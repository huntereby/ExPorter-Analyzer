Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membranous particles released from nearly all cell types into all bodily fluids
evaluated to date — including serum and plasma. Depending on tissue of origin, health state and organism
age, they carry a variety of complex cargo consisting of nucleic acids, proteins and metabolites. Although
resilience at a tissue level has largely been attributed to stem cells, recent evidence increasingly points to their
production of EVs as mediators of their remarkable regenerative capacity. The rapid release of small EVs is
induced by physical activity and believed to contribute to the long-term beneficial effects of regular exercise on
muscle metabolism, the cardiovascular system as well as immune modulation. The goal of this project is to
develop biomarkers of aging and resilience through analyses of EVs. Due to their coordinate regulation of
tissue homeostasis and biological processes through intercellular trafficking of microRNA and protein cargo,
EVs are particularly attractive for this project because they can potentially serve as DIRECT biomarkers of
aging and resilience, namely indicators AND mediators of the aging process and response to stressors. We will
use our newly developed 18-channel-high-resolution flow cytometric methodology with validation by
nanoparticle tracking video microscopy, and fluorescence-activated particle sorting that we have established in
the laboratory to evaluate our large existing extensive human sample sets (n=4213 individuals from EPESE,
PALS, STRRIDE, BHS and the Duke 1KP (1000 Patient) cohort) with associated deidentified data and
longitudinal follow-up (6 months to 23 years). We have preliminary data demonstrating an age-related decline
in specific subsets of circulating EVs. We also have identified that a subset of EVs, including some of those
declining with age, are induced with exercise training and predict a beneficial metabolic response to exercise.
These data, together with our collaborators for this project, bring together extensive expertise in aging,
resilience, exercise, and physical performance across the lifespan (ages 18 to 102 years). These resources
and capabilities provide a unique opportunity for us to significantly advance EVs along a biomarker pipeline
and to identify effectors of heathy aging and resilience. For this reason, we are responding to the funding
Opportunity Announcement PA-17-088 that invites applications that employ secondary analysis of existing data
sets or stored biospecimens to address clinically related issues on aging changes influencing health across the
lifespan."
10772071,"ABSTRACT—METABOLISM AND METABOLIC HEALTH (MMH) CORE
Investigators interested in mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of obesity, diabetes and related
metabolic diseases will benefit from a comprehensive analysis of components regulating energy balance,
macronutrient combustion and metabolism in live animals. Simple tests that compare food intake to weight
gain, or that measure metabolically-relevant analytes from a single static condition, fail to fully capture nuanced
bioenergetic and metabolic phenotypes, changes in feeding behaviors, or alterations of body composition.
Therefore, the Metabolism and Metabolic Health (MMH) Core has been designed and structured to provide
investigators with expert consultation, state-of-the-art instrumentation, and technical support to assess—in live
mice—energy balance, energy intake (EI) and digestion, energy expenditure (EE), metabolic efficiency, EI-EE
coupling phenotypes, macronutrient metabolism, hormone action and secretion, body/tissue composition, and
associations with the microbiome and xenometabolome. The MMH Core will be service-oriented, client-facing,
and research-supportive. The MMH Core will be staffed by a Leader, co-Leader, Core Coordinator, Technical
Specialists, and 5 Scientific Consultants.
The mission of the MMH Core will be accomplished through the following 2 Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1: Provide clients with innovative and unique assets and approaches to deeply-
characterize key nodes involved with energy balance, food intake, glucose and triglyceride
metabolism, metabolic hormone sensitivity, body composition and gut microbiota metabolism in live
mice.
Specific Aim 2: Provide clients with consultation services focused on study design and interpretation
of results in the areas of metabolic physiology, obesity, and diabetes.
Under these specific aims, the MMH Core will carry out the following activities:
 • Providing acute, mid, and long -term assessments of EI and sensitivity to EI-regulating hormones in
 male and female mice as models of diabetes, obesity, and other metabolic disorders;
 • Offering a battery of bioenergetics and EE tests, including RER complex pattern and frequency
 analysis, EE-EI coupling as a measure of energy balance regulation, and characterization of TNZ
 and TNP, including under temperature extremes, norepinephrine, exercise, or timed meal
challenges;
 • Conducting analyses of body composition by EchoMRI and PixiMus DEXA and studies of
 macronutrient metabolism via glucose and insulin tolerance tests, continuous glucose monitoring,
 and hepatic triglyceride production;
 • Providing innovative and unique services to assess the microbiome and xenometabolome,
 metabolic and feeding efficiency, and whole-body imaging to complement services obtained from
 the PB Core;
 • Assisting investigators to generate high-quality and reproducible research results for publications,
 pilot data for grant proposals, and preclinical findings to inform human clinical trials;
 • Being flexible and responsive to user requests for new and customizable assays and procedures;
 • Participating in the Vibrant Program to assist and train a new generation of scientists with a tailored
 focus toward underrepresented investigators and increasing diversity in biomedical research
Through their previous association with the MMPC, the investigators participating in the MMH Core have
proven expertise and capabilities in the study of energy metabolism, bioenergetics, body composition, glucose
and lipid homeostasis, food intake, metabolomics, and gut microbiota in live mice. When coupled with state-of-
the-art equipment, facilities, and core analytical labs at UC Davis, the MMH Core will be a unique and highly-
impactful scientific asset to national investigators interested in metabolic physiology and the pathophysiology of
diabetes and obesity."

In order to survive, grow and metastasize, tumors need the support of a favorable host environment. Local
changes in normal cells in close proximity to a developing tumor can create a favorable tumor micro-environment
(TME) that is necessary for tumor growth. Mesenchymal populations, including cancer-associated fibroblasts
(CAFs), secrete pro- tumorigenic and immune suppressive factors, and produce extracellular matrix to create a
stiffer, tumor-conducive soil. Several CAF subsets with specific functions have been identified, however, whether
distinct CAF subsets derive from the same progenitor that acquire functional specificity during tumor progression
or from different progenitors committed to give rise to a specific CAF population, is under investigation.
We recently made the unexpected observation that cells expressing bone osteolineage marker Osterix (Osx) are
present in the TME of tumors outside the bone and support tumor growth. In adult animals, Osx is expressed by
committed osteoblasts (OB) and drives their differentiation. Surprisingly, we detected Osx in stromal cells,
isolated from various breast cancer tumors, expressing CAF and OB makers, and in the tumor-associated stroma
of patients with breast carcinomas. Co-injection of Osx+ cells with tumor cells enhance tumor growth.
Importantly, Osx expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Based on these rather unexpected
findings, we hypothesize that bone-derived osteolineage Osx+ cells represent a novel subset of tumor infiltrating
stromal populations contributing to tumor progression and CAF diversity. Aim 1 will determine the functional
relevance of Osx+ cells in the TME and pre-metastatic sites; Aim 2 will determine the origin of Osx+ cells in the
TME and pre-metastatic sites. This information will broaden the concept of cellular heterogeneity within the TME
and offer a new platform for targeting the stroma with the purpose of inhibiting tumor growth."

Since DNA bases are continuously damaged by oxidation, cells have evolved a robust pathway to repair this
type of DNA base damage, termed base excision repair (BER). Most oxidative damage can be repaired at the
cell’s leisure except at a replication fork, where oxidative damage can cause replication fork collapse.
Collapsed forks are a far greater danger to the cell than oxidative damage elsewhere in the genome, but the
mechanism of BER at oxidatively damaged replication forks is less well understood compared to BER
elsewhere. The 5’ abasic endonuclease APE1 plays a key role in BER repair at oxidatively stressed replication
forks. However, there is significant evidence for an alternative pathway; some cancers lack APE1 yet replicate
without difficulty, and several aging organs lose expression of APE1 without deleterious effects. We previously
found that the 5’ endonuclease EEPD1 can initiate homologous recombination (HR) repair of stressed
replication forks by cleaving the lagging parental strand of a stalled fork and loading EXO1 for 5’ end resection
in a BRCA1-indepednent manner. In further characterization of EEPD1, we found that it has 5’ abasic
endonuclease activity similar but not identical to APE1. EEPD1 can replace APE1 in BER assays in vitro and in
vivo. EEPD1 depletion also harmed the repair and restart of oxidatively damaged replication forks. EEPD1
depletion or deletion also resulted in significantly decreased cell survival in the presence of oxidative or
alkylative stressors, which cause DNA lesions repaired by BER. EEPD1 has a high differential expression in
glioblastoma (GBM) compared to adjacent normal brain or other cancers. GBM exist in a hypoxic environment
and are sensitive to oxidative injury, and EEPD1 is required for the survival in every GBM cell line tested. Our
SEC-MALS studies found that EEPD1 exists as a dimer in physiologic solution. We resolved the X-ray
crystallographic structure of the EEPD1 nuclease domain to 3.0 Å. The tertiary structure of the EEPD1
monomer is similar to the AlphFold2-predicted EEPD1 nuclease domain structure. The EEPD1 crystal
structure also has similarities to and distinctions from the APE1 structure. Thus, EEPD1 represents a unique
opportunity to gain insight into the structural basis for abasic endonuclease activity and how this activity
promotes repair of oxidatively-stressed replication forks. Understanding the structure-function relationship of
EEPD1 will lead to regions to target for development of rationally designed inhibitors, for which we have
candidate compounds. This is especially important in GBM, for which new therapeutic targets are sorely
needed. This renewal application will assess how the structure of EEPD1 functions to repair of replication forks
stressed by oxidative DNA damage in GBM cells by addressing three questions: 1) Is EEPD1 dimerization
essential for its activity? 2) What EEPD1 domains mediate its 5’ abasic endonuclease activity? 3) What
are the distinct roles for EEPD1 versus APE1?"

to provide the type and quality of services that will enable Prostate Cancer SPORE investigators to address
pathology, radiology, and quantitative imaging translational aims as well as generate reliable and clinically
significant findings that will impact treatment outcomes. Successful accomplishment of many of the translational
aims of the Prostate Cancer SPORE projects is dependent on the iPRC services. The specific aims of the iPRC
are strategically designed to produce a core service unique from existing cancer center cores that will directly
meet the needs of the Prostate Cancer SPORE projects and build a sustainable central organizing force for
future translational PC research. The unique infrastructure and resources created to support the UW Prostate
Cancer SPORE projects will provide an integrated pathology and radiology database repository to benefit
collaborative translational PC research projects at UW and the wider PC research community."
10783758,"Generating spatial and functional maps of cell-to-cell interactions in MS lesions
Single nucleus RNA sequencing (sNuc-Seq) studies have greatly advanced our understanding of
cellular heterogeneity in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. However, current CNS sNuc-Seq
protocols selectively under-sample astrocyte and microglia nuclei, resulting in low resolution of
population heterogeneity. Moreover, sNuc-Seq does not capture spatial information, such as
distribution and interactions of cell populations within the MS lesion environment.
Here, we propose to use a novel approach to sNuc-Seq of MS lesion tissue, enrichment for
unrepresented/rare nuclei such as astrocytes, microglia and infiltrating immune cells through Flow
sorting. We will combine this approach with advanced computational tools for denoising,
imputation and batch correction to improve recovery of biological signal and resolution of cellular
heterogeneity in acutely demyelinating, chronic active and remyelinating MS lesions. We will
leverage the subpopulation-specific transcriptomes to computationally predict possible
interactions between cell populations, based on expression of receptor-ligand pairs. We will
further use a highly multiplexed histology imaging approach to localize cellular subpopulations
and confirm co-localization of receptor-ligand pairs in MS lesions. We will finally conduct in vitro
studies to elucidate the functional impact of selected receptor-ligand interactions.
Our study will identify the constituent subpopulations and receptor-ligand interactomes that are
associated with acute demyelination, chronic low-grade inflammation and remyelination. These
interactions or combinations of interactions can be targeted to reduce inflammation or to enhance
neurorepair in MS. Moreover, our datasets will provide a rich resource that will guide more
functional studies on disease mechanisms."
10773148,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Nearly 20% of women in the United States experience clinically significant depressive symptoms
during pregnancy or the postpartum period. Although treatments exist for depressive symptoms such as
antidepressants and psychotherapy, many women remain under- or un-treated due to concerns about stigma,
side effects, and costs, particularly marginalized women (minority, low socioeconomic status). Further, the
standard depression treatments do not address social connectedness, which is a potentially modifiable factor
involved in depressive symptoms. A focus on adequate symptom management through safe, non-
pharmacologic, accessible therapies that address social connectedness during pregnancy in marginalized
women is an urgent clinical and research priority. Preliminary Data: Preliminary evidence from our research
team shows a promising pathway for addressing social connectedness in the context of perinatal depression:
we have piloted the “Mindful Moms” intervention in a NICHD-funded study (R15HD086835, Kinser); the 12-
week intervention involves a brief motivating discussion about symptom self-management plus group-based
mindful physical activity (prenatal yoga) sessions. Study findings provide support of protocol feasibility and
intervention acceptability, with qualitative findings leading us to hypothesize that social connectedness plays as
a key role in symptom management. Also, we have identified epigenetic patterns uniquely related to
postpartum depression; we will evaluate the similarity of these DNA methylation patterns related to social
connectedness and postpartum depression, as an exploration of mechanisms of social connectedness. Study
Design: Using a conceptual framework based upon Individual and Family Self-Management Theory, the overall
goal of this two-arm longitudinal randomized controlled trial is to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of this
self-management approach in marginalized women with depressive symptoms (n=200), compared to an active
control. The first Specific Aim is to evaluate effects by group on depressive symptom severity, anxiety, and
perceived stress over time. The second Specific Aim is to understand the role of social connectedness as a
moderator of the effects of group assignment on depressive symptoms. The third Specific Aim is to identify
genome-wide DNA methylation patterns associated with levels of perceived social connectedness. Potential
Impact: The successful completion of our aims will provide important insights into social connectedness as a
mechanism to decrease depressive symptoms in a largely understudied, historically marginalized population of
women. Further, if proven efficacious, “Mindful Moms” may be a low-cost, sustainable, and translatable option
for intervention in perinatal depressive symptoms."

Approximately 70,000 adolescents and young adults are diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 15-39 in
the U.S. every year. Due to their age and life stage, the experience of a cancer diagnosis as a young adult
(YA) can lead to a cascade of emotional and physical challenges. A key obstacle faced by YA cancer patients
is impaired social health, a complex construct that includes perceived social belonging, social support, and
social network composition. YA patients report social health challenges such as maintaining existing and
forming new social relationships after diagnosis, which may contribute to poor quality of life post-cancer.
Diminished social health is a major risk factor for poorer health in the general population and has been found to
reduce health-promoting behaviors such as physical activity, in part because of the lack of healthy
opportunities and support that social contacts can provide. Cancer patients clearly benefit from greater levels
of physical activity and lower levels of sedentary time as these are associated with improved quality of life,
longer periods of disease-free survival, and lower mortality. Thus, understanding the relationships between
social health, physical activity, and quality of life is critically important for YA cancer patients, as the impaired
social health experienced by these patients may reduce their activity levels and endanger long-term health
outcomes. The overall hypothesis is that social health in YA is negatively impacted following a cancer
diagnosis, and that detriments in social health influence subsequent physical activity behaviors and
survivorship quality of life (emotional well-being and physical function). In the proposed study, we will
comprehensively prospectively assess social health over 12 months and examine its influence on activity
behaviors and quality of life. Assessment will begin proximal to diagnosis when changes in social health are
likely to initiate for YA cancer patients, with subsequent follow-ups at 3, 6, and 12 months. This longitudinal
design will enable the examination of the dynamic changes in social health during and after therapy and its
predictive influence on physical activity and quality of life. The Specific Aims are: Aim 1: we will characterize
the trajectories of social health in YA cancer patients and assess their influences on quality of life in
survivorship; Aim 2: we will investigate the longitudinal associations between social health and activity
behaviors in YA cancer patients and test the mediational and reciprocal relationships between social health,
activity behaviors, and quality of life; Aim 3: we will explore demographic and clinical moderators of the
relationships between social health, activity behaviors, and quality of life. Understanding the mechanistic
processes by which social health impacts activity behaviors and quality of life will inform the development of
effective intervention strategies to foster social health and improve healthy survivorship for this at-risk and
vulnerable population."

Substance use disorder (SUD) is prevalent in the US with over 10% of adults fitting the criteria for diagnosis.
Unfortunately, SUD treatments are often unsuccessful, with up to 75% of patients experiencing relapse. SUD is
associated with problematic reward processing, leading to drug use at the expense of natural rewards and
despite negative consequences. Addiction recovery programs often require drug abstinence while reinforcing
engagement with natural rewards such as socialization. Research suggests that oxytocin administration could
help with this process and improve treatment outcomes for SUD. Although the therapeutic potential of oxytocin
is already being investigated in clinical trials with encouraging outcomes, the effects of oxytocin on reward-
related neural circuits are not understood.
The current proposal will assess the region-specific influence of oxytocin receptor activation on neurochemical
release associated with drug and social reward processing. Most studies point to oxytocin decreasing the
reinforcing effects of drugs but increasing the salience of social stimuli. The detection of rewarding stimuli is
regulated in part by the mesolimbic dopamine system, with dopaminergic cell bodies in the ventral tegmental
area (VTA) that project to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Emerging evidence suggests that different circuits
facilitate drug versus social reward, with drug reward depending on phasic (fast bursts) dopamine release and
social reward on tonic (slow, steady) dopamine release in the NAc. Oxytocin’s therapeutic effects for addiction
may be a result of oxytocin shifting dopamine release patterns from phasic to tonic, thus rebalancing the
pathways facilitating drug and social reward.
The proposed study will be the first to systematically investigate the neural regions in which oxytocin mediates
phasic and tonic mesolimbic dopamine release. Using an established electrochemical technique (fast scan
cyclic voltammetry), we will assess in vivo phasic and tonic dopamine release following microinfusions of a
selective oxytocin receptor agonist into the NAc or VTA. Clarifying the mechanisms by which oxytocin
mediates drug and social reward is crucial for harnessing the full therapeutical potential of oxytocin for SUD."
10818379,"Summary.
Despite the plethora of ways that developmental experience influences long-term patterns of behavior, our
mechanistic understanding of how this occurs is limited. The long-term goal of this research program is to
elucidate the intersection of maturational and experience-dependent mechanisms that support behavioral
acquisition across development. The objective of this application is to identify the epigenetic and molecular
signatures of select cells recruited for developmental learning in juveniles. Here, we build on our recent
preliminary data that repeatable, spatially-discreet cell populations initiate a molecular response required for
memory formation at an age when learning is possible, but not before, and differently between males and
females. This provides a unique opportunity to track the changes that occur within a brain region as
development proceeds and comes “on-line” for encoding experience such that it determines adult behavioral
patterns. In contrast to the explosion of sequencing technology-based discoveries about brain cells in adults,
only a few factors are known to track with developmental learning. Identifying the properties of individual cells
and their networks as they shift functionally across juvenile development would be useful for discovery of other
brain systems that undergo developmental functional fluctuations and ultimately to move towards remediation
efforts and enrichment programs targeted for peak phases of developmental receptivity to experience. The
central hypothesis is that epigenetic and molecular regulatory processes define individual cells and their
relationships differently depending on an individual’s age and sex, creating combinations that support learning
at the onset of a natural learning phase. The PI has expertise in mechanisms of brain development and
behavior including epigenetics and molecular biology as means to find causal relationships of juvenile
experience to adult behavior. The co-Investigator’s expertise in single cell sequencing methods and analysis is
complementary. The objectives will be accomplished by pursing two specific aims 1) To identify properties of
the auditory forebrain that support molecular activation required for behavioral effects, and 2) To predict cell
responsivity based on baseline chromatin accessibility and RNA profiles. A combination of state-of-the-art
sequencing methods, and innovative analysis across platforms and datasets, will discover new relationships
between chromatin structure and RNA populations, new cell subtypes, and the relationships between them,
that predict the ability to learn in sex-specific ways. Using a molecular marker for cells recruited for learning,
we will then co-localize these baseline cell features with functional ones. The proposed research thus begins to
fill a void in developmental neurobiology by applying an unprecedented level of detail to the structural
organization of functional networks. Elucidating and establishing mechanisms underlying the organization of
developing brain to encode experience is the key to breaking through to a new productive era for testing novel
ways that maturation and experience-dependent processes shape neural networks to promote or limit learning."
10764330,"Postpartum psychosis is a severe mood disorder, one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks
of suicide and infanticide if untreated, and should be treated as a medical emergency. It is generally considered
a bipolar spectrum disorder, yet, this disorder has not been classified in current disease classification systems
because the underlying neurobiology and risk architecture is unclear. In particular, it is unknown how postpartum
psychosis fits within the bipolar spectrum, and thus prevention and treatment guidelines are lacking. The long-
term goal of this project is to identify the distinct risk architecture of postpartum psychosis. The overall objectives
in this application is to use unique large epidemiological data from the Swedish national registers to characterize
and compare the genetic risk architecture of postpartum psychosis with postpartum depression, bipolar disorder,
and schizophrenia. Our central hypotheses are: (1) postpartum psychosis shows significant evidence of additive
genetic effects; and (2) postpartum psychosis has a high but not complete (not equal to one) genetic correlation
with bipolar disorder. The rationale is that by understanding the cross-disorder genetic risk of postpartum
psychosis and related disorders, we know more about the neurobiology and how to classify this disorder. Using
family-based designs and data for a cohort of 271,303 mothers from the Swedish national registers, we will carry
out the following Specific Aims: (1) evaluate the familial risk of postpartum psychosis; (2) quantify the impact of
additive genetic effects on risk of postpartum psychosis and (3) estimate the genetic correlation between
postpartum psychosis, bipolar disorder, postpartum depression, and schizophrenia. The proposed research is
innovative in five main areas: (1) it is built around a large homogeneous population-based resource covering an
entire nation, minimizing selection bias; Studies thus far provide evidence for the familiality of postpartum
psychosis, but these studies have mainly focused on exploring if there is a familial association between
postpartum psychosis and other mental disorders by interviewing probands. They did not include controls and,
therefore, were not able to provide an estimate of the risk relative to the general population and these studies
did not explore familiality across disorders; (2) linking the Swedish population-based register provides a unique
opportunity to determine specific risk effects, such as mother's age at pregnancy, psychiatric history,
socioeconomic factors, and previous births; (3) the study uses cutting-edge survival analysis methods to study
novel aspects of additive genetics while taking into account censoring; (4) the proposed model delivers the
estimates of the specific risk factors for postpartum psychosis beyond genetic confounding; and (5) it provides a
novel framework for understanding shared risk across postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder, postpartum
depression, and schizophrenia. Our approach is a new and substantially different approach compared to other
studies and will allow us to overcome the challenges of modeling additive genetic effects and genetic correlation,
thereby opening new horizons for understanding the risk profile of postpartum psychosis."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a high global prevalence, estimated at 11-13%, and it is ranked third
highest for years of life lost due to premature mortality. Interstitial fibrosis is a chronic and progressive process
affecting kidneys during CKD progression, regardless of cause. It can disrupt kidney architecture, reduce blood
supply, disturb renal function, and ultimately cause kidney failure. Histologically, the degree of kidney interstitial
fibrosis correlates with the severity of CKD. Hence, assessment of kidney fibrosis can facilitate prognosis and
guide therapy in CKD progression. Currently, biopsy remains the gold standard for assessing kidney fibrosis,
but complications and limitations exist. Hence, novel noninvasive imaging probes or methods are in high
demand for the evaluation and follow-up of patients with CKD. Recently, we and others have shown that
macrophages play a key role in the progression of kidney fibrosis. Macrophage accumulation significantly
correlates with the degree of the extent of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy in the mouse models of CKD
and in human kidney diseases and chronic allograft injury. Therefore, developing novel imaging probes to
noninvasively assess kidney interstitial profibrotic macrophages will help diagnose and quantify kidney fibrosis,
and thus be useful to prognosticate CKD progression. This proposal presents a potential shift in current
approaches to develop a novel molecular imaging probe that specifically target profibrotic macrophages in the
kidneys to sensitively and specifically report renal fibrosis in the course of CKD progression. Nanoparticles
have become increasingly attractive as a candidate tool to serve as effective diagnostic agents to reduce
undesirable systemic side effects and overcome several physical and physiological barriers following systemic
administration. Among these, dendrimers have become one of the most versatile compositionally and
structurally controlled nanoscale building blocks for use as contrast agents in the field of biomedical imaging.
To test this hypothesis, we propose to first engineer dendrimer nanoprobes that specifically target profibrotic
macrophages (Aim 1) and then to assess dendrimer nanoprobe efficacy for diagnosis and quantification of
kidney fibrosis in the mouse models of CKD (Aim 2). This application will provide us the opportunity to develop
innovative nanoprobes that can be tested preclinically to non-invasively report kidney fibrosis."

 Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, and exerts an untold burden on
patients, families and caregivers, and the U.S. healthcare system. Alzheimer's disease is a progressive
neurodegenerative disorder caused by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles
(NFTs) in the brain, the two neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Much effort has been
devoted to understanding the molecular mechanisms of amyloid and NFT accumulation, and the majority
of therapeutic approaches thus far have targeted these pathways. However, the field has yet to produce
an effective therapeutic for Alzheimer's disease that can convincingly slow, halt or reverse this
devastating illness. Recently, the biomechanical properties of brain tissues have emerged as a potentially
useful biomarker, as the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients have been consistently shown to have
decreased mechanical stiffness relative to those of healthy subjects. These biomechanical changes are
likely due to a combination of the effects of neurodegeneration and changes to the composition and
structure of brain extracellular matrix (BECM). Importantly, neurodegeneration correlates well with clinical
symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, whereas changes in the BECM occur years to decades prior to
cognitive decline, suggesting that they are intricately connected with disease pathogenesis. Herein, we
propose to systematically evaluate the contribution of BECM biomechanical properties to the development
of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Unfortunately, in vivo models offer very limited capacity to
regulate the mechanical stiffness of brain tissue. Therefore, we have developed novel three-dimensional
(3D) decellularized BECM-based models with tunable mechanical properties, and have demonstrated that
we can vary the model stiffness within the range of normal and Alzheimer's disease human brain tissue.
We have also developed 3D cerebral organoid (CO) models using human induced pluripotent stem cells
(hiPSCs) derived from Alzheimer's disease patients or from healthy controls (HC). We found that, relative
to HC COs, Alzheimer's disease COs have decreased mechanical stiffness and develop progressive
amyloid plaques and NFTs and neurodegeneration. Herein, we propose to embed COs within 3D BECM
models, enabling high-throughput experimentation of the relationship between tissue biomechanics and
Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. We will test the hypothesis that the Alzheimer's disease
neuropathology within the CO is intricately linked with BECM mechanical properties, and that increasing
the BECM mechanical stiffness will reduced Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. These experiments will
establish 3D BECM-CO as a new tool for investigation at the intersection of tissue biomechanics and
disease pathobiology, and aims to identify a new mechanistic pathway contributing to Alzheimer's disease
that has the potential to be modified therapeutically to alter disease trajectory."

laboratories. Single cell sequencing is also evolving rapidly and constantly improving the information capabilities,
number of samples per run and data modalities per cell. There is only limited number of facilities available
worldwide with such capabilities to continue to innovate. Dana Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) is a
major center in the US sequencing significant number of cancer genomes. DFCI is committed to continually
appraising new sequencing technologies, using in-house testing wherever possible, and will use whatever future
technology is most suitable and cost-effective for the applications demanded by the science pursued at the
Institute. The purpose of Core 4 is to provide for comprehensive genomic sequence analyses by utilizing a state
of the art ‘next generation’ sequencing platform for the sequencing of whole genome, targeted regions,
methylated regions, circulating cells as well as single cells and the identification and characterization of genome-
wide somatic alterations in samples detailed in all projects. We have also developed and standardized single
cell and bulk sequencing for various platforms. To meet these goals we will perform whole genome sequencing
and enzymatic methylation sequencing to generate genome wide somatic alterations and methylation changes
with streamlined analysis pipeline from IFM/DFCI 2009 and 2020-02 study samples at diagnosis and when
available at relapse (Specific Aim 1); and generate single-cell whole genome and targeted sequencing data from
selected serial samples to explore clonal changes during MM evolution (Specific Aim 2). Further, the core will
provide bioinformatics expertise in the management and analysis of data produced within the core to support the

The proposal is to perform a randomized phase III study comparing HDT versus additional cycles of induction
therapy for MRD negative patients and single versus tandem HDT for MRD positive patients. Moreover along
with clinical information a large amount of genomic and epigenomic data has been generated using the patients
samples that requires integrated analysis. In the prior funding period the Core has supported all the projects with
planning, analysis and integration. In this proposal Core will continue to support this effort and will provide 1)
support and direction on the formatting, quality control and annotation procedures of clinical and research data
as well as the process of transferring the research data a data warehouse for integrative analysis, 2)
bioinformatics support for primary and integrative analysis of the high-throughput data and 3) biostatistics support
in terms of design and analysis for all projects. Core members will work closely with all project members as well
as Cores 1 and 2 with regard to quality control, specimen tracking and data transfer procedures as well as Cores
3 and 4 which will perform next generation sequencing for identifying genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic
changes at bulk and single cell level. Bioinformatics and biostatistics support and analysis is not only required
for individual projects, but it is crucial for the integrative analysis from data across the projects and thus overall
success of the program."

Despite decades of research in pediatric sepsis, mortality remains at approximately 25% for children with

with mortality that is not simply a reflection of the severity of illness. As no disease-modifying therapies exist for
SAMD, there is a critical need to understand the biologic basis of cardiomyocyte dysfunction in sepsis.
Furthermore, there is a need for novel human modeling with patient-derived materials given the failure to
translate molecular discoveries in murine models of sepsis to improvements in human organ injury. Our
objectives are to establish human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs)
as a model for cardiomyocyte dysfunction in pediatric sepsis and to examine the roles of host genetic
background and serum factors in the pathogenesis of SAMD. We have built upon our large, established
biobank of serum from children with sepsis to study the cardiomyocyte response to septic serum banked from
children who did and who did not have SAMD. We have found that the contractility of hiPSC-CMs is depressed
by serum banked from children with SAMD but not by control septic serum from children without SAMD. This
depressant effect was reversible after removal of the serum, suggesting this was not reflective of cell death.
Furthermore, we identified a significant association of interleukin-8 (IL-8) with SAMD in children with septic
shock and found that recombinant human IL-8 depresses hiPSC-CM contractility. Our proposal will address
three important questions as specific aims: First, we will determine whether hiPSC-CMs and cardiomyocytes
derived from the same children share common functional and transcriptional patterns of responses when
exposed to banked septic serum. We will provide a comprehensive comparison of hiPSC-CMs to ex vivo
cardiomyocytes by isolating cardiomyocytes from discarded surgical tissue from children undergoing cardiac
surgery and by generating hiPSC-CMs from these same patients. Second, we will determine the degree to
which host genetic background contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction in SAMD. We will develop hiPSC-
CMs from pediatric patients with and without SAMD to determine responses to septic serum to identify patterns
of functional and transcriptional responses associated with susceptibility to SAMD. Third, we will dissect the
role of IL-8 signaling in cardiomyocyte dysfunction in sepsis. We will employ a combination of IL-8 modulation
in serum and IL-8 receptor (CXCR1 and CXCR2) knockouts in hiPSC-CMs, providing evidence for IL-8
blockade as a potential therapeutic target in SAMD. This career development proposal will build on my
background in translational research in myocardial dysfunction to gain new expertise in cardiomyocyte
functional analysis, hiPSC generation and differentiation, and next-generation RNA sequencing technology to
facilitate my transition to independence as a physician-scientist focused on elucidating and targeting
mechanisms of pediatric SAMD."

Autosomal Dominant Leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a fatal, adult onset, progressive neurological disease that is
characterized by widespread CNS demyelination. Most cases of ADLD are caused by tandem genomic
duplications (ADLD-dup) involving the lamin B1 gene (LMNB1) while a small subset is caused by genomic
deletions upstream of LMNB1 (ADLD-del). Both these mutations are thought to cause increased CNS LMNB1
expression and are a 100% penetrant i.e., all individuals with the mutation develop the disease. LMNB1 is a
component of the nuclear lamina and plays a critical role in maintaining nuclear architecture, regulating gene
expression and modulating chromatin positioning. Why increased expression of a widely-expressed gene such
as LMNB1 causes such a specific demyelination disorder is unknown.
Using a combination of patient data, murine and human derived oligodendrocyte (OL) lineage cells we propose
to test the hypothesis that genomic rearrangements involving Lamin B1 that cause ADLD result in mis-expression
of the lamin B1 gene. We will identify regulatory elements and mechanisms that can potentially regulate Lamin
B1 expression both in vitro and in vivo using a novel mouse model.
The experiments we have proposed will allow us to comprehensively characterize a potentially novel OL
regulatory element that can provide mechanistic insights into the tissue type specificity of ADLD and the role of
non-coding regulatory elements in OL function and demyelinating diseases."

Converging human association studies link cannabis abuse during adolescence with an increased likelihood of
developing cognitive and emotional regulation deficits later in life, many of which are refined and dependent on
prefrontal cortex (PFC) maturation during adolescence. However, the neurobiology underlying this adolescent
vulnerability remains unclear due to our limited knowledge on how adolescent cannabis exposure impacts the
maturation of neural circuits. Our long-term goal is to identify sensitive neurodevelopmental processes that are
vulnerable to repeated cannabis exposure, with emphasis on PFC neuronal circuits that undergo functional
remodeling during adolescence. Data from our recent studies revealed that a hallmark of PFC maturation is the
re-calibration of an excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance during adolescence that is required for sustaining proper
PFC-mediated behaviors in adulthood. Our data also indicate that it is the maturation of GABA function that
renders the PFC labile during adolescence, a developmental process that is intimately linked to the activity of
afferent transmission from the ventral hippocampus. Similarly, adolescent, but not adult, exposure to THC
impaired the maturation of PFC GABA function. This raises the exciting possibility that the PFC deficit resulting
from adolescent THC exposure is mechanistically linked to the disruption of specific inputs driving PFC
maturation. Based on our preliminary data, we will test the central hypothesis that the developing PFC GABA
circuit during adolescence is highly sensitive to the negative impact of cannabis through a ventral hippocampal
-mediated mechanism. Thus, the rationale for undertaking this research is that if PFC GABA maturation is
compromised by adolescent THC exposure, the normal facilitation of PFC inhibitory control will be arrested,
which in turn could lead to an enduring state of PFC disinhibition resulting in behavioral deficits in adulthood. We
will fill this gap in knowledge through the pursuit of 3 Specific Aims. We will use a recently developed
combustion/smoking chamber to deliver THC at 3 non-overlapping adolescent windows to establish the precise
period during which changes in PFC GABA function (Aim 1) and PFC-sensitive behaviors (Aim 2) are susceptible
to repeated THC exposure. Currently available input-specific DREADD manipulations will be used in Aim 3 to
establish whether the enduring PFC GABA deficit elicited by THC is causally linked to disruption of ventral
hippocampal-to-PFC transmission."

Cochlear implantation with minimally traumatic surgical techniques and atraumatic electrode arrays has led to
an increasing prevalence of adult and pediatric cochlear implant (CI) recipients with the potential for combined
Electric and binaural Acoustic Stimulation (EAS). Many studies have demonstrated that adult EAS users
consistently exhibit significant benefits for speech understanding in noise and spatial hearing tasks as
compared to a CI paired only with a contralateral HA. We have also demonstrated that sensitivity to interaural
time difference (ITD) and interaural level difference (ILD) cues is correlated with EAS benefit for postlingually
deafened adult listeners. Despite this active phase of discovery, there is still a striking paucity of research on
EAS outcomes in pediatric CI users, the expected trajectory of benefit following EAS fitting, as well as
underlying mechanisms driving EAS benefit (or lack thereof) in all populations. There is a disconnect between
EAS availability and EAS utilization in all CI recipients and current audiological management of EAS
candidates is not data driven. This is problematic given the protracted maturation of the binaural system and
the fact that we do not understand what additional effects sensorineural hearing loss and combined EAS may
have on the developing binaural system. The proposed research activities will describe the time course of
binaural development using behavioral and objective responses to interaural differences in timing (phase) and
level as well as allow for a natural factor investigation of a clinical intervention, the EAS fitting, on said
development. Within the context of a clinical trial, we will compare acute and chronic EAS outcomes for
speech recognition and spatial hearing as related to binaural cue sensitivity, cue weighting, and underlying
neural synchrony necessary for ITD resolution. We have proposed a single-group assignment for both adult
and pediatric EAS users and will also include chronological- and hearing-age-matched listeners with normal
hearing (NH). A within-subjects, accelerated longitudinal design for both EAS and NH listeners will provide
insight into the developmental trajectory of the binaural system for children NH and will provide a benchmark
for interpreting effects of sensorineural hearing loss, asymmetry in audibility resulting from cochlear
implantation, and EAS use on said trajectory. Our proposed research activities will help close the gap between
what is technologically possible with EAS technology and what is clinically implemented by otologists and
audiologists investigating development of binaural sensitivity and spatial hearing abilities. The resultant data
will comprise the first comprehensive description of behavioral and electrophysiologic measures of binaural
hearing in adults and children both with NH and EAS and will uncover information about our EAS clinical
populations holding high potential for clinical application in device fittings as well as audiologic and otologic
clinical recommendations regarding cochlear implantation."

It is widely accepted that mitochondrial metabolism contributes to the development and progression of non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), but the mechanisms of this process are poorly understood.
Hepatocellular mitochondria are unique in their ability and requirement to support biosynthetic, catabolic,
and substrate trafficking pathways. These functions are mediated by anaplerosis, non-oxidative pathways of
the TCA cycle that allow its intermediates to produce and recycle substrates. The downstream pathways
that require anaplerosis (e.g., gluconeogenesis and urea cycle function) are energetically costly. They are
also notably dysregulated by obesity and insulin resistance, but it is unknown how mitochondrial anaplerotic
function impinges on the progress of liver disease. It is suspected that changes in anaplerotic pathways of
liver mitochondria alter apparent mitochondrial function, redox state, and antioxidant capacity. This project
tests the hypothesis that the equilibrium between anaplerosis and downstream pathways impinge on
antioxidant capacity by modulating redox-mediated reactions in liver. Hence, seemingly unrelated
intermediary metabolism may have secondary effects on mitochondrial function and contribute to factors
like oxidative stress and inflammation in NAFLD. To test the hypothesis, we will use state-of-the-art stable
isotope tracer methods, NMR and MS to evaluate metabolic flux, and conditional knockout mice to establish
mechanism. Emphasis is placed on identifying how TCA cycle intermediates modulate antioxidant function
and the role of metabolic compartmentation. In the process, we will develop new tools and concepts that
can be tested and applied against human disease."
10762465,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 1.5 million Americans suffer from myocardial infarction (MI) each year, and about 25% of these patients
develop severe cardiac dysfunction including congestive heart failure (HF), which has a high 5-year mortality
rate of ~50%. Current therapies following MI have limited success in attenuating cardiac dysfunction and slowing
HF progression. Thus, there is a critical need for novel, more effective therapies that protect the heart, improve
its function, and slow/halt progression of cardiac dysfunction. We recently demonstrated that activation of the
brain leptin-melanocortin system pathway greatly improves cardiomyocyte energy metabolism and contractility,
preserves cardiac function, and prevents progression of HF following MI induced by ligation of the left anterior
descending coronary artery. We observed that intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of leptin for 4 weeks, at a
low dose that did not alter blood leptin concentration, restored ejection fraction, cardiac output, left ventricle (LV)
muscle strain and left atrium/aorta diameter ratio almost all the way back to normal baseline values, and
preliminary data suggest that other measures of cardiac function such as +dP/dtmax and exercise capacity were
also markedly improved. We also observed that these cardiac protective effects are absent in melanocortin 4
receptor (MC4R) deficient rats and that activation of brain MC4R using synthetic agonists infused into the
cerebral ventricles protected the heart against progressive cardiac dysfunction after MI in a similar fashion
compared to leptin treatment. Our preliminary data also indicate that activation of the CNS leptin-MC4R pathway
increases sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) expression, mitochondrial biogenesis and substrate oxidation (i.e., glucose and fatty
acid oxidation), and improves cardiomyocyte contractility in non-infarcted regions of the LV, including areas at
risk but still viable. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that activation of the brain melanocortin system
improves cardiac function and prevents progression of HF after MI, increases myocardium
mitochondrial biogenesis and SIRT3 levels, enhances substrate oxidation, and improves energy
production and cardiomyocyte contractility in healthy portions of the heart. We also propose that these
beneficial effects of the melanocortin system on the heart require MC4R activation in PVN and/or
DMV/NTS/IML, and that MC4R agonists that cross the blood-brain barrier (e.g. setmelanotide) and can
be administered systemically will be effective to provide cardioprotective even in the setting of obesity.
We will use state-of-the-art chronic in vivo protocols with high-resolution ultrasound techniques for imaging
cardiac function (including 4D-strain echocardiographic imaging technology) in genetically engineered animal
models combined with ex vivo and in vitro preparations for detailed measurements of cardiac muscle function,
morphology, energy metabolism and contractility to test our hypotheses. The outcomes from this study could
lead to novel and more effective therapeutic approaches for MI and HF, and will provide a new target for MC4R
agonists which are currently being used to treat rare forms of genetic obesity in humans."

This R01 grant has focused on long-lasting changes induced by stimulant and opioid drugs of abuse in the
brain's reward circuitry in rodent models. Our aims have shifted over the years based on an expanding knowl-
edge of addiction mechanisms and development of more powerful experimental methods. When the grant was
last renewed competitively, it focused on transcription factors that mediate drug regulation of gene expression.
Recently, we have shifted increasingly to a host of chromatin-based mechanisms—so-called epigenetics—that
work in concert with transcription factors to alter expression levels of target genes. Our central hypothesis is
that drug exposure induces stable “chromatin scars” that drive particularly long-lived changes in gene
expression, which in turn mediate many downstream changes in cell and circuit function and behavior. Here,
we concentrate on the nucleus accumbens (NAc) based on its central role in brain reward and our empirical
finding that it is most dramatically affected by drugs of abuse in our RNA-seq datasets across numerous brain
reward regions. In Aim 1, we utilize cocaine or heroin self-administration in mice, combined with unbiased
RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and proteomic methods, to identify candidate chromatin-scar mechanisms in each of the
two major subtypes of NAc medium spiny projection neurons, D1- and D2-type MSNs. We then use ChIP-seq
to map those candidate mechanisms genome-wide in the affected cell type. In Aim 2, we use viral-mediated
gene transfer to bidirectionally manipulate the most highly implicated chromatin-scar mechanisms in a cell-
type-specific manner to causally establish their role in mediating the lasting transcriptional and behavioral
consequences of drug self-administration. We have already identified two prominent chromatin scars. After
prolonged (30 days) withdrawal from cocaine or heroin self-administration, there is profound depletion of
H2A.Z (a variant of the core histone subunit H2A) and its acetylated form (H2A.Zac) in both D1 and D2 MSNs,
and such depletion associates extensively with those RNAs that show primed or desensitized expression at
this time point, an effect particularly prominent in D1 MSNs. Moreover, several of the proteins that control
H2A.Z deposition or eviction from nucleosomes or its acetylation are prominently regulated selectively in D1
NAc MSNs. We also have evidence for a role played by H3K79me2 (dimethylation of histone 3 Lys 79) which
is induced in NAc after prolonged withdrawal. The histone methyltransferase (DOT1L) and demethylase
(KDM2B) that catalyze and remove this mark, respectively, are regulated in D1 and in D2 MSNs. We will now
manipulate each of these proteins in a cell-type-selective manner and study downstream behavioral and
transcriptional effects. We already have shown that DOT1L knockdown in D1 NAc MSNs profoundly reduces
rewarding responses to cocaine. It is important to note that neither H2A.Z nor H3K79me2 have been studied
previously in addiction models, which underscores the power of utilizing the unbiased approaches presented
here. Together, this work will characterize novel mechanisms that drive a persisting state of drug addiction."
10767257,"African Americans (AA) suffer disproportionately across most health disparities (HD). Preventative behaviors
including screenings can inform proactive measures to address many HD which include: diabetes, heart disease,
high blood pressure, stroke, HIV, STDs/STIs, cancer, and cardiovascular disease, most of which can be
prevented.1-3 Evidence suggests that a lack of general health literacy (HL) and racially appropriate health
communication strategies may contribute to the consistent high rates of health disparities in the AA community.
Family Health Histories (FHH), which describe genetic and other familial contributions to health, have been
identified as an effective tool for prevention and early detection and screenings. The underutilization of FHHs in
AA communities negatively impacts screening and preventative measures that could prevent the onset of
disease, illness and ultimately death.4 Although many FHH toolkits have been created to assist families in
gathering FHH information, these tools typically are mostly focused for the general population and do not account
for the cultural and ethnic nuances, communication preference and health literacy levels of the African American
community.4 The failure to effectively engage AA in the creation and conception of culturally relevant FHH tools
and activities to date likely contributes to their underutilization in this population.
 The objective of this K01 is to develop culturally appropriate FHH tools designed for broad understanding
and uptake in AA communities. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that, using a community based
participatory research (CBPR) approach, co-development of a culturally appropriate FHH toolkit will increase the
utility and engagement of AA families in FHH activities; increase effective health communication within the family
structure; and increase the health literacy of participants in a multifaceted effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate
racial and ethnic health disparities. Flint is an ideal community in which to conduct this participatory research
because the recent events of the Flint Water Crisis have created interest in genetics and FHH in the AA
community as a result of community concern around the generational impacts of bacteria and lead exposure on
health. Therefore, we will have partners within AA communities in Flint who will be motivated to partner with us
to develop these tools for Flint and for other minority communities.
 This career development award is being submitted by Dr. Kent Key, a candidate with extensive experience
in CBPR and a solid foundation in qualitative and health disparities research. To reach his long term goal of
becoming an R01-funded researcher in CBPR to reduce health disparities by increasing health literacy and
using effective health communication strategies to reduce and ultimately eliminate racial health disparities for
African-American populations, this K01 will provide additional training in the following areas: (1) intervention
development and design and conduct of randomized trials, (2) health communication models, (3) health literacy
promotion, (4) CBPR approaches to Genomics and Genetics, (5) biostatistics, (6) grant-writing."

 This infrastructure proposal aims to further advance capabilities in the social sciences (broadly defined) to
collect data on the daily lives of U.S. families and individuals. These data will be more accurate, more granular,
and more comprehensive than is currently possible in traditional survey-based research. The context for this is
the Understanding America Study (UAS), the probability-based Internet panel we have been building at USC
since 2014. The infrastructure includes the combination of many data types (including survey data, information
from wearables, contextual and administrative linkages, ecological momentary assessments, self-recorded
narratives, and electronic records of financial transactions), as well as an open communication with the wider
research community both in data dissemination and in soliciting input on content and methods.
 The UAS currently comprises about 10,000 U.S. residents (including a 2,500 person California oversample),
recruited by address-based sampling and provided with Internet-enabled tablets if needed. Surveys are
conducted in English and Spanish. We propose to expand the UAS national sample to 20,000 respondents, with
subsamples of Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics of at least 3,000 each.
 The information collected will focus on factors explaining racial and socio-economic disparities over the life
course, including racial discrimination, inequalities in access to education and healthcare, differences in the
physical and social environment, and, more generally, the various opportunities and obstacles one encounters
over the life course.
 The proposed project team covers a broad spectrum of substantive expertise on disparities, racial
discrimination, environmental health, child development, health, and cognition over the life course, as well as
aging and retirement, consumption, work, and income. To encourage input from the research community, we
envision a program of added survey modules on inequality-related topics proposed by outside researchers, as
well as an annual research conference.
 The basic premise underlying the project is that the only feasible approach to comprehensively investigating
the impact of differences in the life course on observed inequality is to enact a robust multi-method approach
that provides the means of accounting for as many explanatory factors as possible. Within that context, naturally
occurring experiments can be exploited to help identify causal pathways of interest (e.g., when air quality in a
neighborhood improves due to a plant closure; a policy change that affects the quality of schools in a certain
area). Thus, our proposed project aims to create and make available to the research community a uniquely
detailed and focused collection of information on U.S. households and individuals. To achieve this goal, we aim
to strategically integrate selected external data sources with UAS survey data and expand the already broad set
of topics covered by UAS surveys."

We aim to develop a one-time treatment for durable remission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for
patients who are not suppressed by antiretroviral therapy (ART), including patients who are ART naïve or ART
non-compliant. Our treatment is an autologous HIV-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy that
employs the CXCR5 chemokine receptor as a homing device to direct anti-HIV killer T cells into immune-
protected “hidden” viral reservoirs in lymphoid B cell follicles, where most virus-producing cells are located during
chronic infections. Virus-specific CD8 T cells exert potent antiviral activity against HIV-1 and Simian
immunodeficiency virus (SIV), an animal model of HIV. Nevertheless, despite abundant CD8 T cell responses in
HIV-1-infected humans and SIV-infected macaques, these cells do not fully suppress virus replication, likely
because the majority of HIV-1 and SIV replication occurs in CD4+ T cells concentrated within B cell follicles in
secondary lymphoid tissues where few virus-specific CD8 T cells reside. In fact, we showed that the ratio of in
vivo effector virus-specific CD8 T cells to target SIV RNA+ cells is >40-fold lower inside compared to outside of
B cell follicles in lymphoid tissues in SIV-infected macaques. Furthermore, the majority of virus-specific CD8 T
cells fail to express the follicular homing molecule CXCR5, likely explaining low levels of virus-spcific CD8 T cells
localizing to and surveilling B cell follicles. These data suggest that the inability of HIV- and SIV-specific CD8 T
cells to fully suppress virus replication may be due to a deficiency of virus-specific CD8 T cells in B cell follicles.
As the vast majority of virus-producing cells are CD4 T cells located in secondary lymphoid tissue during chronic
HIV and SIV infections, we targeted lymphoid cells by autologously infusing anti-viral CAR (specifically
CAR/CXCR5) T cells into chronically SIV-infected rhesus macaques. The treated animals showed CAR/CXCR5-
T cell localization to B cell follicles and decreased virus replication in the follicles compared to control animals.
In addition, this product showed safety and efficacy in a pilot preclinical study of ART-suppressed SIV-infected
macaques. Based on these findings and the success of our preclinical studies in ART-suppressed macaques,
we propose to: (Phase 1, Aim 1) modify our current CAR/CXCR5 construct by producing and characterizing an
optimized (opt) CAR/CXCR5 construct that contains a tri-specific HIV binding domain, an alternate co-stimulatory
domain, and an HIV resistance domain; (Phase 2, Aim 2) develop a GMP-scalable method to produce CAR-T
cells using the optCAR/CXCR5 construct and PBMCs from a) SIV-infected non-ART-treated rhesus macaques
for use in an IND-enabling preclinical study; and b) HIV-infected non-ART treated individuals to prepare for the
first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial; and (Phase 2, Aim 3) assess the safety and efficacy of CAR-T cells produced
with the human optCAR/CXCR5 construct in a simian/human HIV (SHIV) model of chronic HIV infection.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will be IND-enabling, moving the optCAR/CXCR5-T cell product
from the preclinical stage into clinical development."

Cells organize biochemical reactions into biological condensates. P-bodies are conserved cytoplasmic
condensates enriched in factors important for mRNA storage or degradation, but how these opposing outcomes
may be achieved in condensates is unclear. A critical step in mRNA degradation is the removal of the 5'-7-
methylguanosine cap by the decapping enzyme complex (Dcp1/Dcp2) that precedes and permits digestion of
the mRNA body by conserved exoribonucleases. We have reconstituted biological condensates containing
fission yeast Dcp1/Dcp2 and an enhancer of decapping protein 3 (Edc3), which are major core proteins of P-
bodies. Using novel, activity-based fluorescence probes we have made two significant discoveries. First, contrary
to the popular model that condensates enhance enzymatic reactions due to local concentration effects, we find
that phase separation represses the activity of Dcp1/Dcp2 100-fold compared to dilute solution. Second, the
decapping activity of these condensates can be rescued by Edc3. Our data suggest the protein interaction
platform Dcp1 is an integrator of short-linear protein interaction motifs that couples phase separation to
inactivation of decapping by promoting a conformational change in Dcp1/Dcp2 to an autoinhibited conformation.
In Aim 1, we will determine the structure of the autoinhibited conformation of Dcp1/Dcp2 and test the hypothesis
that short-linear motifs in Dcp2 directly interact with Dcp1 to promote a transient inactive conformation of the
decapping complex. In Aim 2, we will study how condensates provide an additional layer for decapping
repression, testing the hypothesis interactions that promote phase separation further stabilize the inactive
conformation of Dcp1/Dcp2 in condensates. In Aim 3, we will determine the mechanism for activation of
decapping in condensates, testing the hypothesis that Edc3 opposes the inhibitory action of short-linear inaction
motifs in Dcp2 and promotes a conformational change that opens the RNA binding channel in Dcp1/Dcp2 to
promote efficient decapping within condensates. Lesions important for repression of decapping in vitro will be
tested for their function in EDC3-mediated mRNA decay in fission yeast. The proposed studies are poised to
provide a paradigmatic example of how biological condensation is coupled to conformational control of enzyme
activity that affects the fidelity of gene expression at the level of mRNA decay."

 Cell-surface glycans participate in numerous biological processes, including signal transduction, cell-cell
communication and development. Aberrant glycosylation is a hallmark of human disease. At a molecular level,
glycans represent the first points of contact between cells. However, not directly encoded in the genome, these
biomolecules are challenging to study using molecular biology techniques alone. Metabolic oligosaccharide
engineering (MOE) developed in late 1990’s has revolutionized the way for the labeling and visualization of
glycans in living organisms. In this method, cells’ own glycan biosynthetic machinery is hijacked to incorporate
unnatural monosaccharides with linkage promiscuity.
 Complementary to MOE, chemoenzymatic glycan editing has emerged as a valuable tool to probe and
modify glycan structures within a cellular environment. Unlike MOE, chemoenzymatic glycan modification
utilizes recombinant glycosyltransferases to transfer natural or unnatural monosaccharides with novel functions
from activated nucleotide sugars to glycoconjugates on the cell surface with linkage specificity. For these
reasons, chemoenzymatic glycan modification provides a facile and more precise way for probing the function
of glycans in their native environments.
 Building upon our successful application of chemoenzymatic glycan editing, in the next five years we will
expand our chemoenzymatic tool kits to study glycans’ cellular functions with a focus on the special roles of N-
acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), fucose and sialic acid in immune regulation. Cell-surface LacNAc mediates
ligand-receptor binding and sets a threshold for initiating the downstream signaling for immune cell activation.
LacNAc residues are dynamically modified by sialic acid and/or fucose. However, the specific roles of these
modifications in immune regulation and disease progression remain obscure.
 We are particularly interested in finding out: (1) if changes in LacNAc and fucosylation status can serve
as glycan signatures of T cell exhaustion during which T cells gradually lose their cytokine production,
proliferation and cytotoxic capacity; (2) Can cell-surface in situ LacNAc fucosylation be used to boost the
efficacy of antitumor immunity of T cells and NK cells? In parallel, we will develop chemoenzymatic tools for
profiling sialylated glycoprotein ligands of Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectins) and for the
identification of unnatural, high-affinity and specific ligands to interrogate Siglec functions.
 Through these studies, we will gain a deeper understanding of how LacNAc, fucose and sialic acid are
involved in the regulation of the immune cell activation, effector function and exhaustion. Tools developed in
this project can also be used to study other types of glycans and their interactions with glycan binding proteins."

The T32 program ‘Promoting Academic Workforce Diversity in Translational Behavioral & Cardio-Metabolic
Research (PINNACLE)’ at the University of Miami (UM) leverages our experience directing several URM-
focused training programs over the past 15 years. The program provides an innovative, theory-based
mentored learning experience anchored in an environment of inclusive excellence to promote academic
careers of URM postdoctoral mentees. Its programmatic components are informed by the Theory of
Planned Behavior, the Bandura’s Social Cognitive Theory, and the Ibarra-Thomas Theory. During the two
academic years, mentees will receive didactic training in cardio-metabolic, behavioral, and digital health
sciences by attending structured courses and workshops at the CTSI’s MS in Clinical Translational
Investigation and the NHLBI-funded PRIDE Institute. Consistent with recommendations of the NIH Office of
Intramural Training & Education, scholars will participate in individualized and group learning exercises to
improve skills in critical thinking, verbal and written communication, time management and other soft skills
necessary for academic advancement. They will be mentored while implementing their IDP, including
acquisition of professional and lab-based research skills, peer networking, and grant writing. We will
implement and evaluate the program for 5 years and track mentees’ achievements for 10 years post
completion. Specific outcomes will include number of: 1) peer-reviewed publications and professional
presentations; 2) leadership positions, retention and promotion; 3) awards; and 4) federal and non-federal
grants. We will also evaluate mentees’ characteristics (self-efficacy, intrinsic motivation, and resilience) that
predict academic success pre and post matriculation. The specific program aims are: 1) To select qualified
postdoctoral URM mentees (e.g., PhD, MD, or MD/PhD) with great potential to become innovative and
creative leaders in the scientific community, applying translational behavioral models to study and reduce
risk of cardio-metabolic diseases (e.g., obesity, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea); 2)
To increase mentees’ academic self-efficacy to pursue independent research in translational behavioral
cardio-metabolic health. This intensive 2-year program provides exposure to multidisciplinary research
methods and digital health technologies utilized to study cardio-metabolic diseases and exposure to
instructions to enhance leadership and career development skills; 3) To provide coaching, mentorship, and
sponsorship to URM scientists to facilitate entry in academia and transition as independent researchers.
PINNACLE will address a critical deficiency in the academic workforce by mentoring a total of 12 URM
postdoctoral mentees to pursue careers in translational behavioral and cardio-metabolic research. This will
have a strong impact in achieving Healthy People 2030 goal to diversify the academic workforce, thus
expanding the capacity to implement translational behavioral models to improve health equity."

 Identifying air pollution sources is critical for developing mitigation strategies to protect human health. Many cities
in the western United States experience elevated short-term PM2.5, composed of heterogeneous PM2.5 mixtures that
vary seasonally. PM2.5 is a mixture of primary PM2.5 (aerosols emitted directly from a source) and secondary PM2.5
(aerosols formed in the atmosphere from reactions involving primary pollutants, precursor emissions, and atmospheric
processes). Although source apportionment models can be applied to trace pollutants back to their emission sources, all
conventional source apportionment models share a common limitation: only the primary PM2.5 is apportioned.
 Meteorology plays a significant role in elevated air pollution concentrations during colder months in the western
U.S. Under typical meteorological conditions, temperature decreases as altitude increases. During an inversion, this
relationship is inverted – warm air is held above cooler air – causing ambient air pollutants, such as PM2.5, to be trapped
near ground level. Several major historical air pollution events, including the 1952 London “Great Smog,” were caused
by inversions. During colder months in the western U.S., it is common for over 80% of the total PM2.5 to be secondary
PM2.5. To create effective regulations to protect human health in these cities, air quality managers must understand
the origin of secondary PM2.5. Given the predominance of secondary PM2.5 during colder months, existing source
apportionment models cannot reliably identify which source(s) should be prioritized for mitigation strategies.
 We propose to address this public health problem by developing an innovative air quality model that apportions
both primary and secondary PM2.5, and to use the estimates from this model in a large 12-city epidemiologic study.
We will develop a new data fusion method that combines air quality model results and speciated PM2.5 observations to
create seasonal, location-specific source profiles for both primary and secondary PM2.5 species. These new source
profiles will be used in a multi-year source apportionment model to estimate daily PM2.5 source concentrations during
colder months for Boise, Salt Lake City, Provo, Ogden, Denver, Reno, Las Vegas, Sacramento, Fresno, Modesto,
Bakersfield, and Visalia. Emergency department visit data from these cities will be used to estimate associations
between the PM2.5 source concentration estimates and cardiorespiratory emergency visits.
 Our project directly addresses major limitations in existing source apportionment approaches by developing
methods to apportion secondary PM2.5. Our multicity epidemiologic analyses will uniquely contribute to the literature by
providing source-specific health associations that comprehensively account for both primary and secondary PM2.5
originating from a given source. We focus on the significant public health problem of PM2.5 in western U.S. cities prone
to inversions and accompanying PM2.5 spikes, but our novel source apportionment methodologies can be readily applied
to other regions and studies. Findings from our study will be of immediate interest to air quality and public health
stakeholders, informing policy development to reduce high pollution days and protect public health."
10749921,"Project Summary
Cervical cancer remains a significant global cause of death in women, and 40% of women with cervical cancer
will relapse and die despite chemoradiation treatment. There is an urgent need to identify prognostic and
predictive biomarkers for chemoradiation response. We have developed and optimized a novel, non-invasive
swab-based biopsy approach to collect tissue before, during, and after chemoradiation without patient discomfort
or risks of serial biopsies such as bleeding or fistula. Despite low tumor purity, we have also developed a custom
computational pipeline to optimize mutation calling and identify clonally expanded mutations during
chemoradiation. Developing a deep understanding of genomic alterations during and after CRT to these findings
will help fast-track clinical translation of targeted therapies. To this end, we have used our pipeline in a pilot study
of 70 patients to reconstruct the evolution of mutations during CRT and identify proliferatively advantageous
driver mutations and pathways. This proposal aims to validate the candidate driver mutation lists in multiple
dimensions and develop a patient-derived organoid platform to test potential targeted therapies. First, we will
validate the preliminary identified clonally expanded genes and pathways in a larger population of already
collected but yet-to-be-sequenced samples. Second, we will perform a CRISPR/Cas9 library screen of these
preliminarily identified drivers in available cervical cancer cell lines. Simultaneously, we will develop a cervical
cancer organoid biobank to perform single-cell RNA sequencing before and after CRT and validate these
preliminarily identified genes. This platform will be used in the future to test targeted agents. When we complete
the aims of this R21, we will have validated ideal targets, developed testing platforms, and set the stage for
testing clinically impactful therapies in a future R01."
10773143,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The food environment has changed dramatically and rapidly in the last 50 years. A glance around any grocery
store will demonstrate that ultra-processed foods, defined as industrial formulations of sources of energy,
nutrients, and additives have come to dominate the food supply. In fact, ultra-processed foods now make up
around 58% of total calories consumed in the US. Ultra-processed food consumption has been linked with
various forms of cancer, increased cardiovascular disease, and increased all-cause mortality. Therefore, basic
understanding of the mechanisms that drive consumption of ultra-processed foods must keep pace with their
increasing availability and expanding percentage of the US food supply. The long-term goals of this research
are to identify specific properties of ultra-processed foods that support their consumption, the physiological and
neurobiological mechanisms they exploit to affect activity in brain reward systems, and the individual factors
that drive susceptibility to overconsumption so they can be later targeted for intervention. Our central
hypothesis is that ultra-processed foods are enriched in rapidly useable calories, which enhances reward
related brain activity to those specific foods (and associated cues and flavors) and renders them more
reinforcing. To this end, in Aim 1, we will parametrically vary the speed of nutrient availability and assess brain
response to calorie predictive flavors and measure the rewarding properties of those flavors. In Aim 2, by
varying the level of processing in foods, while controlling for caloric density and macronutrient profiles, we will
directly assess the specific role of food processing on the time course of the metabolic response to
consumption and its relation to brain activity and food value. We will use data collected in both aims to create
predictive models that will allow us to pinpoint key factors, both within the individual and within the food, that
drive food reward. To our knowledge, this proposal is one of the few to assess processing as a key factor,
while controlling for other confounding variables such as energy density and macronutrient content. By
combining this with an innovative analysis approach we will have a unique opportunity for generating a data
driven assessment of key factors in ultra-processed food reward. The data generated in support of this
proposal have high potential significance in that they could provide key evidence needed for changing dietary
guidelines with the ultimate goal of reducing diet-related mortality and disease."
10770500,"Abstract
Despite advances in surgery, radiotherapy, and molecular targeted therapies, mortality in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains high. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) targeting the PD-1/PD-
L1 axis have been approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC, yet >70% of the patients
experience little clinical benefit due to a variety of immunosuppressive barriers in the tumor
microenvironment (TME). Myeloid suppressor cells exert potent immunosuppressive activity in the
TME that promotes tumor progression, mediates resistance to immunotherapy, and confers poor
outcomes in a variety of cancer types. We have shown that low dose stereotactic body radiation
therapy (SBRT) in combination with ICI confers durable anti-tumor immunity resulting in marked
tumor regression and improved survival in mouse models of NSCLC. Unexpectedly, we uncovered
that SBRT-mediated activation of lung resident Scgb1a1+ club cell secretome is necessary for
improving the efficacy of ICI. We identified a set of 8 club cells secretory factors which in
combination with PD-1 blockade elicited significant tumor control and improved survival.
Mechanistically, club cell factors inhibit myeloid suppressor cells, reduce pro-tumor inflammatory
mediators to improve the effectiveness of ICI. Consistent with the preclinical findings, NSCLC
patients who responded to neoadjuvant SBRT/ICI therapy showed increased plasma CC10, a member
of the club cell secretome factor. These findings have led to the hypothesis that club cell factors
selectively inhibit immunosuppressive and proinflammatory function of myeloid suppressor cells to
increase the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. We further hypothesize that club cell factors
may serve as biomarkers of response and recurrence to SBRT/ICI therapy in human NSCLC.
Using an integrated preclinical and clinical approach, we will test this hypothesis through two
specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the exact identity of the core club cell factor/s and elucidate
mechanisms by which they attenuate myeloid suppressor cells to generate durable anti-tumor
immunity, and Aim 2 will leverage samples from a clinical trial to determine if club cell-based
biomarkers are associated with response therapy and metastatic recurrence following ICI/SBRT
therapy in human NSCLC. This work will develop a mechanism-based rationale for the development
of club cell factors as selective inhibitors of myeloid suppressor cells and for improving the efficacy
of ICI in NSCLC."

10890575,"PROJECT SUMMARY—Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD): Genes, Images, and Emotions
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) research is entering a new era of therapeutic discovery, spurred in part by
contributions from this program project grant (PPG), entitled “Frontotemporal Dementia: Genes, Images, and
Emotions,” which has a 20-year history of productivity and collaboration. In renewal, this PPG has been designed
to close important clinical-translational knowledge gaps that could, if unaddressed, impede progress toward new
therapies. The PPG will include four projects and seven cores. Project 1 will dissect the cognitive and emotional
processes disrupted in FTD using novel laboratory and neuroimaging approaches and will translate this
knowledge into automated, scalable tools for pathology prediction and disease-monitoring. Project 2 will link
transcriptomic and proteomic discovery platforms to TDP-43 loss-of-function biology, seeking to develop new
plasma-based molecular diagnostic and disease monitoring biomarkers. Project 3 will use laboratory-based
emotions research methods to evaluate FTD caregivers, a group at risk for poor health outcomes, with an eye
toward enhanced caregiver wellbeing and patient clinical trial participation. Project 4 will seek to identify sources
of heterogeneity in FTD clinical progression and treatment goals. Core A (Administration) will oversee all aspects
of the PPG to assure success of the project. Core B (Clinical) will recruit and evaluate patients and caregivers,
including those from groups historically underrepresented in research, and collect clinical, neuropsychological,
and functional assessments. Core C (Data Management and Biostatistics) will ensure data quality and availability
and provide biostatistical consultation to all projects. Core D (Neuropathology) will coordinate autopsies and
render neuropathological diagnoses, serving as the diagnostic gold standard and providing tissue for basic
science and biomarker discovery efforts. Core E (Imaging) will acquire and process MRI scans and obtain
amyloid-PET to detect AD in selected diagnostically uncertain patients. Core F (Genetics) will identify known
genetic FTD pathogenic and risk variants through whole-exome sequencing and provide gene expression
profiling in support of Project 2. Core G (Biospecimens) will obtain and bank biofluid specimens, provide samples
and proteomics data to Projects 2 and 4, and use established fluid biomarkers to detect neurodegeneration and
AD pathophysiology. These tightly integrated projects and cores will support our overall aim of accelerating
progress in the era of FTD therapeutic discovery."
10772998,"OVERALL
PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of this Program is to understand how transcription and splicing regulation is altered and co-
opted by cancer cells to promote tumor initiation and progression, and to apply this knowledge towards
development of new therapeutic approaches. During the past 50 years, the strong underlying basic science
foundation of the Program Project has allowed members to identify vulnerabilities in cancer and develop novel
and highly specific therapeutic strategies. This Program continues to take a multi-pronged approach grounded
in basic cancer research to identify and disrupt the molecular dependencies underlying cancer.
Within this Program, there are three highly integrated Projects (Targeting oncogenic transcription factors; RNA
Splicing dysregulation in cancer; Regulatory RNAs as cancer drivers and dependencies) and four innovative
Cores that are using cutting edge technologies to study the molecular mechanisms of cancer biology. To achieve
the Program's goals, these studies will exploit novel organoid models of human cancers, pioneering imaging
modalities in animal models, therapeutic antisense oligonucleotide strategies against otherwise undruggable
targets, and cutting-edge methods in biochemistry, cell biology and molecular biology. The researchers will
interrogate the basis of two of the most devastating types of tumors, basal-like carcinomas of the breast and
pancreas. All of this work is supported by four Cores that provide access to technologies, services, and expertise
that all combine to enhance productivity and promote interactions.
The interactive and collaborative nature of this Program guides each of these Projects beyond their singular
potential. Research in all three Projects touches on overlapping themes and benefits from the expertise of the
other Program members. Together, this Program is making significant progress towards its goal of identifying
novel therapeutic targets that will substantially impact cancer treatment."
10890594,"PROJECT SUMMARY – TDP-43 Loss-of-Function: Biology to Biomarkers (Project 2)
Biomarkers for frontotemporal dementia (FTD) may be used to confirm the presence of neurodegeneration,
predict underlying pathology, demonstrate drug target engagement, or monitor disease progression. Biomarkers
for pathology prediction represent a major challenge but also a pressing unmet need. For example, if a tau- or
TDP-43-based clinical trial chose to recruit across the full FTD spectrum, ~40% of participants would receive
treatment for a condition they do not have. Furthermore, candidate biomarkers for tracking disease progression,
such as structural MRI or neurofilament light chain (NfL), do not capture molecule-specific pathobiological
changes or quantify engagement of potential treatment targets. Recently, it has been shown that frontotemporal
lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP) is associated with, and possibly driven by, neuron type-
specific loss of TDP-43 function. Additional work has shown that loss of nuclear TDP-43 results in incorporation
of non-conserved cryptic exons, creating ripples of downstream dysregulation. Moreover, because TDP-43
normally binds to and represses transposable elements, loss of TDP-43 function leads to de-repression of these
highly mobile genetic elements, inducing genomic instability and cellular toxicity. The overarching goal of this
project is to pursue tissue-informed, biofluid-based molecular FTD biomarkers, using a systematic discovery and
validation approach. Biofluid-based biomarkers represent an attractive development platform, and tissue-derived
insights provide important constraint and guidance for such efforts. First, in a biomarker candidate discovery
phase, we will conduct transcriptomic (blood) and proteomic (CSF) analysis of banked samples from 60 patients
with pathologically diagnosed or genetically predicted FTLD-TDP, 60 with FTLD-tau, and 60 controls. Next,
candidate biomarkers will undergo multi-method validation that includes correlations with clinical, neuroimaging,
digital pathology, and plasma proteomic measures, followed by biochemical and histological confirmation, to
prioritize candidates. Finally, top candidates will be developed into single analyte immunoassays and tested as
diagnostic and disease monitoring biomarkers using longitudinal plasma samples from 80 patients with FTLD-
TDP, 80 with FTLD-tau, and 30 controls. This project will leverage the extensive resources of this long-running
PPG, interact with all seven cores, and utilize the complementary expertise of the participating laboratories.
Successful completion of this project would have a major impact on the field by advancing our understanding of
TDP-43 loss-of-function biology and by providing urgently needed tools for clinical trial-associated enrollment,
stratification, and disease monitoring."
10770358,"SUMMARY
The purpose of this application is to determine clinical, immunologic, and inflammatory factors that lead to
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
with the clinically relevant goal of improving HFpEF screening, prevention, and therapy for people with HIV
(PWH). HFpEF is a complex syndrome with high mortality: 50% of persons with HFpEF die within 5 years of
diagnosis. Rates of HFpEF and diastolic dysfunction – the key structural abnormality underlying HFpEF – are
significantly higher for PWH than people without HIV, with recent studies finding a 4-8-fold higher prevalence of
diastolic dysfunction for PWH than people without HIV. In general, inflammation and immune dysfunction are
important precipitants of HFpEF, and may be particularly important for HIV-associated HFpEF. However, data
are limited regarding HFpEF clinical risk factors and pathophysiology in PWH. One key reason for this
continued scientific gap is that no large, diverse, multi-center cohorts of PWH have adjudicated heart failure
events or linked these to biospecimens – a necessary step to accurately characterize and investigate specific
subtypes of heart failure. We propose to do this in a large, modern cohort of >35,000 PWH in clinical care
throughout the United States; this cohort has an extensive array of individually-linked bio-specimens, patient-
reported outcomes, and access to clinical imaging data that are unique among large HIV cohorts and
necessary to comprehensively characterize HFpEF in HIV. Our central hypothesis is that PWH with incomplete
immune recovery, as indicated by lower CD4 counts and CD4/CD8 ratios, are especially susceptible to HFpEF
in the presence of “second hits” ranging from hypertension to specific ART classes associated with off-target
comorbidities (such as weight gain). In the first aim, we will investigate clinical risk factors and interactions
thereof which are most strongly associated with incident HFpEF for PWH. In the second aim, we seek to more
deeply understand the biology of HIV-associated HFpEF and will therefore leverage a multi-marker proteomics
panel – for which we have extensive pilot data in non-HIV HFpEF patients – to define immunologic and
inflammatory contributors to HFpEF for PWH. In Aim 3, we will use a novel method to determine, at a single-
cell level, meaningful differences in immune cell gene expression that may lead to systemic biomarker
abnormalities and HFpEF for PWH; we will validate these findings in cardiac tissue in Aim 4. We have data to
support the premise and feasibility of each aim, and our PI is ideally suited to lead the proposed analyses; as a
cardiologist, he recently served as writing chair of the American Heart Association's scientific statement on HIV
and CVD, a landmark document that required extensive multidisciplinary coordination. Led by the PI, our team
has the requisite methods and content expertise to successfully perform the analyses. Through completion of
the aims, we intend to generate key clinical and pathophysiological knowledge regarding HIV-associated HF
which will inform improved prevention, diagnosis, and ultimately treatment of HFpEF among PWH."

10758971,"Abstract of research
The finding that most patients with virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA >=1,000cp/mL) on second-line PI-
containing regimens lack PI-resistance mutations in the protease (PR) gene is one of the main
enigmas of antiretroviral drug resistance research. We hypothesized that env and gag sequences
from these patients contain compensatory mutations, specifically in the Env, that confer PI
resistance. A role of the gp41 CT in PI resistance may be linked to the role of virus maturation,
triggered by PR, in activating Env fusion activity. In recent years, increasing numbers of clinical
reports have observed failure of DTG-containing therapy in the absence of integrase (IN)
mutations, suggesting that mutations outside IN may confer resistance in these patients. Our
studies demonstrated the first instance of de novo selection of Env mutations that confer
resistance to Dolutegravir (DTG) in vitro (unpublished data). We attribute this phenotype to the
ability of the Env mutants to mediate highly efficient cell-to-cell transmission, resulting in an
increase in the multiplicity of infection. In addition, up to 20-, 6- and 24-fold reduction in
susceptibility to ATV, DRV and LPV, respectively, was observed in absence of PR mutations
among HIV-1 CRF_02AG and subtype G infected patients. These findings have broad
implications for our understanding of Env and Gag functions and the evolution of HIV-1 drug
resistance. Our goal is to identify factors that predict virological failure (VF) on ATV/r or LPV/r as
patients with VF on a PI-containing regimens have suboptimal future treatment and may be at an
increased risk for developing integrase resistance inhibitor on a third-line regimen. A collaborative
team involving investigators led by the Institute of Human Virology Nigeria will exploit robust
longitudinal cohorts (Cameroon, Nigeria and Uganda) of patients on 2L regimens, coupled to well-
characterized and archived clinical specimens that underpin a rigorous nested case-control study
design.
To test these interlocking hypotheses, we propose to: (i) use our newly developed HIV-xGen next
generation sequencing method to extend understanding of viral evolution and HIV drug resistance
across the viral genome and to determine whether there is effect modification by non-B HIV-1
subtypes, (ii) characterize recombinant viruses carrying mutations identified in Aim 1, using
established phenotypic assays to determine their effect on drug susceptibility and site-directed
mutagenesis, and lastly (iii) determine differences in replicative fitness on drug susceptibility with
use of a yeast recombination-based cloning system. Our plans to study these patients and their
viruses (subtype A, C, D, G, and CRF02_AG, CRF43_02G, HIV-1 O and HIV-1 N) provides a
unique opportunity to determine the phenotypic and clinical significance of genotypic changes in
HIV-1 gag, gag-pol and env genes. All in all, this proposal will permit exciting epidemiological,
clinical, and public health research opportunities."
10770385,"Project Summary
The lack of specific targets for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a major challenge, as
many TNBCs do not respond to cytotoxic chemotherapies. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has yielded
promising results in both advanced and early-stage TNBC and is expected to substantially improve the overall
prognosis of patients with this disease. However, since TNBC is not inherently immunogenic, it is important to
identify patients who would benefit most from immunotherapy and to identify agents that can prime the tumor
microenvironment to enhance the therapeutic effects. TNBC is known to exhibit high levels of replication stress,
which occurs when the DNA replication machinery encounters obstacles that impede the replication process. In
normal cells, replication stress activates the replication stress response (RSR) to maintain genome integrity.
Defective RSR allows cells with high replication stress to survive and proliferate. Recently, we have identified a
gene signature that represents defects in RSR (RSRD). We found this RSRD signature to be highly enriched in
TNBC cells. Furthermore, RSRD-high TNBC cells accumulate cytoplasmic DNA and induce STING-dependent
cytokine production, which is required for the effectiveness of ICB. Intriguingly, the RSRD signature score
correlates perfectly with the response of TNBC to ICB in syngeneic mouse models, and it accurately predicts
ICB response across 5 low–mutation-burden tumor lineages. All these intriguing findings support the hypotheses
that RSRD may act as a key determinant of ICB outcomes in low–mutation-burden cancers, including TNBC,
and that RSRD-enhancing drugs may sensitize ICB-resistant TNBC to immunotherapy. These hypotheses will
be tested via 3 specific aims. (1) To determine how the immune microenvironment is modified in RSR-defective
TNBC. We will use a highly multiplexed imaging mass cytometry panel to determine how RSRD remodels the
immune microenvironment of TNBC and induces susceptibility to ICB. In addition, we will manipulate the RSR
status in TNBC cells to assess the relationship between RSR defects and immunotherapy response. (2) To
identify causative drivers of RSRD-high–mediated ICB responsiveness in TNBC. Our preliminary studies suggest
that RSR defects may drive immunotherapy response through accumulation of immunostimulatory cytosolic
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). We will, therefore, seek to manipulate the cytosolic ssDNA level in TNBC models
to determine whether cytosolic ssDNA is indeed a causative driver of ICB responsiveness in TNBC. In addition,
to understand why our RSRD gene signature predicts response to ICB in TNBC, we will apply an in vivo CRISPR
screen to determine what transcriptional changes contained within our RSRD gene signature cause this
response. (3) To develop novel combination therapy to convert RSRD-low TNBC to RSRD-high to improve their
response to ICB. Using cutting-edge systems and bioinformatics approaches, we have identified many potential
RSRD-inducing agents. We will assess the 6 most promising candidates and identify the best candidate
compound that can effectively sensitize RSRD-low TNBC to ICB."
10932105,"PROJECT SUMMARY: The proposed K23 award will prepare Dr. Jessie Gibson, PhD, RN, AGPCNP-BC to
become an independent investigator developing interventions for neuropsychiatric symptom management in
neurodegenerative disease. Dr. Gibson’s clinical and research experiences have provided a foundation in
identification, measurement, and effects of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Huntington’s disease (HD) and
Parkinson’s disease (PD). The proposed research plan will prepare Dr. Gibson to take the next steps toward
investigating treatment for these symptoms in independent clinical trials. Anxiety symptoms are extremely
prevalent in HD and PD, causing significant burden for patients and caregivers. Unfortunately, there is limited
evidence for how to treat these symptoms. Experts recommend use of psychological interventions to treat
anxiety symptoms in HD and PD, but there have been few rigorous studies to support these recommendations.
Cognitive bias modification for interpretation bias (CBM-I) paradigms address negative interpretation biases by
training participants to (re)interpret ambiguous, potentially threatening situations in more benign ways to make
anxious thinking more flexible. Our preliminary work has demonstrated feasibility of web-based CBM-I in this
population and identified the need to adapt CBM-I programs to meet the needs of individuals with movement
disorders. Our current objective is to determine whether a web-based cognitive bias modification for
interpretation bias (CBM-I) intervention can reduce anxiety in PD and HD. Thus, we aim to: 1) gather
stakeholder perspectives and 2) develop a web-based CBM-I intervention tailored to individuals with
neurodegenerative movement disorders (MindTrails-Movement), then 3) evaluate target engagement and
preliminary efficacy of MindTrails-Movement for reducing interpretation bias and anxiety symptoms in HD and
PD. To carry out these aims and prepare Dr. Gibson to become a national leader in developing interventions
for neuropsychiatric symptom management in neurodegenerative disease, she will work with an expert
mentoring team led by Dr. Bethany Teachman, and including co-mentors Drs. Madaline Harrison, Carol
Manning, Jeanne Alhusen, and Guofen Yan. Training experiences will support Dr. Gibson’s career
development goals to: 1) cultivate skills to develop behavioral interventions using human-centered design; 2)
develop expertise in clinical trial design and implementation; 3) establish advanced knowledge of mechanisms
that maintain mood and anxiety disorders; and 4) develop leadership and grantsmanship skills and establish
collaborations to prepare for a successful career as an independent nurse scientist. University of Virginia
provides the ideal environment to achieve these research and career development goals, as home to a world-
class nursing school, Huntington’s Disease Center of Excellence, American Parkinson’s Disease Association
Advanced Center for Research, and the Program for Anxiety, Cognition and Treatment (PACT) lab- all of which
are critical to the success of this proposal."
10755732,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The efficiency with which messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are translated into proteins by the ribosome is a
fundamental determinant of gene expression. This efficiency is often determined during the mRNA recruitment
step of translation by the ribosome. Consequently, this step is a crucial point of control for gene expression. In
eukaryotes, mRNA recruitment is an elaborate, multi-step, and highly regulated process that depends upon the
activities of ~13 eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). Dysregulation of eIF activity and mRNA recruitment has been
causally linked to tumorigenesis, tumor growth, drug resistance, and metastasis in an increasing list of human
cancers. Consequently, several eIFs and their roles in mRNA recruitment are emerging as very attractive
anticancer drug targets, with an existing, FDA-approved, eIF-targeting compound already having been
successfully repurposed as an anticancer therapy. In order to expand and fully exploit this therapeutic potential,
however, it is necessary to understand the molecular events that underlie eIF function and mRNA recruitment.
 Here, we will use a highly purified, fluorophore-labeled, Saccharomyces cerevisiae in vitro translation
system that we developed and that includes a full-length, site-specifically labeled eIF4G and a fully reconstituted,
site-specifically labeled eIF3, reagents that have been difficult to generate. With these reagents in hand, we will
use state-of-the-art, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM),
including a pioneering, time-resolved cryo-EM approach developed by our collaborator, Dr. Joachim Frank, to
directly observe and characterize the dynamics of mRNA recruitment during eukaryotic translation initiation.
 In Aim 1, we will investigate the mechanism through which the multi-component eIF4F complex activates
different classes of mRNAs for loading onto ribosomal 43S pre-initiation complexes (PICs), and how changes to
the composition of the eIF4F complex can alter which classes of mRNAs are activated. We hypothesize that the
structural dynamics of the activated mRNA complex are critical for mRNA loading and will quantify how these
dynamics contribute to mRNA selection. In Aim 2, we will investigate how the multi-component eIF3 complex
interacts with different classes of mRNAs and/or the 43S PIC in order to facilitate mRNA activation and/or loading
onto a 43S PIC, as well as how biologically active subcomplexes of eIF3 can modulate these activities. A large-
scale structural rearrangement of 43S PIC-bound eIF3 is thought to control its mRNA loading activity and we will
therefore characterize how this rearrangement facilitates formation of the 48S PIC on mRNAs of different
classes. In Aim 3, we will investigate the mechanism through which eIF1A and eIF5B mediate mRNA start-codon
recognition within a 48S PIC. Start-codon recognition by eIF1A has recently been associated with a large-scale
rearrangement of the 48S PIC in which eIF5B and initiator transfer RNA (Met-tRNAi) are repositioned in

10775742,"Project Summary/Abstract
 C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) is an aggressive ultra-rare kidney disease that occurs at any age and carries
the highest risk for irreversible renal failure of the known glomerular diseases. It is defined by underlying
complement dysregulation and characterized by predominant complement C3 deposition on kidney biopsy.
Two major disease subgroups are recognized–dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis
(C3GN)–although overlapping clinical and pathological features suggest that C3G is more appropriately
considered a disease continuum. Dysregulation of the alternative pathway (AP) of complement is
fundamental to disease manifestation although terminal pathway dysregulation is also common.
 The estimated renal half-life in C3G patients is 10 years and in patients who progress to end-stage renal
disease (ESRD), transplant decisions, including timing and post-transplant medical therapy, are
overshadowed by the fact that disease recurrence remains a major medical issue. The challenges faced by
clinicians in caring for C3G patients reflect our incomplete understanding of both the underlying
pathophysiology and natural history of this disease. These knowledge gaps impact treatment decisions and
the development of disease-specific therapies.
 In this grant, we propose to:
 • Specific Aim 1. To study the role of genetic variation in C3G
 • Specific Aim 2. To define the characteristics of autoantibodies in C3G by epitope mapping
 • Specific Aim 3. To develop and clinically validate predictive models of disease outcome in C3G
 Completing these specific aims will significantly refine our insight into the pathogenesis of C3G, improve
clinical care of these patients, and lay the foundation for effective and personalized treatments for this
disease."
10767952,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While significant educational barriers exist for minority, disadvantaged, and underrepresented groups it has been
shown that undergraduate research programs targeting these individuals increases both enrollment in graduate
programs and the number of individuals pursuing careers in the sciences. Therefore, developing undergraduate
research programs for minority, disadvantaged, and underrepresented student groups will be vital for increasing
their participation in health science graduate programs and career in the biomedical sciences. Groups nationally
underrepresented, as defined by the NIH, include racial and ethnic groups but also individuals from
disadvantaged background (rural, low-income or medically underserved area). Indeed, many rural areas across
the US face unique health and educational challenges and Utah is not immune from these. Rural residents are
more likely to die from health issues like cardiovascular disease, chronic lung disease, and stroke and fare poorly
across many social determinants of health compared to urban populations. In addition, students from rural areas
often lack educational resources including access to high-speed internet, AP coursework, or extracurricular
opportunities. They also struggle with reduced exposure to career pathways and appropriate role models.
Indeed, Utah’s rural students have lower college entrance exam scores and are less likely to enter college. With
these unique challenges in mind the Rural and Underserved Utah Training Experience (RUUTE) & Regional
Affairs program was established in 2018
at the University of Utah. RUUTE was developed as a concerted effort
to extend the University of Utah’s Health Sciences resources to rural and underserved communities throughout
the Intermountain West and to create unique opportunities for health science education and professional
development. The RUUTE office has expanded rapidly over the past 4 years (from 1 program coordinator in
2018 to 10 faculty and staff members), and continues to develop new programs each year. One of the newest
RUUTE initiatives was the development of a Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE), piloted
in the summer of 2021. to provide a high quality 10-week mentored research opportunity for undergraduates
from rural areas in the Intermountain West. The SURE program has an overarching goal to provide students with
academic, research, and professional development experiences that will make them competitive when applying
to health science programs in the NHLBI mission areas. To accomplish this, the current proposal aims to: 1)
Develop a 10-week intensive summer research program focused on heart, lung, blood, and sleep-specific health
concerns for students from minority, disadvantaged, and underrepresented backgrounds from the Intermountain
West; 2) Develop a concurrent 10-week education series and professional development opportunities to
supplement the research experience; 3) Facilitate effective networking and mentoring opportunities for students
to ensure retention of individuals;
and 4) Determine the efficacy of the SURE program by tracking participants
and through both mentor and mentee feedback."
10768738,"Abstract
The primary objective is to develop an artificial intelligence-centric, quantitative and noninvasive software
platform that can be integrated into 3D angiographic scanners (DSA, CTA or MRA) to provide guidance
regarding the diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Hemorrhagic stroke secondary to
ruptured IAs leads to significant morbidity and mortality and affects over 35,000 patients on a yearly basis in
the United States. The diagnosis of asymptomatic IAs is on the rise with the increasing use of cerebral
imaging. However, guidance regarding which aneurysms should be treated has not advanced.
Leveraging recent advances in computational science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence, the
proposed software platform built on two enabling technologies can (1) propel automated “patient-specific”
hemodynamic evaluations into the clinical workflow and (2) conduct “data-driven” risk assessments of IA
rupture on an individual basis. Specific research aims are to (1) develop a clinically-oriented CFD platform
that enables automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations of IAs, (2) investigate data-driven
analytics toward prediction of rupture risk for IAs and (3) evaluate the data-driven analytics in a blind
study.
Once validated, a follow-up R01 project is planned to examine the clinical utility of the proposed software
platform in a prospective clinical study as a single gateway for computer-aided evaluation of cerebral
aneurysms."
10804609,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Genome editing is revolutionizing biomedicine and biotechnology by enabling the precise modification of
genomic DNA in living cells. While various genome-editing tools have been developed over the past decade, the
CRISPR-Cas9 system has emerged as a particularly versatile and efficient technology for editing DNA.
Nonetheless, limitations derived from its reliance on DNA double strand breaks (DSB), which can lead to
unpredictable editing outcomes and even chromosomal translocations, could limit its applications.
 Base editors (BEs) and prime editors (PEs) are two novel classes of genome-editing tools capable of
introducing precise single-base conversion in DNA without the requirement of a DSB. PEs, in particular, provide
greater flexibility than BEs, owing to their ability to introduce any type of base conversion and even programable
small insertions and deletions. This expanded set of capabilities compared to other technologies makes PEs a
particularly promising platform for applications in biomedicine; however, the large size of PEs precludes their in
vivo delivery by AAV, a promising and effective gene delivery vehicle that is currently under evaluation in multiple
clinical trials.
 To overcome these obstacles, we have created a split-PE platform that is compatible with AAV delivery and
have demonstrated the functionality of this approach in cultured cells. Despite this progress, there still remain
several critical challenges, which we here propose to overcome in order to optimize this technology for effective
and specific in vivo prime editing.
 To accomplish this objective, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with collective expertise in genome
editing (Dr. Perez-Pinera), AAV gene delivery (Dr. Gaj) and computational biology (Dr. Song). Our collaborative
efforts will yield an integrated and comprehensive PE toolset that will blend strategies for target identification and
editing optimization, with methods for reducing off-target effects and immune responses, thus priming this
technology for future in vivo applications.
 Given that the flexibility of PEs has significantly expanded the number of actionable target sites that can be
genetically modified, we anticipate that the integrated technologies we develop will have large, direct and long-
lasting impact in biomedicine by enabling not only novel gene therapies, but also basic research. In particular,
our technology will provide investigators with biological tools that are uniquely capable of introducing mutations
within post-mitotic cells in vivo, which could be used to dissect functional elements or even determine the role of
pathogenic mutations in a cell- and tissue-specific manner. The technologies created by this application will thus
broadly impact biotechnology and biomedicine."
10735900,"A Novel Hydrology-based Malaria Transmission Model and Field Applications
Project Summary
Malaria is a major public health challenge in Africa. Scale-up of insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) and
indoor residual spray (IRS) in the past two decades has reduced malaria burden in Africa by half,
however the progress of malaria control has been stalled in many African countries due to limited
effectiveness of LLINs and IRS. The World Health Organization recommends larval source
management (LSM) as a supplementary vector control tool. However, LSM has so far not been widely
used for malaria vector control in Africa, partly due to the inability to predict habitat locations and stability
in many eco-epidemiological settings. LSM would be greatly facilitated if larval habitat distribution can
be predicted a priori so that areas best suitable or unsuitable to LSM can be identified. Further, if the
impact of environmental modifications such as landscape alteration and irrigation on malaria risk can
be predicted, optimal LSM-based vector control program can be developed. Past studies have
attempted to use field-based surveys or remotely sensed data for larval habitat identification or
correlated environmental factors with malaria risk, but these studies focused on the statistical
association between the environmental factors and malaria incidence, and they did not consider the
physical processes and environmental regulation on vector larval ecology. Furthermore, the dynamic
nature of the interactions between the multiple environmental factors that may be highly dynamic and
malaria risk was not studied. Recent advancements in parallel computing, hydrological modeling and
remote sensing present an excellent opportunity to incorporate hydrologic processes in malaria risk
modeling, and subsequently enhance the prediction accuracy. The central objective of this R21
application is to integrate a physically-based hydrologic model with remote sensing and
entomological data, to model malaria risk and apply the model to identify optimal larval habitat
water management strategies and malaria hotspots. Well-characterized study sites in western
Kenya with detailed entomological and epidemiological information will be used to calibrate and validate
the model. A unique aspect of this project is the use of multi-layer data such as hydrological,
meteorological, topographic, entomological and historical epidemiological parameters to enhance
malaria risk prediction. The findings of this project will improve our understanding of the impact
of hydrology and other environmental conditions on vector ecology and malaria risk, and
enhance malaria control through a priori prediction of transmission hotspots at high spatial
resolution and identification of optimal agricultural water management strategies that meet the
crop production needs but reduce malaria transmission."
10896143,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Fexinidazole has emerged as the front-line treatment against African trypanosomiasis, offering the first oral
monotherapy against T. brucei gambiense infections. Because of its current success in African trypanosome
treatment, fexinidazole is actively being investigated as a therapy against American trypanosomiasis (Chagas)
and Leishmaniasis, which currently infect over 15 million people globally. Fexinidazole joined nifurtimox (NECT
combination therapy, HAT) and benznidazole (Chagas disease) as clinically significant nitroaromatic compounds
for the treatment of trypanosomatid infections. Nitroheterocyclic compounds function as prodrugs that require
nitroreductase (NTR) enzymatic activation to generate cytotoxic species that are thought to damage DNA, lipids,
and proteins. Naturally occurring and laboratory resistance and cross-resistance have been documented based
on T. brucei NTR mutants and in RNAi-based knock-down studies, respectively. Fexinidazole is a repurposed
compound whose success in clinical trials enabled rapid approvals with few publications evaluating the drugs
trypanocidal phenotypes, Mechanism of Action (MoA), or potential for drug resistance. Inadequate molecular
understanding of fexinidazole’s MoA and modes of drug resistance represent a significant knowledge gap. To
fill this gap, our state-of-the-art T. brucei Gain-of-Function library was applied to the question of fexinidazole
resistance and preliminary studies identified 11 survival associated ORFs including oxidoreductases, a
peroxidase, dithiol glutaredoxin, and a glutathione S-transferase. Collectively, the identified genes support the
central hypothesis that novel fexinidazole survival genes constitute a redox-based pathway able to promote
nitroaromatic drug resistance with implications for fexinidazole’s MoA. This exploratory proposal will take the
modest risk of investigating genes that promote survival during fexinidazole treatment, toward the high reward
of identifying the drugs molecular targets and drug resistance mechanisms. The Specific Aims are targeted to
answer two significant questions: Are fexinidazole survival ORFs specific to nitroaromatic compounds? and Do
fexinidazole GoF survival genes constitute a redox-based drug resistance pathway? Aim 1 will employ a set of
innovative T. brucei Gain-of-Function genetic screens to determine if the identified fexinidazole survival genes
are (i) specific to fexinidazole resistance, (ii) general to all nitroaromatics, or (iii) broadly associated ROS stress
management. AIM 2 will test the working hypothesis that fexinidazole resistance can arise from a novel redox-
based resistance pathway through unbiased phenotypic analysis of drug resistance and cross-resistance, protein
localization, mitochondrial functionality, cell cycle and DNA synthesis, and ROS and redox. The proposed
research is significant because it will identify genes associated with fexinidazole’s MoA and resistance
mechanisms, filling critical knowledge gaps for this frontline therapeutic. New medicines are needed against all
parasitic trypanosomatid infections and discoveries arising from this work are expected to result in alternative
therapeutic approaches and new drug targets."
10747445,"The zoonotic potential of members of the genus Orthopoxvirus (orthopoxviruses) of mammal- infecting poxviruses represent a continued threat to global public health. A hallmark of the complex biology of orthopoxvirus multiplication in the host cell cytoplasm is the generation of two distinct infectious forms—intracellular mature virions (IMV), which remain largely cell- associated, and enveloped virions (EV), which are critical for extracellular viral spread. EVs bear a unique complement of eight virus-encoded membrane proteins at their surface that influence tissue tropism, long-range in vivo dissemination, and ultimately, virulence; provide key targets for vaccine-induced and therapeutic antibodies; and are important determinants of the therapeutic potential of oncolytic poxvirus vectors. Despite their importance, a comprehensive understanding of EVs is challenged by the complex networks of virus-host and virus-virus interactions that underlie their morphogenesis and function. Our overall objective is to unravel these functional protein interaction networks through a combination of genetic and proteomic approaches. Using a new platform for unbiased and deep mutagenesis of any genomic locus in the prototypic orthopoxvirus, vaccinia virus (VACV), we conducted deep-mutational scans (DMS) of two EV proteins, A33 and A34, in the context of infectious viral particles and identified novel regiospecific mutations that enhance EV fitness. We will elucidate the mechanisms of action of these mutants. In parallel, we will perform genetic modifier and proteomic screens to uncover new functional interactions of A33/A34 with viral and host proteins. Collectively, these studies will provide new information on how EVs—critical for both the virulence of orthopoxviruses and their utility as oncolytic vectors—assemble, egress, and spread to new cells during infection."

understanding of global gene regulation to deploy novel therapeutics that target key epigenomic factors. Cells
and cell states can be defined by their gene expression programs, and tumor cells commonly have deregulated
gene expression programs. This core will perform epigenomic analyses on clinical samples from Projects 1 as
well as preclinical samples in Project 2, 3 and 4 at bulk and single cell level. Specifically, samples will be obtained
from patients enrolled on the previous clinical trial (IFM/DFCI 2009) and the newer IFM-2020-02 trial (evaluating
an MRD-based therapeutic algorithms at time of diagnosis and at relapse) in Project 1. In each case, tumor cells
will be isolated in Core 2 using well established procedures. This core will perform analysis for epigenetic
regulatory factors. The core has capabilities to perform ATAC-seq, MINT ChIP-seq using low cell number (5000

183, 1103–1116.e20) as well as adopt innovative variations specifically needed to answer questions. The core
will help with analysis of the generated data and accurately chart maps of epigenetic modifications and related
chromatin structures in myeloma. It will work with Core 5 to help integrate these results with other genomic

10756081,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Pathologies characterized by excessive fear and anxiety are the most common mental
illness with a 12-month prevalence estimate of about 40 million American adults. The primary treatment for
anxiety and stress-related disorders is exposure therapy, which is informed by theoretical and technical aspects
of Pavlovian extinction. However, extinguished behaviors are prone to relapse under a variety of circumstances.
Further, clinical research reveals serious deficits across a host of psychiatric conditions in the ability to form and
retrieve extinction memories, which likely contributes to relapse following extinction-based therapies.
Accordingly, there is strong motivation to better understand how extinction memories are encoded, stored, and
expressed so as to bolster the strength and generalization of clinical treatment. Pioneering research in rodents
reveals that fear conditioning and extinction generate separate and measurable memory traces within and across
discrete brain regions. Whether such an organization exists in the human brain is unknown. More precise
knowledge on how threat and safety memories are represented and interact in the human brain will advance
innovative treatments for pathological anxiety that are built on the neuroscience of learning and memory. The
goal of this research is to better understand how competing memories of fear and safety are formed, stored, and
retrieved in the human brain. To build directly on mechanistic insights from animal models, we utilize Pavlovian
fear conditioning and extinction in adult humans during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The
research leverages advances in multivariate pattern analysis techniques, and integrates theoretical and technical
advancements of fear extinction research from animal models with computational approaches developed to
study human memory. Each study includes healthy adults and individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), as linking advances in fear extinction research to the pathophysiology of PTSD can have direct benefit
to exposure therapy—the gold-standard treatment based on the principles of extinction. We also evaluate
extinction memory at 24-hours and again at 1 month. Assessing long-term extinction retrieval in humans is
extremely rare, but consistent with diagnostic criteria for assessing PTSD, and thus furthers the bridge to
translational relevance. Aim 1 attempts to identify separate and stable memory traces of fear and extinction in
by identifying the correspondence (overlap) between neural activity related to the formation and retrieval of fear
and extinction over time. Aim 2 decodes a multivariate neural signature selective to the contextual encoding of
extinction memories. Aim 3 uses a non-pharmacological behavioral strategy to modulate the strength of
extinction to determine how enhanced fear extinction affects multivariate neural signature of extinction memory
retrieval over time. These findings have the potential to establish new risk and resilience factors for anxiety and
stress-related pathologies, and may ultimately contribute to innovative neuroscience-based treatments for
psychiatric conditions marked by excessive fear and the inability to regulate unwanted emotional responses."
10890581,"PROJECT SUMMARY—Imaging Core (Core E)
Brain imaging plays a critical role in research and care of dementia. The Imaging Core of this PPG on
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) has facilitated scientific discovery since its initiation in 2002. Brain imaging has
been used by this PPG to characterize different forms of FTD, support diagnosis, and advance knowledge about
a variety of brain functions that are particularly affected in FTD, including executive control, social and emotional
behavior, speech, and langauge. To achieve these goals, we have used a variety of imaging modalities including
structural MRI; diffusion MRI (dMRI); task-free functional MRI (tf-fMRI); and FDG, amyloid, and tau PET. Over
the last few years, this core has also focused on the development of longitudinal processing pipelines for multiple
imaging modalities to facilitate tracking disease over time. In the next cycle of the PPG, the Imaging Core will
continue to support novel uses of brain imaging to validate new assessments of emotion and language (in Project
1: Language and Emotions); develop biological markers of specific proteinopathies (Project 2: Molecular
Biomarkers); understand the factors that influence caregiver health (Project 3: Caregiver Health); and understand
cognitive resilience, variation in rates of decline, and develop a new clinical trials meaure (Project 4: FTD
Heterogeneity). All of these projects will utilize cross-sectional and longitudinal imaging data generated by this
core, in particular structural MRI, dMRI, and tf-fMRI. To support this work, the Imaging Core will pursue the
following aims: Aim 1: Collection and archiving of images and maintainenance of an image database. We will
collect and manage the following MRI sequences in patients with the behavioral variant of FTD; the nonfluent,
semantic, and logopenic variants of primary progressive aphasia; corticobasal syndrome; progressive
supranuclear palsy-Richardson’s syndrome; and Alzheimer’s diseas;, and in controls: MP-RAGE, FLAIR, dMRI,
ASL-perfusion tf-fMRI, and T2-weighted MRI. We will also acquire 18F-PI2620 and 18F-Florbetaben PET scans
in patients for whom clinical features and blood biomarkers for AD are inconsistent. Aim 2: Extraction of imaging
data to create cross-sectional estimates of structure, function, and molecular pathology. We will generate
regional estimates of volume and structural connectivity coinciding with the baseline visit for each participant.
Aim 3: Creation of longitudinal MRI-based change data. We will generate regional estimates of volume and
structural connectivity coinciding with each visit in each participant, and voxelwise maps of longitudinal change
in volume and white matter integrity. Aim 4: Data archiving and analytical consultation. We will work with PPG
investigators and staff and other researchers at our center to incorporate imaging data into their analyses."
10890597,"PROJECT SUMMARY—Caregiver Health and Attitudes in the Era of Therapeutic Discovery (Project E)
In the era of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) therapeutic discovery, the primary focus will be on people with
dementia (PWDs). However, the health and well-being of family and friends who serve as informal caregivers
(CGs) will also be a major concern. CGs provide essential support for maintaining PWDs’ health and
compensating for their functional declines, which differ considerably in FTD, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and other
dementias. Over time, these declines create additional burden that may adversely affect CGs’ health and, thus,
their ability to provide high-quality care. CGs currently face difficult decisions about PWD participation in clinical
trials. They will increasingly need to make decisions about using new therapeutics and be asked to help monitor
PWD disease progression, treatment compliance, and treatment efficacy. Thus, the argument for integrating CGs
for PWDs with a wide range of diagnoses into dementia research is compelling.
Approach. From the new participants entering the PPG over the five-year project period, we will recruit a
subsample of LMM PWD-CG dyads and NO functionally intact controls selected to maximize diversity in CG
ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status (SES), and PWD diagnosis. Emotional functioning in CGs and PWD-
CG dyads will be assessed initially in our Berkeley laboratory and repeated at two annual follow-ups conducted
in participants’ homes. Combining these data with data from other PPG cores and projects, we will address two
aims.
Aim I: CG health. We will explore: (a) Trajectories. Characterize CG health trajectories and influences of
moderators (i.e., PWD diagnosis; CG sex, ethnicity, and genetics); (b) Predictors. Determine associations
between changes in PWD health and functioning, CG functioning, and external resources and changes in CG
health and influences of moderators; (c) Mediator. Determine how changes in the PWD-CG relationship explain
associations between predictors and changes in CG health; and (d) Optimal measures. Determine optimal
measures (observational measures; self, clinician, and informant ratings) for predicting changes in CG health.
Aim L: CG attitudes towards trials and therapeutics. Paralleling Aim L, we will explore: (a) Trajectories.
Characterize CG attitude trajectories and influences of moderators (i.e., PWD diagnosis; CG sex, ethnicity,
genetics); (b) Predictors. Determine associations between changes in PWD health and functioning, CG
functioning, and external resources and changes in CG attitudes and influences of moderators; (c) Mediator.
Determine how changes in the PWD-CG relationship explain associations between predictors and changes in
CG attitudes; and (d) Optimal measures. Determine optimal measures for predicting changes in CG attitudes
toward trials and therapeutics.
Significance. Research findings from Project E can inform future efforts to assess risk in CGs and design
interventions to protect CG and PWD health and increase engagement in trials and therapeutics."
10762946,"Gastrointestinal issues are extremely common in neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), and alterations of the gut microbiome and intestinal epithelial barrier have been reported in recent studies.
Environmental toxicant exposures early in life are increasingly implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such
as ASD, including air pollution. There is strong evidence that particulate matter (PM) in air pollution significantly
impacts the gut microbiome and gut function of directly-exposed humans and rodents. Less characterized is if
PM exposure to pregnant females alters the gut microbiome of offspring, though this is likely given evidence that
the maternal gut microbiome sets the trajectory of the newborn microbiome, especially with a vaginal delivery.
To study the impact of environmental pollutants on autism-like behaviors in mice, we developed a novel model
combining prenatal diesel exhaust particle (DEP) exposure throughout pregnancy with maternal stress (MS)
during the last trimester of gestation. Maternal stress is linked to autism in several recent studies, which may be
most harmful for populations made vulnerable by other factors. We have demonstrated that combined prenatal
DEP + MS produce striking communication and social deficits early in life, and persistent cognitive deficits and
increased anxiety into adulthood, in male but not female offspring. Our preliminary data also show significant
changes in the composition of gut bacteria and gut structural changes in male offspring exposed prenatally to
DEP/MS compared to unexposed controls. Our goal is to test the hypothesis that gut microbiome changes in
pregnant dams following combined environmental exposures are transmitted to newborn offspring and underlie
the persistent behavioral abnormalities. Together these studies will: (1) fully characterize the impact of prenatal
environmental toxicant (DEP) exposure on maternal and offspring microbiome development, (2) ascribe causality
among microbiota changes, gut epithelial structure/function and inflammation, and behavioral abnormalities in
offspring, and (3) establish the critical window(s) in which microbiome changes in offspring can be prevented or
reversed using interventions at birth vs. post-weaning. If successful they will significantly advance our
understanding of the emergence and causal link between gut dysbiosis and behavioral/brain dysfunction in
devastating disorders such as autism, and the role of environmental toxins in inducing these changes, as well
as suggest a potential therapeutic option and window for treatment."
10900569,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Fibrosis and scarring from injury and disease costs $20 billion annually to treat in the US, and even when treated
remains a persistent problem that significantly diminishes quality of life. The use of autologous adipose
micrografts used in reconstructive surgeries appears beneficial for reducing scar. Furthermore, intradermal
adipocytes have also recently gained attention for their role in the early stages of normal wound healing. The
objective of this proposal is to determine how human adipocyte lineage cells impact fibroblast-myofibroblast
conversion and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in a healing wound. Our long-term goal is to engineer
more effective and improved clinical therapies for wound healing. To achieve this objective, we propose three
aims that are designed to unravel the communication between adipose lineage cells and fibroblasts. In Aim 1,
we will determine how secreted factors from adipocyte linage cells regulate fibroblast-myofibroblast conversion,
phenotype, and ECM remodeling. We hypothesize that adipocyte lineage cells differentially regulate inhibition,
induction, and reversal of fibroblast to myofibroblast conversion, which in turn impacts the composition of the
ECM produced. We also hypothesize that adipokine-induced myofibroblasts (compared to TGF-β1-induced
myofibroblasts) produce distinct ECM that results in less scaring. We will test these hypotheses and identify how
one-way communication from adipocyte lineage cells regulates fibroblast-myofibroblast activity using a
myofibroblast conversion assay coupled with fractionation, proteomics, computational genomics, and
inhibition/add-back assays. In Aim 2 we will determine how adipocyte lineage cells coordinate with fibroblasts to
remodel ECM. We hypothesize that reciprocal communication between adipocyte lineage cells and fibroblasts-
myofibroblasts impacts wound healing by altering cell activity and the composition of the ECM proteins produced
by both fibroblasts and adipocyte lineage cells. We will use our 3D adipose spheroids and our 3D in vitro models
to interrogate the interactions between the relevant cell types and the composition and mechanics of the ECM
produced. In Aim 3, we will complement the in vitro work of Aims 1 and 2 by determining how transplantation of
adipocyte lineage cells alter fibroblast behavior and ECM remodeling in a porcine wound model. We hypothesize
that wound bed fibroblasts will differentially respond to adipose-based treatments depending on the cellular
composition delivered. We will test this hypothesis by assessing the effect of transplanted adipose stem cells,
preadipocytes, or adipocytes on fibroblast/myofibroblast behavior and wound healing. Successful completion of
these aims will substantially improve our understanding of adipose-fibroblast interactions that will be critical for
the development of more effective and improved clinical therapies for wound healing."
10818636,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers are common among young adults. Young adults put themselves at
increased risk for skin cancers due to their tanning habits and inconsistent use of recommended sun protection
methods. Existing interventions for young adults have relied on a one-size-fits-all approach primarily using
appearance-focused appeals examining short-term outcomes, and have not examined potential moderators of
intervention effects. We designed a skin cancer prevention intervention for college students that incorporates
different types of personalized skin cancer risk information (ultraviolet photo showing underlying skin damage,
MC1R testing indicating genetic risk for skin cancer, action planning) to increase receptivity to personalized
risk information and to facilitate decreased tanning and increased use of sun protection. Our study is guided by
the Elaboration Likelihood Model; as such we posit that intervention components will improve outcomes by
increasing central processing of highly personally relevant risk and behavioral planning information. In our
preliminary studies of these intervention components, we observed decreases in tanning behaviors and
increases in sun protection pre- to post-intervention. We propose to apply a Multiphase Optimization Strategy
to identify which of the proposed components or their combinations optimally prevent sunburn, and
secondarily, which elements discourage tanning and increase use of sun protection in college students over
longer term intervals (12+ months). Through a full factorial experiment, we will examine the effects of three
personalized risk components: 1) UV photo; 2) MC1R genetic testing results; 3) action planning. We will
explore socio-demographic and behavioral moderators of the intervention effects in order to inform the
development of future deeply-tailored, optimized adaptive interventions. This project addresses the critical
need for efficacious skin cancer preventive interventions for young adults in the college setting. The project will
also lead to new scientific understanding of moderators of the intervention effects, which will lead to more
deeply tailored interventions that better meet the needs of all young adults."

inhibitors to undruggable oncoproteins using artificial intelligence (AI). Both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are cancers that start in lymphocytes, which are part of the body’s immune system.
The main difference between Hodgkin lymphoma and NHL is in the specific lymphocyte each involves: in the
presence of abnormal cells called Reed-Sternberg cells, the lymphoma is classified as Hodgkin’s; otherwise, it
is classified as NHL. NHL is the most common blood cancer and causes over 20,000 deaths every year in the
United States. There are about 90 types of NHL, which usually develop when mutations occur within a
lymphocyte. The gene MYD88 encodes myeloid differentiation primary response 88 protein, a critical universal
adapter with essential functions in inflammation and immunity. Following stimulation of toll-like receptors,
MYD88 transduces the signal to activate genes responsible for innate and adaptive immune responses.
MYD88 is a driver oncogene that is frequently mutated in B-cell NHLs. The most frequent missense
mutation is L265P, which changes leucine at position 265 to proline and accounts for ~90% of all MYD88
mutations. MYD88 L265P is found in ~90% of Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM, a rare NHL), >50% of
primary extranodal lymphomas, and ~29% of activated B-cell diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). WM is
considered incurable. DLBCL can be cured in about 40% of the patients, but those with MYD88 L265P have
poorer survival than those without. BCM collaborates with Atomwise, the inventor of the first deep learning AI
technology based on neural networks and a leader in AI-assisted drug discovery, to virtually screen 2.7 million
compounds. We identified scores of AI-selected compounds targeting a binding site near L265P in MYD88. We
validated these hits by evaluating their inhibition of MYD88 L265P ubiquitination and xenograft tumorigenesis.
One compound attenuated lymphoma growth from NHL cells with MYD88 L265P, but not that with WT MYD88.
We hypothesize that adaptor oncoproteins such as MYD88 L265P can be targeted by AI. In this
application, we propose two specific aims to develop drug candidates that target MYD88 L265P for NHL
therapy. In Aim 1, we will use AI to virtually screen billions of compounds to discover novel drug candidates
targeting a binding site near L265P in MYD88. In Aim 2, we will optimize validated hit compounds targeting
MYD88 L265P. Data generated from this partnership will provide a solid scientific platform for therapeutic
development targeting the oncogenic MYD88 L265P while sparing WT MYD88, which is critical for both innate
and adaptive immunity. This work addresses the unmet clinical need to target MYD88 L265P directly and
advances drug development against mutation-specific drivers."
10756511,"ABSTRACT
Rotator cuff tears are prevalent, particularly in the elderly population, and typically require surgical repair to
regain shoulder function. Unfortunately, successful repair remains a major clinical challenge, with high post-
operative failure rates. At the root of these failures is poor healing at the repaired tendon-to-bone interface, which
does not regenerate the native tendon enthesis attachment structures. Specifically, the healthy tendon enthesis
consists of a transitional tissue with spatial gradations in composition (e.g., mineral content) and cell phenotype
(e.g., tenocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts), which provides a strong and tough attachment to transfer
muscle load from tendon to bone. To address the critical clinical need to improve outcomes after tendon-to-bone
repair, this project brings together a multidisciplinary research team to develop, validate, and translate a novel
class of biomimetic scaffolds for enhancing healing. The team is led by Dr. Thomopoulos (MPI, an expert in
tendon-to-bone development, pathology, and repair) from Orthopedics and Biomedical Engineering at Columbia
University and Dr. Xia (MPI, an expert in materials science and nanotechnology) from Biomedical Engineering
at Georgia Tech. Key compositional and structural features of the natural tendon-to-bone attachment will be
directly fabricated in Aim 1 or generated by stem cells provided with the appropriate cues in Aim 2. The first
(acellular) approach has the benefit of high throughput and off-the-shelf availability whereas the second (cellular)
approach has the advantage of a responsive extracellular matrix generating component. Funnel-shaped
microchannels will be laser drilled through the depth of the scaffolds to encourage cell migration and extracellular
matrix deposition, and thus alleviate the concern that the interposed scaffold will be a barrier to healing between
the tendon and bone. These two designs will be independently fabricated and evaluated in vitro and then tested
in a clinically relevant animal model of rotator cuff injury and repair in Aim 3. Reducing the failure rates of rotator
cuff surgical repairs will have a major impact on a large population of patients. The proposed clinically relevant
translational studies have the potential to directly impact the treatment of rotator cuff injuries. Furthermore, the
results will be broadly applicable to connective tissue-to-bone repair in other locations (e.g., ACL reconstruction,
meniscal repair)."
10890577,"PROJECT SUMMARY—Clinical Core (Core B)
The overarching goal of this Program Project Grant (PPG) has been to advance knowledge of the neurological,
cognitive, behavioral, imaging, plasma biomarker, genetic, and neuropathological features of frontotemporal
dementia (FTD). In this renewal, the Administration and Clinical Cores are separated to meet the new scientific,
technological, and leadership demands of this PPG. With renewal, the Clinical Core will oversee the recruitment,
evaluation, and maintenance of cohorts that serve all the PPG cores and projects. New tools and approaches
will be used to translate FG years of discovery into innovative approaches for FTD clinical trials. We will refine
language and emotion symptoms and track their progression with traditional and automated techniques, obtain
accurate antemortem molecular prediction, gain a better understanding of caregiver vulnerability and its influence
on patient outcomes, and understand heterogeneity in FTD progression. The Clinical Core has added faculty
and research staff to focus on inclusion of a more diverse patient population and will add longitudinal
assessments designed to provide effective and scalable biomarkers needed for early diagnosis and monitoring
of treatment strategies. We will leverage tools and procedures developed as a response to the COVID-MN
pandemic to implement a hybrid model of in-person and remote, web-based assessment that will increase
recruitment, favor retention, and minimize patient and caregiver burden. The specific aims of the Clinical Core
are: Aim M. Recruit and longitudinally evaluate RFS new patients with FTD-spectrum disorders and their family
caregivers, patients with language and non-language variants of Alzheimer’s disease, and functionally intact
healthy controls, with renewed effort to include individuals from underrepresented groups. Aim F. Ensure a
comprehensive, standardized, quantifiable, and innovative clinical evaluation of each subject that includes
remote and in-person measurements. Aim V. Obtain three annual hybrid in-person and remote assessments.
The Clinical Core will continue to influence the landscape of FTD research and clinical care by providing the
best-characterized and largest single-site cohort of patients in the world."
10788311,"CARDIOVASCULAR PHENOTYPING CORE B SUMMARY
The primary goal and function of Core B is to provide services to the individual projects within the Program
Project related to measures of cardiovascular function. The objective of Core B is to serve basic support
services separated into three functional areas: 1) 24-hour blood pressure analysis in rodent models; 2)
ambulatory and clinic blood pressure measurements and validation in human participants; and 3) pulse wave
velocity and pulse wave analysis assessments in human subjects. We will also monitor quality control and
reproducibility in cardiovascular measurements in both animal models and human subjects for maximum
efficiency and rigor. Core B is structured to provide the highest degree of quality control and allow for
consistency across all of the individual projects of the Program Project. This involves very closely coordinated
efforts and sharing of expertise between the projects. Drs. David Pollock and Eric Judd will oversee Core B.
Dr. Pollock has many years of experience coordinating large scale in vivo studies in rodents with over 20 years
of conducting chronic blood pressure measurements by telemetry. Dr. Judd has directed a wide range of
cardiovascular phenotyping studies in human subjects for over 10 years. This includes ambulatory blood
pressure monitoring, vascular stiffness measurements via pulse wave velocity and pulse wave analysis. Core
services will be tightly maintained with weekly contacts by email and monthly meetings to discuss how well
Core B is functioning to meet the needs of the PPG and any issues that may have developed. The aims of
Core B are: 1) Provide circadian analysis of 24-hour telemetry data in rodent models, 2) Provide frequency and
time domain analysis for assessment of autonomic function in rodent models, 3) Provide supervision of clinic
and ambulatory blood pressure measurements and consistent data acquisition and analysis, 4) Perform pulse
wave velocity assessments, 5) Liaison with Core C to provide statistical analysis of cardiovascular data, and 6)
Liaison with Core A to facilitate data storage."
10772999,"PROJECT 1 – TARGETING ONCOGENIC TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS
PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA-binding transcription factors have exceptional specificity as cancer drivers and dependencies, but these
targets lack deep hydrophobic cavities that allow for drug discovery. Hence, there is striking lack of pharmacology
for modulating such targets in our arsenal of cancer therapies. The main objective of Project 1 is to reveal
therapeutically-relevant mechanisms involving the oncogenic transcription factors KLF5 and TEAD:YAP/TAZ,
which are strong dependencies in carcinomas of the breast and pancreas while being dispensable for tissue
homeostasis. This Project has applied the latest innovations in genetic screening technology to discover novel
interactions involving these onco-transcription factors. Our objectives will now be to elucidate these mechanisms
with maximum precision and explore how such mechanisms can be leveraged to develop novel pharmacology.
Aim 1 will focus on exploring the link between TEAD:YAP/TAZ and the poorly understood kinases MARK2/3.
Using paralog co-targeting `double knockout' screening, we have discovered that MARK2/3 catalytic function is
selectively essential in YAP/TAZON cancer cells. Our epigenomic and epistasis experiments indicate that the
essential function of MARK2/3 in cancer is to sustain TEAD:YAP/TAZ function. In this aim, we will employ an
organoid biobank to rigorously evaluate the YAP/TAZ activity as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity to catalytic
MARK2/3 inhibition. In addition, we will use `bump-and-hole' chemical-genetic tools, peptide-based inhibitors,
and epistasis experiments to reveal the critical substrates of MARK2/3 in the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway that
account for its cancer maintenance function. The mechanistic research outlined in Aim 1 will test the hypothesis
that chemical modulation of MARK2/3 can exploit the addiction of carcinoma cells to the TEAD:YAP/TAZ
complex. Aim 2 focuses on the zinc finger protein KLF5, which is major driver and dependency in pancreatic and
breast cancer. Using an innovative marker-based genetic screening strategy, we have identified several novel
cofactor ligands of KLF5, including both transcriptional coactivators as well as RNA splicing factors. We will
perform rigorous biochemical and genetic experiments to definitively demonstrate whether KLF5 requires direct
binding these cofactors to execute its essential function in cancer. Such interactions might serve as opportunities
for developing orthosteric inhibitors of KLF5 function. In addition, we will collaborate with the other Projects to
identify vulnerabilities of the KLF5 mRNA using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). Organoid models will be
employed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of several ASO-based targeting strategies that modulate KLF5
expression or splicing. Collectively, this Project features a unique ensemble of technologies and hypotheses in
pursuit of a major objective in molecular oncology: to overcome `undruggable' targets."
10890586,"PROJECT SUMMARY—BIOSPECIMENS CORE (Core G)
Fluid biomarkers hold great promise for improving early and accurate diagnosis, symptom monitoring,
prognostication, and measuring treatment effects for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Over the past 19 years,
the UCSF PPG Biospecimens sub-core (as part of the Neuropathology Core) has successfully collected, banked,
and shared human biofluid specimens from over 2,000 research participants. In parallel, we have leveraged the
strength of the UCSF neurodegenerative disease research community and multiple public-private collaborations
to build infrastructure in fibroblast banking to enable induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) preparation. This newly
proposed Biospecimens Core will synergize these resources to support this PPG's mission of improving the early
and accurate diagnosis and tracking the progression of FTD. The Biospecimens Core will be led by Dr. Adam
Boxer, a leader in neurodegenerative fluid biomarker development. He also co-directs the ALLFTD Consortium
(U19AG063911) including its Biofluids Core. Serving as Co-Leader will be Dr. Aimee Kao, a neurologist-
physician-scientist whose research focuses on the basic pathophysiological mechanisms underlying FTD,
Alzheimer's Disease, and related disorders. She brings experience and expertise in fibroblast and iPSC culture
and banking, and she serves as Lead of the UCSF ADRC Biomarker Core. We propose three aims. In Aim 1,
this Biospecimens Core will work with the Data Management and Biostatistics Core to support the Clinical Core
with blood, CSF, and epithelial fibroblast collection from research participants. In Aim 2, the Biospecimens Core
will provide measures of established fluid biomarkers such as plasma and/or CSF Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, total tau, P-
tau217, and neurofilament light chain (NfL) as a basis for Amyloid [A], Tau [T], Neurodegeneration [N]
classification of all participants. Aim 3 will support the PPG projects and work towards discovery and validation
of novel biomarkers through establishment of proteomic and lipidomic datasets and collection of FTD epithelial
fibroblasts, thus enabling iPSC line generation. Information will be iteratively shared with the Neuropathology
Core to drive scientific insights into disease pathophysiology. This Biospecimens Core will also collaborate with
the Imaging Core on development of novel neuroimaging measures in conjunction with validation of new plasma
diagnostic biomarkers. By leveraging established agreements with the National Centralized Repository for
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), this Biospecimens Core will continue to bank and share
a large longitudinal collection of exquisitely well-characterized patient and control biospecimens, positioning this
core to support research projects locally, nationally, and internationally."
10890602,"PROJECT SUMMARY—Heterogeneity in FTD Clinical Trials: New Mechanisms and Measures (Project 4)
Clinical trials in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) depend on robust and reliable tracking of disease over time.
Although all variants of FTD show measurable longitudinal decline, heterogeneity across FTD patients, and FTD
subtypes, poses a significant challenge for clinical trials. Rates of decline differ significantly across patients,
impacting power for trials. In addition, our group has noted that, despite fairly linear reductions in brain volume
in FTD over time, rates of clinical decline can vary dramatically across patients. One potentially important
contributor to this phenomenon is cognitive resilience (CR), which can be defined as the degree to which a
person’s clinical status remains better than predicted by measures of neurodegeneration, such as MRI. CR is a
naturally-occurring phenomenon evident in aging and several neurodegenerative diseases, yet it has been
understudied in FTD. Prior studies have identified a number of factors, including several modifiable lifestyle
behaviors, that influence CR, and preliminary data from our group and others suggest that several of these,
including sex, variation in the TEM106B gene, and exercise, may influence CR and rates of clinical decline in
FTD. A major goal of this project will be to identify the major factors, including modifiable behaviors, that influence
CR in FTD, and to create multifactor models for predicting who will decline more rapidly or slowiy, which can be
used for planning clinical trials. In addition, variation in symptom profiles across patients, even those who harbor
the same underlying proteinopathy, is another factor hindering trials in FTD. An individual affected by one of the
major FTD proteinopathies, TDP-43 or tau, can manifest behavioral, language, and/or motor symptoms. Thus,
another goal of this project will be to develop a new outcome measure, based on an approach called Goal
Attainment Scaling (GAS), for FTD clinical trials. GAS establishes individualized clinical outcomes based on
participant and caregiver ratings of the most troublesome symptoms, and is therefore ideal for trials of protein-
specific interventions that would enroll patients with a variety of clinical syndromes. To accomplish these goals,
we will leverage the baseline and longitudinal clinical, imaging, and biomarker data collected across the PPG
cores and examine the relationship between our hypothesized predictors, including genetic variants, exercise,
sleep, and vascular health, on CR over time. We will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Determine the
influence of inherited and modifiable factors on CR in FTD; Aim 2. Determine the brain network physiology
associated with CR in FTD; Aim 3. Identify molecular markers that influence CR in FTD; Aim 4. Determine the
optimal combination of predictors that best account for CR in FTD; Aim 5. Develop Goal Attainment Scaling
(GAS) for FTD clinical trials. The new tools for prediction and new outcome measures emerging from this project
will help speed the development of disease modifying interventions for FTD."
10767303,"Program Summary/Abstract
The overall goal of this research is to understand how organisms safely break their own DNA. DNA double-
strand breaks (DSBs) are highly hazardous lesions whose improper repair can cause loss of heterozygosity
and copy-number variations, leading to numerous psychiatric and developmental disorders, as well as cancers.
Despite these risks, most eukaryotes introduce programmed DSBs into their genomes at one or more points in
their life cycle. These breaks occur in the soma and the germ line and function to create genetic diversity,
remove unwanted DNA, and support adaptation to changing environments.
Cells go to great lengths to keep programmed DSBs safe. They control the location and timing of DSBs,
promote correct repair-template choice, and use surveillance mechanisms to coordinate DSB formation with
other cellular processes, including cell-cycle progression. Defects in any of these layers of control leave
organisms with a higher risk of genome instability, and thus provide key insights into the genome instability
associated with cancers and the chromosomal abnormalities that lead to birth defects and infertility.
To investigate safe DSB formation, the proposed work focuses on two highly conserved instances of
developmentally induced DNA breakage: (1) meiotic recombination, which involves hundreds of DSBs per
meiotic germ cell, and (2) programmed copy-number changes in the ribosomal DNA (rDNA), the most highly
expressed gene locus in eukaryotes. The proposed work uses genetics, molecular biology, and genomics to
investigate these processes. Most of the work is conducted in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but
conservation of rDNA copy-number control is also tested in human cell lines.
To investigate meiotic DSBs, research over the next 5 years will build on results of a phospho-proteomics
screen to dissect the surveillance network that coordinates many meiotic processes with DSB formation.
Experiments will also define the role of chromosome architecture in making DSB hotspots hot, and a genome-
wide approach will be developed to measure meiotic repair-template choice across the genome.
To analyze copy-number dynamics in the rDNA, research will focus on the mechanisms that drive re-
expansion of critically short rDNA clusters and investigate the role of a novel DNA repair intermediate in this
process. In addition, the proposed work will investigate the spreading of genetic variants among repeats of an
rDNA cluster over evolutionary time scales and upon selection in the laboratory.
Together, these analyses will provide fundamental insights into the dynamics of developmentally induced
DSBs, open avenues for understanding how these endogenous processes contribute to genomic plasticity in
health and disease."
10765709,"Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder primarily affecting girls. In its classical form, RTT
is predominantly caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP2). MeCP2 is
a multifunctional regulator of gene expression which regulates transcription through diverse mechanisms such
as DNA-binding, interaction with transcription factor complexes, modulation of chromatin structure and regulation
of miRNAs – mechanisms that are engaged pleiotropically through different developmental stages. MeCP2 was
considered to act predominantly through late development into adulthood, but recent clinical studies of RTT
children point to very early signs of the disorder. The early developmental mechanisms of MeCP2 are poorly
understood. We previously used RTT patient iPSCs to show that reduction of MeCP2 leads to overexpression
of miRNA-199 and miRNA-214, an increase in neural progenitors, and reduction in neurogenesis and neuronal
migration in cortical organoids. We now propose to analyze the migration deficits in detail, and examine the
mechanisms underlying the deficits. The objective of this proposal is to develop a novel live-cell imaging platform
merging 3D stem cell technologies, microfluidics and multiphoton microscopy, and combine it with state-of-the-
art molecular approaches, including mass spectrometry proteomics and single cell RNA sequencing, to examine
mechanisms of neuronal migration deficits associated with RTT-causing mutations in MECP2. In Aim 1, we
propose to develop label-free third-harmonic generation three-photon microscopy and use it to characterize
neuronal migration deficits in RTT organoids compared to isogenic controls. We will additionally develop a
microfluidics-based live imaging platform where organoids can be stably imaged and neurons tracked for days.
In Aim 2, we will examine the consequence of MECP2 mutations on downstream molecular pathways involved
in neuronal differentiation and migration. We will examine mechanisms of anomalous overexpression of AKT in
RTT organoids and neural progenitors, and use a proteomic and phospho-proteomic screen to define new
proteins and pathways of neuronal migration dysregulated in RTT. We will exploit the transcriptomic profile of
single cells to reveal cell types, populations and transcriptomic differences between RTT and control organoids.
In Aim 3, we will use the technologies of Aim 1, and results of Aim 2, to examine the role of implicated signaling
pathways in neuronal migration. We will interrogate the function of AKT and downstream signaling molecules,
and that of new proteins, including modulators of cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization identified from our
screens, that are predicted as involved in migration. We will validate in vivo in mice the ability of specific pathways
and focal adhesion proteins to rescue RTT neuronal migration deficits. Together, we expect that these results
will advance our understanding of mechanisms involved in deficits of early cortical development in RTT, and
suggest potential novel therapeutics targeting these stages."
10881645,"Project Summary
The overall goal of this application is to continue and expand operation of the National Swine
Resource and Research Center (NSRRC). The NSRRC is halfway through its 19th year of
operation, and it has successfully developed the infrastructure needed to assist swine-based
research across multiple disciplines. The NSRRC has developed new models of human disease
by genetic engineering, it has recruited models created by others, and it has distributed
expertise, cells, tissues, organs, and pigs to investigators throughout the United States and
Europe. Since genetic engineering of pigs requires specialized facilities and expertise, the
NSRRC provides invaluable services to the research community by creating new genetically
engineered swine models. The NSRRC also provides training and education by interacting with
individuals, publishing manuscripts and sponsoring workshops and meetings that promote the
use of pigs for studying human diseases. The NSRRC has a state-of-the-art building with high
biosecurity, to house animals free of specific pathogens. The Specific Aims for the upcoming
grant period are as follows:
1. To operate the National Swine Research and Resource Center. Functions of the NSRRC will
continue to include: a) importation of existing swine models of human health and disease, b)
rederivation of pigs to eliminate specific pathogens, and health monitoring to assure
maintenance of a specific pathogen-free status, c) cryopreservation and storage of gametes,
embryos and somatic cells to prevent future loss of valuable models, d) distribution of expertise,
reagents, cells, tissues, organs and pathogen-free pigs, and e) creation of new genetically-
engineered pigs needed by the biomedical research community. Rigorous quality control will
ensure that only high-quality genetics are distributed.
2. To perform innovative research that will benefit the NSRRC and the biomedical research
community. Applied research projects are aimed at improving: a) the cryopreservation of pig
reproductive cells and tissues, and b) the development of improved methods for the production
of genetically-engineered pigs. The NSRRC will also serve as a site for training and educational
activities related to research employing swine models."
10782454,"Project Summary
The goal of this proposal is to identify how Toll-like Receptors (TLRs) stimulate diverse cellular responses in
macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), and to understand how these responses influence DC-based cancer
immunotherapies. The ability of TLRs to induce inflammatory gene expression has been under investigation for
twenty years, with distinct signaling pathways mediated by the MyD88 and TRIF adaptors explaining all
transcriptional responses. It has only recently become appreciated that TLRs also drive metabolic changes in
responding cells, such as the rapid induction of aerobic glycolysis. During the previous funding period, we
discovered that the TLR-induced myddosome complex contains two classes of proteins. One class is necessary
for myddosome assembly (e.g. MyD88) and represents the core of this signaling structure. The second class is
not necessary for myddosome assembly (e.g. TRAF6), but rather operates to recruit enzymes that diversify the
effector functions of the myddosome. Specifically, we identified the kinase TBK1 as a myddosome component
that is recruited by TRAF6 and is dedicated specifically to induce glycolysis. The myddosome therefore serves
as a subcellular site of signals that activate diverse cellular responses. Our understanding of how these activities
are regulated in vitro and their impact on T cell mediated protective immunity remains limited.
In addition to the myddosome, select TLRs (e.g. TLR4 and TLR3) engage the triffosome. The central triffosome
regulator is TRIF, which stimulates interferon (IFN) responses, NF-kB and MAPK activation, necroptosis and
glycolysis. While the importance of TRIF in immunity has long-been recognized, the means by which it activates
these diverse responses is unclear. This gap in knowledge is not merely an academic curiosity, as TRIF is
essential for the ability of the LPS receptor TLR4 to stimulate adaptive immunity. Understanding regulatory
events that stimulate myddosome- and TRIF-dependent responses will enable discussions of how TLRs drive
protective immunity against infection and cancer. In this application, we propose to explore myddosome
activities in vitro and in the context of cancer immunotherapies (Aim 1). In Aim 2, we offer an innovative synthetic
biology-based approach to define the mechanisms of TRIF signaling and how these mechanisms relate to those
induced by complementary innate immune pathways. Our focus on the two major signaling pathways activated
by TLRs should provide an operational view of this important family of receptors."
10756532,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant type of brain tumor, with a median survival time of 15 months.
Despite advances in cancer survival for many malignancies, GBM survival rates still remain low and have not
significantly changed over the last 30 years, emphasizing the urgent need for new treatment options. One of
the common hallmarks of cancer is splicing perturbations and alternatively spliced genes are an interesting
new source for potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Current methodologies to characterize
splicing in tumors using mRNA sequencing can only indicate that alternative exons are transcribed, but
additional validation is needed to verify that these spliceforms produce functional proteins. Our preliminary
results comparing paired tumor/normal samples indicate that alternative splicing in GBM affects many more
genes than previously expected, both at the transcript and protein levels. Based on these data, we hypothesize
that a set of alternatively spliced genes are involved in tumor initiation and GBM pathogenesis. In this proposal,
we will use a combination of precision medicine approaches to detect and quantify tumor-specific alternative
splicing events in GBMs. We will verify that these events produce distinct proteoforms using splicing-aware
proteogenomics experiments. Finally, we will functionally characterize differentially expressed splice isoform
candidates for their effects on growth, apoptosis, and invasion in patient-derived glioma stem cells. If
successful, this work will lead to new understanding of the biological impact of novel GBM proteoforms, and
potentially lead to novel approaches to treatment of GBM based on unique tumor antigens and molecular
pathways."

The Immunobiology Program (IMB) serves as a rich resource for the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) in
advancing an understanding of immunobiology and immunotherapy of cancer. The Program aims to: 1)
Understand the fundamental aspects of immune biology, including leukocyte activation, differentiation,
inactivation, and transformation as these relate to cancer; 2) Forge a comprehensive understanding of tumor
immune surveillance using state-of-the art in vitro, animal model, and human experimental systems; and 3)
Guide translation of novel clinical strategies for immunotherapy of cancer by leading or collaborating on human
clinical trials. Established in 1974, this Research Program received “Exceptional” merit at the time of the last
CCSG renewal application. The Program co-Leaders (PLs) are Warren Pear, MD, PhD, an expert in the
molecular biology of leukocyte development and malignant transformation and E. John Wherry, PhD, a leader
in tumor immunology, immune exhaustion and immunotherapy. Drs. Pear and Wherry are experienced, NCI-
funded investigators who are highly collaborative and whose research interests span the realm of basic and
translational science. There are 39 Program members from nine departments and three schools with long-
standing intra- and inter-Programmatic collaborations spanning the basic, clinical, and population science
Programs. Members include international leaders in basic immunology, tumor immunobiology and translational
immunotherapy who have driven landmark breakthroughs such as molecularly defining T cell exhaustion,
dissecting the biologic response to checkpoint inhibition, and developing CAR T cells that revolutionized
cellular therapy for cancer. IMB collaborates extensively with other Programs for clinical translation and
biomarker discovery. For example, CART19 T cells were designed in IMB then translated to the clinic with
members of the Hematologic Malignancies and Pediatric Oncology Programs in studies that led to two FDA-
approved indications. The PLs facilitate interactions through multiple weekly seminars and meetings,
promotion of collaborative grants and projects, two annual research retreats, pilot project grants, and training
programs. During the current project period, PLs recruited 11 new Full members, expanded important forums,
facilitated new collaborative grants, initiated new ACC-wide initiatives, and were actively involved in decisions
regarding new and existing Shared Resources. Currently, Program members have $24.2M in research grant
funding (annual direct costs), of which $15.1M is peer-reviewed and $4.1M is NCI-funded. The Program holds
38 R01-equivalents. During the current project period, Program members published 468 cancer-related

elucidating biological mechanisms underlying the disease and translating this knowledge to improved
detection, prevention and treatment. BCP members are highly collaborative, working on interconnected
scientific aims that span the continuum from basic science to clinical research. Specific Aims are: 1) Elucidate
the biologic, genetic and molecular mechanisms of breast cancer development and progression; 2) Advance
understanding of genetic susceptibility to optimize screening and prevention for those at risk; 3) Develop
innovative imaging approaches to improve breast cancer screening, detection and biomarkers to guide
treatment and assess therapeutic response, and 4) Translate laboratory discoveries to clinical trials of novel
therapeutics, incorporating biomarkers of response and outcome. Members made fundamental discoveries to
identify breast cancer drivers, mechanisms of tumor dormancy and genome integrity, interferon response, and
the relationship between radiation and immunogenicity. These findings were translated into new targeted
therapeutics, novel combinations, genomic and predictive assays, and cutting-edge imaging methods and
probes. Program members design and implement innovative clinical trials, leading clinical/translational teams
within the ACC, nationally and internationally. In the current funding period, there were 1,386 accruals onto
interventional trials and 14,079 accruals onto non-interventional trials. The complementary skills of Program
co-Leaders (PLs) Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE (clinical trials/biomarkers) and Roger Greenberg, MD, PhD
(basic science/genetics) facilitate intra- and inter- Programmatic collaborations. With clinical translation of basic
science as a major focus, the PLs expanded clinical research units for breast cancer and genetics, grew and
curated large biospecimen banks, and recruited exceptional senior and junior faculty. These developments
have fostered new ideas and collaborations supported by ACC pilot funds. The PLs also initiated two new

advanced solid tumors. CTP accomplishes this goal through three Specific Aims: 1) Translate mechanistic
biologic insights into Phase I trials; 2) Use data from Phase I trials to perform Phase II and Phase III trials to
change clinical practice; and 3) Discover and develop innovative biomarkers that enhance safety and efficacy
of cancer therapies. This Program is co-led by Program Leaders (PLs) Drs. Ravi Amaravadi and Naomi Haas,
both appointed in 2013. Drs. Amaravadi and Haas are NCI-funded researchers who bring highly
complementary scientific visions and a notable depth of experience as accomplished translational researchers.
CTP encompasses a full range of basic, translational, and clinical research. CTP works closely with leaders of
the ACC Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) to understand the cancer burden in the ACC
catchment area and ensure that CTP research addresses the major unmet needs in our catchment area. CTP
members work on improving cancer therapies for patients with advanced, lethal and often highly symptomatic
solid tumors, including lung, prostate and pancreas cancer, as well as melanoma and others. During the
current funding period, the PLs aggressively recruited new junior and senior investigators to CTP, reorganized
the Program into disease-focused groups, and promoted intra-Programmatic interactions through carefully
selected and relevant scientific themes including autophagy, cancer cell metabolism, targeted therapies, and
immunotherapy. These efforts resulted in new multi-investigator grants, including NCI Program Project grants
and SPORES that include CTP members, new leadership positions in National Groups, and an increase in
collaborative publications. Interventional trial accruals were more than 640 per year on average (in CTP alone),
representing an increase compared to the prior funding period; 59% of interventional accruals were on
investigator-initiated trials. Major accomplishments include validating autophagy as a cancer target, translating
basic findings in DNA damage to new therapies in ovarian and pancreatic cancer, determining the
pharmacodynamics of PD-1 therapy in patients with earlier stage melanoma, testing novel immunotherapies
such as monalizumab, CD40 mAb, and CAR T cells in patients with solid tumors, and advancing circulating
DNA as a biomarker of response in lung cancer. The 31 CTP full members and 28 CTP associate members
represent six departments from two schools at Penn. CTP members have $14.7M in annual cancer-related
research grant funding (direct costs), of which $3.1M is NCI-funded and $4.5M is peer-reviewed. This
represents an increase in total funding of $8M (120% increase) since 2015. Our Program has 16 R01-
equivalents. There are 540 cancer-related publications from the Program since 2015. Of these, 19% are intra-
Programmatic, 38% resulted from inter-Programmatic collaborations, and 74% are multi-institutional."
10817950,"ABSTRACT
Cue-driven behaviors are actions motivated by salient environmental stimuli. Maladaptive changes in cue-
driven behaviors are fundamental to several neuropsychiatric disorders, including substance use disorder.
Ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) neurons have often been assumed to homogeneously encode
reward prediction errors. However, even within the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which is the major
projection target of VTA DA neurons, DA release has been implicated in several behavioral functions,
including reward, aversion, motivation, and incentive salience. This discrepancy might be, at least in part,
due to the different methodologies used to record DA cell body activity versus DA release at the axon
terminal level. Additionally, recent investigations suggest that VTA DA neurons might differentially
contribute to reward and aversion dependent on their projection target and mediolateral position within the
VTA. Here, we propose to further detail and define, in a circuit- and cell-type specific manner, the
functional heterogeneity of the mesoaccumbal DA system. We will employ a three-pronged approach that
leverages pharmacological manipulations, fiber photometry-based recordings of DA cell body activity and
DA release, as well as in vivo electrophysiological recordings of DA neurons using Neuropixels and
optogenetics. Our investigations will that takes the precise neuroanatomical position of DA neurons within
the VTA and their corresponding NAc projection target into consideration. Experiments will be performed
in head fixed mice during pharmacological manipulation or during reward seeking behavior as well as in
freely behaving mice performing a two-armed bandit task. This will allow us to test whether DA dynamics
mediated by different mechanisms in different locations (i.e., at the level of cell bodies versus terminals)
underlie distinct behavioral functions. The primary goals are to (1) investigate how different doses of
nicotine modulate DA release in distinct NAc subregions. Additionally, we will provide a systematic
understanding of how nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function contributes to nicotine-induced DA release
in different NAc subregions. (2) We will study how DA cell body activity and DA release in separate
mesoaccumbal subcircuits contributes to reward learning and motivated behavior. (3) We will establish an
in vivo electrophysiological approach that utilizes Neuropixels and optogenetics to record VTA DA neurons
in a circuit- and cell-type specific manner in head fixed mice performing a reward seeking task. Together,
we anticipate that these experiments will provide further evidence for our hypothesis that VTA DA neurons
make specific contributions to reward learning and motivation in a projection-defined manner. Delineating
the precise functions of separate mesoaccumbal DA subcircuits for reward learning and motivated behavior
is a significant step in improving our understanding of their diverse roles in health and disease."
10754917,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this research is to understand how formins shape the architecture and dynamics of the actin
cytoskeleton. Formins are a uniquely versatile family of actin regulatory proteins that stimulate both filament
nucleation and elongation. Actin filaments assembled by formins are incorporated into a diverse set of higher-
order structures that support essential cellular functions, including migration, division, and transport. Mammals
express 15 formin isoforms, each of which possesses unique actin assembly properties and plays a specific
role in cells. Consistent with this specialization, mutations in individual formin genes are linked to a broad
range of diseases and pathologies, including neurological disorders, kidney disease, microcephaly,
cardiomyopathy, and several cancers. However, despite their foundational roles as regulators of actin
assembly, it is unknown how the polymerization activity of each formin isoform is tailored for the assembly of a
specific actin structure. To bridge this gap in understanding, our goal is to establish how the broad range of
formin activities influences actin network physiology and dynamics. Our central hypothesis is that formins direct
the assembly and specialization of higher-order actin structures by generating binding sites for bundling and
severing proteins at isoform-specific rates. We will use a combination of biophysical and cell biological
approaches to test this hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to elucidate the mechanism that
underpins the adaptable polymerization activities of formins, (2) to investigate the effects of formin-mediated
elongation on actin filament bundling, and (3) to assess the interdependent contributions of filament nucleation,
elongation, and turnover to actin structure dynamics. Our work will establish at a molecular level how formins
dynamically regulate the construction, specialization, and function of cytoskeletal structures that are essential
for cellular viability and human development. In light of the diversity of formin isoforms, our results will generate
fundamental insights into the molecular and temporal regulation of a large number of cellular processes. This
will inform and guide our understanding of the molecular pathologies underlying a diverse set of human
diseases linked to mutations in formin genes."
10810855,"Spinal cord injured (SCI) individuals have significantly reduced lifespans compared to the general population, a
statistic that has not changed in 30 years. One reason is “endocrine, metabolic and nutritional diseases”, which
are increasing at alarming rates in the SCI population (2019 Models Systems report). This is evidenced by SCI
individuals having increased prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), the complications of which put them at
a higher risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and stroke compared to the general population. A central
feature of MetS and contributor to morbidity is hepatic pathology in the form of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), a severe form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NASH includes hepatic lipid accumulation
(steatosis) and inflammation, which in turn cause hepatocyte damage and release of pro-inflammatory
mediators. NASH likely facilitates subsequent systems-wide pathology after SCI. Experiments in this proposal
are designed to identify mechanisms that initiate and sustain NASH in acute and chronic SCI. Focus will be on
increased sympathetic input to the liver and consequent intracellular changes in the liver that drive
inflammation and fat accumulation. We hypothesize that excess sympathetic input to the liver after SCI
initiates pro-inflammatory cascades involving TNFa and NFkB, which in turn initiate hepatic fat
accumulation and prolonged inflammation. We will use transgenic mouse technology as well as unbiased -
omics approaches to comprehensively identify cellular changes in the liver induced by SCI that drive
“neurogenic” NASH and subsequent features of MetS. Our long-term goal is to identify therapeutic targets that
can interrupt the dysfunctional spinal cord/liver axis after SCI to restore liver homeostasis and improve overall
metabolic health."
10817207,"Project Summary/Abstract. We seek to establish the Undergraduate Research Initiative for Student
Enhancement (U-RISE) program at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). We use a growth
mindset as a scaffolding for the activities and interventions we propose in this new program. The future of
our nation needs scientific expertise to maintain our current global status and to help overcome the
significant issues that confront humanity. This requires that this nation develops and trains the people who
can solve problems facing us such as new and emergent disease such as Covid-19, including nutrition,
water safety, plant productivity, normal vs. abnormal cellular processes, and mental health. However, not
all sectors of the population have access to opportunities that prepare them to become fully engaged in
the sciences and to lead the scientific enterprise. U.S. citizens and permanent residents belonging to
certain ethnic groups are significantly underrepresented in their participation in the scientific enterprise
(including basic biomedical sciences), technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) as are
economically/socially disadvantaged and disabled people. By doing authentic research and presenting it
we expect students develop a strong self-efficacy and agency as scientists. We will accomplish this through
readings on bias and hegemony that serves to exclude UR students from science. The overarching goal
is to broaden diversity of those participating in basic biomedical research careers. To increase the pool of
high-achieving students, we propose to continue and enhance several levels of intervention, including
Summer Math and Language Arts for a one-month workshop, Science 100, and a new Freshmen seminar
series. Some of these high-achieving students will apply to the mentored research component of the U-
RISE program. The trainees will receive training in responsible conduct in research, molecular biology,
conduct authentic research, advisement, mentoring from PIs and research preceptors, attend U-RISE
seminar series, statistics and research rigor, opportunities to practice critical thinking skills, and
communication. This structured program will ultimately prepare them for graduate school and lead to the
Ph.D. or MD/Ph.D. Historically under represented students are Afro-Americans, Mexican-Americans and
other Latinos, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, Filipinos and Southeast Asians. CSUN also has a large
population of disabled and Pell eligible students. The U-RISE Advisory Committee will select trainees from
these pools. The goal of this research component is to place 70% of students who complete the program
in Ph.D. or MD/Ph.D. programs. In the previous 15 years of MARC U*STAR, program (2004-19), student
persistence in Ph.D. or MD/Ph.D. programs is 88%. We expect similar outcomes from this new U-RISE
program."
10751003,"Overall Summary
A protective vaccine for HIV is arguably the most important prevention strategy to end the global HIV pandemic.
The RV144 trial demonstrated a correlation between protection and envelope (Env) specific serum IgG
antibodies. However, there was a notable lack of HIV-specific neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) and T cell
responses. The DNA platform has several advantages, it is (1) simple to design, (2) can co-deliver molecular
adjuvants, (3) can deliver complex structural antigens, and (4) is safe and well tolerated, even after numerous
boosts. In our previous IPCAVD program we developed DNA-launched nanoparticle (DLNP) vaccines targeting
Env which induced potent and neutralizing immunity in vivo. We have also developed DNA-launched native-like
trimer (DL-NLT) immunogens including the clinically relevant BG505 MD39 trimer (Xu et al. Nat. Comm 2022).
Protein nanoparticles are difficult to manufacture and poorly stimulate CD8+ T cells. We reported that in vivo
assembled nanoparticles drive extremely rapid and strong B and T cell immunity. Functional antibody responses
require help from germinal center (GC) follicular helper T cells (TFH). In previous clinical trials with HIV antigens,
we observed increased B and T cell responses in the presence of plasmid-encoded IL-12 (pIL-12). Work from
members of this team has demonstrated that co-delivery of adenosine deaminase (ADA-1) and plasmid-encoded
IL-21 (pIL-21) can enhance antibody induction in mice in a GC-dependent fashion. Here, we combine the DLNP
and DL-NLT platforms to generate DNLPs bearing stabilized NLTs focusing immune responses on apex and
CD4bs B cell lineage-targeting Envs (DNLP-ACE). We will characterize humoral and cellular immunity to these
constructs in the presence of molecular IL-12 with and without additional GC-targeting adjuvants, in mouse and
non-human primate vaccination studies. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that DLNP-ACE
immunogen technology combined with the co-delivery of genetic adjuvants is a novel approach for the
development of HIV-1 vaccines that promotes robust, durable, broad, and neutralizing antibody
responses, and supports effector T cell function in vivo A key innovation of this project will be to integrate
the selected DNLP-ACE HIV vaccine constructs in a dual expressing plasmid construct with next generation
noninvasive intradermal skin electroporation (EP) devices which promote functional CTL and humoral immune
responses. The clinical development plan for this IPCAVD is directed by a leading HIV vaccine development
organization, Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO), which has expertise in development of synthetic DNA vaccines and
in vivo electroporation delivery. Inovio will oversee clinical grade production of 2 plasmid constructs at a state-
of-the-art cGMP plasmid manufacturing facility. Inovio’s processes have passed rigorous international regulatory
reviews and have been used in dozens of human clinical trials in the U.S., Europe and Asia, including multiple
Phase II and in Phase III studies."
10817065,"All animals need to be resilient to perturbations in their internal and external environments.
Mechanisms that ensure or promote resilience must exist on a large variety of time scales, from
milliseconds to years for long-lived animals such as humans. Moreover, many psychiatric
disorders may be expressed as a lack of resilience to a variety of stresses, so understanding the
fundamental principles and cellular mechanisms that promote resilience in individuals and the
population will provide a set of backbone concepts that will inform our understanding of the loss
of resilience seen in mental illnesses. This computational/theoretical project will explore a
number of hypotheses and potential mechanisms that may contribute to increasing the
resilience of neurons and circuits to perturbation. Specific Aim #1 will explore the hypothesis
that neurons with multiple voltage-dependent currents with overlapping properties will be more
resilient to perturbation than neurons with fewer currents. Specific Aim #2 will characterize
and explore the dynamic range of small reciprocally inhibitory circuits in response to
perturbation. Of particular interest is whether resilience at one level of organization percolates
to the next level. Specific Aim #3 will study a newly refined model of homeostatic tuning of
intrinsic excitability and determine if homeostatic changes in response to a single, short-term
perturbation result in changes of resilience towards repeat presentations of the same
perturbation or qualitatively different perturbations. These studies may provide insight into
how repeated insults “accrue” to produce long-term changes in mental health."
10788309,"ADMINISTRATIVE AND DATA ANALYTICS CORE A SUMMARY
The primary goal of the Administrative and Data Analytics Core is to enhance the research environment and
infrastructure in pursuit of building on the strong synergy between Project Leaders, Core Directors, and all
investigators to ensure cost effective management and integration of the goals of the PPG. The Program Project
Grant funding mechanism is designed to enhance collaborative research and dissemination of new information
that would otherwise not occur. The Administrative and Data Analytics Core has four major aims or
responsibilities. The first is to foster scientific progress and coordination among the various projects and cores,
including professional development and expansion of ideas. This includes coordination of scientific activities,
communication, and travel for the external advisory committee members, organizing and overseeing regular
scientific meetings of the entire research team. These services will be available to all investigators participating
within the framework of the PPG and are designed to improve efficiency, prioritization, resource management
and productivity of the individual projects and maximize the opportunity for synergism among projects and cores.
Secondly, the Administrative and Data Analytics Core will facilitate the various budgetary and business
requirements associated with the PPG. The PPG has the full support of the administration of the sponsor
institution, University of Alabama at Birmingham, and subcontract institution, University of Iowa. Thirdly, the
Administrative and Data Analytics Core will provide the infrastructure for a Biorepository to store samples and
data to facilitate future synergistic and collaborative studies with a state-of-the-art data management system.
Finally, the Administrative Core will provide biostatistical and bioinformatics expertise for each of the projects to
analyze data in standardized and novel approaches."
10814954,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Accumulated damaged DNA, if left unrepaired, may disrupt tissue homeostasis, enabling a milieu favoring
tissue degeneration, cancer, and metabolic dysfunction. DNA damage response and repair pathways are
attenuated with aging and may also result in cell senescence, with senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP) promoting DNA damage and cell proliferation in neighboring cells, or in apoptosis. Non-pituitary growth
hormone (npGH), synthesized locally in peripheral tissues, is recognized by the widely expressed GH receptor
(GHR), and acts through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. Our preliminary results show that npGH is induced
by DNA damage in aged human colon tissues, in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human colon 3D
organoids, in hypophysectomized rat colon lacking endocrine GH, and in senescent colon cells. In turn, npGH
suppresses DNA repair, further reinforcing DNA damage and resulting in chromosomal instability. We propose
a novel hypothesis supporting the role of local epithelial GH as an adverse determinant of age-associated DNA
damage accumulation and as a marker of epithelial aging.
 We will assess npGH induction and DNA damage in aged colon organoids, and Colon Intestine-Chip
microfluidic devices. We will examine npGH expression in human colon tissue specimens derived from age-
determined cohorts, assess spatial genomic profiles in conjunction with cells expressing npGH, and elucidate
npGH as a cause of chromosomal instability. We will explore signaling mechanisms for npGH regulation of DNA
damage response activity, senescence pathways, and DNA damage repair. Epithelial GHR signaling in vitro will
be blocked with the GHR antagonist pegvisomant, a JAK2 inhibitor, and metformin. We will assess npGH actions
in aged tissues derived from colon-specific and universal GHR knockout mice, and in GH overexpressing
transgenic mice, and also assess npGH paracrine effects on colon epithelial somatic copy number alteration
(sCNA) and respective genes affected by sCNA. We will study whether npGH is expressed in senescent cells, and
whether it affects adjacent cell DNA damage and senescence. We will test paracrine npGH effects on senescence
in Colon Intestine-Chip devices co-cultured with human colon fibroblast npGH transfectants, and will confirm
in vitro results in transgenic models overexpressing GH or in GHR knockout mice.
 We largely focus on validated human colon epithelial models, yet experiments in this proposal are designed
to elucidate a universal mechanism whereby local npGH reinforces epithelial age-associated DNA damage
leading to tissue degeneration and or neoplasia."
10768737,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 We hypothesize that pathogenic variants in the family of the nuclear ARS2 genes, encoding mitochondrial
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-aaRSs), cause disease primarily by disrupting nutrient sensing and cell
signaling. Each mt-aaRS is responsible for charging its cognate mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) with its specific
amino acid, as required for the dedicated mitochondrial protein synthesis machinery. Loss-of-function variants
of each ARS2 have been linked to human diseases, showing central nervous system involvement, myopathy,
sensorineural hearing loss, ovarian dysgenesis, and pulmonary hypertension. However, the correlation is poor
between the enzymatic activity of individual variants and manifestation of the disease phenotypes. This suggests
that disease is mediated not necessarily via loss of tRNA charging, but by other functions of mt-aaRSs. Given
that the cytosolic counterpart ARS1 genes are often implicated in non-canonical functions, beyond
aminoacylation, we will test the hypothesis that ARS2s mediate nutrient-sensing and cell-signaling processes
that are disrupted by pathogenic variants resulting in disease development. To test this hypothesis, as a pilot
model, we will generate a human subject-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line with pathogenic
variants in the YARS2 gene, encoding mt-TyrRS. Pathogenic variants of YARS2 result in the MLASA (myopathy,
lactic acidosis and sideroblastic anemia) syndrome. Previous studies of pathogenic YARS2 variants have shown
no appreciable effect on tRNA aminoacylation. Here we focus on a pair of novel compound heterozygous
mutations that we identified in a human subject with neonatal fatal disease, the most severe clinical case
observed to date. This provides a unique model where the largest changes in nutrient sensing and cell signaling
are expected to occur. In Aim 1, we will create an iPSC line from an established fibroblast line of the human
subject. We will use CRISPR/Cas to generate an isogenic control line that corrects the genetic mutations. In Aim
2, we will differentiate the patient and control iPSC lines to disease-relevant cell types. We will focus on myocytes,
as skeletal myopathy is the most notable feature of clinical cases of YARS2 variants. We will also focus on
peripheral neurons, which are affected in most clinical cases of other ARS2 variants. We will identify changes of
gene expression in nutrient sensing or cell signaling of the subject line. Combined, this work will produce an
isogenic pair of subject and control iPSC lines that will be shared with the research community. This pair of iPSC
lines will serve as the foundation for understanding the implications of nutrient sensing and cell signaling in
YARS2 variants, which will provide a template that is generalizable to other ARS2-associated disease."
10758282,"ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to establish the Yucatan minipig as a preclinical animal model for innovative
therapeutics and arthroplasties designed to treat carpal bone pathologies associated with ligament injuries and
severe osteoarthritis (OA). Degenerative and traumatic wrist pain is common, often resulting in activity
restrictions and the inability to work. Ultimately, wrist replacement is the only treatment capable of retaining
wrist function while counteracting the degenerative changes. However, outcomes after wrist arthroplasty
treatment are much poorer than those for the hip, knee, or shoulder. Treatments for wrist osteoarthritis have
evolved much more slowly than these larger joints, due in large part to the lack of study and available data.
The wrist’s complexity also presents a significant challenge, compounded by the lack of a validated preclinical
animal model that can be used to interrogate the consequences of carpal instability and evaluate the ability of
carpal bone replacements to restore carpal function and limit osteoarthritis progression. Preclinical large
animal models have been crucial for the development, translation, and FDA approval of arthroplasty devices
for hips, knees, and spines. With an aging and increasingly active older population, the need for improved
treatments for degenerative wrist pathologies is growing rapidly. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to
establish the Yucatan minipig as a model for carpal bone therapeutics and arthroplasties that are designed to
treat severe osteoarthritis. This goal will be achieved in two independent aims. In the first, we will quantify the
biomechanics of the minipig carpus and the kinematics of the radial carpal bone (RCB) using established in
vitro biomechanical testing. In the second, we will evaluate OA progression in vivo, after induced carpal
instability and after treatment with a carpal bone hemiarthroplasty. In both aims three carpal conditions will be
evaluated, with the intact carpus as a reference: division of the radial intermediate ligament (RIL group),
division of the RIL+dorsal intercarpal ligament (RIL+DIC group), and hemiarthroplasty of the radial carpal bone
(RCBH group). Outcome measures for Aim 1 will include wrist biomechanics and radial carpal bone
kinematics. Outcome measures for Aim 2 will include spatiotemporal measurements of gait and cartilage
health. At the conclusion of this R21 project, we will, for the first time, have fully characterized the
biomechanics of the porcine carpus and we will have established a novel animal model for carpal bone
hemiarthroplasty and innovative therapeutics. This project will advance the treatment of carpal instabilities by
providing a fit-for-purpose animal model capable of evaluating important features of innovative treatments and
arthroplasty designs (e.g., shape, material, finish, bearing surfaces, fixation methods, bone/soft tissue
ingrowth, and wear debris), as well as the broad range of future innovative therapeutics, such as tissue
engineered ligaments, cartilage and osteochondral grafts, and patient-specific 3D printed implants."
10754908,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The major shortcoming of current cancer therapies is the inability to target the leukemic stem cells, despite initial
success in eliminating the bulk of leukemic cells. Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) belongs to the group of
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), the fourth most prevalent hematological malignancy. In the United States,
~100,000 people are living with or in remission from MPNs. The most frequent driver mutation is JAK2V617F. JAK2
inhibitor ruxolitinib remarkably alleviates constitutive symptoms, but does not prolong survival or reverse disease,
which progresses to myelofibrosis or transforms to acute myeloid leukemia. Mouse models and patient data
suggest that this shortcoming is due to its inability to target the JAK2V617F+ stem cell. This application addresses
the urgent need to develop treatments that specifically target JAK2V617F+ stem cells to improve the long-term
outcome of current therapies. Previous work on the SERCA K01 award revealed de-regulated expression of
integrins, adhesion molecules that integrate the extracellular environment with the actin cytoskeleton, in
megakaryocytes of JAK2V617F transgenic mice and PMF patients. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that
1 integrin is a key mediator of JAK2V617F+ stem cell maintenance in PMF. In our most recent preliminary studies,
we found higher activation of 1 integrin in stem cells of JAK2V617F transgenic mice compared to wild-type (WT)
controls. Treatment with an anti-1 integrin inhibitory antibody HM1-1 in vivo was able to dramatically reduce
the number of JAK2V617F+ stem cells, with negligible effect on WT animals. However, it is critical to understand
what makes the JAK2V617F+ stem cells particularly susceptible to 1 integrin inhibition, and whether the stem cell
reduction persists long-term. AIM 1 of this proposal, of mechanistic significance, will define how the anti-1
integrin antibody HM1-1 reduces JAK2V617F+ stem cells in vivo, by addressing two hypotheses: 1) that induction
of cell cycle leads JAK2V617F+ stem cells to exit quiescence and differentiate, and 2) that HM1-1 induces
apoptosis and cell death in JAK2V617F+ stem cells. AIM 2, of translational significance, will address the hypothesis
that JAK2V617F+ stem cell reduction upon HM1-1 treatment persists long-term, and will lead to reduction of all
progeny derived from JAK2V617F+ stem cells. Studies will be performed on JAK2V617F transgenic mice, carrying
the human mutation, using state-of-art flow cytometric analysis of hematopoietic stem cells. Importantly, despite
its essential role in organism development, conditional deletion of 1 integrin in hematopoietic cells of adult mice
did not affect blood cell production or maintenance of stem cells. In contrast, as our data suggest, JAK2V617F+
stem cells seem to be particularly dependent on integrin signaling and highly sensitive to its inhibition, offering a
possible therapeutic opportunity window. This proposal addresses the unmet need of identifying a molecular
target specific to JAK2V617F+ stem cells with potential for therapeutic development. The AIMS of the proposal will
provide important preliminary data which will serve as a basis for mechanistic studies to be proposed in an
ensuing R01 grant application in support of applicant’s independent research career."

10827947,"ABSTRACT. Structural and social inequities have historically impacted the health and wellbeing of Black,
Indigenous and Persons of Color (BIPOC) in the United States, resulting in health disparities that were
exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which coincided with a surge of discriminatory events and hate
crimes targeting minority groups. Emerging research shows that substance use, especially polysubstance use
(PSU), is increasing as a means to cope with the range of stressors and psychological consequences among
BIPOC adults. The extent to which PSU as a maladaptive coping process unfolds and accumulates in the
current context of the pandemic and racial injustice to perpetuate and potentially expand addiction-related
disparities is unknown. Furthermore, the impact of coping responses, resources and resilience factors on these
processes has not been extensively studied in all BIPOC subgroups. In the current proposal, we aim to capture
the nature of daily variation in acute perceived discrimination and to examine how these variations influence
PSU, with emphasis on evaluating predictors of resilience to stress. This information is critical to inform the
design of context-sensitive interventions tailored to momentary circumstances in addition to person-level
variables to prevent maladaptive coping strategies, including PSU. Building on our current user-centered,
smartphone Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) app, we propose to conduct an exploratory-sequential
mixed methods study. In Aim 1, we will use 6-9 focus groups (FGs; N~70) to better understand discrimination
experience and coping resources in the context of intersectionality of race/ethnicity and gender in relation to
PSU to inform context-sensitive EMA, refined during a pilot EMA phase. Subsequently, BIPOC adults who co-
use 2+ substances (N=270) will be recruited through targeted digital ads, and will complete 7-day EMA every 3
months over 4 waves. In Aim 2, a cross-over, within-subject, repeated measure, observational EMA design
will be used, and multi-level logistic regression models will be developed to determine the within-person effects
of perceived discrimination on PSU and identify the underlying mechanisms. In Aim 3, we will model the
prospective association between changes in discrimination and PSU using the multi-wave EMA data to
examine the longitudinal effects of perceived discrimination contexts on changes in PSU among BIPOC adults.
IMPACT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-wave EMA study that uses a social-ecological
framework and a novel, culturally appropriate, real-time assessment design to determine the impact of day-to-
day discrimination and PSU in BIPOC adults. We expect our study to uncover micro-temporal etiologies of
PSU disparities across BIPOC adults that will inform future targeted interventions to ameliorate the effects of
acute perceived discrimination on PSU and reduce addiction-related burdens disproportionately affecting
BIPOC, an urgent aspect of post-pandemic recovery."
10758585,"SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Astrocytes are the most diverse glial cell type and maintain essential interactions with endothelial cells to form
the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB plays a major role in CNS homeostatic function, while dysregulation of
the astrocytic BBB contributes to a spectrum of neurological disorders, ranging from neurodevelopmental and
degenerative diseases to CNS injury and malignancy. Particularly, pathologic astrocyte-BBB interactions
contribute to ischemic stroke, which is the 5th leading cause of death in the U.S. However, the mechanisms
underlying maintenance of BBB integrity, both in health and in diseases such as stroke, remain poorly defined.
The overarching goal of this proposal is to elucidate novel targets and associated signaling pathways influencing
normal astrocyte-BBB function and to leverage this knowledge to define key mechanisms for BBB disruption
after ischemic cerebral stroke. This proposal focuses on an astrocyte-enriched sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter
1, Slc4a4, which was previously identified as a glial-specific regulator of both intracellular and extracellular pH.
While pH homeostasis is essential for brain function and patients carrying Slc4a4 variants can suffer ischemic
stroke, a regulatory role of Slc4a4 in astrocyte-BBB integrity remains unknown. To begin addressing this
knowledge gap, we generated new transgenic mouse lines that temporally ablate Slc4a4 in astrocytes. Using this
genetic mouse model, we showed that loss of Slc4a4 significantly reduces astrocytic morphological complexity
and generates enlarged blood vessels with disrupted endothelial junctions. Our profiling analyses of astrocytic
Slc4a4-deficient mice and conditioned media of Slc4a4 ablated astrocytes revealed increased CCL2 production
and secretion coupled with dysregulated arginine-nitro oxide (NO) metabolism, further supporting a crucial role
for Slc4a4 in astrocyte-BBB integrity. Using an ischemic stroke mouse model, we found loss of Slc4a4 exacerbates
stroke-induced motor dysfunction and increases infarct area coupled with impaired reactive gliosis which results
in BBB disruption, which is rescued by inhibition of CCL2 in vivo. Based on these preliminary data, our central
hypothesis is that Slc4a4 functions to maintain astrocyte-BBB interactions and prevent progressive BBB leakage
in ischemic stroke, in part by inhibiting the chemokine CCL2. To address our hypothesis, we will first determine
how Slc4a4 regulates astrocyte morphology and physiology in the adult brain (Aim 1). Second, we will determine
the role of CCL2 in Slc4a4-dependent BBB maintenance in the adult brain (Aim 2). Upon completion, these
studies will establish whether and how Slc4a4-deficient astrocytes influence anatomical and physiological
properties of astrocytes, and will elucidate how Slc4a4 regulates astrocytic modulation of endothelial cell and
BBB integrity via NO metabolism that drive astrocytic CCL2 signaling in the adult brain. Lastly, we will define
the Slc4a4 pathway in the maintenance of BBB integrity following ischemic stroke (Aim 3). Together, elucidating
the Slc4a4 pathway could reveal fundamental mechanisms controlling astrocyte morphology, physiology, and
secreted molecules, and it will advance our understanding of astrocyte-BBB interactions after stroke."
10889025,"Project Summary
 Ureteral injury represents one of the most serious complications of pelvic surgery, with a majority of these
injuries occurring during gynecological procedures. This injury is particularly problematic during hysterectomies
because of the proximity between the ureter and nearby blood vessels. One barrier to progress is the absence
of clinically available technology to identify relative positions of the ureter, uterine arteries, and tool tips with suf-
ficient depth penetration and image contrast. We previously demonstrated that photoacoustic imaging achieves
simultaneous detection of critical structures with approximately 25-30 dB contrast at centimeter depths, allowing
for complete avoidance of the ureter and better targeting of the uterine arteries. However, to advance this tech-
nology into surgical practice, we need to establish the optical, acoustic, and navigation parameters necessary
to achieve optimal detection of tool tips, blood vessels, and ureters. Optimizing photoacoustic imaging system
designs and providing informative real-time feedback during hysterectomies will enable these surgeries to be
performed without the complications that are typically associated with ureteral injuries, including extensive re-
peat surgeries, complete kidney failure, sepsis, acute renal insufficiency, and patient death. Our long-term goal
is to develop guidance technology to differentiate critical structures in real-time during surgery.
 The overall objective of this proposal is to establish optimal parameters to advance photoacoustic technol-
ogy toward differentiation of ureters, uterine arteries, and tool tips during hysterectomies. Aim 1 of this project
will define the light delivery requirements for optimal visibility of laparoscopic surgical tool tips and underlying
structures. Aim 2 will integrate and optimize sound reception components and parameters for photoacoustic
imaging of the ureter, uterine artery, and tool tips. Aim 3 will pursue in vivo demonstrations of robotic hysterec-
tomy navigation with photoacoustic imaging system components. These three aims will be tested independently
with a combination of simulation, cadaver, swine, and human patient studies, resulting in multiple possibilities for
deploying the proposed technology.
 Successful completion of the proposed project will establish a series of viable photoacoustic imag-
ing system designs to enable ureter avoidance during hysterectomies. This project is innovative because
of the novel integration and refinement of photoacoustic approaches and techniques to distinguish the ureter
from the uterine artery. The project results are anticipated to have a significant impact on patients undergoing
laparoscopic hysterectomies, robotic hysterectomies, and other robotic surgeries (e.g., radical prostatectomies,
thoracic surgeries), with possible extensions to additional surgeries wherein critical structures reside in close
proximity. The proposed research aligns with NIBIB’s mission to accelerate the application of biomedical tech-
nologies by supporting research to advance the development of new tools for visualizing critical structures to
target or avoid during minimally invasive surgeries."
10774289,"Our goal is to elucidate neuroprotective mechanisms of autophagy and harness the knowledge to develop therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is a major catabolic process involving the synthesis, transport, and degradation of autophagosomes, which sequester and recycle large molecular complexes, protein aggregates, and cellular organelles through lysosome pathway. Human neuropathological and genetic studies suggest dysfunctional autophagy-lysosome pathway as a common pathogenic pathway for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). My lab pioneers in the study of autophagy in neurons. We reported the disruption of specific autophagy functions in animal and cell models of AD, PD, and ALS. We and others showed that neuronal autophagy is compartmentalized, and that different neuron types have distinct vulnerability to autophagy deficiency in the brain. Furthermore, basal autophagy is selective and mediated by autophagy receptors. By characterizing dopamine neuron (DA)-specific autophagy knockout and SYNJ1 mutant mice, we showed an interplay between autophagy, synaptic vesicle (SV) trafficking, and regulation of αSyn homeostatic levels in age and neuron-type specific manners. Moreover, our recent study has revealed a critical role for microglial autophagy in the clearance of neuron-released αSyn and protection of DA neurons in mice (we termed synucleinphagy). Therefore, we propose to elucidate cell-type specific autophagy pathways (neuron vs. microglia) under physiological (young and old) and pathological conditions (PD). We will perform a systemic study that integrates multiple genetic mutant lines of mice, human induced neuron lines (hiN), quantitative proteomics, and molecular and cell biology to identify autophagy cargo and receptors in neurons and microglia. We will identify novel autophagy cargo and receptors in mediating autophagy functions and SV trafficking in an age and neuron-type (e.g.DA neuron) specific manner. We will determine distinct pathways of autophagy regulation between neuron and microglia. Our study is expected to contribute to the understanding of different mechanism of Syn degradation. Our study will pave the way to identify novel therapeutic targets of autophagy in the treatment of PD or synucleinopathies."
10757644,"Project Summary
Preventive services have been emphasized as essential components of the medical care system. However, the
disparities in cancer incidence and mortality rates experienced by vulnerable populations are evident in rates of
screening for colorectal cancer (CRC). While community health centers can play an important role in addressing
these disparities, their current operations are not set up to ensure that every eligible patient receives timely CRC
screening. The current patient self-test relies on a fecal immunochemical test that is plagued with low rates of
positive early cancer identification and difficulty in excluding non-neoplastic causes of intestinal bleed. Until a
low-cost, simple, and highly accurate diagnostic method is developed, screening rates in minorities, uninsured,
and low-income populations will likely remain low. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the accessibility
of CRC screening through the development of a new, on-demand diagnostic approach that has potential to
enable self-testing at home followed by signal development and diagnosis after sending the test to a central
facility (for example by mail). The objective of the current R21 application is to pre-validate a set of five CRC
cancer antigen biomarkers through their multiplexed detection on a 3D paper-based microfluidic device in CRC
patients as well as to test the possibility of using a self-regenerative photo-catalyst to amplify mass spectrometry
(MS) signals for early CRC detection. The test is designed to be stable enabling storage under ambient
conditions, a condition critical for successful remote sampling. The test is also rapid enough to enable point-of-
care testing on a portable mass spectrometer. Although the proposed detection strategy is based on
immunoassay, the use of a photoredox catalyst to amplify MS signal is novel. Traditional immunoassay tests use
colorimetric detection via enzyme amplification, necessitating both cold storage and analysis of the once-initiated
colorimetric signal within a specified time to ensure the validity of the test. This research program will follow three
specific aims: (1) using 356 CRC patient biorepository samples to validate the five selected biomarkers CEA,
CA199, CA242, CA125, CA153 and to optimize their multiplexed detection via paper-based immunoassay, (2)
investigation and selection of a photosystem for mass spectrometry signal amplification, and (3) using an
independent set of patient samples collected in the field to validate proposed method through the development
of a prototype 3D paper-based microfluidic device for CRC detection in whole blood samples. The project is
innovative because it combines new levels of simplicity and practicality, modest levels of cost, and a centralized
detection strategy, which will redefine the breadth of application and performance/cost ratio for accurate CRC
detection in underserved communities. The proposed research is significant because it has potential to improve
cancer care among all populations, irrespective of their race, geographic location, or income."
10757711,"Abstract/Summary:
The vertebrate craniofacial skeleton is a dynamic organ that arises and is maintained through an
intricate balance of genetic and environmental inputs. Disruptions to either can lead to deleterious
health outcomes. While significant progress has been made toward understanding the genetic and
cellular mechanisms that underlie early craniofacial patterning, much less is known about the basis for
craniofacial variation that manifests over extended periods of development, and depends upon the
environmental context in which it occurs. Whether it's the physical interactions between cells and
tissues within the developing embryo, or the mechanic forces imposed on the system, these contexts
will determine how genetically-encoded systems unfold over time to determine craniofacial geometry.
 Implicit to these ideas is feedback in the system. Feedback is how disparate developmental units
come together to form integrated functional systems - e.g., reciprocal signaling between adjacent but
developmentally distinct tissues. It is also necessary for normal growth and homeostasis in kinetic
systems - e.g., progenitor cells must sense environmental inputs, including mechanical load, and adjust
developmental processes accordingly. Broadly speaking this proposal seeks to understand how both
types of feedback are regulated at the genetic level. In doing so, three specific questions will be
addressed: (1) What are the genes that contribute to craniofacial shape? (2) Do they exert their effects
on more than one tissue, either via pleiotropy or as part of the same signaling pathway? (3) How do
these loci interact with the environment, via mechanosensing, to affect variation in facial form?
 Cichlid fishes will be used as the experimental model, as they have undergone extensive
evolutionary modifications of their skulls and jaws in a very brief period of time, making them ideal for
genetic/genomic mapping. Cichlids are also well known for their capacity to remodel their jaws under
different foraging environment, but not all cichlids share this ability, and thus plasticity itself is
genetically determined and has diverged in this system. Cichlids therefore represent an ideal model to
identify and parse the genetic, environmental, and GxE effects that underlie craniofacial variability. This
proposal leverages these experimental attributes, and integrates advanced phenotypic, genotypic and
functional tools to provide a more holistic understanding of the mechanisms that underlie craniofacial
shape."
10774201,"Background: Black women represent the largest group of women with HIV, both nationally, and locally in Miami, a U.S.
HIV epicenter; and 40% are not virally suppressed. Further, they live at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities
and within social structures that take a daily toll. Microaggressions are every day and subtle insults via comments, jokes,
and behaviors that are demeaning to a marginalized group (e.g. Black individuals, women, people living with HIV,
LGBTQ+). Despite their frequency and potential importance, microaggressions have largely been ignored in the scientific
literature on Black women living with HIV (BWLWH). Also, while scholars are beginning to investigate macroaggressions
(discrimination acts such as denial of housing) and trauma/violence among women living with HIV, they are often only
captured infrequently (e.g. annually) despite their re-occurring nature for this population. Preliminary work. We have
further demonstrated the importance of studying microaggressions among BWLWH via an R56 that supported 1 year of
research that this 4-year proposal will build on. We are finding high rates of microaggressions in BWLWH, and high rates
of other adversities such as discrimination (macro acts) and reoccurring violence. These factors relate to mental health
symptoms and health behaviors, but additional data over time is needed to understand their relationship specifically to
viral suppression. Additionally, we are starting to understand the role of factors such as resilience, COVID-19, and the
current U.S. racial climate. Conceptual Model: The conceptual model for Project MMAGIC (Monitoring
Microaggressions and Adversities to Generate Interventions for Change) focuses on microaggressions and other
adversities as negative predictors of HIV viral suppression (main outcome) mediated by mental health symptoms and
health behaviors (ART adherence and engagement in care). We will longitudinally examine both potential direct effects
and moderation by resilience factors at the individual (e.g. self-efficacy), interpersonal (e.g. social support), and
neighborhood level (e.g. community health centers). By elucidating these pathways to viral suppression among BWLWH
and having ongoing engagement with community partners, our findings will directly inform interventions. This proposal is
precisely aligned with the NIH HIV/AIDS (high) Research Priority for supporting research to reduce health disparities in
treatment outcomes of those living with HIV. Research Plan: 300 BWLWH will be enrolled in Miami (151 enrolled [4 lost]
via R56 grant), and followed over 4 years. Data will be collected at assessment visits every 3 months on
microaggressions, discrimination/macroaggressions, trauma and violence, mental health symptoms, medication
adherence, engagement in care, viral suppression, and resilience factors. Given the daily nature of microaggressions,
we will use an innovative text-message ecological momentary assessment methodology shown to be feasible (99%
response rate) in our R56. Annually, we will gather information (using zip codes) from public data sources on
neighborhood level resilience resources such as number and distance to community health centers and domestic
violence shelters. Implications: The present study, occurring in the context of both COVID-19, and heighten visibility on
racism in the U.S. presents an unfortunate yet unmatched important opportunity to study BWLWH in an HIV epicenter."
10767256,"Young people living with HIV (YPLWH, 10-24 years of age) are a growing population that experience unique
mental health challenges that may compromise their HIV care. Despite the clear need, few evidence-based
mental health interventions exist to address the difficulties faced by this important population. The long-term
goal of our research is to provide developmentally appropriate, evidence-based mental health interventions that
effectively prevent and treat HIV in young people, especially in low resource settings where the majority of the
epidemic occurs. Sauti ya Vijana (SYV, The Voice of Youth), is a novel and innovative group-based mental
health and life skills intervention designed with and for Tanzanian YPLWH to address the mental health and life
challenges they have described in our prior research. The intervention consists of 10 group sessions (two joint
with caregivers) and two individual sessions delivered by trained young adults living with HIV who have
successfully transitioned to the adult clinic using a task sharing model that builds local capacity while overcoming
the critical shortage of mental health professionals in this setting. SYV incorporates components of Trauma
Informed-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Interpersonal Psychotherapy, and Motivational Interviewing that during
this critical neurodevelopmental period, when foundations of self and social regulation are realized, may prevent
or dramatically reduce severity of mental health symptoms. The overall objectives of this proposal are to support
positive coping strategies that bolster mental health and lead to improved HIV outcomes among YPLWH. The
central hypothesis is that SYV will be effective to improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and virologic
suppression in YPLWH in Tanzania. The rationale for this project is that by targeting mental health, which is
strongly associated with medication adherence, we will effectively improve adherence and thereby HIV viral
suppression. The central hypothesis will be tested in three aims in a hybrid type-1 effectiveness-implementation
trial. The first aim will use an individually randomized group treatment trial design to determine if SYV is effective
based on the primary outcome of 10% increase in virologic suppression (HIV RNA <400 copies/mL) among
YPLWH in the intervention arm compared to standard of care. The second aim will elucidate the mechanisms
by which SYV works and for whom it is most effective by evaluating potential moderators and mediators of the
intervention using structure equation modelling. Change in mental health, internal stigma, resilience and coping
are hypothesized to mediate the intervention effect, while age, sex, site, and baseline mental health symptoms
are hypothesized moderators. The final aim will evaluate implementation determinants and outcomes, including
cost effectiveness and sustainability guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research
(CFIR) to identify any implementation differences among sites. This project is significant because it is expected
to fill a critical mental health gap in caring for YPLWH in low resource settings with far-reaching implications on
individual health (HIV suppression) and population health (preventing transmission of HIV infection to others)."

 This program is directed at developing a new approach to OSA care based on the principles of Precision
Medicine, with a focus on improving prediction, prevention and personalization. The program has 4 projects and
3 cores to support the work of the investigators. Project 01 (Genetics of Extreme Phenotypes of OSA and
Associated Upper Airway Anatomy) is focused on identifying both common and rare genetic variants that are
associated with risk for OSA. Since OSA has multiple pathways to disease, identifying associated genetic
variants is challenging. This project investigates gene variants associated with quantitative intermediate traits for
the disorder. The focus is on structural risk factors—both craniofacial dimensions and soft tissues. A focus is on
tongue fat, a specific heritable distribution of fat that mediates the effect of obesity in causing OSA. Machine
learning approaches have been developed to allow quantification of traits of interest from a large number of
relevant clinically-obtained CT and MR images in individuals with genetic data. Data from this project will be
used in combination with data from ongoing genetic studies to develop a polygenic risk score (PRS) for OSA
with wide-applicability. Project 02 (MicroRNAs as Biomarkers for Obstructive Sleep Apnea) will study
microRNAs as a biomarker relevant to OSA using RNA sequencing of all short microRNAs. Expression of
microRNAs is dynamic; they respond to multiple challenges, including hypoxia. MicroRNAs are being used in
development of biomarkers in multiple areas, with supportive data in OSA, albeit in relatively small samples.
Thus, we will employ a combination of a hypothesis-driven approach complimented by a broader discovery
strategy. Biomarkers will be developed to help identify cases with OSA, as well as to assess effectiveness of
therapy and to provide prognostic information about who with OSA will have blood pressure reduction with
treatment. Project 03 (Mechanisms that Account for Different Symptom Subtypes of OSA) will examine the
physiological and multi-omics determinants of robustly validated symptom subtypes of OSA. There will be an
emphasis on the excessively sleepy subtype, which has been shown to be at elevated cardiovascular risk. We
will evaluate whether there are differences in physiological responses during sleep in the different subtypes
and/or whether there are genetic, epigenetic, and metabolomic differences. Project 04 (Going from Genetic
Associations to Identification of Causative Genes) will focus on identifying causative genes that explain GWAS
associations. For genes conferring risk for OSA, we will begin with existing GWAS data complimented by data
from Project 01. For sleepiness, this project will start with recently published genetic loci, and include analyses
based on genes identified in Project 03. We will first use cell-based approaches to identify possible causative
genes. The role of these genes will be assessed in high-diversity mouse models (for genes associated with
anatomy) and in Drosophila and zebrafish (for genes associated with sleepiness)."

10745728,"SUMMARY
Sepsis is a life-threatening, systemic response to infection and is 13-times more likely to occur in individuals over
65, leading to hospitalization, increased mortality, and chronic repercussions. Why older persons are more
susceptible to sepsis is poorly defined, although hyperactivation of the immune system is an underlying feature.
Visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) is the organ that ages first; changes include tissue expansion and
increased immune cell activation. We demonstrated that a hyperinflammatory state in old organisms contributes
to increased mortality in response to infection, whereas young mice remain healthy. We also discovered that
there is an accumulation of aged adipose B cells (AABs) and inflammatory macrophages in vWAT of old mice.
We showed that these immune cells inhibit lipolysis, a metabolic pathway essential for maintaining energy
homeostasis. Lipolysis is also necessary to keep inflammation in check in mice challenged with
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial pathogen-associated molecular pattern from gram-negative bacteria.
Together these studies support the premise that age-related inflammation mediated by the vWAT contributes to
risk of sepsis. This proposal seeks to identify how signaling events from vWAT immune cells, which regulate
lipolysis in adipocytes, are altered with age and sepsis. We recently described a role for the NLRP3
inflammasome activation and the expansion of AABs that increase inflammation, and reduce tissue function,
including lipolysis and insulin sensitivity. These findings have led to our hypothesis that vWAT lipolysis is
impaired in old organisms due to exacerbated inflammasome activation and altered signaling by AABs, and this
negatively impacts responses to endotoxemia and sepsis. We will test this hypothesis in three aims that focus
on a mouse model of endotoxemia. Aim 1: Define the lipolytic response of adipocytes from old vs. young mice.
Aim 2: Determine if inflammasome activation and GDF3 mediate reduced lipolysis and increased inflammation
in vWAT upon LPS challenge of old mice. Aim 3: Determine the role of adenosine signaling on lipolysis in old
vWAT during LPS challenge. This information will contribute to the identification of new signaling pathways that
can be targeted to treat sepsis in the elderly."
10806997,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke is currently the leading cause of permanent disability and fifth leading cause of death in the United States.
Early and accurate recognition reduces mortality and morbidity by expediting access to neurocritical care.
Unfortunately, recognition of stroke during triage is dependent on symptom-based assessments that are often
unreliable, and up to 35% of patients are misdiagnosed at initial clinician contact. Thus, the development of
accurate biomarker-based screening tools that could be used to rapidly detect stroke in emergency medicine
settings could substantially reduce rates of mistriage, enable earlier access to intervention, and improve patient
outcomes. Numerous prior investigations have attempted to use blood measures of various proteins released from
damaged neural tissue as an indicator of stroke. Unfortunately, it is now known that many of the proteins targeted
in these prior studies exhibit a limited degree of enrichment in brain tissue, curtailing their diagnostic specificity.
Furthermore, they typically circulate at too low of levels to enable reliable detection using the immunoassay
platforms available for rapid blood testing in emergency medicine settings, blocking their path to clinical use.
Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a family of circularly continuous non-coding transcripts that are resistant to RNase
degradation; they accumulate in long-lived cells such as neurons, and recent work has demonstrated that there
are variants which are truly found only in the brain. In addition to the potential for improved diagnostic specificity,
targeting brain-specific circRNAs released from damaged neural tissue could have significant translational
advantages over targeting the proteins studied for blood-based stroke recognition in the past. The amplification
methods used to measure nucleic acids are thousands of times more sensitive than the immunoassay techniques
used to measure proteins, which could dramatically increase the odds of detection. Furthermore, because these
circRNAs would be cell-free, they could be directly assayed in serum without upstream RNA isolation; this could
allow for rapid direct detection using qRT-PCR on existing hardware found in clinical labs, or even methods such
as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) at the point-of-care. Despite these tremendous advantages,
brain-originating circRNAs have never been investigated as a potential source of biomarkers for stroke recognition.
In the work proposed here, we aim to use digital droplet PCR to evaluate the absolute circulating levels of five
brain-specific circRNAs in 500 patients with various cerebrovascular and non-cerebrovascular pathologies who
present with stroke-like symptoms at hospital admission, as well as develop a set of clinically viable custom rapid
qRT-PCR and LAMP assays targeting said circRNAs and evaluate their sensitivity and specificity for stroke. This
novel, innovative, and highly translational project addresses an area of dire clinical need; we fully expect the
assays generated as part of this work to establish the immediate technical and molecular foundation for the
downstream development of a pair of rapid stroke triage diagnostics: one that could be deployed for stat testing in
the clinical laboratory on existing hardware, and another that could be deployed at the point-of-care."
10752680,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint inhibitors like monoclonal blocking antibodies against programmed cell death 1 (PD1) have
revolutionized the way solid malignancies are treated. However, despite a dramatic response in some patients,
the majority either have no response or develop resistance. The focus of our research is on head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), an aggressive cancer with high mortality rates and high resistance to
checkpoint inhibitors. Our goal is to develop new treatment options that improve immunosurveillance and reduce
the resistance to PD1 therapy in HNSCC patients.
The efficacy of immunotherapy in cancer relies on the therapy's capability to increase their migration of tumor-
specific T cells into the tumor, and sustain their cancer killing capacity despite the immunosuppressive tumor
microenvironment (TME). Improving the ability of the T cells to infiltrate the tumor and to function in the hostile
TME remains the greatest challenge of immunotherapy. These functions of T lymphocytes rely on Kv1.3 and
KCa3.1 potassium channels that control the membrane potential and facilitate the Ca2+ influx necessary for
cytokine production, cytotoxicity and chemotaxis. We have discovered that these channels contribute to the
failure of immune surveillance and the resistance to immunotherapy in HNSCC. KCa3.1 channels are inhibited
by adenosine, an immunosuppressive molecule present in the TME, and this mechanism limits T cell infiltration
into the tumors. In addition, Kv1.3 channels are reduced in tumor infiltrating T cells and contribute to inefficient
cytotoxicity. Lastly, we observed that cytotoxic T cells of HNSCC patients that respond to PD1 blockade
display a characteristic increase in Kv1.3 and loss of response to adenosine. Therefore, a therapy that enhances
Kv1.3 and confer resistance to adenosine selectively in T cells would be highly beneficial in HNSCC.
We will develop lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for targeted delivery to T cells of a messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding
Kv1.3 and a peptide that confers resistance to adenosine through liposomal nanoparticles. The adenosine-
blocking peptide blocks the signaling pathway downstream to the adenosine receptor. Herein, will test the
hypothesis that a cell-targeted liposomal mRNA formulation that induces overexpression of Kv1.3
channels and loss of adenosine-sensitivity in T lymphocytes can reduce the resistance to anti-PD1
therapy in HNSCC patients. In Aim 1, we will produce LNPs that carry an mRNA encoding Kv1.3 and a peptide
that blocks the effect of adenosine and are decorated with antibodies for targeted delivery to T lymphocytes. In
Aim 2, we will determine the impact of these LNPs on tumors utilizing HNSCC patient-derived organoids and
humanized mice. These studies will establish the feasibility of a new formulation that can improve the T cell
cytotoxicity and confer resistance to the TME, and its validity for single-agent or combinatorial cancer
immunotherapy."
10830928,"This Merit Review Project is part of a Collaborative Merit Review Award (CMA), in response to an RFA seeking
collaborative projects related to military service exposures and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Here in
CMA2 we focus on the gut microbiome, PTSD, and host features specific to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
in Veterans. Our overall CMA has 5 projects based on the concept that while emerging evidence supports the
importance of the gut microbiome in human diseases, there are no systematic studies focusing on the role of the
gut microbiome in deployment-related GI and liver diseases in Veterans. Our overall CMA application, based on
the Roadmap developed by our group, proposes to address this knowledge gap. The questions to be addressed
include the novel role of the gut microbiome and chronic stress in mechanisms underlying the higher incidence
of diarrheal diseases, IBD, and liver diseases in Veterans. A highly collaborative group of high-impact
translational projects (3 CSRD & 2 BLRD) will address: CMA1- the role of Gulf War Illness (GWI) and PTSD gut
microbiome in susceptibility to diarrheal diseases; CMA2 (this project)- the role of PTSD in increased incidence
of IBD/gut inflammation; CMA3- the role of PTSD microbiome in gut-barrier structure and function; CMA4- the
role of PTSD and microbiome in liver disease; and CMA5- functional metagenomics in GWl-related gut
dysfunctions. The CMA approach is critical as the PIs will collaborate on shared sources of: a) gut microbiome
from Veterans; b) metagenomics, metabolomics, and gene expression data; and c) state of the art mouse models
and organoid technologies. This CMA2 proposal considers the following concepts. IBD is increasing in the USA
and in the VA, and causes morbidity in VA patients. Psychological stress, especially PTSD has been implicated
in IBD. PTSD is linked to systemic inflammation and autoimmunity, but specific effects on the gut are unknown.
An altered microbiome (dysbiosis) is strongly associated with IBD. Deployment related PTSD in Veterans may
be related to dysbiosis, which has been linked to an altered gut-brain axis. More work is needed to determine
biological links between PTSD and IBD, which we will study in VA patients. The PI is a gastroenterologist at the
VATVHS, and he and his VA GI colleagues can obtain clinical samples for this project, based on our VINCI
analysis of the high number of IBD patients at the VATVHS who also have PTSD. Our hypothesis is that PTSD
predisposes to and exacerbates IBD in Veterans due to a dysbiotic microbiome, and gut epithelial and
immune dysfunction. The Specific Aims are: 1) To test the hypothesis that the dysbiotic gut microbiome in
PTSD contributes to IBD pathogenesis in Veterans. We will study the gut microbiome and its function in stool
samples and colon tissues. This will be related to deployment history and PTSD assessments. We will utilize: A)
metagenomics; and B) metabolomics. The translational goal is to develop strategies to manipulate the
microbiome to attenuate PTSD and IBD. 2) To test the hypothesis that PTSD dysregulates intestinal epithelial
and immune cell biology and contributes to IBD pathogenesis. We will quantify markers of inflammation
established in our Lab at the level of A) mRNA by qPCR; and B) protein, using standard and multiplex
immunofluorescence, and Luminex assays. We will conduct C) metabolomics and spermidine studies, based on
data from our Lab. The Translational goal is to develop new strategies for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment
of IBD in Veterans. 3) To test the hypothesis that human organoids and human microbiota-associated (HMA)
mice can be used to validate the causal role of specific microbiome constituents and cellular dysfunction in PTSD
and IBD in Veterans. We will use: A) patient-derived organoids from control and IBD patients ± PTSD to establish
microbiome constituents and metabolites causing inflammatory responses; and B) germ-free mice humanized
with VA patient microbiota studied in colitis models. The Translational goal is to develop a bench to bedside
pipeline to guide clinical management of IBD ± PTSD. Together, these studies are expected to improve
understanding of IBD and the interaction with PTSD in Veterans and yield new interventions for VA patients."
10765666,"Our studies advance knowledge about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis
of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD), also called renal anemia. CKD represents a major
public health burden worldwide and is associated with high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In the
United States the prevalence of CKD in the general population has been estimated to range between 10 and
15% and is even higher in veterans.
Anemia is a classic manifestation of advanced CKD and results from (erythropoietin) EPO deficiency and
dyregulated iron homeostasis. The current treatment of renal anemia consists of EPO replacement therapy
with recombinant versions of EPO, typically administered in conjunction with intravenous iron. Although
recombinant EPO is effective in treating renal anemia, clinical studies have raised significant concerns
regarding its cardiovascular safety profile, providing a strong incentive for the development of new therapeutic
approaches.
EPO deficiency results from the diminished ability of diseased kidneys to produce adequate amounts of the
glycoprotein hormone EPO in response to anemia or hypoxia. EPO is essential for red blood production and
is produced in the kidney by perivascular fibroblasts and pericytes. In these kidney interstitial cells, oxygen-
dependent prolyl 4-hydroxylase domain (PHD) dioxygenases (PHDs) function as the oxygen-sensors that
control EPO synthesis by regulating hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 2 activity. The inability to activate HIF2
leads to EPO deficiency as shown by our laboratory. Perivascular fibroblasts and pericytes give also rise to
myofibroblasts, which promote kidney fibrosis through the enhanced production of collagen and other matrix
molecules. Thus, kidney fibrosis and the development of EPO deficiency are directly linked.
Despite their importance in erythropoiesis and pathogenesis of kidney fibrosis, very little is known about the
metabolic characteristics of renal interstitial cells. In particular, the role of mitochondria in interstitial cell
differentiation and function is unclear and has not been investigated.
Under this grant, we hypothesize that mitochondria play a central role in the regulation of renal interstitial cell
differentiation, HIF2 oxygen sensing and pathogenesis of EPO deficiency in CKD. The application uses
genetic mouse models in conjunction with state-of-the-art high resolution 3D imaging of mitochondria,
metabolic flux analysis and single cell transcriptomics to investigate a) the role of mitochondrial depletion in
renal interstitial cell differentiation and metabolism, b) the role of mitochondria in the regulation of the
HIF2/PHD/EPO axis and hypoxia responses in renal interstitial cells, and c) the role of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain in the development of EPO deficiency and renal anemia."
10840826,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the 10 most common malignancies in both men and women. It is also a
malignancy that is prevalent in the Veteran population. An analysis of VA Central Cancer Registry (VACCR)
data demonstrates that cancer of the kidney is among the most common cancers in the veteran population. The
most common histology is clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the focus of this proposal. One-third of patients will develop
metastasis. Unfortunately, most patients who develop metastasis will die from their disease. These realities
have created two fundamental gaps: 1) what are the mechanisms that mediate aggressive behavior in RCC?
and 2) can we target these mechanisms? The goals of this proposal will be to address these major gaps in the
field to improve outcome for Veterans, as well as the greater population afflicted with RCC. The kidney is among
the most metabolically active organs in the human body. Notably, RCC harbors dramatic alterations in metabolic
gene expression programs. The most well-studied metabolic pathway in RCC is glycolysis as the expression
of enzymes that mediate this pathway are upregulated due increased expression of hypoxia inducible factor
(HIF). However, an equally compelling phenotype is our data demonstrating dramatically reduced expression of
enzymes that mediate the catabolism (i.e., breakdown) of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). BCAAs are
essential amino acids, and therefore must be obtained from the diet. BCAA catabolism occurs in the
mitochondria and consists of a complex series of reactions that mediate the breakdown of valine, leucine, and
isoleucine. Amongst all tumor types, loss of the BCAA catabolism program is most strongly associated with
death for patients with kidney cancer. Despite this compelling link, the mechanisms that drive this remodeling
and its impact on tumor biology are poorly understood. The objective of this proposal is to identify the key drivers
of metabolic remodeling and the molecular underpinnings by which this remodeling propels tumor progression.
Elucidating this molecular connection will yield novel strategies to counter tumor progression which would
improve patient outcomes. Our preliminary data uncover a novel role for the epigenetic factor histone
deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) in suppressing the BCAA catabolic gene expression program in RCC. Our data indicate
this reroutes BCAAs toward protumorigenic pathways based on our findings demonstrating that HDAC7 inhibition
restores expression of BCAA catabolism enzymes and suppresses tumor growth in vivo. In turn, our data
uncover a novel role for BCAAs in the activation of signaling nodes that promote aggressive behaviors in cancer
cells. These data have led us to propose the novel hypothesis that HDAC7 reprogramming of BCAA metabolism
drives RCC progression This central hypothesis, based on strong preliminary data, will be tested through pursuit
of the following specific aims: 1) determine the epigenetic basis by which BCAA catabolism is suppressed in
kidney cancer, 2) determine the role of suppressed BCAA catabolism in renal carcinogenesis, and 3) determine
novel signaling roles for BCAAs that promote aggressive tumor behavior. We will delineate how diet, the
epigenome, and metabolism interact to activate downstream signaling events critical to renal tumor growth and
progression. By dissecting these molecular mechanisms and demonstrating their significance, we expect to
identify novel opportunities for intervention to improve outcomes for veterans impacted by kidney cancer."
10908264,"Long-term outcomes for lung transplant recipients remain inadequate. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD)
is the most important immune-mediated complication of lung transplantation, representing the leading cause of
late death among lung recipients. CLAD is diagnosed upon a sustained decline in lung function measures, yet
the clinical course after diagnosis is highly variable. Despite the burden of CLAD, there remain no approved
therapies. In part, this relates to difficulties in the design of CLAD trials due to a paucity of precise, generalizable
information on CLAD progression under standard-of-care (SOC) conditions and lack of established surrogate
endpoints for use in CLAD treatment studies. An additional barrier to advancing CLAD trials is the large number
of participants needed and ethical concerns regarding enrollment in placebo-controlled studies for a progressive
disease with substantial mortality risk. To address these gaps this proposal will create the largest multicenter
cohort of lung recipients with CLAD available in the published literature and perform analyses that will inform the
rational design of future CLAD trials. Specifically, to be responsive to this Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) this
proposal will integrate longitudinal clinical data collected on adult lung recipients through a prior NIAID-funded
Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation (CTOT) study, CTOT-20, and through the NHLBI-funded Lung Transplant
Outcomes Group (LTOG) study. Using these rich data, Aim 1 will precisely define the natural history of lung
function progression after CLAD and employ latent class analyses of longitudinal lung function measures to
discover subphenotypes of CLAD progression, incorporating other clinical variables that may influence disease
behavior into the analytical framework. Plausible surrogate lung function endpoints for CLAD trials will be
identified by assessing the association between each identified class and graft loss/death using landmarked Cox
proportional hazards models. Aim 2 will evaluate the practical use of these real-world lung transplant datasets
as a source of external SOC controls to complement future CLAD trials. Key eligibility criteria and endpoints
assimilated from ongoing CLAD trials will be applied to evaluate how many patients from CTOT-20 or LTOG
could potentially be included as real-world external controls for each trial. Simulations will then be conducted to
assess operating characteristics when the external controls are used in hypothetical CLAD trials. This research
is innovative because it represents a substantive departure from the existing state of CLAD investigation, namely
in the application of modern statistical methods, such as latent class methods, to a large multicenter CLAD
dataset and in the examination of innovative concepts, such as the use of external controls from historical data,
a model of increasing interest to the FDA and industry. This research is significant because it will establish the
natural history of CLAD and resolve the heterogeneity in CLAD progression in a multicenter real-world cohort;
informing the design of future interventional CLAD trials in a way that is generalizable across center practices.
Thus, aligned with the goals of this NOSI, these data are expected to improve the success of future CLAD trials."
10746848,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Whole genome analyses support the tumor stroma as the main site of molecular change that
promotes deadly prostate cancer in African American men. However, complimentary basic
research studies showing a direct cause-and-effect relationship are lacking.
 As our bodies use the sugars, we consume for energy they generate waste chemicals known
as metabolites. One such group of metabolites is known as advanced glycation end products or
AGEs for short. AGE accumulation in our tissues and organs causes their functional decline and
accelerates the aging process. AGEs represent intrinsic biological elements within health disparity
risk factors that align with the stromal profiles that influence prostate cancer in African American
men. This group has previously shown that AGEs are elevated in the circulation and tumors of
prostate cancer patients with highest levels being observed in men with African ancestry and in
more aggressive tumors. Using diet as a surrogate for health inequity, a key and novel finding from
this research is that dietary consumption of AGEs can directly accelerate prostate tumor growth.
Dietary-AGE mediated effects on tumor growth were shown to be dependent upon stromal
signaling by the transmembrane receptor for AGE (RAGE). AGE-RAGE signaling was associated
with an activated stroma similar to that observed in African American men with prostate cancer.
This was defined by the increased presence of cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and the
downregulation of matrix associated genes.
 The long-term, objective is to integrate ancestral tumor biology into the multilevel framework of
health inequity constructs to inform on cancer disparity outcomes. The study hypothesis is that
“increased AGE bioavailability contributes to rapid tumor progression in AA men with PCa
cancer”. The study will use a combination of prostate cancer cell lines and unique mouse tumor
models to define a direct cause-and-effect relationship between AGEs and ancestry specific
crosstalk in the tumor associated stroma. It will also assess if the consumption of AGEs has a
positive correlation with prostate cancer risk using data from large human cohort studies.
 By establishing the mechanistic consequences AGEs found in the food chain on ancestry
specific tumor biology, defined strategies to limit their accumulation in at risk populations, such as
African American men with prostate cancer, may be viewed as cancer preventive or therapeutic
strategies when combined with existing treatment regimens."
10772995,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Hematologic Malignancies Program
The Hematologic Malignancies (HM) Program drives basic scientific discoveries and translates them into novel
therapeutics for patients with myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms. Formed in 1994, the Program has two
scientific aims: 1) Develop a mechanisms-based understanding of the genetic, cellular, and biochemical
processes regulating malignant hematopoiesis; and 2) Translate basic scientific discoveries into more effective
and less toxic therapies for hematologic malignancies. Areas of national expertise include molecular processes
(epigenetic, transcriptional, translational, signaling) underlying malignant hematopoiesis; hematopoietic stem
cell biology and transplantation; molecular therapeutics; and immune-based therapies. Annual average accrual
to interventional clinical trials has more than doubled this funding period compared to the prior, with heavy
emphasis on investigator-initiated trials. Program members are heavy users of Shared Resources (e.g.
Transgenic and Chimeric Mouse, Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting, Human Immunology, Biostatistics and
Bioinformatics, and Genomic Analysis) and have wide-ranging collaborations with members of multiple other
Programs. The Program is co-led by Dr. Edward Stadtmauer, an expert in clinical trials of novel therapeutics
for hematologic malignancies and blood and marrow transplantation, and Dr. Nancy Speck, an internationally
known basic scientist working in the area of hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia. The Program's 29
members come from seven departments in the Perelman School of Medicine. Investments by the ACC include
an innovative Hematologic Malignancies Translational Center of Excellence (TCE) co-led by Dr. Stadtmauer,
as well as an emerging Lymphoid Malignancy TCE co-led by Drs. Stephen Schuster and Megan Lim. These
and other investments have galvanized an already successful Program by expanding resources for laboratory,
tissue banking, and clinical research and providing pilot grant funding. Scientific accomplishments this funding
period include studies garnering multiple FDA approvals (CAR T cell therapy for adults with relapsed and
refractory B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; gilteritinib for refractory acute myeloid leukemia with FLT3
mutations; and selinexor, a first-in-class oral nuclear transport inhibitor for `penta-refractory' multiple myeloma).
Basic discoveries revealed novel tumor-cell intrinsic pathways such as the demonstration that kelch-like 6
(KLHL6) functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and KLHL6 mutations in lymphoma increase NF-κB signaling.
Weekly seminars, collaborative grants, weekly clinical working group meetings, and an annual research retreat
facilitate member interactions. Currently, members have research funding totaling $16.2M (direct), of which
$5.8M is peer-reviewed and $1.9M is from the NCI. There are 20 R01-equivalents held by our members.
During the project period, members published 450 cancer relevant publications, of which 32% were intra-
Programmatic, 25% were inter-Programmatic and 73% were multi-institutional. The Program enrolled 1,567
subjects onto interventional trials this project period, and 2,162 subjects onto non-interventional trials."
10773000,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Pediatric Oncology (PO) Program
The Pediatric Oncology (PO) Program of the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) discovers, develops and
translates novel therapeutic approaches to improve cure rates and reduce acute and long-term toxicities in
children with cancer. Established in 1992, the Program has the overall goal to change the standard of care for
children with cancer in the US and across the world. Scientific aims are: 1) Characterize molecular
mechanisms of childhood cancers and predisposition for risk evaluation and precision therapies; 2) Further
develop innovative cell therapies for hematologic malignancies to improve cure rates and minimize the use of
allogeneic stem cell transplantation; and 3) Identify targets in high risk and relapsed solid tumors and develop
new therapies for these challenging tumors. The Program is led by Stephan Grupp, MD, PhD, Professor of
Pediatrics, Chief of the Cell Therapy and Transplant Section and Medical Director of the Cell and Gene
Therapy Laboratory, and Kai Tan, PhD, Associate Professor of Pediatrics. Dr. Grupp is a world leader in
cellular therapy, immunotherapy and translational research. Dr. Tan is a leading researcher in cancer
genomics and systems biology. They provide translational and transdisciplinary leadership for 35 Program
members, who form a dynamic community of investigators from three Departments in the Perelman School of
Medicine. The Program has integrated basic, translational, and clinical research components, with a diverse
group of investigators who have expertise in cancer genomics, cell biology and signal transduction, tumor
immunology and immunotherapy, drug development, clinical pharmacology, epidemiology, clinical research,
cancer control, survivorship, and behavioral oncology. Members collaborate within Pediatric Oncology, and
with the Cancer Control, Cancer Therapeutics, Tumor Biology, Hematologic Malignancies, and Immunobiology
Programs. Clinical investigations are robust, with 1,156 accruals to interventional trials and 2,946 to non-
interventional trials in the current funding period. Members engage in research that is relevant to major
pediatric cancer issues within our catchment area, and are highly engaged in educational activities across
Penn and beyond. Most notably in the current funding period, PO members worked collaboratively with
members of other Programs to develop CD19-targeted CAR-T cells (tisagenlecleucel), taking the first CAR-T
therapy to FDA approval for children and young adults with ALL. Other accomplishments include advances for
targeted therapy of pediatric leukemia, discovery of novel cancer pathways in neuroblastoma and gliomas, and
two new FDA approved drugs for pediatric solid tumors. Program members also play major leadership roles in
the national pediatric cooperative groups. Program members have $15.1M in annual grant funding (direct), of
which $9M is peer-reviewed and $6.3M is NCI-funded. The Program holds 21 R01 equivalents. There were
570 cancer-related publications from the Program since 2015. Of these, 30% are intra-Programmatic, 18%
resulted from inter-Programmatic collaboration, and 83% are multi-institutional."
10773003,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Radiobiology and Imaging Program (RBI)
The Radiobiology and Imaging Program (RBI) seeks to advance the understanding of the interaction of
ionizing and non-ionizing radiation with cancer and normal tissues. RBI addresses the cancer burden within
our catchment area through collaboration with our Community Outreach and Engagement (COE). Scientific
Aims are to: 1) Develop and characterize agents to improve cancer therapy with radiation; 2) Investigate
radiobiological or imaging methods of altering or interrogating the immune environment to improve therapeutic
response; 3) Gain a deeper understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and metabolism with the aim
to leverage this understanding to improve therapeutic response; 4) Develop novel imaging to optimally guide
cancer care; and 5) Understand the biological effects of protons to optimize their clinical use and determine
which patients will benefit most from proton beam therapy. The Program is led by Amit Maity, MD, PhD,
Professor and Executive Vice-Chair of the Department of Radiation Oncology, and Daniel Pryma, MD,
Associate Professor of Radiology and Chief of the Division of Nuclear Medicine. Drs. Maity and Pryma are
NCI-funded researchers who bring their scientific vision to this Program, which is focused on basic and
translational research and the development of investigator-initiated trials. Since the last renewal, the Program
Leaders recruited new junior and senior scientists, enhanced collaborative peer-reviewed funding, and more
than doubled accruals to interventional clinical trials, especially investigator-initiated trials (which constitute
91.6% of interventional accruals). Drs. Maity and Pryma expanded the Program's focus on imaging modalities
and theranostics and further enhanced the integration and interplay between radiobiology and imaging in RBI.
A major development has been the substantial expansion of both translational and clinical studies of proton
therapy. RBI has critical interactions with other ACC Programs including Tumor Biology, Immunobiology,
Cancer Therapeutics, Breast Cancer, Cancer Control, Tobacco and Environmental Carcinogenesis, and
Pediatric Oncology. The 44 Program members represent seven departments from four schools at Penn. RBI
members have $12M in research grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $10.9M is peer-reviewed and
$7M is NCI-funded. There were 654 cancer-related publications authored by Program members during the
project period. Of these, 27% are intra-Programmatic, 35% are inter-Programmatic and 64% are multi-
institutional. RBI has 36 R01-equivalents. Program members accrued 1,476 subjects to interventional trials,
and 3,611 subjects to non-interventional trials."
10773009,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Cancer Control Program
The Cancer Control Program (CCP) is a highly collaborative and transdisciplinary Program that focuses on
identifying and analyzing the genetic, behavioral, and health care determinants of cancer susceptibility and
outcomes in diverse and vulnerable populations and on developing, evaluating and implementing interventions
to lower risk and improve cancer outcomes. CCP is one of two Population Science Research Programs of the
Abramson Cancer Center (ACC). CCP has 39 members who work intra- and inter-Programmatically to apply
advances in science to population health and cutting-edge data analytics, address the cancer burdens and risk
factors in our catchment area, and train the next generation of cancer control researchers. Members conduct
research within four broad and interconnected Program aims: 1) Cancer Genomics and Risk; 2)
Communication and Health Behavior; 3) Cancer Survivorship; and 4) Health Care Outcomes. CCP has
produced a substantial body of high impact work in the current funding period. In Cancer Genomics and Risk,
members have established the basis for clinical management of individuals with moderate penetrance risk
genes for breast and colorectal cancer, identified risk loci associated with susceptibility to testicular germ cell
tumors, and established the comparable efficacy of genetic counseling delivered through telehealth. In
Communication and Health Behavior, members have conducted innovative studies on the use of incentives for
improving early detection and novel transdisciplinary research in diet, obesity and cancer. In Cancer
Survivorship, members have established clinical paradigms for cancer survivors through patient-centered care
plans and have revealed important complexities in end of life care. In Health Outcomes, members have
innovated methods to use the electronic health record to improve health behaviors and have conducted
pragmatic trials to innovate new models of high-quality cancer care. CCP recruited 17 new members during the
current funding period in the areas of epidemiology, genomics, biostatistics, informatics, nutrition and the
microbiome. CCP works closely with the Tobacco and Environmental Carcinogenesis Program to create a
robust population science presence at the ACC. CCP members come from ten departments in the Perelman
School of Medicine, School of Nursing, Wharton School of Business, and Annenberg School for
Communication. There have been 640 cancer-related publications over the current funding period (13% intra-
Programmatic, 35% inter-Programmatic, 76% multi-institutional). Members have 30 R01-equivalents, $14.5M
(direct) in annual cancer-related research funding, of which $11.6M is peer-reviewed and $3.8M is from NCI.
During the funding period, CCP members enrolled 10,768 subjects onto interventional trials (with 819 onto
treatment trials) and 2,923 subjects onto non-interventional trials. In sum, CCP is a vibrant community of
interactive population science investigators working across four inter-connected aims to further research
impacting our catchment area and beyond."
10773023,"PROJECT SUMMARY - Community Outreach and Engagement (COE)
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) is a longstanding priority of the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC)
and leverages decades of commitment to address the cancer burden in our catchment area. COE's mission is
to engage with the catchment area community; understand the cancer burden in the catchment area; ensure
that our Research Programs work to reduce cancer burdens; and disseminate evidence-based interventions
and policies in our catchment area and beyond. Leading our COE are two highly skilled and experienced
population scientists: Dr. Karen Glanz, Associate Director (AD) for Community-Engaged Research, and Dr.
Carmen Guerra, AD for Diversity and Outreach, who, together, bring the expertise and dedication needed to
achieve the COE mission. They led the effort to comprehensively characterize our catchment area, a
geographically-defined area of 12 contiguous counties in Southeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and
Delaware, with over 7 million residents, which captures the residences of 81.4% of all ACC patients seen
during the current funding period. The ACC has invested heavily to systematically understand the unique
cancer burdens, including cancer incidence and mortality rates, disparities, and cancer-related risk factors
across the catchment area. Key aspects of the cancer burden in the catchment area include: a high overall
cancer incidence; high incidence of prostate, lung, pancreas, and liver cancers, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma; variable cancer incidence between Philadelphia County (lung, liver) and the other counties in the
catchment area (breast, prostate, melanoma); differential cancer incidence and mortality between Black (lung,
liver) vs. White (breast, prostate, melanoma) catchment area residents; many medically underserved residents,
particularly in Philadelphia; areas with concentrated carcinogenic environmental hazards; and high rates of
obesity, smoking, and alcohol use. COE leaders manage a bidirectional process of communication, working
with the Community Advisory Board, ACC leadership, and Program Leaders to understand catchment area
needs, in order to shape research and outreach to reduce the cancer burden. COE uses a logic model as a
conceptual framework to guide its activities, objectives, and evaluation of impact. During the current funding
period, COE developed new tools (the ACC Catchment Explorer and Catchment Report) and catalyzed
research to ensure an emphasis on data-driven priorities. Significant impacts of COE to date include achieving
high rates of minority participation in clinical trials, accelerating uptake of early cancer detection methods,
promoting high rates of HPV vaccination, and increasing tobacco use treatment. The accomplishments of COE
to date reflect the ACC's deep commitment to community engagement, catchment area-relevant research, and
the dissemination of cancer prevention information and policies that directly affect the ACC catchment area."
10773032,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Developmental Funds
During the current project period, the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) used Developmental Funds to support
innovative new research through a robust Pilot Project Program, to support our Staff Investigators, to support
our Developing Shared Resources, and to support new and talented faculty recruits. These funds stimulated
research in areas of strategic importance to the ACC. This support is essential to the ACC's ability to execute
its responsibilities in stimulating transdisciplinary and translational research and to encourage research in
areas of priority to both the ACC and the NCI. Pilot awards are issued based on a long-standing, well-
established peer-review process involving senior and junior ACC members from multiple Programs,
departments, and disciplines. This process is similar to the peer-review process used by the NCI. During the
current project period plus the last two years of the previous project period, 34 pilot projects were awarded.
Fifteen new externally funded grants were awarded to pilot recipients (totaling $14.3M in direct costs) and
another three external grants are pending review. Additionally, this work was disseminated to peers through 31
manuscripts in high-impact journals including Nature, Nature Medicine, JAMA, Cancer Discovery, and J Clin
Onc. Other noteworthy outcomes from our pilots include performance of nine interventional clinical trials and
launching of a Translational Center of Excellence in Cardio-Oncology and the Population Science Center of
Excellence in lung cancer screening. Developmental Funds during the current cycle supported three Staff
Investigators and two Developing Shared Resources (one in Circulating Tumor Material and one in Cancer
Metabolism). Both Developing Shared Resources supported multiple high-impact publications (including
papers in Nature, Cell, JCI, and PNAS), and services are now incorporated into full Shared Resources in this
renewal application. Finally, Developmental Funds were used to aid in the recruitment of three talented faculty
members (Dr. Kathrin Bernt, Pediatric Oncology; Dr. Kara Maxwell, Cancer Control; and Dr. Robert Maki, who
arrived at Penn in 2020). In the coming cycle, we are requesting Developmental Funds to continue our Pilot
Project Program, to provide support for two Staff Investigators, and to continue our recruitment of faculty-level
scientists in areas of strategic need."
10773043,"PROJECT SUMMARY – Leadership, Planning and Evaluation
Senior Leadership of the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) is a carefully selected group of nationally prominent
individuals who have clearly defined roles, and together share overall responsibility for realizing the mission of
the ACC. Senior Leaders develop and implement strategies that respond to the needs of members, fostering a
creative, cohesive, and comprehensive cancer research environment that encourages transdisciplinary team
science across the translational pipeline for which the ACC is well-known. Senior Leaders foster and advance
basic discovery in line with strategic priorities, facilitating clinical translation. The ACC has a well-established
internal, Institutional, and external Planning and Evaluation (P&E) process that engages leaders, members,
and scientific and community advisors from multiple disciplines and perspectives. The goal of this process is to
guide future directions, set priorities, and prioritize investments of the ACC while at the same time, providing
ongoing mechanisms to monitor, assess, and adjust research progress, Programs, Shared Resources,
allocations, and strategies. This cohesive process is supported by highly integrated and effective bodies, such
as the Director's Advisory Council, Executive Committee, Program Leaders Committee, and committees for
Shared Resources, Community Outreach and Engagement, Cancer Research Training and Education, Pilot
Funds, and Clinical Informatics. External Scientific Advisory (ESAB) and Community Advisory Boards (CAB)
provide critical advice and feedback. The P&E process resulted in changes in Program infrastructure;
development of new Shared Resources; new leaders, resources, and tools for COE; improvements in clinical
research operations; strategic recruitments; and prioritization of Developmental Funds. Complementing these
efforts are Programmatic and Center-wide research seminars, meetings, and retreats that foster new
interactions and collaborations with Penn colleagues and external experts. A Strategic Plan in 2016 set forth
the goals for this period, and upon appointment of Dr. Vonderheide as Director, the ACC conducted a Strategic
Plan Update in 2018-2019. Seven priority areas were evaluated: Experimental Therapeutics, Biomedical
Informatics, Population Sciences, Immune Health, Precision Oncology, Shared Resources, and Education and
Training. Priority values include relevance to the catchment area, team science, translation of discovery, risk
assessment, precision profiling, leveraging of big data, behavioral research, and education and training.
Rigorous internal review of Programs, Shared Resources, Developmental Funds, and the strategic plan by
Senior Leaders and the ESAB ensure that the ACC continues to achieve its highest aspirations and adheres to
NCI guidelines. The ACC responds to all ESAB recommendations and then reports on its actions. Taken
together, integrated P&E processes successfully guided marked growth and impact of the ACC during the
current funding period."
10765607,"Project Summary
In addition to significant human distress, neurological disorders cost the U.S. economy more than $1.5 trillion
per year—8.8 percent of the gross domestic product. This physical, emotional and financial burden underscores
the potential benefit from developing innovative platforms to study brain development, physiology, and
associated diorders. The advent of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived 3D cortical organoid
cultures has shown great promise as a model system, yet there remain a number of technical limitations that
have stymied their ability to recapitulate critical non-cell autonomous aspects of human brain development.
These components include extrinsic influences of the extracellular matrix (ECM), skull, and axial morphogen
gradients that together help shape and diversify regions of the developing brain.
Currently, standard organoid protocols involve embedding organoids in Matrigel droplets or in suspended bath
culture, which prevents reproducible user-control of the extracellular environment. This limits the ability to create
morphogen gradients that topographically polarize stem cells, or to ask how molecular and physical properties
of the ECM outside the brain parenchyma guide neurodevelopment. To address these challenges, we propose
developing 3D bioprinted cortical organoid constructs that recapitulate key microenvironmental cues of native
brain tissue. This project builds upon our recent technological achievements, enabling embedded bioprinting of
custom tissue constructs at high spatial resolution (20 µm) specifically designed for long-term organoid culture.
Our goal is to bioprint cortical brain organoids into 3D scaffolds with customizable molecular and
physiomechanical compositions. The synergy of brain organoid and bioprinting technologies provides a nearly
unlimited potential to manipulate extrinsic developmental cues of a complex multicellular human model system.
We will pursue two integrated Specific Aims using the multi-PI leadership mechanism to combine complementary
research skills and expertise in the Sloan (neurodevelopment) and Serpooshan (tissue engineering)
laboratories. In Aim 1, we will decouple the molecular composition and physical stiffness paramaters of the
ECM, and ask how these factors influence neural development, differentiation, maturation and architecture. In
Aim 2, we will use three separate approaches to generate a stable morphogen gradient within bioprinted
constructs, which we will use to induce intra-organoid polarization of both dorsal (pallial) and ventral
(subpallial) regional identities. Together, these approaches offer a novel platform for 3D stem cell modeling that
could be applied broadly to numerous systems and usher a new generation of neurodevelopmental modeling."
10813003,"Project Summary
One of the most widespread presentations of Interstitial Lung Disease is Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a
chronic, progressive and fatal disease. The prevalence of IPF in the US has increased 2-fold in the last 10 years
and it affects ~180,000 Americans. Subclinical epithelial injury has been identified as a central process in IPF.
The prognosis of IPF is dire, with a median survival of 3.8 years among adults 65 years or older. Important
advances in the therapy of IPF include the approval of nintedanib and pirfenidone. Although these agents are
able to clinically attenuate the loss of lung function in IPF, they do not completely halt or reverse the progression
of disease. This underscores the need to identify novel therapies for the treatment of IPF. Epithelial reprograming
of alveolar type II cells (AEC2) is a central process that leads to lung remodeling in IPF. Intriguingly, we have
identified a novel developmental transcription factors that is up-regulated in IPF: Sine Oculis Homeobox Homolog
1 (SIX) and its co-factors eyes absent (EYA)-1 and 2. Using an experimental model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced
lung fibrosis, we demonstrate that deletion of SIX1 in AEC2 inhibited the development of lung fibrosis and
improved lung function and that SIX1 overexpression in AEC2 results in an atypical lung epithelization. Taken
together these results point at elevated SIX1 in AEC2 as an important pathway for lung fibrosis. Preliminary data
suggests that activation of this pathway promotes expression of senescent associate secretory phenotype
(SASP) factors and hyperplasia of AEC2, key features of lung fibrosis. However, the SIX1/EYA driven
mechanisms that promote these changes are not fully understood and will be interrogated in this proposal."

10751005,"Project 1 Summary
Extensive efforts have been carried out over the years to design a HIV-1 vaccine candidate which
elicits robust immune responses supporting broad neutralization and effector T cell responses.
Recently the Weiner and Kulp laboratories reported the development of novel DNA-launched, in
vivo, self-assembling immunogens, including both DNA launched native like trimers (DL-NLTs)
and DNA-launched nanoparticle immunogens (DLNPs). Both DNA launched NLTs and NPs
assemble and display appropriate epitopes for neutralizing antibodies while occluding epitopes
for non-neutralizing antibodies in vivo. Additionally, they drive robust T cell immunity. These
vaccine candidates are being moved to the clinic under studies HVTN-304 and HVTN-305.
synDNA facilitates rapid immunogen design, co-delivery of molecular adjuvants, supports
expression and assembly of complex structural antigens in vivo, has a safe clinical track record,
and maintains boost-ability. Building on progress from our previous IPCAVD, combining these
designs, we will be working with Dr. Kulp under Project 2 to formulate DLNPs bearing NLTs
displaying Apex and CD4 binding-site B cell lineage targeting Epitopes (DLNP-ACEs).
Furthermore, we have designed and characterized several synDNA-encoded molecular adjuvants
to support enhanced humoral immunity, cell-mediated immunity, and direct antigen-specific
responses to mucosal surfaces. The overarching goal of Project 1 is to combine these novel
immunogens with DNA-delivered genetic adjuvant combinations and/or heterologous adjuvant
regimens, in dual expressing plasmids developed with Project 3 to support vaccine-induced
immunity and represents a great leap forward in the design of HIV-1 vaccines."
10751008,"Project 2 - Project Summary
In order to protect against HIV-1 acquisition, antibody-based vaccines must be able to consistently elicit
broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). bnAb elicitation has proven difficult in humans and non-human
primates (NHPs), in part because of the complex developmental pathways bnAbs require to mature,
competition from off-target responses to the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env), and rare precursor B cell
frequency. In this project we will develop candidate immunogens to address each of these problems through
a variety of approaches. First, we will use structure-based and mammalian display techniques to further
enhance the germline targeting ability of our lead candidate, Q23.17 MD39. Using these approaches, we
will develop native-like trimers capable of targeting the V2-apex and CD4 binding site bnAb epitopes. These
trimer immunogens will additionally be engineered to limit off-target responses by minimizing competition
from highly immunodominant non-neutralizing antibody lineages. Furthermore, we will use these constructs
to develop novel “germline targeting SHIVs”, and through SHIV-infection will identify boosting immunogens
that can guide the development of breadth. Additionally, through structural analysis of the process of Env-
Ab coevolution, we aim to identify determinants of bnAb development in infected primates, that will further
inform our immunogen design process. Finally, we will complex these with genetic adjuvants developed in
project 1 and platform advances in project 3, as well as with our novel DNA-Launched NanoParticle (DLNP)
platform. We have shown DLNPs improve the immunogenicity while not requiring the complex cGMP
processes that hamper the pace of clinical development for traditional nanoparticle vaccines. We will then
down-select immunogens using a variety of innovative mouse models that harbor human B cell lineages,
recapitulate human B cell competition and have tunable bnAb precursor frequencies. These mice will
provide a benchmark for our lead candidates to be advanced into GMP production. We will test them in a
NHP model for heterologous challenge, and through these combined approaches, we aim to demonstrate,
for the first time, protection from heterologous tier-2 challenge in NHPs."
10751017,"Project 3 Summary
Project 3 is primarily focused on the product production aspects of this IPCAVD proposal (Specific Aim 1). It is
directed by a leading HIV vaccine development organization – Inovio Pharmaceuticals (INO) who have advanced
multiple clinical DNA vaccine programs. Inovio has extensive expertise in development of synthetic DNA
vaccines and advanced in vivo electroporation delivery. The central goal of Project 3 is to cGMP manufacture
and deliver product for 2 DNA immunogen constructs in years 4 and 5 of the program. Using Inovio’s advanced
process technology the experienced team will manage CMC aspects of producing product with specific state-of-
the-art manufacturing facilities for drug substance and drug product activities resulting in vialed doses, and
support IND submission to be delivered in year 5 of the program. Additionally, Inovio will support the use of the
next generational compact, portable, hand-held intradermal EP delivery device, CELLECTRA™ 3PSP. This
device will be provided and employed for the preclinical studies across all animal models throughout this
program. 3PSP will be available to support the subsequent clinical trials which will be initiated by the HVTN. In
Specific Aim 2 Project 3 will collaborate with Project 1 to evaluate and advance the development of dual antigen
and cytokine DNA constructs. Our development work with the dual promoter IL-12 constructs, will provide the
blueprint for these dual promoter constructs that will express a HIV antigen and cytokine adjuvant. Project 3 will
provide coordination and support of the NHP studies throughout the duration of the project which will include
immunogenicity and IND-enabling studies to advance the development HIV vaccine constructs originating from
Project 1 and 2. In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate DNA vaccine delivery employing transformative skin delivery
protocols in clinically relevant models, including guinea pigs and NHPs, integrating needleless jet delivery with
skin electroporation. In summary, Project 3 will provide high quality concentrated drug product for subsequent
HVTN clinical testing and advance the development of novel HIV DNA vaccine constructs and delivery platforms."
10788320,"PROJECT 1 SUMMARY
Early life stress (ELS), or traumatic events during the years prior to age 18, was identified as a novel risk factor
for cardiovascular disease (CVD) over 20 years ago yet little is understood about the ELS-initiating mechanisms.
Dr. Pollock and colleagues previously showed that young adults with ELS exposure have higher vascular
dysfunction (pulse wave velocity and peripheral resistance) compared to those with no ELS exposure. These
data indicate that ELS initiates CVD risk at earlier ages in humans. Previous reports find that ELS impacts the
sexes distinctly, thus both sexes are utilized in our studies. Project 1 will investigate the molecular and cellular
mechanisms of vascular and immune dysfunction as well as a strategy to reverse the dysfunction using a
clinically relevant rodent model of ELS, maternal separation (MaSep). MaSep incorporates a psychosocial
stressor of repeated periods of separation of pups from dams during the postnatal-preweaning period.
Understanding the ELS-initiated molecular mechanisms across development is essential to devise strategies to
mitigate CVD risk. Progress in studying the mediators of ELS-induced vascular and immune dysfunction provides
a strong rationale for this Program Project Grant (PPG). Project 1 finds that pre-pubertal mice exposed to MaSep
have increased aortic stiffness (pulse wave velocity). Further, we found that MaSep induces endothelial
dysfunction, or loss of nitric oxide (NO) and increased superoxide (O2-), greater mitochondrial DNA damage, and
increased activated macrophages—all described mechanisms contributing to vascular inflammation and aortic
stiffness. Reports show that microbial-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) affect vascular and immune
activity. Project 1 found specifically that plasma butyrate, an anti-inflammatory SCFA, is reduced in pre-pubertal
and adult mice exposed to MaSep. Project 2 found that butyrate blocked the induction of hypertension
sensitization. The central hypothesis of Project 1 is that ELS initiates vascular and immune dysfunction
through reprogramming of the endothelium and vascular macrophage systems. Two aims will address the critical
gaps in our understanding of how ELS initiates and sustains vascular and immune dysfunction utilizing innovative
approaches. Aim 1 will test whether exposure to ELS initiates vascular and immune dysfunction through
reprogramming of the endothelium, specifically focused on histone deacetylase (HDAC) 9 and NADPH oxidase
(NOX) 2. Experiments utilize inducible endothelium-specific HDAC9 or NOX2 knockout mice and, in collaboration
with Project 2, whether butyrate repletion moderates the vascular dysfunction with a multi-omic approach. Aim
2 will test whether exposure to ELS initiates vascular and immune dysfunction through reprogramming of
vascular macrophage activation. Experiments include determinations of macrophage depletion or macrophage-
specific HDAC9 knockout reverses vascular inflammation, and, with Project 3 and Project 4, a timeline of
macrophage activation with a multi-omic approach. Project 1 studies have translational relevance by
determinations whether butyrate repletion will reverse ELS-initiated endothelium or macrophage reprogramming."

Neuropathology Core will help to further develop a unique bank of specially handled CNS tissues for ongoing
and future FTLD molecular, translational, clinico-pathological, and biomarker discovery research."
10760296,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a complex disorder affecting between 50-70% of the United States population
aged 65 or older. In public settings, seniors frequently have great difficulty understanding speech, which can
lead to withdrawal from social activities, depression and cognitive decline. All individuals and especially the
elderly can maintain speech understanding in difficult listening conditions by engaging attentional, cognitive and
mnemonic (top-down) resources to help disambiguate speech from a degraded ascending acoustic code.
Understanding the impact of aging on circuits that maintain speech understanding and the pharmacology of
cholinergic attentional systems in their modulation is at the core of the proposed studies.
Studies during the previous grant period identified differential age-related changes in nicotinic cholinergic
receptor (nAChR) subunit/subtypes in the medial geniculate body (MGB) and primary auditory cortex (AI). In
vitro aging studies detailed the pre- and postsynaptic function of nAChRs in thalamic circuits likely to underpin
attentional modulation of acoustic information. Unit recordings from awake rat auditory thalamus MGB also
showed age-related repetition-enhancement, as opposed to sensory adaptation, in response to
repeating/predictable temporally rich stimuli. This was posited to reflect increased use of corticofugal/higher-
order resources. Age-related enhanced coding of repeating modulated stimuli was reproduced in young animals
by simply degrading the temporal clarity of the sinusoidal amplitude modulated (SAM) stimuli. Corticothalamic
blockade of projections to MGB reversed predictive repetition-enhancement to a degree, but not completely. The
proposed Specific Aims will address questions raised by these prior studies and supported by preliminary data.
In vitro and in vivo approaches in rats will: SA1: Characterize the functional pharmacology and the impact of
aging on nAChR pharmacology in the central and dorsal nuclei of the inferior colliculus (CNIC, ENIC and DNIC).
SA2A: Determine single unit response properties of CNIC and DNIC units to temporally distinct and less
temporally distinct SAM stimuli presented in repeating/predictable or random sequences. SA2B: Determine the
impact of aging on the response properties of CNIC and DNIC units to repeating vs. randomly presented SAM
stimuli. SA3. Determine the impact of pontine mesencephalic tegmentum (PMT) release of acetylcholine on the
response properties of IC units to temporally distinct and temporally less distinct SAM stimuli presented in a
repeating or random sequences. Understanding the mechanisms involved in repetition enhancement/predictive
coding and identification of novel nAChR subtypes potentially resistant to aging will inform future behavioral and
pharmacotherapeutic approaches to improve speech understanding in the elderly."
10757752,"Individuals with serious mental illnesses (SMI), as well as those experiencing suicidality or psychiatric crisis,
encounter police officers frequently in the community. Almost a third of people with SMI have police involved in
their pathway to mental health care. Although a variety of strategies to reduce law enforcement involvement in
mental health crisis response are emerging, people with SMI and/or those in crisis will continue to encounter
police when officers must serve as first responders, and importantly, during officers’ routine patrol duties. As
such, officers need training to safely and effectively interact in these situations. The Crisis Intervention Team
(CIT) model is a collaborative approach that includes a 40-hour training of officers. CIT has been implemented
in thousands of U.S. communities, and some agencies are now mandating all of their officers complete CIT
training. Despite widespread support and growing research, a randomized, controlled trial (RCT) has never
been conducted to assess the effectiveness of CIT training on officers’ actual skills and behaviors.
 Prior research has relied on officers’ self-report of their de-escalation skills and has not directly measured
actual performance in a rigorous, standardized, controlled fashion. Furthermore, multi-site studies are lacking,
and potential officer-level factors that may moderate CIT training outcomes have yet to be systematically
assessed. This study will partner with six sites across the country representing diverse geographic areas and
constituency demographics. There are four Specific Aims of the study. First, we will conduct a rigorous, multi-
site RCT of CIT mental health training. Each agency will provide 40 officers, for a total of 240. Among the 40
officers from each agency, half will be randomized to CIT training. Data will be collected using Standardized
Scenarios, which will be rated centrally in a blinded fashion (blinded by site, study arm, and time). Primary
outcomes are actual verbal crisis de-escalation skills and non-verbal physical behavior. Second, we will
determine the impact of CIT training on two secondary outcomes: use of procedural justice and disposition-
related decision-making. Third, we will test the influence of four targets/mediators on our primary outcome.
These hypothesized targets/mediators are: knowledge of mental illnesses, attitudes, subjective norms, and
self-efficacy/perceived behavioral control. Engagement of these targets is hypothesized to lead to the expected
improvement in officers’ actual skills and behaviors. Fourth, we will evaluate three officer-level variables that
might moderate any observed improvements at 3-months and 6-months: greater exposure to/familiarity with
the mental health field, greater years of service as a police officer, and greater desire, interest, and motivation
to perform the types of duties that CIT officers perform. Results from the RCT will inform decision-makers in
jurisdictions across the U.S."
10754949,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Spinocerebellar ataxia type 12 (SCA12) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease, 
discovered and characterized by our group, notable clinically for tremor, gait abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric 
syndromes, and neuropathologically for atrophy in cerebral cortex and cerebellum. SCA12 is caused by a 
CAG/CTG expansion mutation in PPP2R2B, a gene encoding brain-specific regulatory units of protein 
phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Normal alleles carry 4 to 31 triplets, whereas disease alleles carry 43 to 78 triplets. 
SCA12 is the second most common ataxia in North India, with cases of SCA12 detected in the United States, 
Italy, and China. There is no treatment. Our preliminary data indicates that PPP2R2B contains at least 16 exons 
with multiple alternative splice variants, resulting in at least 8 protein isoforms (termed B1-B8) with different N 
terminal domains, among which Bβ1 and Bβ2 are by far the most abundant and best characterized. The N-terminal domains contribute to the localization of the PP2A holoenzyme, and hence their relative abundance 
may be critical in establishing patterns of protein phosphorylation. The repeat is located in the 5’ region of exon 
7 in a predicted promoter region, but is also contained within the transcripts of alternative splice variants. Based 
on extensive preliminary data, we hypothesize that the CAG repeat expansion in SCA12 alters PPP2R2B
expression and splicing, leading to changes in PP2A targeting that contribute to SCA12 pathogenesis by 
alteration of phosphoproteome. Secondarily, we hypothesize that missplicing induced by repeat expansion 
generates a transcript encoding a toxic polyserine tract that contributes to SCA12 pathogenesis. Our aims are 
each designed to explore a specific aspect of SCA12 pathogenesis, and simultaneously to explore more general 
principles of neurodegeneration related to repeat expansion and the function of PP2A, using genetically 
engineered mice and human iPSCs. In Aim 1, we will determine the effect of the SCA12 mutation on PPP2R2B
expression. In Aim 2, we will determine the effect of abnormal PPP2R2B expression on PP2A substrate targeting 
and the phosphoproteome. In Aim 3, we will determine how changes in PP2A substrate targets and aberrantly 
expressed polyserine contribute to neurotoxicity. If our hypothesis is correct, SCA12 pathogenesis derives from 
repeat-expansion-induced changes in PPP2R2B expression that 1) alters PP2A substrates targets and hence 
the phosphoproteome, and 2) generates toxic polyserine tracts. Establishing these pathways will establish 
multiple potential targets for therapeutic intervention in SCA12. At the same time, our experiments will more 
generally establish the potential effect of repeat expansion on promoter and splicing function, and the role of 
PP2A dysregulation in neurodegeneration, of particular interest given evidence of PP2A dysregulation in other 
neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease."

10754514,"Project Summary
Aneuploidy is a ubiquitous feature of cancer cells, and accumulation of aneuploidy is believed to often happen
via tetraploidization (genome doubling) as an intermediate step. This idea is based on the observations that
nearly 40% of all tumors have likely undergone whole genome duplication during their clonal evolution, that
tetraploidy was shown to buffer chromosomal instability (CIN), and that tetraploid (4N), but not diploid (2N),
mammary epithelial cells could induce subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. A widely accepted model suggests
that the extra centrosomes commonly arising during tetraploidization are responsible for ongoing chromosome
missegregation during mitosis leading to the accumulation of aneuploidy and CIN. A possible selective
advantage conferred by aneuploidy would, in turn, promote tumorigenesis. Support for this model comes from
the fact that both aneuploidy and supernumerary centrosomes have been observed in human tumors and that
extra centrosomes can promote tumorigenesis in animal models. However, recent reports have shown that
cells kept in standard culture conditions spontaneously lose extra centrosomes acquired during
tetraploidization, and that this centrosome loss can occur over a very short time period (about two weeks). The
discrepancies between what is believed to happen in vivo and what is observed in standard tissue culture
conditions suggests that the in vivo ecological niche (e.g., various factors within the tumor microenvironment)
can impose specific selective pressures that influence the evolution of 4N cells, and thus the consequences of
tetraploidization. This hypothesis will be tested by experimentally inducing tetraploidy and then combining a
multi-disciplinary approach to study the interplay between altered ploidy/centrosome number and the
microenvironment in three specific research aims. The first aim will determine the effects of the physico-
chemical microenvironment on the evolution of 4N cells and will identify specific, physiologically relevant,
physico-chemical properties of the microenvironment that produce an evolved cell population unlike the one
emerging in standard culture conditions. The second aim will establish how communication with stromal cells
influences the evolution of 4N epithelial cells and specifically assess the role of signaling molecules and cell-
cell physical interactions in shaping the evolution of cells with altered ploidy. The third aim will identify the key
processes driving the evolution of 4N cells in vivo. This will be achieved by injecting newly formed 4N cells in
mouse models and then characterizing the evolved, tumor-derived cell population. An ODE-based
mathematical model will be used in each aim to capture the evolution dynamics of subpopulations of cells with
defined ploidies and centrosome numbers and pinpoint the events, cellular processes, and microenvironmental
factors that drive the differential, context-dependent, evolutionary outcomes. The findings from these studies
will not only broaden the current knowledge, but also set the stage for future identification of potential
molecular targets and/or novel microenvironment manipulations for cancer therapy."
10794204,"ABSTRACT
The effects of various hormones on oxidative metabolism and other mitochondrial functions, in the liver and other
tissues, are mediated by cytoplasmic [Ca2+] oscillations propagated to the mitochondria. Ca2+ is released to the
cytoplasm from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the IP3 receptors (IP3Rs), which, based on findings
from us and others, expose mitochondria at ER-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCs) to high [Ca2+] nanodomains
to attain activation of the low-affinity mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites. ERMCs were also recognized in other
processes including lipid metabolism, organelle dynamics and autophagy. Our work has revealed the physical
support of ERMCs by tethering proteins. We have created synthetic membrane linkers to measure and perturb
ERMCs and local inter-organelle communication in live cells, and provided clues to local calcium and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) signaling. We have also provided these reagents to several hundred laboratories
worldwide, which together have showed the role of interorganellar contacts in a range of paradigms including
metabolism, vesicle dynamics, neuronal and immune functions and linked structural or functional impairments
of the ER-mitochondrial coupling to an array of disorders across organs including the liver (e.g. fatty liver).
However, fundamental questions remain unanswered. ERMCs are dynamically restructured to meet the
continuously changing demands of the cell, but how ERMCs are formed and dissolved is yet to be
determined. IP3R-mediated fluctuations in [Ca2+] might provide a means to control contact formation, given that
elevations of cytoplasmic [Ca2+] stop mitochondrial movements close to the ER through the Ca2+-sensing Miro
proteins, and both the IP3R and Miro proteins, have been implicated as components of interorganellar
complexes. However, the interaction partners and mechanisms are elusive. We hypothesize that IP3Rs and
Miros mediate ERMC formation in an isoform-specific and Ca2+-dependent manner to regulate
physiological functions of hepatocytes. Aims#1&2 will test this hypothesis using novel genetic and
microscopic imaging toolkits that will enable us to specifically and systematically measure and perturb ERMC
forming elements. The effect of genetic perturbations in the liver will be tested by novel, in vivo imaging
approaches. The interactomes of IP3R and Miro will be evaluated primarily by unbiased proteomics, but Bcl-xL
will also be specifically tested as a tether forming partner for the IP3R. Finally, a major limitation in the field of
inter-organellar communication research is that quantitative evaluation of the geometry of nanometer scale
membrane contacts remains difficult. In Aim#3 we will develop and characterize methods of measuring and
describing organelle interface geometry in 2-and 3D electron microscopy data and uncover the structural
features most relevant to calcium transfer. The proposed work will explore the molecular mechanisms of ERMC
dynamics and their physiological relevance and will continue our efforts in creating molecular tools and methods
that allow many investigators to explore the local communications of ER and mitochondria or other organelles."

The overall goal of the Southwest Health Equity Research Collaborative (SHERC) is to increase basic
biomedical, clinical, and behavioral research at Northern Arizona University (NAU) to address health disparities
and advance health equity among diverse populations of the southwestern United States. In the next 5 years,
we will increase research capacity especially in the areas of clinical and translational research with a focus on
team science and diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ). SHERC will work closely with community
partners to expand capacity to address health disparities in multiple chronic and infectious diseases, as well as
high-priority behavioral health conditions, as determined by community partners. SHERC consists of 5 cores
that all interact synergistically. Each of the SHERC cores provides a clear opportunity for innovation
individually; in combination, they demonstrate significant impact in innovation. The Administrative Core
combines evidence-based organizational theory with a tested but novel use of a “continuous improvement”
model of program assessment and feedback. The innovative Core Leadership Development Program will
cultivate a new cadre of mentored research leaders from underrepresented (UR) backgrounds. The Research
Capacity Core focuses on enhancing translational, data, and clinical science, and simultaneously aims to
grow the use of novel laboratory technologies, cutting-edge community-engaged methods and models,
biostatistics, interinstitutional collaborations, and support of relevant NAU core research facilities. The
Investigator Development Core will support early-stage investigators in basic biomedical, behavioral, and
clinical sciences at NAU through 2 programs: a Pilot Project Program and an Individualized Mentoring
Program. The Community Engagement Core uses an innovative 4-direction Framework for Inquiry and
Action that will represent the shared and distinct social determinants of health in Arizona. The Recruitment
Core aims to recruit 2 mid-level or senior faculty members with established health equity research programs to
fill gaps in institutional expertise; to support the new hires in establishing collaborative and independent health
equity research programs at NAU; and to integrate them into SHERC as collaborators, mentors, and leaders.
The 3 Research Projects include the following innovative studies: Project 1 (Camplain) addresses physical
activity and sedentary behavior and their impact on health outcomes among women incarcerated in Arizona.
Project 2 (Cope) focuses on childhood asthma and aims to determine the effect of a gut microbiome modifying
therapy (fiber supplementation) to improve type-2 asthma symptoms by reducing airway inflammation via the
gut microbiome-airway axis. Project 3 (Mihaljevic) will develop and operationalize modeling tools that allow us
to rapidly improve the design and implementation of spatial epidemiological models of SARS-CoV-2 that are
informed by local-level geographic and demographic features, including social determinants of health."
10896449,"SUMMARY
Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can interact with other members of the same RTK family, forming
heterocomplexes with distinctive signaling activities that have both physiological and pathogenic relevance.
These heterointeractions likely occur within each of the 20 RTK families, but they have not been studied in
most cases. The Eph family, with 14 members, is the largest of the receptor tyrosine kinase families. Different
Eph receptors are often expressed in the same cells, and some evidence suggests that these co-expressed
Eph receptors can form heterocomplexes. Among the Eph receptors, EphA2 is the one most profoundly linked
to disease. EphA2 signaling is complex because it can mediate diverse, and often opposite, biological
functions. For example, EphA2 can exert either anti-oncogenic or pro-oncogenic effects through different
ligand-dependent and ligand-independent signaling mechanisms. Although heterointeractions with other co-
expressed Eph receptors likely contribute to the versatility of EphA2 signaling and to the pathological effects of
EphA2, the significance of these interactions is not well understood. In this proposal, we seek to enhance our
basic knowledge about the biological significance of EphA2 heterointeractions through the use of innovative
tools and experimental approaches. In Aim 1, we will use quantitative biophysical strategies that we have
developed to characterize ligand-independent interactions of EphA2 with other Eph receptors. In Aim 2, we will
characterize EphA2 interactions with other Eph receptors in the presence of an EphA2-specific ligand. In Aim
3, we will define the functional consequences of specific heterointeractions for EphA2 signaling. This will be
accomplished by investigating the effects of heterointeractions on EphA2 phosphorylation, effector recruitment,
downstream signaling pathways, and cellular responses impacting cell migration/invasion. This work will
identify mechanisms by which interacting Eph receptors affect EphA2-mediated signaling processes. This in
turn will inform the design of future therapies targeting mixed EphA2-Eph signaling platforms."
10773182,"In mammals, the hypothalamic pacemaker clock synchronizes peripheral tissue clocks to temporally partition
oxidative and reductive metabolic pathways to align fuel utilization with nutrient availability. Yet how the circadian
clock in brain and peripheral tissues integrates nutrient state with transcription to promote energy conservation
and metabolic homeostasis during sleep and in nutrient scarce conditions remains obscure. An exciting clue as
to how nutrient signals control circadian transcription emerged from the discovery in our group and others that
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and the NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 regulate circadian
behavioral and mitochondrial rhythms through posttranslational modification of the core clock repressor PER2,
indicating that NAD+-SIRT1 controls clock cycles within both neurons and peripheral cells. Interconversion of
NAD+ with its reduced form NADH during redox reactions is dependent upon nutrient state. In new results
published after our first submission, we show that NADH accumulation in liver during healthful calorie restriction
inhibits SIRT1 and reduces daytime body temperature and oxidative metabolism. Surprisingly, reducing NADH
levels through hepatic transduction of the water-forming NADH oxidase Lactobacillus brevis (LbNOX) disinhibits
SIRT1 and augments oxidative cycles of metabolism and transcription. Further, our newly-generated PER2K680Q
acetyl-mimetic knockin mice, which are resistant to SIRT1-induced deacetylation, exhibit profound period
lengthening, while clock ablation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) abrogates rhythmic feeding and
thermogenesis. We are now poised with innovative genetic tools and circadian protocols to dissect how the
circadian clock promotes energy constancy during sleep and in adaptation to calorie restriction at the level of the
liver (Aim 1) and hypothalamic pacemaker neurons (Aim 2). Aim 1 will specifically test the hypothesis that nutrient
sensing by the clock involves NAD(H)-SIRT1 signaling. We propose to dissect the role of redox state in clock
function and metabolism during sleep and calorie restriction by genetically manipulating NAD(H) levels using
LbNox in combination with hepatic clock ablation or PER2K680Q acetyl-mimetic knockin mice. Aim 2 will examine
the role of hypothalamic pacemaker neuron subtypes in synchronizing thermogenesis, feeding, and metabolic
rhythms with sleep and in the adaptive response to calorie restriction by utilizing an innovative combination of
CRISPR-Cas9 clock ablation, loss and gain of function studies, and projection-based chemogenetic manipulation
of pacemaker neurons. Collectively, our proposed studies will elucidate circadian mechanisms involved in
maintenance of energy constancy across the sleep-wake cycle and how clock adaptations contribute to health

The overall objective of this research is to gain a deeper understanding of visual processing in
the macaque monkey retina, the most important animal model for understanding human vision,
and to leverage that knowledge to treat blindness. The goal of the proposed work is to
determine how four poorly understood retinal cell types contribute to visual processing in
primates. Many of the retinal amacrine and ganglion cell types that have been characterized in
non-primate retinas perform complex and specialized visual computations, extracting
information such as motion direction, object orientation, and object versus background motion
from visual inputs. Whether similar computations also occur in the primate retina is unclear,
because most physiological studies have focused on the role of only five of the ~20 output
pathways. We have identified four cell types in the macaque monkey retina that exhibit
intriguing differences from the five better-studied cell types in their visual response properties.
Our specific aims are to 1) determine how striking waves of activity in the network of A1
amacrine cells network shapes the light response properties of parasol ganglion cells, 2)
determine how intrinsic and circuit mechanisms shape the unusual spatial and temporal
response properties of broad thorny ganglion cells, and 3) determine how membrane and
receptive field properties allow ON- and OFF-type smooth monostratified ganglion cells to signal
distinct information to the brain from their parasol cell counterparts. At the conclusion of this
work, we expect to have a deeper understanding of the visual computations performed by the
primate retina and the neural mechanisms that underlie those computations. Further, this
project will shed much needed light on how retinal processing in primates, and by extension
humans, relates to that observed in rodents and other animal models."

Fragility fractures are a substantial public health problem in older adults in the United States (US), with vertebral
fractures being the most prevalent fracture type. Cardiometabolic disorders (e.g., hypertension, type 2
diabetes mellitus, abdominal obesity, and hyperlipidemia) have been associated with lower bone strength, bone
mineral density (BMD), and higher fracture risk. Although several epidemiologic studies have evaluated the role
of cardiometabolic health on vertebral fractures, by not accounting for the clustering of cardiometabolic
conditions, many of the study findings are limited. Large studies with the ability to adjust for multiple
cardiometabolic conditions are needed to provide information on the full effect of cardiometabolic conditions on
vertebral health, including BMD and strength. Studies evaluating molecular mechanisms of cardiometabolic
conditions on vertebral health also have study design limitations, including the lack of adjustment for clustering
of other cardiometabolic conditions and/or biomarkers, and cross-sectional evaluations where either the
cardiometabolic exposures and/or bone health data are assessed at a single time point. The lack of longitudinal
data limits our ability to understand how cardiometabolic health is related to vertebral health. Lastly, advances
in computed tomography (CT) technology has allowed for bone mass and strength measurements.
Biomechanical CT (BCT) analysis has allowed researchers to obtain validated bone mass and strength on CT
images obtained for other clinical indications, opening the investigation of the role of cardiometabolic disorders
on vertebral health in individuals who do not routinely receive DXA imaging (i.e. women of color and men). The
Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study has followed 5,115 Black and White male
and female adults aged 18-30 years at baseline for 35 years. The proposed study will build on CARDIA’s
previously collected cardiometabolic disease and biomarker data. It will also add vertebral strength data through
BCT analysis of Year 25 and 35 abdominal CT scans. Our aims are to: 1) Evaluate the association between
cardiometabolic disease patterns and vertebral health, 2) Determine the role of cardiometabolic
biomarkers on vertebral health, and 3) Identify cardiometabolic health factors that predict 10-year
changes in vertebral health. Our overall goal is to provide unbiased and longitudinal estimates of the
association between cardiometabolic health and vertebral health, and to explore the potential biologic
mechanisms of these associations. Determining how cardiometabolic disease patterns and biomarkers, at
clinical or subclinical levels, impact vertebral bone health is highly desirable and can lead to changes in fracture
screening protocols in this high risk population."

Neurons are viewed as the cellular correlate of cognition and only target of clinical therapeutics, in part because
manipulating neurons rapidly and directly alters behavior. Yet, the human brain is also made of glial cells, which
morphological and genetic complexification is a striking feature of the human brain. Astrocytes, in particular, are
now known to orchestrate many neural functions, crystalizing the possibility of a direct astrocyte contribution to
cognitive functions and mental health. However, a lack of understanding of the rules that govern astrocytes
activity and their involvement in neural circuits has limited our ability to test this idea. Collective work recently
showed that astrocytes transduce neuromodulatory information onto synaptic circuits. Specifically, we found that
α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7nAChRs) on astrocytes regulate the release of the astrocyte transmitter
D-serine onto synapses. Neuromodulation, in particular cholinergic signaling, permits behavioral adaptations to
changes in the environment, and its alteration is linked to cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Coincidently, the
α7nAChR has focalized major drug development efforts in the past decade to restore the cognitive symptoms of
patients with schizophrenia. Here, we will take advantage of this new astrocyte-based α7nAChR pathway to test
the role of astrocytes in cognitive functions and pro-cognitive interventions, and elucidate the mechanisms
through which neuromodulation is sensed and transduced by astrocytes at the cellular and molecular levels. In
doing so, we will test a set of general principles which we hypothesize govern input output fidelity in astrocytes
(positional coupling). In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that α7nAChRs are located in the immediate vicinity
of D-serine pools, directly linking Ca2+ influx through α7nAChR channel activity to the Ca2+-dependent D-serine
release machinery. We will conduct fluorescence Ca2+ imaging studies to understand the spatial, temporal and
molecular rules of α7nAChR-mediated Ca2+ signals and their relation to D-serine release. We will then map the
physical association of α7nAChR and D-serine pools in perisynaptic astrocytic processes, using electron
microscopy. In addition, we will conduct single-particle tracking studies to understand how the dynamic
distribution of α7nAChR at the surface of astrocytes, with respect to D-serine pools, is influenced by the binding
of endogenous and exogenous ligands. In Aim 2, we will generate cell-specific knockout mouse lines to
selectively ablate α7nAChR from astrocytes, excitatory neurons or inhibitory neurons in the brain, and canvas
the contribution of each cell-types to characteristic behaviors supported by α7nAChRs. We recently showed that
an α7nAChR partial agonist tested in Phase-III clinical trials for the treatment of cognitive deficits in patients with
schizophrenia, elevates D-serine levels in the mouse brain. Based on our observations that inactivating
astrocyte-based α7nAChR signaling leads to specific alterations in D-serine levels and cognitive behavior, we
will then test the hypothesis that astrocytes, but not neurons, enable the behavioral efficacy of cognitive
enhancers tested in clinical trials, and that D-serine signaling is the circuit actuator of these effects."

Mechanisms of Mitosis and Size Control in Xenopus
Research in my laboratory is focused on two major areas:
Cell division is arguably the most dramatic event in the life of a cell. Chromosomes condense, organelles
vesiculate, and the microtubule cytoskeleton rearranges into a bipolar spindle that attaches to chromosomes at
their kinetochores and segregates a complete genome to each daughter cell. Although the morphological
changes that occur during mitosis were first observed over a century ago, we still do not understand
how these dynamic events are orchestrated. Many factors have been identified that contribute to spindle
assembly and function, but the molecular and biophysical mechanisms and interactions that ensure mitotic
fidelity remain unclear. Our current projects address outstanding questions including 1) What are the molecular
underpinnings and functional consequences of different spindle architectures? Spindle size and organization
vary dramatically across cell types and organisms, and factors known to affect these parameters are altered in
many cancers, but how specific spindle features are established and their effects on chromosome segregation
and cell division are poorly understood. We will leverage morphometric and phylogenetic comparisons together
with biochemical and functional assays to investigate the dramatic changes in spindle architecture that occur
between oocyte meiosis and the mitotic divisions of early development in Xenopus and the sea squirt Ciona
intestinalis. We will elucidate the role of specific factors in this transition, and examine the consequences of
altering spindle architecture on embryo cell division. 2) What defects in cell division mechanisms underlie
speciation? We have observed chromosome mis-segregation in inviable hybrids generated by fertilizing Xenopus
tropicalis eggs with X. laevis sperm, and identified incompatibility between a subset of paternal centromeres and
maternal cytoplasm as one underlying cause. We will elucidate the molecular basis of inter-species conflicts that
impact cell division and contribute to reproductive isolation. 3) What is the molecular basis of mitotic chromosome
condensation? We have developed a novel approach using optical tweezers to measure the dynamics of single
DNA molecules in real-time in Xenopus egg extracts with high spatial and temporal precision and will use this
system to dissect the roles of key factors in driving mitotic chromosome assembly.
Absolute and relative size of biological entities varies widely, both within and among species at all levels of
organization above the atomic/molecular: the organism, the cells that make up the organism, and the cellular
components. How does scaling occur so that everything fits and functions properly? Correct scaling inside
cells is crucial for cell function, architecture, and division, but until recently the control systems that a
cell uses to regulate the size of its internal structures were virtually unknown. We have established assays
to elucidate mechanisms of intracellular scaling between different-sized frog species and during the rapid,
reductive cell divisions of early embryogenesis. We are further developing these systems to ask: 1) What scales
mitotic chromosome size to cell size? We are testing the hypothesis that a surface area to volume sensor acting
on the interphase nucleus and the mitotic spindle also coordinately adjusts mitotic chromosomes to cell size
during Xenopus development. 2) What are the connections between genome size, cell size, physiology, and
development? Cell size correlates strongly with genome size across evolution, but underlying mechanisms are
unknown. We will utilize different ploidy frog embryos to address how altering genome size affects gene
expression, and a variety of species including the dodecaploid frog Xenopus longipes to investigate relationships
between genome size, cell division mechanisms, development, and physiology.
The means to address these fundamental cell biological questions is enabled by powerful experimental systems
based on cytoplasmic extracts and functional in vivo assays in vertebrate (Xenopus) embryos. We have
established productive collaborations and apply diverse techniques including high-resolution microscopy, single
molecule assays, genomics, proteomics, microfluidics and computational modeling to fill important conceptual
gaps in an innovative, rigorous, and interdisciplinary manner. Our research will continue to provide novel insight
into cell division and size control, processes essential for viability and development, and defective in human
diseases including cancer. Although introduced as distinct topics, cell division and size control are intimately
linked. We are increasingly focused on how cross-species comparisons can elucidate molecular mechanisms
underlying cell division and size control, as well as how biological constraints related to these processes have
shaped evolution. Together, these projects uniquely advance our understanding of long-standing questions in
biology."
10914767,"The Rhind lab studies questions of cellular growth control and organization. We are interested in how cells
make organizational decisions without obvious external input; in effect, how cells create order out of chaos.
The two particular questions that we are currently focusing on are how cells decide when to divide, in order to
maintain cell-size homeostasis, and how cells decide when to activate individual DNA replication origins, in
order to regulate the spatial and temporal organization of DNA replication.
 The mechanism of cell-size regulation is an enduring mystery in cell biology. The ability to maintain size
homeostasis is an essential cellular function, and regulation of proper cell size is a key feature of differentiation,
required for cellular function from tiny platelets to enormous oocytes. Moreover, loss of size homeostasis is a
characteristic of many cancers and tissue-degenerative diseases. Although recent progress has been made on
specific mechanisms in several systems, there is still no system in which the problem is well understood. We
study cell size in fission yeast because it affords a well-characterized, evolutionarily conserved and experimentally tractable system. We are investigating the hypothesis that cell size in fission yeast is controlled by the
size-dependent expression of two mitotic activators: Cdc13 and Cdc25. We have shown that both Cdc13 and
Cdc25 levels increase in proportion to cell size, and propose that this size-dependent expression prevents cells
from entering mitosis until they reach their correct size for division. We are currently working to test that hypothesis directly and to understand how these two proteins are expressed in size-dependent manners.
 DNA replication timing is a fundamental aspect of nuclear metabolism. Well-organized replication timing
is essential for timely completion of replication and thus stable genome inheritance. Replication timing is also
correlated with, and has been proposed to regulate, gene expression, chromatin modification, chromosome
structure, and genome evolution. Dysregulated replication timing is a feature of cancer cells and contributes to
their genome instability and pathological gene-expression phenotypes. Replication timing is regulated by the
timing of replication origin firing, which is in turn regulated by the probability of firing, which varies between
origins. To investigate the regulation of origin firing, we have pioneered single-molecule origin mapping techniques that allow us to measure both the location and firing probability of origins across the genome. Our results and the results of others that have shown how the heterogeneity of origin firing at the single cell level is
averaged over the population to produce emergent replication timing patterns. It is therefore critical to understand how the probability of origin firing is regulated. We are pursuing this question in both budding yeast,
which affords well-defined and well-characterized origins for specific mechanistic experiments, and mammalian cells, which allow us to apply what we learn to more complicated genomes and developmental pathways."

Carbohydrates are ubiquitous and play a vital role in many important biological processes. The development of
efficient and selective chemical methods for the synthesis of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates is necessary
to understand the specific roles of carbohydrates and for therapeutic development. The most prevalent
functionality in carbohydrates is the hydroxyl group. There are two fundamental challenges in carbohydrate
synthesis associated with the hydroxyl group: 1) site-selective functionalization of one hydroxyl in the presence
of many other seemingly identical hydroxyls, and 2) stereoselective glycosylation. One long-term goal of this
program is to develop methods to address these challenges and improve the efficiency and selectivity for
carbohydrate synthesis. In the next five years, we will develop methods that can site-selectively functionalize
hydroxyl groups, such as acylation, alkylation, and sulfation, in various minimally protected or unprotected
glycosides in a predictable and general manner. We will also develop methods that can site-selectively remove
protecting groups in carbohydrates. The directing groups that are site-selectively installed in carbohydrates will
also allow us to access various types of glycosidic linkages stereoselectively. These transformations can
significantly improve the efficiency and selectivity for the synthesis of carbohydrates.
The other long-term goal of this program is to prepare carbohydrates and glycocongates with novel biological
functions. Certain glycans on glycoproteins can be recognized by lysosome targeting receptors (LTRs), which
then transport the glycoproteins to the lysosome for degradation. To take advantage of this natural process,
lysosome targeting chimeras were recently reported for the degradation of disease-associated extracellular
proteins. These degraders are created by conjugating carbohydrate ligands of LTRs on the cell surface with
ligands that can bind to the extracellular protein targets. The receptor-ligand interaction then triggers the
internalization of the extracellular proteins through receptor-mediated endocytosis, which further induces the
degradation of the endogenous extracellular protein targets in the lysosome. This new strategy complements
existing targeted protein degradation methods, which largely focus on intracellular proteins. In the next five
years, we will develop a series of carbohydrate-based ligands for LTRs that can be used for the degradation of
various extracellular disease associated proteins.
During our previous studies, we recognized the enormous potential of transition metal catalysts and chiral
organocatalysts in carbohydrate synthesis and the unique utility of glycoconjugates in cell-type selective
targeted protein degradation. In the next five years, we will continue developing novel methods for the
synthesis of carbohydrates and glycoconjugates, studying their applications in targeted protein degradation,

Pemphigus vulgaris is a devastating B-cell mediated autoimmune disease. Autoantibodies produced by B cells
targeting desmoglein-3 (Dsg3), a desmosomal protein, critical for intercellular adhesion, is responsible for the
mucosal-dominant type of the disease and cause painful deep erosions in the mucosa. Anti-Dsg3
autoantibodies result in the disruption of the keratinocytes' connections, and, thereby, cause the formation of
blisters and erosions. The direct pathogenic role of anti-Dsg3 autoantibodies in PV has been established.
Monovalent antibodies have been shown to be sufficient to result in the formation of blisters. Standard
treatments include immunosuppressive drugs that globally suppress the immune system. The goal of this
project is to develop novel, targeted, immuno-therapeutic approaches to specifically and precisely target and
deplete autoreactive B cells recognizing Dsg3. Established Dsg3 specific autoreactive B cells are used to
optimize these methods. We will determine the efficacy and specificity of the approach using peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) obtained from PV patients in different phases of the disease, including treatment-
naive and relapse, and in vivo mouse models of the disease. Successful completion of this study will help
translate the methods into a preclinical and, eventually, a clinical setting. The ease of production, low cost,
compared to cell-based targeted approaches, and the lack of off-target side-effects compared to the existing
treatments for PV make the proposed therapeutics breakthrough treatment options. Furthermore, the
technology developed here can have wider applications to all autoantibody-driven diseases by directly
targeting autoreactive cells without causing global immunosuppression."
10742934,"Virulence gene regulators of enteric bacterial pathogens: Determining the structural and functional
mechanisms of small molecule and polypeptide inhibitors
Summary:
The AraC/XylS family is one of the largest families of bacterial transcription factors with ~16K members
distributed amongst 81% of sequenced bacterial species. Family members are present in pathogenic genera
including Acinetobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Legionella, Pseudomonas, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, and
Yersinia. The regulon of any given family member typically encompasses one of three categories: metabolism,
stress response, or pathogenesis. Those involved in metabolism or stress response often have well
characterized ligands. For example, AraC regulates the expression of genes involved in arabinose metabolism
and its activity is modulated by arabinose. In contrast, small molecule ligands have not been identified for the
vast majority of virulence regulators within the AraC family (hereafter referred to as AraC-VRs), which has led
to the commonly held belief that the AraC-VR branch of the family has lost the ability to respond to ligands.
Published work by us and others –and our preliminary studies– suggest that this assumption is incorrect.
Additionally, a large family of endogenously encoded polypeptides, ANRs for AraC negative regulators, have
been discovered that inhibit AraC-VRs though an unknown mechanism.
The long-term goal of this project is to define the structural and molecular mechanisms underlying virulence
gene regulation. The specific objectives of this proposal are to determine how AraC family members including
Rns, a primary virulence regulator in enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), are inhibited by 1) small molecule fatty
acids and 2) AraC negative regulators (ANRs). Our central hypothesis is that Rns must dimerize in order to
bind to DNA and regulate transcription and that these inhibitors block this by distinct mechanisms. The
motivating rationale for these studies is that they will identify the molecular and structural requirements for
inhibiting virulence gene expression, and will be tested by three specific aims: 1) Determine the structural
mechanism by which ligand binding and dimerization regulates Rns activity; 2) Test our hypothesis that the
Rns homolog RegA is regulated in the same manner; 3) Determine the mechanism by which ANRs inhibit Rns
activity, and clarify if this is distinct from the inhibitory mechanism of small molecule fatty acids.
This project is innovative in that the basic molecular mechanisms by which these proteins are regulated are not
understood. Our multidisciplinary team, with expertise in microbiology, biochemistry, and structural biology, is
uniquely positioned to undertake the proposed studies to determine these mechanisms. This research is
significant, not only because it will answer outstanding questions of how AraC proteins function in enteric
pathogens, but because we expect to demonstrate that AraC family proteins from a wide variety of enteric
pathogens share a common mechanism of being inhibited by fatty acids. This will open up new possibilities for
therapeutic strategies to combat global mortality and morbidity."
10796871,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of our research is to identify mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of
photoreceptor outer segments and vision. In retinal degenerative blinding diseases, loss of ciliated
photoreceptor outer segments precedes the death of photoreceptor neurons. Therefore, a thorough
understanding of the mechanisms behind the stability of the cilia is needed to uncover molecules required for
photoreceptor survival. The specific goal of this proposal is to identify the importance of post-translational
modifications of tubulins in the maintenance of cilia and photoreceptor function. Altered tubulin modifications
are a known cause of human blindness. We will investigate the need for a small GTPase that belongs to the
ARF-like family of proteins, ARL13B, and its role in photoreceptor ciliary maintenance, tubulin modifications,
and function. Our studies will investigate whether altering tubulin modifications will protect photoreceptors
and rescue visual response in various genetic models for retinal degenerative diseases. We will use a
combination of unique animal models, cell culture models, and in vitro biochemical analyses to
comprehensively address the requirement for tubulin modification and their regulation in ciliated
photoreceptors.
Our proposed studies are aligned with the Retinal Diseases Program of the NEI to “Elucidate the molecular
mechanisms that lead to photoreceptor degeneration, including signal transduction pathways, defects in
protein folding, ciliogenesis, functional compartmentalization, or trafficking, and translate these molecular
footholds into therapies for Mendelian and complex diseases.” The findings from the proposed studies have
clinical implications, such as therapy for inherited retinal diseases that lead to blindness."
10757945,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Opioids were involved in 75,673 overdose deaths in 2020 in the U.S. Fentanyl, an opioid mu-receptor (MOR)
agonist acting on central MORs produces analgesia, but depresses ventilation that could be lethal. Rapid
intravenous injection of overdose fentanyl, particularly in Illicit use, is the deadliest. It triggers an apnea leading
to sudden death within minutes in ~1/3 of adults (male > female) with ~75% of fentanyl sequestered by the lungs
after injection. Naloxone is the preferable treatment for post-overdose, but not viable for the illicit FNT users who
are found pulseless upon the arrival of emergency medical services. Moreover, naloxone counteracts analgesia
with potentially life-threatening side effects. Central apnea, upper airway obstruction, and chest wall rigidity are
assumed to be accountable for the sudden death, but the exact cause of the death and the effective
countermeasure remain unknown, constituting a critical and unmet therapeutic clinical need.
Bronchopulmonary C-fibers (PCFs) are the major sensory nerve endings innervating the airways and lungs and
crucial in the control of respiratory rhythm. PCF stimulation could elicit central apnea and vocal closure likely by
promoting release of glutamate or substance P to activate PCF 2nd-order neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarius
via AMPA and neurokinin-1 receptor. We have reported that intravenous bolus injection of a low dose fentanyl
triggers a PCF-mediated brief apnea, consistent with previously reported excitation of dorsal root ganglion C-
neurons by MOR agonists via Gs-cAMP pathway. Our preliminary data show a triple apnea (central apnea, vocal
closure and laryngeal constriction/collapse) coupled with chest wall rigidity, resulting in death within minutes in
anesthetized adult rats after overdose fentanyl is rapidly injected. In this proposal, we seek to establish the first
animal model of fentanyl-induced sudden death following triple apnea in awake adult rats and determine the
dependency of triple apnea (death) on the gender and peripheral (especially vagal) MORs/µ1Rs (Aim 1). We will
further demonstrate that fentanyl directly stimulates PCFs to evoke triple apnea by acting on MOR/µ1R and Gs-
cAMP pathway, thereby promote PCF release of glutamate and SP to activate the 2nd-order neurons (Aim 2).
Our pilot study has shown that intravenous injection of dermorphin (a peripherally acting MOR agonist) induces
MOR internalization in vagal sensory neurons and blocks fentanyl-induced triple apnea. The β-arrestin-mediated
signaling is known to be responsible for MOR desensitization/internalization. We will define that diamorphine has
limited impact on baseline cardiorespiratory activity, but internalizes PCFs' MORs/µ1Rs via activation of β-
arrestin-signaling to prevents the triple apnea (death) with no change in analgesia. This will present a potential
safer and translational pretreatment for overdose fentanyl in clinical settings (Aim 3). A multidisciplinary approach
(electrophysiology, immunohistochemistry, pharmacology and biochemistry) at systemic and cellular levels will
be applied to elucidate the mechanisms underlying not only triple apnea (death) but also the lack of triple apnea
after dermorphin pretreatment. The expected data will, for the first time, mechanistically reveal the key role of
PCFs in generating fentanyl-induced triple apnea and provide a novel and potential countermeasure of
dermorphin pretreatment to prevent/diminish the sudden death."
10752655,"FAT cadherins and vascular remodeling
Vascular remodeling is a critical process in the pathogenesis of major vascular diseases such
as atherosclerosis, restenosis, saphenous vein graft occlusion, and transplant-associated
arteriosclerosis. Factors that control the activities of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs)
during vascular remodeling remain incompletely understood. Fat cadherins belong to an ancient
family of large, single pass type I transmembrane proteins found throughout Metazoans;
conserved functions of these proteins affect cell growth and polarity and span from Drosophila
to mammals. The FAT1 cadherin is expressed by SMCs in multiple animal models of vascular
disease and in injured human arteries. We have found that inactivation of the Fat1 locus in
SMCs permits dramatic increases in proliferation and neointimal formation in a mouse model of
vascular injury. Interestingly, the FAT1 molecule undergoes complex processing: while cleavage
and translocation of the FAT1 intracellular domain (ICD) to the cell nucleus was reported
several years ago, we found an accumulation of FAT1 fragments within mitochondria, wherein
these FAT1mito species interact selectively with inner membrane proteins and exert critical
regulatory control over oxidative phosphorylation, limiting the activities of respiratory Complexes
I and II and inhibiting cell growth. FAT1 also has substantial effects on SMC gene expression,
promoting expression of SMC marker genes both in vitro and in vivo; interestingly, the FAT1ICD
is also found in the cell nucleus, raising the possibility of more direct involvement in gene
regulation. In this project, we will assess how FAT1 signals from different locations within the
cell, and assess whether these activities are complementary, oppositional, or overlapping to
control SMC phenotype. We will investigate intra- and extracellular sequences in FAT1 and
interactions with structurally-related proteins FAT4 and DCHS1 that may control how FAT1 is
processed and thereby directed to distinct compartments. To assess relevance to key disease
processes in vivo, we will assess how these signaling activities affect vascular remodeling and
atherosclerosis in mouse models."
10766792,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hypoglycemic complications are the major barrier to achieving healthy blood glucose levels in persons
with diabetes (PWD). This is largely predicated by a significant knowledge gap regarding how exposure
to well-known risk factors, such as recurrent iatrogenic hypoglycemia, exercise, or alcohol
consumption, leads to the subsequent impairment of the counterregulatory response (CRR) to
hypoglycemia. Thus, clinical interventions aimed at reducing hypoglycemia in PWD are limited to
behavioral modification, such as short-term adjustment of treatment regimens, often at the expense of
decreased glycemic control. To improve outcomes for PWD, truly efficacious treatments for the
prevention of hypoglycemic complications must be developed. This project is designed to develop pre-
clinical data that identifies druggable targets for the prevention of hypoglycemic complications, thus
addressing the significant treatment burden in PWD caused by hypoglycemia. The PI has recently
completed a series of studies that suggest a novel role for leptin signaling in gating the physiological
response to severe hypoglycemia. This work supports our principal hypothesis that stimuli that lower
leptin levels may inhibit the response to severe hypoglycemia by evoking a “pseudostarvation”
phenotype. More critically, this body of work suggests that interventions that prevent the transition to a
“starvation” phenotype could prevent impairment of the CRR. The overarching goal of this project is to
definitively establish the role of hypoleptinemia in the pathophysiological impairment of the CRR while
developing pre-clinical data that identifies druggable targets for the prevention of hypoglycemic
complications. In order to achieve these objectives, the PI has assembled a team of investigators with
extensive expertise in glucose counterregulation, energy homeostasis, and leptin signaling to achieve
the following specific aims: 1) Elucidate the role of hypoleptinemia in altering glucose counterregulation
during hypoglycemia and starvation. 2) Ascertain the mechanisms by which recurrent hypoglycemia
induces hypoleptinemia. 3) Determine whether leptin treatment can prevent impaired hypoglycemic
counterregulation induced by conditions known to increase hypoglycemic complications in PWD, such
as exercise and alcohol consumption. We anticipate that our proposed studies will demonstrate that
hypoleptinemia functionally drives increased susceptibility to hypoglycemia by impairing the CRR in
physiologically and translationally relevant states. If so, these results will not only identify the first
endocrine mechanism driving hypoglycemic risk, but they will also identify a clinically tractable
treatment for the prevention of hypoglycemia."
10755605,"Metalloproteins are critical cellular workhorses, catalyzing difficult but essential transformations that are required
for functions as diverse as energy generation, metabolism, or signaling. The interplay between protein structure
and catalytic activity of these enzymes forms the foundation of our work. The protein may influence both the first
coordination sphere (ligand type, number, and relative geometry) as well as the outer coordination environment.
Despite the indispensable nature of this chemistry, a fundamental understanding of the relationship between
metal ion catalysts and a protein scaffold remains elusive. While native metalloenzyme studies provide valuable
insights, interpretations of these systems are often inadequate because of the intricacy of the scaffold or the
presence of multiple metal centers. Similarly, small molecules can afford insight on reactions but are often limited
by the solvent or synthetic complexity. For this reason, we utilize an intermediate approach with de novo design
of -helical proteins which are easily synthesized, water soluble, recapitulate native metalloprotein active sites
well, and provide native-like folds that can be manipulated simply in order to limit the variables that are probed
during our studies. Our long-term goal is to describe to full chemical resolution the processes by which metals
interact with three stranded coiled-coils (3SCC) composed of -helical proteins in order to achieve specific metal
structures and afford the desired catalysis. The overall objective is to insert metals into well-defined scaffolds
that can then be altered to test important hypotheses that will explain how these catalytic centers work. Our
central hypothesis is that well-defined de novo metalloproteins can be used to interrogate metal behavior within
designed proteins in ways that would be difficult to achieve with native proteins or small molecules. Our basic
premise is that de novo protein design provides simple, highly-controllable, and easily modified scaffolds that
are well suited to extract fundamental information on metal chemistry. These structures provide a framework to
examine and compare systematic perturbations to different coordination sites in aqueous peptidic environments,
which is often difficult to do with small molecule models, especially those insoluble in water. The rationale of the
proposed research is that it will provide new information on protein-metal interactions that have eluded the
scrutiny of other approaches due to the complexity or insolubility of the natural systems. These studies will eventually
form the basis for developing new catalysts with different functions using essentially the same protein ligands but differentmetals.
We can also now explore the influence of asymmetric first and second coordination sphere environments and changing the
helical twist on the structural and catalytic behavior of proteins. Our hypothesis will be tested through three Specific Aims:
1) Evaluation of catalytic activity for metal centers within existing 3SCC; 2) Assessing for the first time
modifications to catalytic activity caused by insertion of sequence discontinuities; and 3) Using our breakthrough
preparation of heavy metal templated heterotrimeric 3SCCs to generate asymmetric metal catalysts. This
research is significant and innovative as it identifies new approaches to optimize biomolecular catalysis."
10749054,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Dynamic gene expression programs drive essential biological processes including cellular differentiation and
stress response pathways. During these processes, cells must simultaneously activate and repress distinct
clusters of genes to facilitate the necessary shift in proteome synthesis. How gene repression is achieved
amidst widespread transcriptional activation is not well understood. My lab has recently discovered a
regulatory mechanism in budding yeast meiosis that achieves such coordination. Central to this mechanism is
the transcription factor-driven expression of an alternative mRNA isoform called LUTI (Long Undecoded
Transcript Isoform) from a distal gene promoter. This mRNA cannot produce functional protein due to
competitive upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its extended 5' leader. Instead, its transcription serves
to repress the canonical mRNA transcription in cis through chromatin modifications, ultimately leading to
inhibition of protein synthesis. Therefore, transcription of these mRNAs, despite carrying a full coding region,
can directly cause gene repression. Consequently, a single transcription factor can synchronously activate and
repress protein synthesis for distinct sets of genes, depending whether it binds to a canonical or a LUTI
promoter, respectively. Furthermore, this mechanism is tunable and reversible, making it ideal for fluid cell
state transitions that rely on dynamic changes in gene expression.
 The LUTI-based mechanism is neither limited to meiosis nor restricted to budding yeast, as it occurs
during the unfolded protein response and is conserved in human cells. Importantly, the two essential branches
of this regulation are both associated with human disease. First, misregulation of alternative transcription start
sites is widespread across multiple cancers. Second, disruption of uORF expression is linked to a variety of
disorders ranging from gonadal dysgenesis to melanoma. Therefore, dissecting the mechanism and biological
scope of LUTI-based regulation is critical for our understanding of how cells control their gene expression
programs, and how mistakes in this process can lead to pathological states. This proposal seeks to address
fundamental questions regarding the mechanism and function of LUTI-based regulation in yeast and human
cells. Experiments proposed in aim 1 will investigate how transcriptional repression is achieved by activation of
LUTI promoters during meiosis and the unfolded protein response, where LUTIs are pervasively expressed.
Experiments proposed in aim 2 will elucidate how the LUTI-based regulation is integrated into larger signaling
networks to ensure precise and robust cell state transitions. Finally, experiments proposed in aim 3 will
determine the evolutionarily conserved aspects of LUTI-based regulation and uncover the biological roles of
LUTIs during human embryonic stem cell differentiation. The combination of studies described in this proposal
will illuminate how cells dynamically control their gene expression programs with transcription factor-driven
waves of coordinated gene activation and repression, not anticipated prior to our discovery of LUTIs."
10771133,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is the fourth lethal cancer in the U.S. with a 5-year survival rate of
only ~10%. The mainstay of therapy in PDA is chemotherapy, however, the majority of the tumors rapidly
develop treatment resistance. Therefore, a critical need exists to understand what drives the emergence of
drug resistance in PDA, and to develop better treatment strategies. One contributing factor to drug resistance
in PDA is the tumor microenvironment, which is characterized by abundant stroma, rich in extracellular matrix
(ECM) proteins, most frequently secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts. The stroma and the secreted ECM
proteins can induce resistance towards chemotherapies, which work by inflicting DNA damage. One way for
the stroma to induce chemo-resistance would be by enhancing DNA repair. Our data show that the cancer-
associated fibroblast-secreted ECM proteins stimulate DNA repair in PDA tumor cells, making them more
resistant to treatments. The overall objective of this application is to investigate the mechanistic basis by which
the tumor microenvironment, and particularly secreted stromal and ECM proteins, stimulate DNA repair. Our
central hypothesis is that the candidate protein we have identified, called N-Myc-Downstream Regulated Gene
1 (NDRG1), conveys signals from the ECM contact to the DNA repair machinery, and our preliminary data
support this hypothesis. To test this hypothesis further, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) to
determine the detailed signaling events by which secreted ECM proteins lead to NDRG1 activation; 2) to
determine the mechanism by which NDRG1 regulates DNA repair; and 3) to assess the efficacy of NDRG1-
pathway inhibition in enhancing chemotherapy in patient-derived organoids and in vivo models of pancreatic
cancer. The research proposed here is innovative, in our opinion, because the research on chemoresistance
and DNA repair has not been studied in the context of adhesion signaling and stromal microenvironment, nor
has the protein we propose to study here, NDRG1, been linked to DNA repair. Therefore, successful
completion of this work would lead to a more complete mechanistic understanding on how tumor-stroma cross-
talk and fibroblast-secreted matrix proteins regulate DNA repair, and how NDRG1 protein contributes to DNA
repair and treatment resistance. These contributions are expected to be significant because they reveal novel
DNA repair biology that is regulated by extracellular matrix environment in one of the most lethal, stroma rich
and drug resistant cancers, and will allow us to test whether targeting this signaling pathway will enhance
chemotherapy efficacy."
10837875,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Investigating the origin of cell types is key to understanding basic processes in developmental biology and to
enable in vitro production of cells and tissues for therapeutic benefit. While major advances in our understanding
the ontogeny of hematopoietic cells have been made, significant technical limitations have precluded us from
having a full picture of the lineage relationships of blood cells during development. For instance, the prevailing
view in the field is that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that emerge in the embryo are the cells responsible for
lifelong blood production in the mammal. However, limited data exist that analyse the long-term fate of the earliest
hematopoietic progenitors entirely in situ. Furthermore, the field still lacks a conclusive understanding of the true
anatomical site of origin of the cells that will become the lifelong HSCs/progenitors in the adult. The Camargo
and Hormoz laboratories have pioneered the use of in situ mammalian barcoding strategies to perform lineage
tracing at the single cell level. Our proposal here aims to utilize these systems investigate the developmental
origins of hematopoiesis. Our application is based on our identification of a population of non-transplantable
embryonic multipotent progenitors (eMPPs) that contribute long-term to post-natal hematopoiesis.
These findings imply that progenitor populations in addition to traditional HSCs have an active and substantial
contribution to adult multilineage blood production. Our first goal in this application is to further characterize
eMPPs molecularly and functionally. We will also explore the idea that functional differences in hematopoietic
lineages can arise based on their eMPP or HSC ontogeny. Finally, we will extend the use of our barcoding
approaches to broadly and unbiasedly characterize developmental waves of blood production and their exact
site of origin. Our work has the potential to uncover basic mechanisms of blood development that could be useful
for therapeutic manipulation."
10771235,"ABSTRACT OVERALL
The main goal of our IPCAVD Program grant is to evaluate in humans self-amplifying mRNA
(saRNA) vaccines that express two HIV-1 Env-derived protein immunogens that activate and
initiate the maturation of VRC01-class B cell receptors (BCRs). The first immunogen,
426c.Mod.Core, was specifically designed to bind with high affinity to the unmutated (germline,
gl) forms of those BCRs as they are expressed on the surface of naïve B cells. The second
immunogen, HxB2.WT.Core, although unable to bind germline VRC01-class BCRs, binds the
VRC01-class BCRs that became activated by 426c.Mod.Core and have accumulated some
somatic mutations. As a result, the boost immunization with HxB2.WT.Core furthers the
maturation of the VRC01-class antibodies elicited by the 426c.Mod.Core. These observations
were made with the adjuvanted recombinant (rec) forms of these two immunogens. As mRNA-
based vaccines are less costly and more easily GMP-manufactured that rec proteins, we
believe that they will accelerate the preclinical and clinical evaluation of HIV-1 Env-derived
immunogens. Here, we propose to first compare preclinically the VRC01 B cell and antibody
responses elicited by these two Env immunogens when delivered by saRNA vaccines to those
elicited by the corresponding adjuvanted rec proteins. And then, if the results are promising, the
saRNA vaccines expressing the two immunogens will be GMP-manufactured for clinical
evaluation. As the 426c.Mod.Core adjuvanted rec protein will be evaluated clinically (phase I) in
the spring of 2022 (HVTN301) and the HxB2.WT.Core rec protein is currently being GMP
manufactured for a follow-up phase I clinical evaluation in 2023, we will be in a unique position
to compare the VRC01 B cell and antibody responses elicited by humans immunized with these
two HIV-1 Env-derived immunogens when delivered as adjuvanted rec proteins and as
expressed by saRNA vaccines. To accomplish our goals in this IPCAVD grant we will take
advantage of our expertise in immunogen-design and testing, expertise in the analysis of B cell
and antibody responses elicited by vaccination and during infection, our ability to rapidly
sequence BCR genes using high through put technologies, the availability of appropriate animal
models, our expertise in saRNA vaccine technology, our unique expertise in conducting clinical
testing of HIV-1 vaccines, the existing collaboration among the participating groups and the
documented expertise of the participants to successfully manage complex Programs."
10720896,"This application is for a competitive renewal of the SRCS program of Dr. Hamid M. Said.
Dr. Said’s program focuses on studying: i) cellular/molecular mechanisms involved in the
absorption/transport of water-soluble vitamins (Vit. B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9 and C) in organ of
the digestive system (small intestine, colon, pancreas) under normal physiological conditions; ii)
how these processes are regulated at the cellular, molecular and genetic/epigenetic levels; iii) how
internal and external/environmental factors and disease conditions affect these processes leading
to deficiencies; and iv) how genetic mutations in the transporters involved lead to impairment in the
function of these transporters and development of systemic and/or localized (tissue-specific)
deficiencies. Water-soluble vitamins are essential micronutrients for normal human health and well-
being, and their deficiencies (whether systemic or localized) lead to a host of serious clinical
abnormalities that range from anemia to neurological, cardiovascular and dermatological disorders
as well as growth retardation, among many others. The incidences of deficiency/sub-optimal levels
of water-soluble vitamins are common in our Veterans as well as in the general population, and
occur due to a variety of causes/conditions including chronic alcohol consumption, chronic
exposure to cigarette smoke, intestinal diseases (inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease,
intestinal resection), infection with foodborne enteric-pathogens, diabetes mellitus, drug-nutrient
interactions, and aging. Our program utilizes state-of-the-art approaches to address our aims. This
include using tissue-specific and global knockout animal models, isolated
cells/membranes/organelles, human primary enteroids and colonoids, advanced molecular and
confocal imaging techniques, among others. We have led the field globally with over 260 original
peer-reviewed and original research articles (plus many reviews/book chapters and books). We
were the first to identify the existence of specific carrier-mediated processes for transport of many
of the water-soluble vitamins mentioned above, identify/characterize the transport systems
involved, delineate how expression and function of these transporters are regulated at the
transcriptional/post-transcriptional/post-translational levels, study their cell biology with regards to
targeting to the appropriate cell/organelle membrane domains, how they are trafficked
intracellularly, and how these events are affected by genetic clinical mutations. We also pioneered
the work on effect of exogenous/environmental factors (e. g., chronic alcohol exposure, enteric
pathogens and bacterial toxins, drug-vitamin interactions, chronic exposure to cigarette smoke) on
absorption and transport of these micronutrients as well as that of internal factors (e. g., chronic
exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines and to pathophysiological hypoxia). We were also the first
to describe the existence of efficient and specific carrier-mediated uptake processes in the human
colon for the absorption of the many microbiota-generated water-vitamins. Another key hallmarks
of our program has been the collaboration we have established with local and national VAs and
university investigators, as well the mentoring/training of many Jr. investigators in advanced cell
and molecular physiology and pathophysiology. Our program has been continuously funded by
multiple VA and NIH awards for over 35 years. This current application is intended to highlight the
success of our program and to request renewal of the SRCS award so that we can continue our
progress towards new heights of successes as well as to mentor a new generation of investigators."
10827468,"ABSTRACT: Sepsis is a dangerous hyper-inflammatory condition that carries a mortality rate of 25% for
uncomplicated cases and rises to 80% for patients who develop multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).
No specific therapies for MODS exist, which is why identification of druggable targets and biomarkers for
diagnosis/prognosis are urgently needed. During the acute phase response in sepsis, circulating factors such
as cytokines and endotoxins cause oxidative stress and derangements in mitochondrial morphology and
function in the heart, ultimately leading to septic cardiomyopathy (SepCM), a manifestation of MODS.
Prohibitins (PHB1,2) are proteins that assemble in hetero-oligomeric complexes within the mitochondrial inner
membrane and in plasma membrane lipid rafts, where studies show they are at the nexus of many vital cellular
functions including metabolism, proliferation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. The current proposal stems from
our recent findings that PHB1 is a dynamic acute phase reactant protein in sepsis, and its secretion during
sepsis is abrogated in mice lacking the anti-inflammatory transcription factor Nrf2 (i.e., NFE2L2). Importantly,
bloodborne PHB1 is biologically active, as administration of recombinant human PHB1 (rPHB1) activates PI3K-
AKT signaling and enhances aerobic glucose oxidation and pentose phosphate pathway in the heart, and
preserves cardiac mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPHOS) in mouse models of sepsis. We also
have very exciting preliminary evidence that serum PHB1 levels are associated with MODS and mortality in
sepsis patients. Experiments outlined in this proposal will test our central hypothesis that bloodborne PHB1 is a
stress-induced ‘hepatokine’ that mediates a liver-to-heart protective feedback signal during sepsis by
enhancing oxidative glucose metabolism (i.e. suppressing lactate production) and preserving mitochondrial
structure and function in the myocardium. This cardioprotective effect of circulating PHB1 can be
therapeutically exploited to treat SepCM.
 Our established interdisciplinary team will test this hypothesis in three Aims. Work in Aim 1 will determine
the Nrf2-mediated mechanisms controlling PHB1 secretion in hepatocytes. In Aim 2 we will identify the
mechanisms of cardio-protection conferred by circulating PHB1 during sepsis. Work in Aim 3 will validate
serum PHB1 as a predictive biomarker of morbidity and mortality in a cohort of patients with established sepsis
(INVACS cohort, University of Utah). Each Aim is hypothesis-driven, and the work will be performed using
gain/loss-of-function approaches in primary cell culture, clinically relevant mouse models of severe sepsis, and
serum samples from a well-characterized cohort of sepsis patients. We will leverage the complementary and
uniquely distinct expertise of our research team to elucidate cardioprotective mechanisms of circulating PHB1,
and to exploit these mechanisms to treat a very serious and deadly clinical condition."
10796839,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infertility affects approximately 10% of women in the United States and is increasingly becoming more
common. Recent studies suggest that, in addition to its reproductive consequences, infertility is associated with
the development of chronic disease and all-cause mortality. Two examples of this phenomenon that are
supported by the literature are risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS), both of
which are more common in women and have elevated risks after menopause. CVD is the leading cause of
death in women, and MetS has a prevalence of approximately 30% and increases risk for mortality. It is likely
that there are shared pathways between infertility and CVD and MetS, such as increased inflammation, which
may modulate risk for both conditions. Thus evaluating women with infertility for future CVD and MetS provides
a unique opportunity for preventative measures and personalized treatments within the context of infertility
evaluations. One way to identify women at increased risk for CVD and MetS is through examining differences
in DNA methylation. DNA methylation is one mechanism through which gene expression responds to changes
in the environment, hormone status, or other physiologic processes. These changes may occur prior to the
onset of symptomatic disease and can identify women at increased risk for adverse outcomes. This study will
evaluate three DNA methylation-based predictors of long-term health, CVD, and MetS in 125 women with
infertility and 125 women without infertility who are undergoing in vitro fertilization. We will also evaluate
associations with low ovarian reserve, which is predictive of time to menopause and may also associate with
increased risk. First, we will assess an indicator of cellular age acceleration that is predictive of health-span
and all-cause mortality. Then, we will leverage combinations of CpG sites to predict a CVD methylation risk
score and a separate MetS methylation risk score. We hypothesize that infertility and low ovarian reserve will
be associated with increased age acceleration, which would serve as a general marker of future disease and
mortality. We hypothesize that the CVD methylation risk score will be associated with infertility and low ovarian
reserve due to putative links between infertility and later development of CVD. Finally, we hypothesize that
infertility and low ovarian reserve will be associated with increased MetS methylation risk scores as obesity
and other MetS risk factors play a role in infertility. If successful, this proposal would provide further evidence
that infertility is linked to other long-term health conditions, and would identify a predictive marker of future
disease that could be evaluated as part of treatment for infertility. This proposal will also inform subsequent
R01 submissions to further establish non-reproductive impacts of infertility and allow for follow-up until disease
onset."
10815588,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Performing skilled actions relies on two fundamental abilities: imitating movements to quickly learn new
behaviors, and using tools to more efficiently manipulate our environments. Imitation and tool use are critical
for many activities of daily living; loss of these abilities in the clinical disorder of limb apraxia, frequently
observed in many neurological disorders including in ~50% of individuals with left-hemisphere stroke, is the
strongest predictor of increased caregiver dependence and poor post-stroke recovery. Despite the recognized
importance of these abilities, the processing mechanisms underlying imitation and tool use remain unclear, in
large part due to the challenges associated with studying them. Imitation and tool use both involve translating
conceptual cognitive goals (i.e., knowing how to serve a tennis ball) into intricate sets of motor commands (i.e.,
accurately hitting a tennis ball with a racket). Hence, the study of imitation and tool use requires merging many
concepts from cognitive and motor neuroscience. This proposal aims to bridge this cognitive-motor divide by
developing a new theory of the common mechanisms supporting imitation and tool use that explains how
conceptual goals are actually turned into motor commands.
 The proposed theory builds on our prior research by hypothesizing two interacting processing routes: (1) A
route that specifies actions in terms of the trajectory of the end-effector (e.g., writing letters), affording an
efficient means of defining desired tool or hand motion in an abstract (body-independent) manner, and (2) A
route that specifies actions in terms of body configurations, providing a more detailed but still computationally
tractable description of the positioning of the entire limb (and tool) throughout an action. While these two routes
typically work together, they may be engaged to different extents due to task demands (e.g., focusing on racket
trajectories or shoulder-elbow-wrist positions during a tennis serve) or when the different brain regions
supporting these distinct processing routes become disrupted. Thus, evidence of these two routes will be
established through novel task-switching paradigms in healthy individuals, measuring behavioral impairments
due to transient disruptions of relevant brain regions using transcranial magnetic stimulation, or by quantifying
chronic deficits in patients with left-hemisphere strokes. We will apply novel rigorous kinematic analyses to
assess behavior, correlate patient impairments with clinical measures of apraxia, and use recently-developed
multivariate lesion-symptom mapping approaches to confirm the neuroanatomical bases of these routes.
Together, such efforts will identify and characterize how trajectory and body-configuration planning support the
production and perception of imitation and tool use actions. Results will not only advance our understanding of
apraxia, highlighting alternative compensatory pathways that might be targeted for rehabilitation treatment, but
serves as a model for studying cognitive-motor interactions more broadly."
10849620,"Platelets play a central role in hemostasis via injury site-selective multi-step mechanisms of: (1) Adhesion to vWF
and collagen, (2) Fibrinogen-mediated aggregation to form the primary hemostatic plug, (3) Biointerfacial
presentation of anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) on the activated platelet surface for procoagulant amplification
of thrombin (hence fibrin), and (4) clot-localized secretion of platelet granule contents (e.g. inorganic
polyphosphate, PolyP) to locally enhance fibrin stability. These mechanisms are significantly compromised in
non-compressible traumatic hemorrhage, which remains a major cause of mortality. The `gold standard' for
treating such hemorrhage is massive transfusion of whole blood or components (platelets, plasma, RBC).
Especially, platelet transfusion has shown tremendous clinical benefit in saving lives in trauma. However,
platelets are rarely available in resource-limited hospitals and unavailable pre-hospital, due to challenges of
storage, portability, high risk of bacterial contamination and very short shelf-life (~5 days). We aim at addressing
this challenge by designing biomaterials-based `artificial platelet' nanoconstructs. To this end, utilizing a
previous R01 award (HL121212) we developed self-assembled lipid-peptide nanoconstructs that mimic and
integrate the platelet mechanisms of (1) and (2) stated above. This design showed hemostatic ability in vitro and
in thrombocytopenic mouse tail-bleeding models, and modest efficacy in severe trauma models. Building on this,
we now propose to mimic the mechanisms of (3) and (4) on a liposomal template by designing unique enzyme-
responsive lipopeptides, that will subsequently allow integration of all four mechanisms onto a single
nanoconstruct for a superior artificial platelet design. Our central hypothesis is `Modular amplification of
hemostasis via mimicry of platelet's biointerfacial and secretory mechanisms within an artificial platelet
construct can significantly attenuate hemorrhage and enhance survival in trauma'. To test this, our Specific Aims
are to: (1) Evaluate stimuli (plasmin)-triggered exposure of PS on lipidic nanoconstructs for platelet-inspired
amplification of thrombin (hence fibrin) site-specifically in trauma; (2) Evaluate stimuli (thrombin)-triggered
release of inorganic polyphosphate (PolyP) as a payload from lipidic nanoconstructs for injury site-targeted
stabilization of fibrin clot; and (3) Integrate these independent synergistic components in artificial platelet
nanoconstructs to evaluate hemostatic efficacy and survival in rodent trauma model. The traumatic insult to
vascular endothelium results in enhanced secretion of tissue plasminogen activator (hence plasmin) at the clot
site, resulting in rapid fibrin degradation (hyperfibrinolysis) and compromising clot stability. Exploiting this
plasmin to expose PS on `artificial platelet' surface will allow enhanced thrombin (and hence fibrin) generation
to offset hyperfibrinolysis. This thrombin can then also act as a local trigger to destabilize the `artificial platelet'
constructs and release encapsulated PolyP to enhance fibrin stability and augment hemostasis. Our principal
innovation is in uniquely mimicking platelet's multi-step mechanisms of hemostasis on a single nanoconstruct."
10740874,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer in the US with the second highest mortality rate.
Locally advanced and metastatic disease have a poor prognosis. A small subset (5-15%) of metastatic CRC
patients, who bear tumors deficient in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) that have high microsatellite instability (MSI-
high), can respond to immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade (CPI), but most CRC do not. We hypothesize
that to induce immune responses in microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC, new strategies that go beyond CPI are
needed. In MSI-high CRC tumors, tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells, fibroblasts and the tumors themselves all have
inflammatory gene expression signatures and are colocalized into inflammatory hubs with adjacent tumor-
reactive CD8 T cells, suggesting that MSI-high CRCs selectively provoke a robust inflammatory multicellular
network within the tumor that recruits anti-tumor killer cells. Disruption of MMR in CRC mouse tumor grafts
enhances tumor neoantigen expression and recruitment of tumor-specific T cells to trigger immune surveillance.
We hypothesize that interventions that convert MSS CRC to an MMR-deficient MSI phenotype could enhance
antitumor immunity and make resistant MSS CRC sensitive to CPI. This proposal will investigate whether
tumor-targeted gene knockdown can convert MSS CRC to immune responsive MSI-high tumors. There
are no known small molecule inhibitors of MMR. We will exploit a method of epithelial cancer-targeted gene
knockdown that uses subcutaneous injection of aptamer-small interfering RNAs (AsiCs), which link a high affinity
EpCAM aptamer for epithelial tumor targeting to small interfering RNAs, for tumor-selective gene knockdown.
EpCAM, the first described tumor antigen, is ~100-1000-fold more highly expressed in epithelial cancers
(including virtually all CRC) than normal epithelia, making it attractive for selective CRC tumor targeting. We
previously showed that EpCAM-AsiCs that knockdown tumor-dependency genes or genes whose knockdown
promotes immune recognition can strongly suppress aggressive breast cancer in orthotopic, metastatic and
genetically engineered mouse tumor models and induce an effective immune response in immunologically cold
tumors. In this proposal we will evaluate EpCAM-AsiCs to knockdown Mlh1, encoding a key MMR enzyme, in
MSS CRC subcutaneous and caecal tumor implants of 4 mouse CRC cell lines and 2 MMR-proficient, MSS
organoid lines derived from an aggressive genetically engineered mouse model, which conditionally express
mutations in intestinal stem cells of four key genes that are frequently mutated in human CRC – Apc, Kras,
Tgfbr2 and Trp53. We will evaluate the effect of MMR disruption on tumor growth in immunodeficient and
immunocompetent mice and dissect in detail how microsatellite stability, tumor mutational burden and gene
expression in the tumor and the immune response to the tumor are altered. We will also investigate whether CPI
enhances the antitumor effect of tumor-targeted Mlh1 knockdown."

 The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is native to Southeast Asia but in a few decades this species
expanded its range to all continents except Antarctica. Aedes albopictus is capable of transmitting multiple
arboviruses including dengue—the leading arboviral disease of 21st century—Chikungunya, and Zika—an
emerging health threats for the world. Because of its remarkable ability to develop a photoperiodic diapause in
the temperate climate, Ae. albopictus has the potential to spread these dangerous diseases further north. This
project will develop haplotype-resolved chromosome-scale genome assemblies for multiple strains of Ae.
albopictus and will test if adaptations to the temperate climate are associated with chromosomal
rearrangements in this mosquito. Toward this end, we propose the following specific aims: 1) develop a
haplotype-resolved chromosome-scale genome assemblies for four strains of Ae. albopictus including
the Foshan strain; 2) improve the physical genome map for the Foshan strain of Ae. albopictus; and 3)
identify chromosomal rearrangements in different populations of Ae. albopictus world-wide. Our long-
term goal is to understand the genetic basis of the incredible phenotypic plasticity of Ae. albopictus that helps
this mosquito to rapidly spread around the globe. We envision that the availability of the high-quality reference
genome assemblies for multiple strains of Ae. albopictus will stimulate further genetic studies aimed at
preventing mosquito-borne disease transmission."

Validation and Feasibility Non-Invasive Anemia Diagnostic Tool (ASIST Device)
This project will establish the accuracy and feasibility of our novel non-invasive, portable, low-
cost device to diagnose chronic nutritional and hemolytic anemia in resource poor areas. This
device has the potential to mitigate the prevalence of anemia in LMICs, improving health
outcomes, especially in pregnant women and adolescent girls.
Despite increased attention from the WHO, anemia continues to be a formidable public health
issue affecting a third of the world's population, with much of the disease burden in low- and
middle- income countries (LMICs). Pregnant women and young children are the most vulnerable
of these populations. Severe anemia in pregnancy contributes significantly to preventable
morbidity and mortality both during pregnancy and in the delivery process. For the fetus of an
anemic mother, there are long-term neurodevelopmental consequences.
In resource-rich countries, anemia can be diagnosed using minimally invasive point of care
devices and nutritional and hemolytic causes can be differentiated without invasive testing using
exhaled Carbon Monoxide, a breakdown product of hemoglobin. In low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs), where this type of testing is not readily available, the diagnosis of anemia is
often inaccurate or missed all together. Based on the global burden of anemia, especially in
LMICs, there is a need for a low-cost device that can non-invasively detect anemia and help to
distinguish between nutritional and hemolytic causes to inform clinical decision making."
10742943,"ABSTRACT
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the current pandemic
of coronavirus-induced disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since December 2019, coordinated research efforts have
provided a wealth of critical data that have enhanced our ability to diagnose and treat COVID-19. To date,
however, much of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remain
elusive. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 contains nine independent open reading frames (ORFs) coding for
proteins that are not essential for viral replication but seem to exert important functions in modulating host
antiviral immunity. Of these accessory proteins, the ORF8 protein stands out for its unique characteristics.
ORF8 is a highly variable protein among SARS-related CoVs. ORF8 also appears to be involved in a network
of host-pathogen interactions inside infected cells: ORF8 impairs immune pathways such as antigen
presentation, interferon type I, and nuclear factor-kB, as well as possibly activate growth pathways. A central
question is how ORF8 mediates interactions with multiple host protein targets. Towards this goal, we are
investigating ORF8 interaction with major histocompatibility class I (MHC I) molecules.
 It was shown recently that SARS-CoV-2 ORF8 suppresses CD8+ T cell responses by downregulating MHC
I molecules, both in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that ORF8 suppresses surface expression of HLA-A and
HLA-B molecules to protect infected cells from recognition by CD8+ T cells, but spares HLA-C and HLA-E to
avoid activation of natural killer (NK) cells. The possibility that ORF8 displays a locus specificity toward MHC I
would provide a mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 to walk a fine line between adaptive and innate immunity.
Specifically, we will undertake an analysis of interactions between ORF8 and MHC I by using a panel of HLA-
A, -B, -C, and -E molecules, and also determine if ORF8 selectively downregulates MHC I in relevant cell
systems (Aim 1). We will extend these studies to ORF8 variants that have been positively selected during the
course of the pandemic and evaluate if and how these mutations affect MHC I binding and downregulation
(Aim 2). The successful completion of these Aims is expected to uncover unknown features of ORF8 and
elucidate its role in suppressing antigen presentation, as well as inform us on the selective pressure that MHC I
exerts on SARS-CoV-2. The immediate and long-term impact of our proposed research is high. This is the first
study that: (1) characterizes molecular interaction of ORF8 with a host protein; and (2) evaluates clinically
relevant ORF8 variants. By studying the immune interactions underlying ORF8-mediated downregulation of
MHC I, we will increase our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 derails cellular immunity. Importantly, our
study will stimulate similar investigations of other ORF8-interactors, providing novel opportunities for the
development of therapeutics directed against ORF8 or its host targets."

Common pathophysiological mechanisms are thought to promote the cutaneous and systemic manifestations
of lupus. Thus a better understanding of the factors that promote CLE are likely to provide important insights as
far as the pathogenesis of SLE. Nevertheless, it is also likely that tissue specific effector mechanisms account
for the diverse clinical presentations exhibited by SLE patient populations. Since 75% of SLE patients exhibit
skin lesions of some sort, and UV exposure of the skin is often associated with lupus flares, it is surprising that
there have been relatively few mechanistic studies that address initiation, progression and recurrence of CLE.
One reason for this gap is that murine models available for the study of CLE have been limited – despite the
numerous murine models of SLE, models that accurately reflect the central features of CLE are much more
limited. We have now develop an inducible model of lupus like skin inflammation (LLSI), initiated by T cell
transfer, that recapitulates many of the features of CLE. These include a prominent role for skin-infiltrating
IFNγ-producing Th1 cells, excessive keratinocyte death, autoantibody deposition at the dermal/epidermal
border, increased expression of CxCL9, CxCL10, CxCL11, CCL8, and accumulation of pDCs in the skin. There
are also mechanistic similarities between our LLSI model and other inducible as well as genetically
programmed murine models of SLE; they all depend on the expression of TLR7 and are exacerbated by the
absence of TLR9. Therefore our LLSI mice provide a novel, rapid and reproducible system for exploring the
effector mechanisms responsible for the induction and regulation of cutaneous lupus. This application will
focus on TLR9 and FasL. As mentioned, TLR9 negatively regulates the development of both cutaneous and
systemic lupus, but whether TLR9 works passively by simply competing with TLR7 for access to the
endosomal trafficking chaperone Unc93B1, or actively by inducing molecules dependent on a TLR9 signaling
cascade that limit inflammation, has not been addressed. We have also recently shown that the development
of skin lesions is completely dependent T cell FasL expression, but whether FasL promotes disease indirectly
by inducing cell death and creating cell debris and/or directly by inducing the production of pro-inflammatory
cytokines is unresolved. Interplay between TLR9 and FasL may be an important amplification loop in LLSI -
TLR ligands induce upregulation of Fas and FasL generates cell debris that can activate endosomal TLRs. We
propose to address the questions by using gene-targeted mice with discriminating mutations for both in vitro
and in vivo (LLSI) studies. In Aim 1, we will use mice that express normal levels of a form of TLR9 that cannot
engage MyD88, and in Aim 2, we will use mice that express a Caspase 8 mutation which removes the
Caspase 8 autocleavage site and thereby prevents FasL-induced apoptosis but not chemokine production.
Together, these studies should help identify the most effective therapeutic strategies for targeting TLR9 and
FasL pathways to prevent or ameliorate the development of cutaneous lupus."

 There is ample scientific evidence that toxic oligomers of A and tau, considered the major neuropathological
factors in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) lead to synaptic failure and dementia, but is also well recognized that some
individuals can accumulate significant AD neuropathology without clinical manifestations. The established
existence of these non-demented with high pathology (NDAN) individuals, suggests that if binding of A
oligomers to specific AMPA and NMDA receptors trigger Ca2+ disruption and synaptic failure in AD, then
modifications in the pharmacology or abundance of these receptors may underlie synaptic protection in NDAN
individuals. However, little is known about the pharmacological sensitivity of human native glutamate receptors
to A and tau oligomers in AD, or their role in resilience, as information primarily has come from studies in animal
models of AD or protein expression systems. Here we will fill in this critical gap of our current knowledge by
identifying the synaptic proteins involved in glutamatergic signaling and Ca2+ dysregulation in AD, evaluating
whether modifications of these proteins correlate with metrics of synaptic preservation in NDAN individuals, and
determining whether A and tau oligomers differentially activate human native synaptic receptors in NDAN
individuals compared to those in AD and controls. The present proposal will test the hypothesis that differences
in the regional abundance of Ca2+-permeable glutamate receptors and/or their pharmacodynamics profile in
response to oligomeric species distinguishes NDAN from AD and control subjects. We will test our hypothesis
in a rigorously characterized cohort of postmortem NDAN, AD, and age-matched normal cognitive control brains,
using two unique and innovative approaches: Microtransplantation of Synaptic Membranes (MSM) to evaluate
receptor electrical activity of native receptors complexes isolated from autopsy human brain, and
Electrophysiologically-anchored Dataset Analysis (EDA) to identify proteins that correlate with receptors’ activity.
The rationale for this project is that determining the pharmacological sensitivity of the natural targets of toxic
oligomers is likely to offer a strong framework whereby novel strategies to AD therapy can be developed. Two
complementary aims are proposed. Aim 1 will identify the impact of gene expression modifications on the
abundance and function of Ca2+ permeable human native glutamate receptors in NDAN compared to AD and
control cases, and aim 2 will evaluate the efficacy of A and tau oligomers to activate human native synaptic
glutamate receptors from NDAN, AD and control cases. At the end of the proposed research we expect to have
defined the mechanisms whereby oligomers trigger synaptic Ca2+ dysregulation in AD but not in NDAN subjects.
These results will lay the foundations for the future development of innovative target-directed pharmacologic
interventions to promote synaptic resilience in AD as a clinically valuable, effective therapeutic approach."

In order to enhance and focus research on Alzheimer's disease (AD)-specific proteinopathies, the 2018
research framework proposed by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA)
recommends that AD be defined by its specific biological signatures that can be documented at autopsy or in
living people by biomarkers rather than by its non-specific neurodegenerative and clinical syndromic features.
Of the three proposed biomarkers by the NIA-AA research framework in living people (amyloid-beta (Aβ),
pathologic tau and neurodegeneration), only the two AD-specific proteinopathies (Aβ and pathologic tau) are
considered obligatory for the biological definition of AD, while neurodegeneration, although contribute to
cognitive impairment and is part of the fully manifested disease, can also occur in other brain disorders and
thus is not specific to AD. The purpose of this harmonized biological definition of AD in living people that
includes the preclinical phase is to distinguish AD from other types of brain disorders and dementia, to
accelerate and focus research on AD-specific proteinopathies that manifest decades before the clinical
manifestation of first symptoms of AD, to enhance better understanding in the underlying mechanisms of AD
clinical expression, and to use (and discover) targeted disease modifying interventions that can prevent or
delay the onset of AD symptoms.
Our ongoing and long-term research interest coincides well with the NIA-AA research framework in living
people where we have already performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on CSF Aβ42/tau levels
and Aβ deposition in the brain measured by amyloid-PET and identified known and novel associations in the
APOE and non-APOE regions. However, the identified signals do not explain all of the phenotypic variation in
the two AD-specific proteinopathies or endophenotypes. Here we propose a collaborative study between
leading experts in the field to extend our ongoing efforts to delineate the complete genetic basis of the two AD-
specific proteinopathies (Aβ and pathologic tau) by whole genome sequencing (WGS) using well-characterized
and large amyloid-PET and CSF Aβ42/tau datasets with clinical outcomes of dementia followed by testing the
effects of identified significant variants on downstream neurodegeneration markers, and performing extensive
bioinformatics and functional studies. The primary objective of this application is to perform and analyze WGS
in adequately powered large discovery samples with well-characterized Aβ and tau data along with clinical
outcomes of dementia to identify putative functional variants associated with Aβ and tau pathologies followed
by replications in independent and large samples with Aβ and tau data (Aims 1-2). We will integrate genetic
information to create polygenic risk scores in order to predict Aβ and tau pathologies and will also examine the
role of AD pathology-associated variants with downstream neurodegeneration, neuropathologies that coexist
with AD and the risk and age-at-onset of AD (Aim3). Finally, we will functionally characterize genetic
association using bioinformatics, causality tests and in vitro experiments to understand their roles in affecting
gene expression as being expression quantitative traits loci, affecting intracellular and extracellular APP/Aβ
and tau levels, and in myeloid cell function. The successful completion of this study will help to identify novel
AD-related genes and pathways, and to uncover underlying possible mechanisms for AD."

Disease Research Training Program in vaccine development and public health between the International
Centre for Diarrhoeal Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh (icddr,b) and the Massachusetts General Hospital
(MGH) in Boston, Massachusetts. Now in its 20th year, this training program has focused on long-term
training of young investigators at the icddr,b. In this renewal application, we propose three revisions to
meet identified evolving needs in Bangladesh and to take this training program to the next level: (1) now
that a number of trainees have successfully completed their pre-doctoral, doctoral and post-doctoral
experiences, we will add a focus to mentor junior faculty and senior postdoctoral fellows as they obtain
independent grant funding in Bangladesh, (2) we will expand our successful Dhaka-based program to
include candidates from the southeast of the country through the Bangladesh Institute of Tropical and
Infectious Diseases (BITID) in Chittagong, Bangladesh, and to the northwest of the country through
Rajshahi University in Rajshahi, Bangladesh to expand opportunities beyond the capitol, and (3) we will
expand our faculty to include Bangladeshi experts in respiratory, viral and emerging diseases as mentors
to meet evolving needs. We will continue to focus on in-country training in Bangladesh, to include
training tracks in both laboratory sciences and public health investigation, and to include trainees at a
range of career development stages. The research platform upon which training would occur is based
upon active and successful NIH and other collaborative projects between the co-program directors for
this training program, Dr. Firdausi Qadri, Senior Scientist/Head, Immunology Laboratory, icddr,b, and Dr.
Edward Ryan, Division of Infectious Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University,
as well as collaborations across faculty members. We propose to continue to train individuals through
both degree and non-degree programs, the former through collaborative arrangements with the James P.
Grant School of Public Health-BRAC University in Dhaka, Bangladesh (Master of Public Health Program),
and in focused laboratory research to support Master of Science and Ph.D. degree candidacy in
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dhaka University, and Master of Science degree candidacy at
BRAC University. We also propose to continue to include long-term non-degree training, including of
new individuals from BITID and Rajshahi to train in Dhaka. We have assembled faculty with expertise in
laboratory sciences, infectious diseases and public health, and the goal of this program is to continue to
meet evolving research and public health needs in a sustainable manner in Bangladesh through

to provide leadership and strategic vision to foster and expand research in the field of inflammatory diseases of the
bowel by its clinical and basic science faculty, particularly in the areas of microbiology, immunology,
genetics/genomics and translational and clinical research. These themes have defined our GI program over 75
years ago when Dr. Joseph B Kirsner put forward the hypothesis that IBD was caused by genetic, immunological,
and microbial factors. The C-IID Administrative Core leadership is provided by Dr. Bana Jabri, Director, Dr.
Eugene Chang Co-Director, and Dr. John Alverdy, Associate Director with the help of their administrative staff
and the C-IID Program Manager, in conjunction with the Executive Committee, the Internal Advisory
Committee, and the External Advisory Committee.
 The Administrative Core will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the C-IID, including strategic,
scientific, and operational directions to insure effectiveness and impact of the program. It will continue to seek
opportunities to foster interaction and collaborations among its members. It will also identify member needs, and
optimize member benefits from Center Cores and Programs The administrative leadership also assures
responsiveness of the C-IID Cores to the needs of the members and provides oversight for Core functions.
This has led, for instance, to the addition of two computational scientists to help members with the analysis of
host and microbial next-generation sequencing data, and the creation of the Multiparametric Host Cell Analysis
core to promote utilization of state-of-the-art genomic technologies and enhance research in human
immunology and tissue cell analysis in the field of DD.
 The proceedings of the monthly Executive Committee and Administrative Core meetings are reviewed on an
annual basis by the Internal Advisory Board (comprised of selected, prominent, senior leaders in the Biological
Sciences Division with expertise relevant to the goals of the C-IID) and the Dean of Biological Sciences, Dr.
Kenneth Polonsky. The Executive Committee consists of C-IID leadership, prominent University of Chicago
digestive diseases investigators. As the neutral review and sounding board, the External Advisory Board of the C-
IID reviews all requests, reports, and recommendations of the Executive Committee. The members of the External
Advisory Board include 5 internationally renowned investigators who are leaders in the area of digestive diseases,
particularly in the focus areas of the C-IID.
 In summary, the Administrative Core of the C-IID provides leadership, programmatic vision, oversight, and
management of a highly multidisciplinary and innovative program that foster interaction, collaboration, and synergy
in studies of inflammatory diseases of the bowel."

The study of complex traits in humans and model organisms has made considerable progress in recent years.
Multi-dimensional high-resolution genomics data and immunological data allows to study complex biological
networks, and the dynamics of cellular state and function at a resolution not possible before. The usage of
these technologies require, however, highly specialized expertise in genomics, immunology, and computational
biology. The primary goal of the Multiparametric Host Cell Analysis (MHC) Core is to provide members of the
University of Chicago (UChicago) Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC) for Interdisciplinary
Study of Inflammatory Intestinal Disorders (C-IID) with such level of expertise, further promoting the usage of
state-of-the-art genomic technologies in gastrointestinal research. Specifically, the MHC core will provide the
community: (i) consulting service for human tissue isolation, analysis and cell sorting protocols adapted to the
different forms of assays, (ii) consulting services and development of customized antibody panels for high
resolution cellular tissue profiling of human samples using spectral flow cytometry, (iii) advanced flow
cytometry sorting of 6 different populations of cells from a tissue sample based on the detection of 28
fluorescence marker using an advanced BD Biosciences sorter (FACSymphony S6 High Parameter Cell
Sorter), (iv) advise with the study design of genomic experiments; (v) a series of pre-optimized genomic assays
(e.g., single-cell RNA-seq, epigenetic profiles); (vi) standardized and validated analytical pipelines for the
analyses of different genomic datasets, and (vii) bioinformatics support for genomic and flow cytometry data
analysis. The standardization of experimental protocols and analytical pipelines offered by the core will help
minimize the errors during data collection, management, maintenance, and, importantly, facilitate downstream

10816987,"SPECIFIC AIMS
The University of Chicago (UChicago) Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC) for Interdiscipli-
nary Study of Inflammatory Intestinal Disorders (C-IID) investigators recognize that a comprehensive under-
standing of the clinical behavior, phenotype, epidemiology and pathophysiology of complex gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders requires analysis of clinical data, human cells, tissues and histopathological specimens. The In-
tegrative Clinical and Biospecimen (ICB) Core, formerly called the Integrative Translational Core (ITR), ena-
bles translational research by providing the infrastructure and services to seamlessly integrate clinical infor-
mation with biospecimens. Since the last renewal, the ICB Core has worked steadfastly to optimize consulta-
tion services for human study design, create a dynamic mechanism to access clinical data and to create an
efficient workflow for patient and biospecimen recruitment. All improvements are supported by the UChicago
and function as a critical resource for the other C-IID Cores. In addition, since the last renewal, we recognize
that services provided through the Tissue Cell Analysis (TCA) Core would more logically be placed within the
ICB Core in order to address previous criticism that there is no direct oversight by a pathologist of the biospec-
imen tissue bank and to provide consultation services to C-IID members on how to collect, bank and analyze
biospecimens.
Since 2015, 47 C-IID members, 66% of membership, have utilized the ICB Core. 6034 patients have been
consented to the ICB Core Registry with a total of 8382 patients recruited through the ICB Core for all GI stud-
ies in the past 5 years. The ICB Core has also built a repository of biospecimens to facilitate the rapid genera-
tion of data which includes over 30,000 biospecimens on over 1800 patients, including whole blood DNA, se-
rum, biopsy RNA and DNA, flash frozen intestinal biopsy samples, liver biopsies, and formalin-fixed paraffin
embedded (FFPE) tissues. In addition, the ICB has implanted an infrastructure to assist in prospective screen-
ing, recruitment, and sample collection for individual investigator's translational studies. The ICB core will con-
tinue to build on the infrastructural foundation established over the last 5 years to meet the growing and chang-
ing needs of C-IID investigators for clinical database information and well-phenotyped biospecimens.
The Specific Aims of the ICB Core are as follows:
1. To provide consultative services for human biospecimen-based study design. The ICB Core utilizes
human translational and basic science expertise of the Core directors to facilitate human-based studies by: a)
providing consultative services to develop and advance translational study experimental design, to facilitate
submission of IRBs and to facilitate statistical analyses; and b) providing consultative services for utilization of
pathology specimens and services.
2. To provide infrastructure and services to optimize clinical database use. The ICB Core provides
streamlined access to comprehensive clinical information as a resource for patient recruitment, phenotyping,
and epidemiology data by: a) maintaining a virtual clinical database that seamlessly integrates clinical metada-
ta from internal and external sources including Epic, Centricity, the National Death Registry, the Cancer Regis-
try, LabVantage, and REDCap; and b) providing services to interrogate data in the virtual clinical database tai-
lored to investigator needs.
3. To provide pathology consultation and histopathological analysis. An important component of the ICB
Core is to provide pathology consultation, instruction in all techniques, including immunohistochemistry and
specialized guidance specifically related to the analysis of complex gastrointestinal disease. The core also pro-
vides fee-for-service immunohistochemical or immunofluorescent staining of investigator-provided or archive-
derived human and animal tissue. This sub-aim is intended to satisfy all of the most heavily used aspects of
our previous Tissue and Cell Analysis (TCA) Core.
4. To provide infrastructure and services for biospecimen utilization. The ICB Core provides uniform pa-
tient recruitment and biospecimen acquisition to optimize individual and collaborative research by: a) maintain-
ing staff to ensure prospective patient recruitment, biospecimen acquisition and processing; b) maintaining a
biospecimen repository with a large number of diverse samples in well-phenotyped populations; c) establishing
standard operating procedures and best practices for optimal acquisition and storage; and d) enabling utiliza-
tion of pathology archives and histopathology processing for translational research.
The ultimate goal of the ICB Core is to remain an integral, essential resource for the advancement of transla-
tional research in understanding physiology, pathogenesis and future therapeutic development in complex gas-
trointestinal disorders"

The Tissue Engineering and Cell Models Core (TECM) enables Universtiy of Chicago (UChicago) Digestive
Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC) for Interdisciplinary Study of Inflammatory Intestinal Disorders (C-
IID) investigators to address key questions relating to causality and mechanisms by providing novel and vetted
experimental models that can be customized to their needs. It was established to replace the Genomics and
Molecular Engineering (GME) Core of the C-IID. The reorganization of the Core was a direct result of two
sequential annual needs assessments indicating strong interest by the membership for more physiologically-
relevant experimental models to study digestive health and diseases. The TECM has three major components:
(1) A centralized repository and facility for established and primary gut-relevant cell lines, which was originally
part of the host-microbe core, but moved to the TECM to centralize all cell and tissue experimental systems,
(2) A tissue engineering component that includes customizing and developing intestinal organoid technologies
for specific applications needed by C-IID users, and (3) an experimental systems component that includes in
vivo models (rodent microsurgery), ex vivo models, and live functional assays. Inherent to these services, the
TECM provides training and education, opportunities for cost-savings through bulk purchases (serum,
disposables, etc), and technical expertise that saves investigators time and ensure high quality of services.
The TECM is inextricably tied to the other C-IID cores. The Integrative Clinical and Biospecimen (ICB) and the
Host-Microbe (HM) cores are essential for providing cells, tissues, and patient samples for establishing the
experimental models. The Multiparametric Host Cell Analysis (MHC) core provides investigators with the
means to analyze data derived from the model systems. Thus, the TECM Core has had great impact in
enabling C-IID members to advance knowledge in the thematic areas fostered by the C-IID which focus on the
study of IBD, host-microbe interactions, mucosal immunology and inflammation. In the past funding cycle, it
was used by ~80% of the C-IID membership and was used in 149 peer-reviewed publications or 46% of the
total (322) C-IID acknowledged publications during this period. The TECM has promoted interaction,
collaboration, cost-sharing, and efficient resources utilization, and, at the same time, has enhanced the
capabilities of our investigators."

The Host-Microbe (HM) Core is comprised of two components – the Gnotobiotic Component (GBC) and Enteric
Microbiology Component (EMC). They synergize in the isolation, cultivation and analysis of microbiota by
biochemical and sequencing methods with the concomitant analysis of microbes and their communities in vivo
using our state-of-the-art Gnotobiotic Research Animal Facility (GRAF). Recent advances in the analysis of the
commensal microbiota and an increasing appreciation for the role of the microbiota in the vital functions of the
mammalian host have put the studies of host-microbe interactions at the forefront of many areas of the life
sciences. This is especially true for studies of the normal physiology of the gut and pathophysiology of disease
states such as IBD, which has been linked to disruptions in the host-commensal mutualism. The ability to analyze
the composition and structure of the microbiota, as well as its functional properties and ex vivo culturing
conditions, is a base requirement for building a successful research center devoted to studying digestive
diseases. Moreover, to be in the vanguard of these increasingly inter-disciplinary research fields, the University
of Chicago (UChicago) Digestive Diseases Research Core Center (DDRCC) for Interdisciplinary Study of
Inflammatory Intestinal Disorders (C-IID) scientists need access to a reliable mechanism for testing their ideas
in in vivo experiments in animals colonized with defined microbiota – gnotobiotic mice. They are also in need of
germ-free (GF) animals to use as controls for studies of the role of microbes in disease development. As a result,
the HM Core is committed to: (1) providing C-IID researchers with services that reflect their needs, are available
on campus, and are competitively priced compared to commercial services; and (2) further development of the
HM Core to meet both current and anticipated demands. The HM Core not only provides valuable expertise to
C-IID users for experiment planning, troubleshooting and discussion of the results but is also integrated with the
other C-IID cores to augment these capabilities. The HM Core, together with the Integrative Clinical and
Biospecimen (ICB) Core, are essential for providing cells, tissues, and patient samples to investigators for
establishing experimental models. Likewise, the EMC of the HM Core provides high-quality, customized services
for cultivation-dependent and -independent analyses of complex gut microbiomes as well as providing both
assistance and instruction in the analysis of large datasets. Thus, the HM Core has had tremendous impact in
enabling C-IID members to advance knowledge in the C-IID thematic areas that focus on the study of IBD, host-
microbe interactions, mucosal immunology, and inflammation. Of the 322 C-IID acknowledged publications over
the past funding cycles, 92 (28.5%) cited the HM Core as the primary core that they used. This represents a 4%
increase over the previous funding cycle. Underscoring the integration of C-IID Cores, the HM Core was also
listed as a secondary core for an additional 107 publications, totaling 199 or 62% of the total publications that
were supported by the C-IID over the past funding period, a 7% increase over the previous funding cycle."
10600121,"The cause of premature ventricular contraction (PVC)-mediated cardiomyopathy is unknown.
The estimated prevalence of PVCs is high in the general population with reported 40-75% on
ambulatory monitoring. PVCs are often considered benign, but may be associated with
increased risk of sudden death or associated with chest pain, syncope, or heart failure,
especially when structural heart disease is present. A long-term study on patients with relatively
low PVC burden showed no difference in survival. However, high PVC burden is associated with
lower left ventricular function in patients with and without structural disease. Unfortunately,
suppressing PVCs by ablation or antiarrhythmic medications do not always improve ventricular
function in patients. Animal models have showed that bigeminy pacing near the apex could
induce a cardiomyopathy that is reversible without myocardial structural changes. However,
these models do not explain the lack of cardiomyopathy development in some human subjects
with frequent PVCs such as bigeminy. We propose that frequent pathologic PVCs lead to PVC-
induced cardiomyopathy in normal hearts and PVC-worsened cardiomyopathy in hearts with
abnormal tissue characteristics. The pathologic versus benign PVCs can be determined by LV
function during PVC, which is quantitatively assessed using advanced real-time cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. LV function during PVC is likely a result of a
combination of factors including PVC site of origin, coupling interval, and conduction time
through the myocardium. Together with tissue characterization of the ventricular myocardium by
cardiac MRI and electroanatomic voltage mapping, this proposal seeks to identify hemodynamic
and structural features in PVC-induced or worsened cardiomyopathy in order to better select
patients for treatment."
10925157,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It is well-documented that where you reside in America shapes when you die, and this has been shown to be
particularly true among low-income Americans. These place-based inequalities in health have grown over time
in the United States, driven by increased mid-life mortality due to drug- and alcohol-related deaths and suicides.
While the drivers of this rise in mid-life mortality are complex and multifactorial, there is broad consensus that
the adoption of evidence-based treatments for substance use disorder and mental illness has the potential to
improve health and save lives. Despite their effectiveness, behavioral health services are generally thought to
be underused, with very limited access to these services in some regions of the country. We study the drivers of
place-based inequities in the Medicaid program, the primary source of insurance coverage and payer of
behavioral health services for low-income populations. This application seeks to understand whether and to what
extent place-based inequalities in mid-life mortality — and their gradients by gender and race/ethnicity — are
driven by the causal effects of place on access to evidence-based behavioral healthcare treatment by studying
the low-income population on Medicaid. Because families sort into areas based on a wide range of factors —
e.g., economic opportunity, amenities, cost-of-living, etc. — if people predisposed to poor (or good) health
outcomes tend to cluster in particular localities then observed health differences between areas may reflect this
non-random sorting (or “selection”) rather than the causal effects of place. To address this challenge, we use a
quasi-experimental movers research design that follows otherwise similar Medicaid enrollees residing in the
same place that move to different destinations. Subsequent differences in their healthcare utilization and health
can be attributed to place effects if movers are observed for a period of time before the move to adjust for
baseline outcomes. Second, to better under social gradients we stratify by sociodemographic characteristics and
recover the effects of places for distinct groups —comparing differences in the impacts of a place on different
groups reveals whether it tends to narrow or widen inequalities. Finally, we examine whether place-based effects
correlated with immutable characteristics of areas (e.g., climate) or features that are more readily amenable to
policy intervention (e.g., the healthcare delivery system). We make an original contribution, by advancing the
understanding of the relationship between “place” and health for low-income populations, with a focus on
understanding the role of differential access to high-quality, behavioral healthcare services."

Pregestational diabetes induces neural tube defects (NTDs). There are 60 million women of reproductive age
(18-44 years old) worldwide, and approximately 3 million American women with diabetes. Even under the best
prenatal care, women with diabetes are still three- to four-times more likely to have a child with birth defects than
women without diabetes. Unraveling the mechanism underlying diabetes-induced NTDs is critical for
understanding its pathogenesis and providing potential intervention targets. Yes-associated protein (Yap), a
transcriptional co-activator, determines body and organ size and regulates cell apoptosis, proliferation, and
differentiation. We found that either conditional KO of Yap or transgenic (Tg) overexpression of constitutively
active Yap (CA-Yap) specifically in the neuroepithelium resulted in NTD formation. Our recently published data
demonstrate that one of the mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) downstream kinase p70S6K1 is activated
by maternal diabetes and its deficiency alleviates diabetic embryopathy. Furthermore, the mTOR inhibitor
rapamycin prevents diabetic embryopathy. Both the HIPPO-Yap pathway and the mTOR pathway induce cell
and tissue growth. Thus, we hypothesize that maternal diabetes activates mTOR-p70S6K1, which
antagonizes Yap by activating the HIPPO kinase Lats1 through phosphorylation, selectively increases
translation and disrupts endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis, leading to NTDs. Lats1 inactivates
Yap through phosphorylation that disrupts the planar cell polarity (PCP) leading to failed neurulation. To
test our hypothesis, we propose the following aims. Specific Aim 1. determine whether the major mTOR
downstream effector p70S6K1 counteracts Yap activity by phosphorylating Yap upstream kinase Lats1
in diabetic embryopathy. We will examine whether maternal diabetes-activated the mTOR effector p70S6K1,
which forms a tertiary complex with the scaffold protein Merlin and Lats1, triggers Lats1 phosphorylation in two
previously unidentified sites, Thr255 and Thr262, leading to Yap inactivation. Specific Aim 2. To determine
whether the HIPPO signaling kinase Lats1 activation leads to neural tube defects in diabetic
embryopathy. We will test whether maternal diabetes induces Lats1 phosphorylation at new sites and
subsequent the canonical phosphorylation sites which leads to suppression of Yap and NTD formation. Specific
Aim 3. To investigate how fine-tuned Yap activity is critical for neurulation and its dysregulation disrupts
planar cell polarity in diabetic embryopathy. We will assess that Yap activity is tightly controlled during
neurulation and restoring Yap activity can ameliorate diabetic embryopathy. We will further evaluate whether
fine-tuned Yap activity maintains PCP gene expression during neurulation."

risk of having MS. Accordingly, several veterans who served Gulf war 1 as well as many Vietnam veterans have
been diagnosed with MS. Although there are some therapies against MS, no effective therapy is available to
promote remyelination in MS.
Therefore, delineation of new technologies for promoting remyelination is an important area of research.
Oligodendrocytes (OLs) are the myelin-producing cells in the CNS and toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) is an
important member of innate immunity. It has been shown that TLR2 activation inhibits the maturation of
oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs). Since there was no specific inhibitor of TLR2, from structural
analysis of the interaction between TLR2 and MyD88, the downstream partner of TLR2, we have designed a
novel peptide corresponding to the TLR2-interacting domain of MyD88 (TIDM) that specifically blocks TLR2,
but not other TLRs. Therefore, here, we want to test a translational, but novel, hypothesis that wtTIDM
peptide stimulates the maturation of OPCs to OLs (Specific aim I) and that intranasal administration of
wtTIDM peptide stimulates remyelination in animal models of demyelination (Specific aim II) via microglial
and/or OPC TLR2 (Specific aim III). A positive outcome of this cutting-edge proposal will delineate if selective
targeting of activated status of one component (TLR2) of the innate immune system by wtTIDM peptide
increases the maturation of OPCs and stimulates remyelination, highlighting the discovery of a prospective
intranasal agent to promote remyelination in MS and other demyelinating disorders."

Over the past decade, the use of digital media and electronic screens has grown substantially. Existing methods
for studying effects of digital media on child health and wellbeing are insufficient to assess the intermittent, on-
demand, and interactive forms of media (e.g., tablets, smartphones) that are intermeshed within families’ daily
activities. Calls for higher quality research have been made to better understand and evaluate the effect of
electronic screens on children’s health outcomes. While scientific progress has been made with advanced
analytics and data processing techniques using wearable devices for other health behaviors including physical
activity, sedentary time, and sleep, insufficient research has been conducted on the development and calibration
of wearable sensor measurement of electronic screen use. Wearable devices that include a color light sensor
combined with advanced machine learning methods is an emerging and promising measure of electronic screen
exposure in adults. However, there is a scientific need to extend this approach to free-living calibrations with
natural observation and validation in children. The overarching aim of this project is to develop and validate a
device-based measure of electronic screen use for children. The specific aims are to: 1) evaluate estimation
accuracy of machine learning algorithms developed under controlled and free-play screen and non-screen
activities using features extracted from a wearable multi-sensor, 2) compare accuracy of electronic screen use
estimation across activities (e.g., watching tv, reading a book), screen type (e.g., TV, smartphone, tablet), body
position (e.g., sitting, lying, standing), and ambient light level (e.g., florescent room light, natural light), and 3)
assess wear method placement, day to day variability, and compare estimates with the established
Comprehensive Assessment of Family Media Exposure (CAFE) tool obtained during 7 days of free-living wear.
Our highly qualified research team will address these aims by using hybrid-structured and semi-structured
activity observation to train and refine sensor-derived, machine-learned algorithms for assessing screen time as
compared to direct observation. Additionally, a free-living calibration protocol will then be used to evaluate
wearable sensor algorithms for the estimation of screen time in naturalistic settings. The results of this work will-
-for the first time--provide an innovative and translatable approach to assess free-living electronic screen use in
children."

Halting the intergenerational transfer of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is a priority for NHLBI and the
American Heart Association (AHA). Yet, limited understanding around the timing, pathways, and mechanisms
underlying the observed associations between maternal gestational health and offspring cardiovascular health
(CVH) remains a significant barrier to developing targeted, timely interventions. We propose to leverage the
Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study cohort to substantially advance understanding
of the in utero origins of offspring CVH and CVD, as measured during the critical period of young adulthood. The
original HAPO study recruited ~25,500 women in 2000-2006 to prospectively and uniformly examine the
association of gestational glycemia, uncomplicated by treatment, with maternal and neonatal outcomes. Eleven
years later, 4,832 offspring returned to study effects of GDM on offspring adiposity and glycemia. We hypothesize
that there are significant independent associations of maternal adiposity, glycemia, BP, and lipids at ~28 weeks
gestation with CVH and arterial injury among offspring at age 18-25 years, and that DNA methylation (DNAm)
will be associated with upstream intrauterine exposures and downstream CVH and arterial injury. HAPO CVH
will include a comprehensive CVH assessment of 1,000 HAPO FUS offspring from 4 HAPO centers. We will
measure BP, adiposity, lipids, glycemia, and lifestyle behaviors, characterize total CVH with AHA’s ‘Life’s Simple
7’ framework, and obtain carotid ultrasonography to identify the earliest changes of subclinical CVD. We will also
analyze existing cord blood DNAm data and will acquire new epigenome-wide association data from young adult
DNA using the Illumina 850K chip. We will achieve our objectives through the following specific aims: Specific
Aim 1: Define associations of the in utero cardiometabolic milieu at ~28 weeks’ gestation with offspring CVH
and subclinical CVD in young adulthood. Hypothesis 1a: Poorer maternal gestational metabolic health is
associated with poorer offspring CVH (Co-primary outcome) in young adulthood. Hypothesis 1b: Poorer
maternal gestational metabolic health is associated with higher carotid IMT (Co-primary outcome), lower carotid
distensibility, and unfavorable carotid artery grayscale features in young adulthood. Hypothesis 1c: Poorer
maternal gestational metabolic health is associated with worsening of cardiovascular health from childhood to
young adulthood. Specific Aim 2: Examine the role of epigenetic mechanisms in the association of upstream
intrauterine cardiometabolic exposures and downstream CVH and subclinical CVD. Hypothesis 2a: Poorer
maternal gestational metabolic health is associated with differential DNAm in aging-related pathways (measured
as accelerated epigenetic aging) in cord blood and young-adult offspring. Hypothesis 2b : Poorer maternal
gestational metabolic health is associated with differential DNAm in specific cardiometabolic pathways in young-
adult offspring blood cells, and this differential DNAm partly statistically mediates the association of adverse
intrauterine exposures with later CVH status and carotid arterial injury in young adulthood"

Declining vitamin B1 (thiamine) blood levels significantly correlates with a deterioration in cognitive
function and is associated with promoting Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) neuropathology hallmarks.
Thiamine is a critical enzyme cofactor within the glycolytic metabolism network that is fundamentally
required to sustain the bioenergetic and anabolic needs of all cells. The brain’s extensive requirement
for glucose metabolism to satisfy its high energy demand makes it particularly vulnerable to TI
mediated metabolic impairment. Congruent with established AD pathology, TI produces cerebral
energy hypometabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and an increase in plaque formation within
the hippocampus, cortex and thalamus. Thiamine or more specifically the activated cofactor, thiamine
diphosphate (TDP) ensures the function of 3 key metabolic enzymes, PDH, α-KGDH, and TKT. A
central feature for neuronal cell injury as a result of low cellular TDP levels is severe deficits in
cerebral energy metabolism. Additionally, the activity of TKT, PDH, α-KGDH are significantly reduced
in post-mortem Alzheimer’s patients and strongly correlate with dementia rating. Yet despite progress
into the relationship between reduced thiamine levels and the neuropathology of AD, mechanistic
insight is lacking. We have established that the metabolic dysfunction as a consequence of TI
activates hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1α). This application will test the hypothesis that TI
mediated metabolic activation of HIF1α initiates pro-apoptotic and amyloidogenic processes that
produce the cellular and regional histological presentation of TI associated AD-neuropathology. We
plan to test our central hypothesis and, thereby, accomplish the objective of this application by (1)
Employing cell type selectivity of HIF1α KO we will reveal the contribution and relationship of
astrocytic and neuronal HIF1α activity during TI on neurological damage. (2) Using a diseased based
(3xTgAD) transgenic AD mouse model, we will establish HIF1α activation as an initiator for
amyloidogenic activity and cognitive decline as a consequence of thiamine insufficiency. (3) Utilizing
an unbiased transcriptomic analysis, we will establish the temporal impact of graded TI stress on
HIF1α transcriptional activity within neurons and astrocytes. We propose to establish the contribution
of HIF1α by using a combination of state-of-the-art methodology including RiboTag RNA-Seq and MR
Imaging coupled with cell specific Cre-drivers for HIF1α knockout and triple transgenic AD mouse
models. Establishing chronic activation of HIF1α in response to hypometabolism linked to
micronutrient deficiency would provide a significant shift discerning AD etiology and suggest possible
prophylactic strategies to limit age-related cognitive decline."

It has become well recognized that inflammation from chronic pancreatitis is associated an 8-fold increased risk
for the development of pancreatic cancer. When cells are injured or stressed, they can transform to a cell with a
different phenotype through a process called metaplasia. In the pancreas, acinar-ductal metaplasia (ADM)
occurs with pancreatitis and this process is usually reversible. However, with chronic inflammation or maturation
arrest, the ductal phenotype cells do not reverse to their normal acinar phenotype but may progress to pancreatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) and pancreatic cancer. There is a gap in our understanding of the mechanisms
involved in this recovery or loss of the ability to recover. Our lab has been studying G-protein coupled receptors
and found that the cholecystokinin-B receptor (CCK-BR) that is found in ductal cells but not acinar cells becomes
expressed during chronic pancreatitis and PanIN formation, and is markedly over-expressed in pancreatic
cancer. Treatment with a CCK-receptor antagonist, proglumide, hastens recovery of ADM, decreases
inflammation, and restores the pancreas to a normal phenotype. In more advanced disease with PanINs or with
pancreatic cancer, proglumide treatment also alters the pancreas extracellular matrix or tumor
microenvironment, by decreasing collagen production from pancreatic stellate cells or cancer-associated
fibroblasts and changing the immune cell signature to a more normal phenotype. We hypothesize that the
CCK-BR signaling pathway is a novel and key pathway in pancreatic plasticity; strategies to suppress
this pathway will decrease pancreatic cancer. Proglumide has already been tested in human subjects in a
Phase 1 clinical trial and deemed to have a broad safety profile. In this proposal we will study the role of
proglumide and the CCK-BR in pancreatic cell plasticity and how this pathway can be targeted to normalize the
pancreatic phenotype and render it less oncogenic to prevent pancreatic cancer. The following aims are
proposed: Aim #1, Determine how the CCK-BR signaling pathway is involved in acinar-ductal metaplasia; Aim
#2, Examine how activation of the CCK-B receptor pathway modulates pancreatic stellate cells and if CCK-
receptor blockade can change the phenotype to render the fibroblasts less carcinogenic; and Aim #3, Evaluate
how activation of the CCK-BR induces tissue inflammation and polarization of immune cells. In this investigation,
we will use murine models of pancreatitis in wild-type and in CCK-BR-knockout mice with state of the art
techniques as laser microdissection of ADM and stroma, Reverse phase protein array, Mass Cytometry and
RNA sequencing to understand plasticity of pancreatic cells. We will also examine the role of the CCK-BR on
the pancreatic stellate cells in vitro using murine and human cells. Our goal is to understand how proglumide
reprograms a metaplastic or dysplastic pancreas to a more normal phenotype and thus preventing development
of pancreatic cancer."

Regulation of stem cell functions is crucial for tissue formation, growth, and homeostasis. In many tissues and
organs, stem cells give rise to transit amplifying cells (TACs), an undifferentiated progenitor population. TACs
function as transient but indispensable integrators of stem cell niche components. However, we have limited
understanding of how mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) interact with TACs and provide feedback to MSCs in
regulating tissue homeostasis. The adult mouse incisor provides an excellent model for stem cell study because
it grows continuously. MSCs are a Gli1+ cell population surrounding the neurovascular bundle (NVB) near the
proximal region in the adult mouse incisor, making it an ideal model in which to investigate the regulatory
mechanisms of MSCs. The NVB may secrete signaling molecules, providing a niche for MSCs in the adult incisor.
However, the functional significance of signaling molecules from the nerve within the NVB and the molecular
mechanism by which they regulate MSCs are largely unknown. Significantly, our preliminary data shows that the
trigeminal nerve secretes Fgf1, which acts directly on MSCs via FGFR1 to regulate tissue homeostasis, as loss
of Fgfr1 in Gli1+ MSCs leads to retarded incisor growth, similar to the phenotype seen with compromised
innervation. Fgf signaling regulates important downstream epigenetic regulators such as Arid1a and Arid1b to
control the fate of TACs. Furthermore, loss of Arid1a specifically inhibits Wnt5a signaling, which may provide
feedback to MSCs. Importantly, we have recently discovered that Runx2+/Gli1+ cells in the adult incisor are
MSC niche cells, strategically positioned to coordinate MSC-to-TAC transition. Our study suggests that Runx2
is regulated by the epigenetic regulator Arid1b and controls p53 activity to mediate MSC-to-TAC transition and
feedback to MSCs. Collectively, based on our preliminary data and taking advantage of well-established animal
models, we propose to test the hypotheses that Fgf signaling from the trigeminal nerve regulates MSCs in the
adult mouse incisor, Arid1a and Arid1b act downstream of Fgf signaling to control MSC-to-TAC transition, and
Arid1b-Runx2 interaction regulates p53 activity to control TAC differentiation and feedback to MSCs to maintain
tissue homeostasis. We propose the following specific aims to test our hypotheses. Specific Aim 1: To
investigate whether Fgf signaling from the trigeminal nerve plays a crucial role in regulating MSCs in the adult
mouse incisor. We will explore the molecular mechanism of Fgf signaling and its downstream targets in regulating
the fate of MSCs to maintain mesenchymal tissue homeostasis. Specific Aim 2: To determine the role of Fgf-
regulated Arid1a and Arid1b activity in controlling the MSC-to-TAC transition and maintenance of incisor tissue
homeostasis. We will explore the mechanisms by which TAC fate is altered and their impact on MSCs in Arid1a
and Arid1b mutant mice. Specific Aim 3: To investigate the molecular mechanism by which Arid1b regulates
Runx2 expression and Runx2-regulated p53 signaling to control TAC differentiation. We will also investigate the
functional significance of p53 in regulating TACs and the fate of MSCs in adult mouse incisors."
10805410,"Genetic testing (GT) for hereditary cancer and related health services do not reach all segments of the
population equitably. Racial disparities in genomic care are profound, persistent, and growing. Less than 30%
of high-risk cancer patients are referred for germline GT, with appreciably lower referral and testing rates
among racial minorities, especially among Blacks. GT of cancer survivors can directly inform treatment
following progression or treatment resistance and can facilitate primary and secondary prevention of cancers in
their unaffected relatives. Demand for GC (genetic counseling) and GT continues to increase with expanding
GT indications and decreasing sequencing costs yet supply of genetic counselors remains limited. The
conventional approach of referral to pretest genetic counseling is a common barrier to receiving GT. Further,
evidence suggests that traditional comprehensive, pre-test GC does not meet the needs of many survivors,
especially underserved minorities. Thus, new models of
genome-based care are needed that are responsive to
community needs, improve access, do not overburden scarce genetic counseling resources, and do not widen
existing disparities. Some health care systems and commercial GT laboratories use digital interventions,
including videos and relational agents (RAs), instead of traditional pre-test GC sessions, without providing
specifics about community engagement development, acceptability, or efficacy in oncology settings through a
rigorous methodologic strategy as we propose. Given the life-saving benefits of GT, understanding how to
effectively educate, empower and test high-risk patients in a culturally acceptable way can move the field
forward and reduce persistent racial disparities. This study will address this translational gap. In response to
community identified needs and enthusiastic support from cancer patients, relatives and community advocates
while also building on our pilot work, we will enroll 428 Black cancer patients meeting national guidelines for
GT into a 2-arm randomized controlled trial. This approach may be of particular benefit to hundreds of
thousands Black patients and their relatives because they are often unaware of their risks, less likely to have a
provider discuss their risk and refer them for GT at the time of diagnosis and are not equably garnering the
potentially lifesaving benefits of personalized prevention, screening, and treatment. The specific aims are to: 1)
Compare the efficacy of a culturally tailored RA vs. Enhanced Usual Care (EUC) on engagement in genetic
education and GT uptake; 2) Evaluate the impact of the RA vs. EUC on informed decision-making and
psychosocial outcomes; and 3) Explore potential mechanisms by assessing mediators and moderations of
effectiveness. Data from this trial can be used to guide clinical practice and policy decisions for advancing
cancer health equity and improving access to genetic education and GT. If successful, this approach could be
applied to other cancers and chronic conditions."

Disorders of fat metabolism, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and atherosclerosis, are characterized by
abnormal processing of fatty acids. The non-random distribution of fatty acids in phospholipids, where
saturated chains are linked to the first (sn-1) but unsaturated chains are linked to the second (sn-2) carbon
atom of the glycerol group, has important implications for membrane structure, lipid metabolism, and second
messenger functions. However, while the composition of unsaturated fatty acids in sn-2 position is controlled
by the Lands pathway, it has remained unclear what controls saturated fatty acids in sn-1 position. We have
collected preliminary data that strongly suggest an sn-1 specific remodeling pathway for saturated
fatty acids, which plays a pivotal role in the production of lipoproteins. Based on our preliminary data we
postulate that the acyltransferase LPGAT1 controls the composition of saturated fatty acids in the two most
abundant phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), and that this pathway
is critical for the regulation of the de novo synthesis of lipids in hepatocytes. To test our hypothesis and to
identify the function of LPGAT1, we will (i) establish the mechanism of phospholipid remodeling by LPGAT1
and (ii) establish the regulatory function of LPGAT1 in lipid de novo synthesis. To this end, we will define the
enzymatic reaction of LPGAT1 in vitro upon expression and purification of the enzyme (subaim 1a), determine
the effect of LPGAT1 knockout and knockdown on the lipid composition of subcellular membranes by
lipidomics analysis of tissues and organelles (subaim 1b), dissect the remodeling pathway of LPGAT1 by
tracing the metabolism of isotope-labeled substrates and by reconstituting the deacylation-reacylation cycle
(subaim 1c), determine the mechanism by which LPGAT1 remodels PC by isotope labeling studies in
hepatocytes (subaim 1d), determine how LPGAT1 affects global lipid fluxes in mice by lipidome-wide 13C-
fluxomics analysis (subaim 2a); determine the effect of LPGAT1 ablation on lipoprotein metabolism by
measuring production and clearance of lipoproteins in mice (subaim 2b), and establish whether LPGAT1
ablation protects from atherosclerosis in LDL-receptor deficient mice (subaim 2c). The proposed work is
significant because (i) it will establish a parallel concept to the Lands cycle for the remodeling of
saturated fatty acids in sn-1 position and (ii) it will identify the function of this pathway within the lipid
metabolic network. This is expected to have critical influence on the evolving concepts of phospholipid
remodeling and be directly relevant to prevalent health problems, such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and
atherosclerosis."

The JHM Hub- and-Spoke network is comprised of nine fully committed Spoke institutions with the capacity to recruit from more than 25 unique clinical sites across five states and Washington, DC. Annual ED census of the network exceeds 1.6 million visits with strong representation of minority, socioeconomically disadvantaged and rural populations. Emergency medical services (EMS) systems associated with Hub and spokes have committed to the SIREN program through direct participation in research conducted with the JHM Hub-and-Spoke network. The JHM DEM will leverage extensive clinical research experience a robust institutional research environment to make immediate and meaningful contributions to the national SIREN program and to improve outcomes for patients with neurologic, cardiac, respiratory, hematologic, and traumatic conditions. The JHM DEM has been continuously engaged in clinical research since 1985 and is a consistent national leader in annual publications and grants, total research funding, NIH funding, and total faculty with funded research. To date, the JHM DEM has enrolled tens of thousands of patients in prospective emergency care research. The JHM Hub-and-Spoke network will achieve success for SIREN through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Create a Hub network administrative structure that guarantees efficient and effective recruitment for and execution of SIREN clinical trials. An innovative Hub-of-Hubs network design will allow for rapid scalability to meet individual SIREN trial needs. Tools to facilitate effective and efficient recruitment, protocol execution, data entry, and quality assurance will be disseminated across the JHM SIREN network. Aim 2. Promote diversity of inclusion in SIREN clinical trials and clinical research leadership. Improving health outcomes for underserved communities is a core clinical and research mission of JHM; promoting representation of these groups in SIREN studies will be a major focus of the JHM SIREN Hub. A second major focus will be inclusion and multi-site mentorship of women and underrepresented racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minorities within our Hub-and-Spoke research team. Aim 3. Train future leaders in emergency care clinical trials research. Our Hub network will serve as a training environment for junior emergency care investigators (residents, fellows, junior faculty, nurses, EMS providers). Junior investigators will gain mentored experience in clinical trials research through workshops and didactics developed by the Hub, execution of SIREN trials, and participation in technical working groups including those focused on optimizing trial implementation and development of new trial proposals. These aims will be executed through a tripartite Hub organizational structure that includes (1) an Administrative Core, (2) a Governance Core, and (3) Technical Working Groups."

NUT Carcinoma (NC) is an undifferentiated or poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma that typically affects
the midline structures, including the head, neck, and thoracic areas. NC occurs predominantly in adolescents
and young adults of both sexes, a vulnerable and under-recognized cancer population. It is among the most
aggressive of all solid malignancies, with most patients having locally advanced or metastatic disease at
diagnosis. NC is characterized by the presence of a NUT fusion oncogene (also known as NUTM1), the most
common of which is BRD4-NUT. The chimeric genes encode BRD-NUT fusion proteins which retain BRD-
encoded bromodomains that bind acetylated histones and recruit chromatin-remodeling complexes.
Mechanistically, BRD-NUT fusion proteins appear to exert their pro-tumorigenic effect by blocking differentiation,
possibly through sequestering histone acetyltransferase activity. MYC, an oncogene that encodes a transcription
factor that plays a central role in tumor initiation and maintenance, has been identified as a key downstream
target of BRD4-NUT. BRD4-NUT has been associated with the MYC promoter and is required to maintain MYC
expression in NC cell lines. There is no FDA approved therapy or established treatment regimen for NC.
Cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens are used for first-line systemic therapy, and subsequent-line treatment
remains an area of high unmet need. Several BET inhibitors have been in development as monotherapies for
the treatment of both hematologic and solid tumors, and have shown limited clinical activity in NUT carcinoma.
More effective strategies are needed and combinations of BET inhibitors with other therapies represent an
intuitive next step. Recently, combined BET and CDK4/6 inhibition demonstrated strong synergism in preclinical
models of NUT Carcinoma. We are conducting a combination treatment strategy using the BET inhibitor
ZEN003694 with the CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib in patients with NC and other solid tumors through the NCI
Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) (Protocol #10509). Tumor tissue research biopsies will be obtained,
if safely accessible, at baseline, on-treatment, and at progression to characterize changes in cell cycle and
proliferation markers, and to explore potential biomarkers of response and resistance to treatment. These include
but are not limited to Ki-67, MYC expression, annexin V (apoptosis detection), whole exome sequencing (WES),
chromatin analysis (ATAC sequencing) and histone marks profiling (H3K27ac CHIP-seq). Peripheral blood
samples will be collected at baseline, during treatment, and at progression to assess thymidine kinase 1 (TK1)
activity. Decrease in serum TK activity has been previously described with CDK4/6 inhibition in breast cancer
and may correlate with a change in tumor Ki67. If clinical benefit is observed with ZEN003694 and abemaciclib,
this will support exploring the combination further in a phase 2 trial."

Cannabis use disorder (CUD) is a significant public health concern with origins in adolescence. Cannabis use
escalates during the teenage years, and early cannabis use predicts the development of later problems. Leading
etiological theories suggest that repeated cannabis use as the brain develops produces changes in reward
systems. Over time, these instrumental brain changes alter cannabis effects and increase the incentive salience
of cannabis cues, ultimately conferring risk for CUD. This longitudinal study pairs ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) in the natural environment and a gold-standard human laboratory (HLAB) paradigm to
monitor changes in subjective cannabis effects, cue reactivity, and CUD symptoms across the formative
adolescent years. Leveraging smartphone (EMA) reports in natural settings allows for studying adolescents’
reactions to the typically higher potency THC products and varied formulations (e.g., oils, edibles) favored by
teenagers. The use of an accelerated longitudinal design allows for charting development from ages 13 to 19
through multicohort assessments completed in a shorter timeframe. We aim to recruit 224 adolescents (ages 13
to 16 at study outset, n = 56 per age cohort) who endorse cannabis use in the past month. Adolescents will
complete a baseline HLAB protocol with follow-ups at 1, 2, and 3 years. Each yearly assessment point will also
include a 28-day measurement burst of EMA in daily life. Multiple domain latent growth curve modeling will: (Aim
1) characterize age-related changes in sensitivity to rewarding cannabis effects over adolescence (ages 13 to
19); (Aim 2) test prospective relations of CUD symptom progression with change in sensitivity to rewarding
cannabis effects; and (Aim 3) test prospective relations of CUD progression with responses to cannabis cues in
the natural environment and HLAB. The proposed longitudinal study extends the investigative team’s prior
research showing cross-sectional associations of CUD severity with subjective cannabis effects and cue
reactivity among adolescents. Our proposal is highly innovative, as well-studied etiological CUD constructs are
assessed across adolescence in real-world and laboratory settings using well-operationalized, multidimensional
assessments. Further, disaggregating individual differences in change from overall age trends through an
accelerated longitudinal design is a sensitive approach that is distinctively innovative. Our proposal addresses a
key priority identified by the NIDA Epidemiology Research Branch by efficiently combining the advantages of
longitudinal research with behavioral and laboratory-based measures to inform understanding of CUD etiology
(NOT-DA-19-066). This proposal will support efforts to prevent the progression of an incubating or emerging
CUD by enhancing scientific understanding of the trajectory to more severe harms. Providing new empirical
evidence of malleable processes that can serve as targets of preventative interventions has power to reduce the
magnitude of societal ramifications of CUD."

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that currently affects an estimated 8.4% of children in the U.S.,
resulting in over 600,000 emergency department visits and over 75,000 hospitalizations each year (Moorman et al.,
2012). For decades the burden of asthma in the U.S. has fallen disproportionately on Black children living in low-
resourced communities, for whom the prevalence, morbidity and mortality rates far exceed those for White
children. Black children have 2-3 times higher rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits compared
with White children, and a nearly 5-fold increase in asthma-related mortality (Volerman, et al., 2019). In some
neighborhoods on the South Side of Chicago the rates of asthma among young Black children are over 40% (Gupta et
al., 2008). The high rate of asthma and allergy in Black children appears to be in part influenced by prenatal stress
exposure. Thus, an intervention designed to improve prenatal stress regulation in Black women may also reduce the
risk of asthma in their children. The Nutrition and Pregnancy Study (NAPS) (NCT02647723) is a nearly completed
double-blind, randomized controlled study (RCT) of prenatal fatty acid supplementation aiming to improve birth
outcomes and infant neurodevelopment via improved prenatal stress regulation. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an
omega-3 fatty acid, has been shown to protect against the development of asthma and atopy in controlled animal
studies and in observational studies of humans. Results from two small RCTs of infant formula supplementation
provide further support for the protective effects of dietary fatty acids against asthma (Birch et al., 2010; Foiles et
al., 2016). The NAPS study provides an unprecedented opportunity to test the effects of prenatal DHA levels on
childhood asthma and atopic disease, and to further examine how patterns of prenatal stress regulation impact that
effect. We propose to conduct clinical assessments of asthma and other atopic outcomes in 130 children at 5-6
years of age whose mothers participated in the NAPS study, and to collect data from medical records and maternal
report to test two aims. Aim 1: Test whether prenatal fatty acid levels are associated with asthma and atopic disease
in early childhood. We hypothesize that higher prenatal blood levels of DHA will be associated with lower levels of
asthma and atopy in the offspring as measured via laboratory assessments of asthma and allergic sensitization at
ages 5-6 years, as well as medical record abstraction and maternal report. Aim 2: Test whether prenatal stress
regulation impacts the association between prenatal fatty acid levels and asthma and atopic disease in early
childhood. Our primary hypothesis is that cortisol and cytokine levels, heart rate variability, and perceived stress
during pregnancy will partially mediate the association between prenatal DHA levels and childhood asthma and
atopic disease. We will also test whether the association between prenatal DHA levels and early childhood asthma
and atopic disease is moderated by prenatal stress regulation at baseline and by changes in stress regulation during
pregnancy. To our knowledge, this will be the first test of prenatal fatty acid levels on asthma and allergy in Black
children living in low-resourced environments in the U.S."
10796856,"ABSTRACT: Food shapes gut microbial communities and their impact on human health. Thus, rationally
designed diets based on gut microbial ecology could provide a cost-effective intervention that significantly
improves public health. Still, there are hundreds of edible food species and thousands of unique gut bacterial
taxa. Do basic dietary rules govern microbial systems of this complexity? One intriguing observation has been
that the diversity of ingested plant species is linked to gut microbiome structure. However, it remains unknown if
and how relationships between dietary diversity and the gut microbiome generalize across diverse human
populations. Moreover, we do not know how diets designed to promote plant species diversity could affect
existing guidelines that promote intake of nutrients like fiber. This renewal application will address these research
gaps. Our project will build on our prior findings that: nutrients from plants can be an effective tool for stimulating
the growth and activity of human gut bacteria; and that both habitual diet and intake of diverse nutrients influence
microbiome responses to nutritional intervention. Based on our previous results, we will examine the hypothesis
that promoting species diversity provides an important complement, and in some cases alternative, to current
dietary recommendations involving plants, which focus on fiber intake. In Aim 1, we will test whether relationships
between dietary plant diversity and microbiome composition generalize across diverse human settings. To do
so, we will refine a novel technique for genomic dietary assessment of plant intake. We will then use our
optimized platform to measure plant species consumption across 1,500 individuals who vary by age, sex, race,
wealth, and nationality. Next, in Aim 2, we will model tradeoffs between plant species diversity and fiber intake.
Current dietary guidelines involving plants have focused on achieving sufficient intake of fiber. Yet, since plants
differ in their fiber content, policies that promote plant species diversity could diminish fiber intake. Do diets that
optimize fiber consumption or plant dietary diversity tend to benefit the gut microbiome more? Here, we will
address this question by creating computational models and using them to predict optimal patterns of plant
intake. Last, in Aim 3, we will evaluate ecological theories for how nutritional complexity affects gut microbial
ecology. Carbohydrates have typically been considered the key limiting resource for gut microbes. Still, modern
ecological thought suggests that multiple nutrients shape the activity of human gut bacteria. We will therefore
test three distinct ecological models for the number and identity of dietary nutrients that regulate the gut
microbiome. In concert, we expect these three Aims to lead to guidance as to whether there exists a specific set
of plant species individuals should consume in a balanced manner; or, if they should instead focus on eating a
smaller number of fiber-rich plant-based foods. We also expect our work to identify plant-based nutrients, besides
fiber, that could serve as new leads for microbiome-targeting dietary interventions; and to inform ecological
theories as to the number and relative importance of limiting nutrients for bacteria in the mammalian gut."
10817195,"The psychological and social impact of the pandemic have been severe and likely will have significant mental effects over the long term. There is also emerging evidence that suggests that COVID-19 may have direct effects on the brain or trigger immune responses that have additional adverse consequences on brain function and mental health in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted older adults, with those 65 years and older at heightened risk of severe illness. In fact, most older adults with COVID-19 survive initial infection and enter a clinical recovery phase for months or longer, which is often marked by persistent symptoms and adverse health outcomes. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19, especially in older adults. The primary goal of the proposed research is to determine whether COVID-19 is associated with increased incidence of dementia (Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias) and new or reemergence of psychiatric disorders in a national sample of patients 65 years and older, with complete outcome ascertainment from Veterans Health Administration and Medicare data. The secondary aim is to examine risk factors associated with development of these neuropsychiatric disorders (i.e., Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias [AD/ADRD], mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and psychosis) among older adults with history of COVID-19. The intent of the current proposal isn’t to be deterministic about the mechanisms of these associations, but to move the field forward informing current knowledge gaps about COVID-19 as a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders in late life. The current proposal will substantiate the early reports of neuropsychiatric effects from COVID-19 in small studies in a large geographically and racially diverse national sample using comprehensive data sources and advanced statistical methods and will improve our understanding of whether COVID-19 is a risk factor for the development of AD/ADRD and psychiatric disorders (Aim 1). Furthermore, this study will identify the baseline risk factors for development of AD/ADRD and psychiatric disorders among individuals with COVID-19 (Aim 2) and determine whether certain acute and post- acute symptoms are indicative of a higher risk for developing AD/ADRD (Aim 3). Given that over 79 million Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19, even small increases in risk of AD/ADRD and psychiatric disorders may have significant consequences for patients, their caregivers, and the U.S. health care system. It is likely that the proposed research will help to identify individuals that may be at higher risk and support engagement in early intervention strategies that will lead to mitigation of AD and related diseases and late-life mental health disorders."
10766118,"Project Summary/Abstract
Obesity is emerging a major public health challenge in the United States, and around the world. It
correlates with several comorbidities including, cardiovascular diseases and metabolic syndromes.
Additionally, epidemiological data suggest strong links between obesity and cancer; however,
mechanistic connections between obesity and these pathological conditions remain incomplete.
Specifically, insulin resistance is characterized by attenuated whole-body sensitivity to insulin and may
result in elevated levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFAs). Essential metabolic functions and
signaling pathways under this condition becomes dysregulated, and alter finely-tuned regulation of
glucose, lipid and overall energy hemostasis. Therefore, obesity is central to preventable pathological
conditions due to direct instigation of metabolic perturbations and associated inflammatory responses.
Importantly, elucidating novel metabolic, as well as angiogenic regulators may provide unique insight
of disease conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer that depend on these processes.
Studies on metabolism and cellular energetics have included skeletal muscles, adipose and hepatic
cells given prominent roles these tissues play with respect to lipid utilization and storage. However, the
response or contributions of vascular targets with respect to metabolic syndromes, including obesity-
instigated perturbations remain unclear. At the nexus of proposed `vascular response target' is
transmembrane, neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) receptor. We hypothesize that obesity and concomitant increase
of circulating FFAs promote the expression and interaction of Nrp1 with insulin substrates, which
vascular Nrp1 functions."

The candidate, Mark S Redfern, PhD, is a professor at the University of Pittsburgh with a primary appointment in the Department of Bioengineering, Swanson School of Engineering, and secondary appointments in Otolaryngology, School of Medicine, and Physical Therapy, School of Health and Rehabilitation Science. He is applying for a K07 to establish a new program in Human Factors of Aging to educate and support researchers, clinicians and students focused on improving the lives of older adults. A unique aspect of the curriculum is including design for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease through a partnership with Pitt’s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC). Research often leads to ideas and findings that can have direct application to improve the lives of people of all ages. One limiting step in the translation of these new ideas is the incorporation of human factors in the design. Incorporating the human factors of aging is a critical component of any medical device design for an older population. There are physical (e.g. mobility, dexterity, anthropometry, strength, range of motion), sensory (e.g. vision, hearing, vestibular, proprioception) and cognitive considerations (e.g. memory, executive function, cognitive speed). Translation of ideas for older adults with cognitive decrements and Alzheimer’s disease is particularly difficult. The interactions of cognitive decrements with the physical and sensory changes associated with aging require special attention during design that to-date is not addressed. To address this need, Dr. Redfern, in collaboration with the ADRC, will establish a new and novel educational program with a curriculum to bring the necessary knowledge of Human Factors of Aging to the research community. This curriculum will address not only physical and sensory considerations, but also the unique requirements for adults with cognitive decline, and how they interact with other age-related issues. The long-term goal is to improve the development of new medical devices and interventions that are targeted to be used by/with older adults taking into consideration cognitive decline. The specific aims are to: 1) partner with the ADRC to educate clinicians, researchers, and engineers in the human factors of aging to improve the translation of their ideas into effective interventions 2) support investigators with collaborative advising and consultation on special issues in aging-related applications and availability of the Human Factors in Medical Device Laboratory for development and evaluation of medical devices/interventions targeting for older populations; and 3) develop a multidisciplinary community of investigators with interests and expertise in human factors of aging; including experts from the ADRC. Dr. Redfern’s background as a senior NIH/NIA researcher, longtime educator in Human Factors/Ergonomics, and positions in academic leadership make him the ideal person to create a sustainable and effective program. The proposed partnership with the ADRC will bring together a unique strength found nowhere else."
10767319,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a highly morbid disease that commonly complicates patients with the
autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc) and is a leading cause of death in this population. Right
ventricular (RV) adaptation to progressive increases in afterload is the main determinant of outcome in SSc
and despite guideline-recommended early detection algorithms designed to identify PAH and therapeutic
advances in the treatment of PAH, SSc patients are often diagnosed late, and mortality remains exceedingly
high. Although several strategies are available, existing screening algorithms have low predictive accuracy.
Thus, an unmet need to better delineate high-risk phenotypes in SSc and improve identification of subgroups
at greatest risk of PAH earlier in the disease course when therapeutic interventions may affect prognosis. This
research aims to fill this gap by providing noninvasive and objective prognostic quantitative imaging markers
and trajectory-based subtype analysis using sophisticated biostatistical and machine-learning (ML) techniques,
enabling early identification of subpopulations at risk for adverse, long-term outcomes. Utilizing novel
echocardiographic techniques, we recently identified early changes in RV contractility and contractile reserve
in SSc prior to the development of overt PAH. Drawing from these findings, in Aim 1, we will specifically
determine whether the addition of echo-derived parameters of RV contractility to standard screening can
identify distinct clinical phenotypes and high-risk trajectories in the development of PAH, while characterizing
the nature and interaction of these trajectories across each of the variables. Our methodology will combine ML
with Bayesian multivariate linear mixed modeling to improve characterization and phenotyping of similar
subgroups and how trajectories present unique risk for adverse events. Aim 2 focuses on the biologic
validation of echo-derived techniques with simultaneous direct chamber-level measures of RV contractile
reserve and RV-arterial coupling to determine whether RVLSS is a noninvasive surrogate for RV contractility
and RV contractile reserve. Our synergistic and complementary aims will be used to derive and validate a
robust early detection strategy in Aim 3, improving upon existing screening methods, enabling the early
prediction of PAH in SSc. We are uniquely positioned to study these critical questions given our access to one
of the largest and finely phenotyped SSc cohorts in the world, our strong track record of excellence in the
noninvasive and invasive assessment of RV function in SSc, and our expertise in the complex multifaceted
methodology necessary to complete this project. Early identification and characterization of RV maladaptation
to emerging pulmonary vascular disease would be transformative in the clinical management of SSc, a
population with exceedingly high morbidity and mortality from cardiopulmonary disease. If successful, our
findings may also be applicable to other cohorts who are at-risk for the development of PAH to allow for earlier
detection and earlier intervention."

10814942,"Adipose tissue contains a network of leukocytes that respond to obesity by generating proinflammatory signals that contribute to metabolic disease. At the same time, there is strong evidence that many healthy immune responses are impaired in obesity and contribute to an increased severity of illness to many diseases that include respiratory viruses. We currently do not have a clear understanding of the mechanisms behind this dichotomy. Addressing this gap can reveal mechanisms by which a hyperactive immune system can be restrained to improve insulin resistance and can also identify mechanisms by which normal immune responses can be preserved to improve health in people with obesity. This proposal seeks to understand immune responses in adipose tissue by focusing on the mechanisms by which the innate and adaptive components of the adipose tissue immune system interact in mice and humans. Our central hypothesis is that the chronic pro-inflammatory environment generated by obesity triggers T cell and myeloid exhaustion. We further posit that the diversity of adipose tissue macrophages (ATM) and dendritic cells (ATDC) shape adipose tissue T cell responses that impair healthy resolution of adipose tissue inflammation. The premise for this hypothesis is based on the published work generated in the last grant cycle, as well as preliminary data demonstrating a impaired T cell activation capacity in obese adipose tissue from mice and humans associated with decrease diversity of T cells in obese humans and enrichment for novel subtypes of ATDC. Our approach will identify the mechanisms by which adipose tissue T cells become exhausted with dietary obesity by testing the hypothesis that the induction of T cell exhaustion profiles requires differential APC signals and the induction of BTLA receptors in T cells. We will also evaluate the hypothesis that endogenous glucocorticoids alter the ability of ATMs and ATDC to activate T cells in a way that promotes exhaustion. Completing these aims further advance the understanding of the cell-cell communication networks that are generated in adipose tissue and how they contribute to metabolic disease."
10763853,"Summary
Breast cancer is a complex and heterogeneous disease where the roles of many prognostic factors, including
androgen receptor (AR) which is an emerging potential prognostic biomarker, remain unclear in its clinical pro-
gression. The Nurses' Health Studies (NHS), which motivated this application, are large prospective cohort
studies conducted to investigate the risk factors for major chronic diseases in women including breast cancer.
The data from the NHS contain invaluable information for breast cancer research such as lifestyle, hormonal,
and genetic risk factors, as well as clinical outcomes such as breast cancer diagnosis, recurrence, and death. In
many epidemiologic studies on breast cancer survival, including the NHS, the hazard ratio (HR), which is esti-
mated based on the proportional hazards (PH) model, has been the most routinely used effect measure despite
its limitations. In the NHS data, the PH assumption in the association between AR expression and breast cancer
survival was found to be violated. The interpretation of HR is challenging and the result is often misleading if the
PH assumption is violated, which makes it difﬁcult to assess AR's prognostic values. Recently, summary metrics
based on the restricted mean survival time (RMST), which is deﬁned as the life expectancy up to a speciﬁc time
point, have attracted substantial attention as useful alternatives to the HR. The RMST has many advantageous
features such as its straightforward interpretation and robustness. Speciﬁcally, we can assess the prognostic
factor's effects in terms of absolute effect, which is clinically more interpretable than the HR, without assuming
PH using the RMST-based regression model. In this project, we propose to develop novel statistical methods
based on RMST to fully utilize the rich data from the NHS and to gain a better understanding of the complex
effect of AR on breast cancer progression and survival. Under Aim 1, we will develop a ﬂexible regression
method based on RMST that estimates the varying covariate effects across a range of time. The proposed
regression method will be used to elucidate the clinical signiﬁcance of AR in survival by different subtypes of
breast cancers. Under Aim 2, we will develop a model-free approach to summarize the bivariate survival
data (i.e., time from an initial event to an intermediate event and from the intermediate event to a failure
event). The metrics developed under Aim 2 will be used to study residual survival after breast cancer recurrence
and facilitate comparisons between groups by AR status for different breast cancer subtypes. These novel sta-
tistical approaches will be applied to data from the NHS to obtain new knowledge about the prognostic values of
AR and potentially lead to better targeted therapies."
10769880,"Anxiety disorders in youth are: 1) the most prevalent psychiatric illnesses, 2) associated with severe disability,
and 3) considered gateway disorders--as they predict a broad range of adult psychiatric and functional
problems. Despite the high prevalence and impairment, less than half of anxious youth receive mental health
services and access to evidenced-based interventions lags far behind that of less common psychiatric
illnesses, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This application addresses this mental health service
gap and responds to NIH’s priorities in PAR-MH-21-131: Pilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive
and Services Interventions (R34) aimed at testing interventions with previous efficacy in community settings
using novel service delivery methods. Specifically, we propose to refine and assess the feasibility of the
Anxiety Action Plan (AxAP), a brief intervention to reduce pediatric anxiety, delivered by primary care providers
(PCPs; defined here as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and/or pediatricians) in community pediatric
primary care clinics. Primary care settings are ideal for addressing pediatric anxiety specifically because: 1)
prevalence rates of excessive anxiety are high in primary care (approximately 10-20%), 2) over 90% of anxious
youth report physical complaints (e.g., stomach aches) and are “frequent flyers” in primary care settings, 3)
children with, compared to without, medical conditions treated by PCPs are more likely to have elevated
anxiety, and 4) PCPs are often the first and only health professional children visit. This proposal builds on the
PI’s development and feasibility pilot work with PCPs conducted as part of the NIMH-funded Center for Mental
Health in Pediatric Primary Care and with school nurses as part of a Department of Education grant. The
AxAP, modeled after the Asthma Action Plan familiar to PCPs, is based on the core element of cognitive
behavioral therapy for anxiety (i.e., behavioral exposure), was designed to fit within the short primary care visit
(20-30 minutes), can be delivered virtually, is brief (1-4 sessions), and can be billed for as an office visit.
Uniquely, and in stark contrast to co-location or integrated models, the goal of the AxAP is to enhance the
capacity of PCPs to identify and intervene with anxious youth, which will enhance access to care in general
and especially in locations with few mental health specialists. The proposal also incorporates several innovative
features including pilot tests of measures to conduct: 1) a cost-benefit analysis of the AxAP and 2) an
examination of theory-based target mechanisms at the child, parent and PCP levels. If results of this study are
positive, findings would support a large effectiveness trial using an intervention that is ready for dissemination
and that could significantly improve clinical care for anxious youth, enhance the capacity of PCPs to identify
and reduce anxiety, and lower personal and economic costs associated with pediatric anxiety."

Sepsis is a common cause of acute illness hospitalization affecting more than 20 million patients each
year. It has a mortality rate of up to 40% and a high burden of cognitive impairment in surviors. Following
critical illness, 26% of patients without pre-existing cognitive deficits will have cognitive function
scores similar to mild Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) are the
greatest cause of disability, and the sixth leading cause of death, in the country. Annual costs
approach $1 trillion. Delirium is a sudden state of confusion that is common in sepsis and associated
with increased morbidity, mortality and acquired long-term cognitive decline. Although there are
substantial costs to both conditions - personal, financial and societal - delirium and ADRD are bereft of
therapies. There is an established bidirectional clinical predisposition of dementia to delirium and vice-versa;
however, the underlying mechanisms for this effect are unknown. Studying pathological changes associated
with delirium offers a unique opportunity to understand how acute accumulations of neurodegenerative and
tau pathologies may contribute to disease pathogenesis and lead to long-term cognitive decline. We will
investigate the inter-relationship of acute brain dysfunction and delirium, cognitive decline and ADRD
pathologies. We will investigate whether plasma biomarkers for neuronal injury (neurofilament light) or
phosphorylated tau disease (a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease) are associated with acute brain dysfunction
and delirium during, or cognitive decline following, sepsis-associated critical illness. We will also
investigate the role of inflammation (and clinical factors) to drive changes in neuronal injury and tau
disease, as we investigate the mechanisms of delirium and accumulation of ADRD pathologies. These
investigations will fundamentally illuminate the mechanisms through which delirium, resulting from
critical illness, may lead to cognitive decline as well as provide novel insights into the pathogenesis
of delirium. We address the most critical question in our field: how does delirium exacerbate cognitive
decline? We leverage our NIH-funded MENDS2 study to address these questions in a feasible and
efficient way, analysing 1526 samples that are already biobanked. All the necessary clinical data required
for this project are collected and ready to be analysed. Through understanding the mechanisms of delirium
and ADRD, including the interaction of neurodegenerative and tau pathologies and inflammation, we will
identify potential therapeutic approaches to prevent increases in ADRD-related pathology. We will also
provide important information on whether screening for ADRD pathologies during acute illnesses may identify
subjects at risk for cognitive decline and identify novel approaches to mitigate the increases in pathology.
Our long-term aim is to limit the cognitive burden of acute and critical illness and hence, reduce the burden
of ADRD in our communities."

10747434,"The Alphaherpesvirinae include pathogens of the nervous system such as herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and the swine virus pseudorabies virus (PRV). Initial infection is commonly at mucosal epithelia such as the oral and anogenital mucosa for HSV, and nasal and oropharyngeal mucosa for PRV. Following replication in these tissues, progeny viral particles are released and infect the termini of adjacent sensory neurons. They then travel by microtubule-directed retrograde traffic along the axon to the neuronal cell body. The viral genome is ultimately delivered to the nucleus and persists as a circular dsDNA episome during ensuing latency in the trigeminal ganglia of humans (HSV-1) and swine (PRV). Periodic reactivation from latency is followed by viral gene expression, DNA replication and assembly of new capsids. These become packaged with the viral genome, emerge from the nucleus and bud into cytoplasmic organelles to generate enveloped, infectious viral particles in the organellar lumen. How and where these transport and envelopment events occur in alphaherpesvirus-infected neurons is poorly understood. Maturing alphaherpesvirus particles are transported from the neuronal cell body into and along the axon by microtubule-directed anterograde transport using kinesin motors. Infectious mature viral particles accumulate at the nerve terminal then are released to infect adjacent mucosal epithelia, leading to subsequent rounds of viral replication and spread. The identity of the kinesin motors utilized at each stage, the machinery used to recruit kinesins to trafficking virions and even the structure of the viral particle that traffics down the axon, whether non-enveloped capsids or capsids that have acquired envelopes in the neuronal cell body, are key questions that we address in this application. In Specific Aim 1 we investigate the function of the gE/gI-US9p membrane protein complex in recruitment of the kinesin motors KIF1A and KIF5 to HSV-1 and PRV. We also test an innovative hypothesis concerning the role of the large tegument protein UL36p in assembly of KIF5 onto trafficking virions. In Specific Aim 2 we use a novel “envelopment trap” to address the controversial question of where HSV-1 acquires its envelope, whether in the cell body or nerve terminal (the Married and Separate mechanisms, respectively) in a range of neuronal cell lines, human iPSC-derived Trigeminal Ganglia and explanted sensory neurons. We also test key questions concerning the mechanisms of kinesin recruitment during egress of HSV-1 and PRV via the Married and Separate pathways. This proposal is therefore focused on the three major events that underlie alphaherpesvirus transmission from the nervous system to mucosal surfaces following reactivation from latency: capsid envelopment, microtubule-directed trafficking, and anterograde axonal transport. The specific aims exploit the complementary in vitro and in vivo expertise of the two principal investigators, and our common interests and experience with the gE/gI-US9p complex and UL36p, to dissect the molecular mechanisms supporting recrudescent disease caused by these viruses."
10878687,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The calvarial bones of the infant skull are separated by fibrous connective tissue joints called sutures and
fontanelles. These joints are critical for early reshaping of the skull during birth and brain growth. Improper
fusion of these joints, both premature and delayed, results in craniofacial deformities seen in numerous
genetic disorders. In this proposal, we aim to study the relatively uncharacterized role of calvarial connective
tissue (CT) to better understand its role in calvarial joint development and pathology. We hypothesize that
lineage-dependent, regional signaling from CT orchestrates distinct differences in morphology, mechanism
of fusion, and susceptibility to abnormal closure among calvarial joints. Using both cutting-edge multiomics
technology and mouse genetics, we will resolve differences across calvarial joint CTs in both normal and
disease contexts. Syndromes featuring premature suture fusion (craniosynostosis) and delayed fontanelle
closure are commonly associated with variants in Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2). Although most
research thus far has focused exclusively on the role of Fgfr2 in the bone, our lab has revealed its importance
in developing joint CT, including tendon and ligament. We will, therefore, apply these findings to study the
role of Fgfr2 in calvarial CT using both loss- and gain-of-function alleles in mice. Our preliminary data shows
that Fgfr2 loss-of-function in the neural crest cells (NCC) blocks normal contribution of CT fibroblasts to the
advancing bone fronts in the anterior fontanelle (AF) resulting in its patency. Conversely, our gain-of-function
model featuring the Fgfr2M391R variant in Bent bone dysplasia syndrome (BBDS) shows that activation in the
NCC leads to multi-suture synostosis, most interestingly in sutures where only CT (and not bone) is NCC-
derived. Conversely, Fgfr2M391R activation in mesoderm does not affect suture patency. The NCC-specific
nature of these phenotypes suggests regional, lineage-dependent regulation of CT. In this proposal, we aim to
identify and characterize gene expression and regulatory networks within CT fibroblast subtypes, as well as
their spatial arrangements and fate trajectories, in different sutures and fontanelles. We predict that regional
regulation of Wnt, Fgf, and retinoic acid signaling pathways play a key role in the organization and fusion of
normal sutures by affecting cell fate potential. Additionally, we will explore the novel concept that non-
canonical, nuclear signaling of Fgfr2 orchestrates these processes via differential gene regulation in calvarial
CT fibroblasts. This study is expected to show that CT fibroblasts are signaling centers that direct calvarial
joint development and underlie region-specific fusion patterns in congenital skull deformities."

The goal of our research is to understand the visual processing performed by the human retina. In the
proposed work, we will explore the striking and novel visual properties of numerous new cell types we have
recently discovered in the human retina – including more than 10 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types that send
visual information to the brain, and more than 10 polyaxonal amacrine cell (PAC) types that modulate RGC
activity over large areas. We will develop new methods to understand their role in natural vision. We will
leverage our large, unique database of recordings from macaque monkeys, the animal model closest to the
human, to direct our experiments with precious human tissue. This work is made possible by several technical
advances: novel large-scale high-density recordings from human donor retinas, novel machine-learning
methods for mining of similar large-scale recordings from macaque monkey retinas performed over the last 15
years, and novel analytical methods to identify, model and compare new cell types and their function in the two
species. Preliminary results in both species reveal a striking variety of new RGC and PAC types, some of
which are likely homologs, and others that may be unique to humans. We will pursue two aims: (1) identify
many novel RGC and PAC types in the macaque retina, probe their unusual light response properties, and
develop models that allow us to further probe their role in natural vision, and (2) identify and characterize many
RGC and PAC types in the human retina, and then use novel large-scale analysis methods to identify
homologous types in the macaque retina. At the conclusion of this work, we will have identified and thoroughly
characterized many of the most important visual pathways at the output of the human retina, developed and
tested models of their function in natural vision, quantitatively compared to homologs in the most important
animal model, and identified retinal cell types and visual signals that are likely unique to humans."

MRSC uses flexible platforms to study insulin action, hormone secretion, hypoglycemic regulation, exercise metabolism, and metabolic flux analysis with and without simultaneous measurements of vO2, vCO2, respiratory exchange ratio, carbohydrate oxidation, and fat oxidation. BWRSC utilizes techniques that allow for granular measurements of the components of energy balance under a wide range of conditions. Chemogenetics, optogenetics, and fiber photometry are applied in the MRSC and BWRSC to study neural control mechanisms in concurrence with studies of metabolism and energy balance. The proposed VMPMOD has made significant technical developments that create new opportunities for advances in our understanding of diabetes, obesity, and metabolism. The Vanderbilt mouse program has been successful because it is comprised of a faculty willing to develop and make technology that is part of their research lifeline available to the scientific community and because of staff that are so skilled and committed that scientists are willing to entrust their mice, their research lifelines, with them. The same faculty and staff that has made the program successful in the past will continue to lead VMPMOD."

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is caused by atherosclerosis of the peripheral arteries, most commonly in the
lower extremities, and affects 8-12 million individuals in the U.S. Cilastozol was the last drug approved to treat
patients with PAD (1999) and twenty years of trials and pre-clinical testing have failed to advance therapeutics.
PAD presents as either intermittent claudication (IC; pain with exertion that is relieved with rest) or critical limb
ischemia (CLI; pain at rest with or without tissue necrosis or gangrene). Although less common than IC, CLI
carries a substantially higher morbidity and mortality; CLI patients have a risk of major amputation or death that
approaches 40% in one year. Differences in the clinical course of IC and CLI together with results of recent pre-
clinical studies raise the intriguing possibility that IC and CLI represent distinct phenotypic manifestations of the
same disease process. We propose an innovative idea; regenerating and functionally competent skeletal muscle
supports ischemic neovascularization and vessel maturation - ultimately leading to the recovery of tissue blood
flow and the prevention of tissue loss. Our proposal will directly test the ability of ischemic cells in the local limb
microenvironment to alter tissue outcomes. We will interrogate the role of human BAG3 (Bcl-2 associated
athanogene 3 - an evolutionarily conserved 575 amino acid protein) specifically in the limb muscle and
endothelial cells of patients and mice. BAG3 is a multifunctional scaffolding protein and co-chaperone with
pleiotropic effects in heart and skeletal muscle. It is a promising genetic candidate for therapeutic development
in PAD for the following reasons: 1) mutations in BAG3 cause muscle myofibrillar myopathy and dilated
cardiomyopathy in humans, 2) BAG3 variants exist in both African Americans with CLI (a demographic
disproportionately affected by PAD - Preliminary Data) and cardiomyopathy, and 3) a murine coding variant in
BAG3 regulates muscle regeneration, vascular density, and limb survival in a pre-clinical model of PAD (hindlimb
ischemia-HLI). To that end, this proposal brings together clinical vascular surgeons, a skeletal muscle biologist
who focuses on physiologic outcome measures, a biochemist and mitochondrial biologist who focuses on
interrogating mitochondrial form and function in disease, a clinical cardiologist and researcher, and a translational
scientist who studies skeletal muscle adaptability to injury and endothelial cell biology and has developed an
unparalleled biobank of human PAD tissues. The central hypothesis of this proposal states that genetic
variants in BAG3 result in myopathy and mitochondriopathy that disrupts communication between
muscle and endothelial cells and results in a local muscle environment insufficient to support the
vasculature. To that end, the Specific Aims are: 1) In PAD relevant models, determine the functional link
between ischemic myopathy and angiogenesis. 2) Determine whether Cox6a2 expression is sufficient to rescue
BAG3 variant induced myopathy in PAD conditions. 3) Establish whether BAG3 variants are a link between AA
race and differences in CLI patient outcomes."

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) manifest from a convergence of characteristics of the individual, the environment,
and the alcohol itself, and is strongly associated with pain disorders. In addition to the well-known analgesic and
anesthetic effects of alcohol intoxication, alcohol withdrawal is associated with hyperalgesic states which
contribute to relapse in patients with AUD-pain comorbidities. Here we will test the preclinical efficacy of
endocannabinoid (eCB) augmentation for the alleviation of alcohol withdrawal-associated hyperalgesic states
and determine the underlying neurobiological mechanisms subserving these effects. eCB augmentation and
cannabis products are known to exert analgesic effects. Our preliminary data demonstrate that pharmacological
augmentation of eCB signaling, specifically the eCB ligand 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), exerts reliable anti-
hyperalgesic effects in mouse models, while depletion of 2-AG levels worsens and prolongs hyperalgesic states
associated with alcohol withdrawal. Based on these data we will rigorously and comprehensively test the global
hypothesis that pharmacological augmentation of 2-AG levels will alleviate hyperalgesic states associated with
alcohol withdrawal via actions at CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. We will also test the hypothesis that
endogenous 2-AG serves a physiological role to counteract withdrawal-associated hyperalgesic states. We will
next test the hypothesis that 2-AG regulates an amygdala-prefrontal cortical (PFC)-periaqueductal gray (PAG)
neural circuit. We will use optogenetics, retrograde tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology to test the hypothesis
that 2-AG signaling suppresses amygdala-mediated inhibition of PAG-projecting PFC neurons. We hypothesize
that 2-AG signaling exerts analgesic actions in alcohol withdrawal via inhibition of glutamatergic transmission
preferentially onto PFC GABA neurons thus increasing the excitation/inhibition ratio onto PAG-projecting PFC
neurons, which contribute to descending pain modulation. Lastly, we will use in vivo calcium imaging of PAG-
projecting PFC neurons to test the hypothesis that noxious mechanical stimulation-induced activity of these
neurons is reduced in alcohol withdrawal and normalized by pharmacological 2-AG augmentation, and that
activity of these neurons is required for the analgesic effects of 2-AG augmentation during alcohol withdrawal.
Completion of these studies could provide preclinical validation for 2-AG augmentation in the treatment of AUD-
pain comorbidity and provide novel mechanistic insight into how 2-AG signaling regulates descending pain
circuits under physiological conditions and during alcohol withdrawal."

Surgeon-scientists are an underrepresented population in academic medicine, and federally funded surgeon-
scientist-led research has been in decline over the past decade. Substantial challenges are faced by surgical
residents seeking research training. Importantly, surgical resident training programs with ample protected time
for dedicated, intensive experiential research training have effectively contributed to the “pipeline” of
successful, independently funded surgeon scientists. These researchers have meaningfully impacted surgical
oncology patient care and scientific knowledge. The proposed Surgical Multispecialty Access to Research in
Residency Training (SMART) program brings together the extensive multidisciplinary oncologic expertise at
Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine (NUFSM) and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive
Cancer Center to create a multidisciplinary, two-year research training program consisting of (1) a Health
Services and Outcomes Research (HSOR) Track and (2) a Basic Science and Translational (BTS) Research
Track. SMART will draw upon the NUFSM Department of Surgery's 30-year experience of training surgical
residents in bench and translational surgical oncology research and the 15-year surgical oncology HSOR
resident training collaboration between the Northwestern Institute for Comparative Effectiveness Research in
Oncology (NICER-Onc), the HSOR Postdoctoral Fellowship at Northwestern, and the American College of
Surgeons (ACS) Cancer Programs. Since 2009, we have trained 46 surgical research residents who have
gone on to oncology-focused academic careers. During a two-year, intensive training period (90% protected
time), residents in SMART will be immersed in multidisciplinary, experiential research training, using a team
science approach, with committed mentorship and focused didactic teaching, while assuring their eligibility for
certification by the American Board of Surgery. Each trainee will have an experienced and diverse Mentor
Team (content and methodological experts), tailored to their training needs. The SMART core curriculum will
include brief courses in study design and analytic approaches, best practices and ethics in research, and
career development. Trainees will participate in the workshops, seminars, and research training opportunities
at Northwestern and at relevant surgical and oncologic professional societies. Trainees will design and execute
research projects that culminate in presentations at major national professional meetings and publications in
high-impact journals. Continuous monitoring and iterative program improvement will be achieved by
engagement of a highly accomplished External Advisory Committee and robust evaluation by Northwestern's
Searle Center for Advanced Learning and Teaching. The ultimate goal of the SMART program is to assure an
increase in the number of surgical resident trainees who successfully pursue and achieve academic careers as
independently funded surgical oncologic physician-scientists. Northwestern is uniquely positioned to assure the
success of the SMART program. SMART will be a national leader in developing future surgical oncology
physician-scientist leaders and mentors."

10766130,"Summary Abstract: Protein Networks as Synergistic Drivers of Membrane Remodeling
Membrane curvature is required for many cellular processes, from assembly of highly curved trafficking vesicles
to extension of needle-like filopodia. Consequently, defects in membrane curvature play a role in most human
diseases, including altered recycling of receptors in cancer and diabetes, targeting of filopodia by pathogens,
and hijacking of vesicle traffic during virus replication. Therefore, understanding the basic molecular mechanisms
that drive membrane remodeling is essential to our knowledge of cellular physiology and human disease.
 Research on membrane curvature has primarily focused on individual protein domains with specialized
structures, such as crescent-shaped scaffolds and wedge-like amphipathic insertions. While this work has
provided invaluable insights, this “structure-centric” perspective ignores two essential facts. First, most
membrane remodeling proteins contain large intrinsically disordered domains in addition to structured domains.
And second these disordered domains drive assembly of large, multi-valent protein networks.
During the past 5 years, our group has made pioneering discoveries in support of the hypothesis
that disordered protein networks are essential drivers of membrane remodeling in the cell. Specifically,
using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a model pathway, we showed that intrinsically disordered domains
generate steric pressure at membrane surfaces. This pressure provides a surprisingly potent driving force for
membrane bending, especially when coupled synergistically to the contributions of structured domains. This
work was the first to reveal the membrane remodeling abilities of disordered proteins, examples of which have
since been discovered in diverse areas of biology. Additionally, we have recently found that disordered domains
within endocytic proteins drive assembly of liquid-like protein networks which efficiently initiate endocytosis.
Importantly, this liquid-like behavior has the potential to resolve a long-standing paradox by explaining how
curved membrane structures can be simultaneously highly interconnected, yet dynamic and flexible.
 These findings suggest urgent questions about the role of disordered protein networks in the key steps
of membrane remodeling: (i) initiation, (ii) curvature induction, and (iii) cargo selection. First, how do protein
networks initiate remodeling events, controlling their spatial and temporal dynamics? Second, once an event is
initiated, how do protein networks bend membranes, stabilizing either a convex or a concave shape? Third, as
the membrane bends, how does the protein network select cargo, such as transmembrane proteins, which are
essential to the structure’s biological function? Building on our recent discoveries, this work will shift the paradigm
for understanding membrane curvature beyond its present focus on in vitro structure-function relationships
toward an understanding of disordered protein networks. By demonstrating novel synergistic mechanisms, this
research will provide a blueprint for the study of protein networks at membrane surfaces throughout the cell."
10754593,"Viscosity is fundamental to biochemical reactions and hence, life itself. Temperature affects the
diffusion rate of molecules and in turn modulates the rate of reactions in non-living systems. For decades it has
been assumed that cells in living organisms are subject to the same principles that connect temperature,
viscosity, diffusion and reaction rates. Yet it has been a mystery how the incredibly complex diffusion-based
interaction networks of a cell are robust to these fluctuations, since perturbation of reaction kinetics in even one
pathway has the potential to impact multiple aspects of cellular functioning. The regulation of intracellular
viscosity as a strategy to mitigate changes in diffusion due to the environment has been largely
unexplored. This proposal addresses how intracellular viscosity is actively regulated, the effects of
viscosity on cellular processes, and viscosity dysregulation in disease.
 We recently discovered that cytosolic diffusion rates and viscosity-controlled reaction rates are held
invariant across at least 20° C of steady state temperatures in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that
cellular viscosity temporarily increases in response to acute stress. We named this phenomenon
“viscoadaptation”. Viscoadaptation is both a homeostatic mechanism for maintaining constant viscosity
despite fluctuations in temperature as well as an acute response to a variety of environmental stressors.
Viscoadaptation acts via production of the viscous carbohydrate glycogen that is linked to human health and
disease, and we hypothesize that low energy levels trigger viscoadaptation.
 The discovery of viscoadaptation marks a major advance in our understanding of how cells regulate
their biophysical properties. Yet many mysteries remain, including 1) how viscodaptation affects the biophysical
properties of cells, 2) what signaling pathways regulate viscoadaptation. We propose to (aim 1) study the
effect of glycogen on protein mobility and structure (aim 2) investigate how the pathways regulating
viscosity in yeast and human cells.
 The proposed studies will examine regulation of a fundamental yet largely unexplored biophysical
feature of cells, viscosity. This will elucidate the long overlooked contribution of viscosity to critical cellular
processes and the mechanisms by which this fundamental property is actively regulated in cells. In doing so,
this work has the potential to reframe disease conditions from the perspective of viscosity dysregulation and
usher in a new conceptual framework of ""viscosity-related"" pathologies."

There is an unmet critical need for noninvasive methods to interrogate the genetic and molecular properties of the malignant brain tumor known as glioblastoma (GBM). Our group was the first to introduce the focused ultrasound (FUS)-enabled liquid biopsy technique for noninvasive and spatially targeted molecular diagnosis and characterization of brain tumors, which we term sonobiopsy. The current barrier to the widespread use of sonobiopsy in clinical practice is the lack of human data that rigorously characterizes the safety and feasibility of this technique. Our long-term goal is to transform the clinical management of GBM patients by providing genetic signatures of the disease using sonobiopsy. The overall obiective of this proposal is to perform a randomized, blinded, double-armed, single-center prospective clinical trial to validate the safety and diagnostic feasibility of sonobiopsy. We have strong preliminary data that demonstrated the feasibility and safety of sonobiopsy in rodent and porcine GBM models and also developed a neuronavigation-guided FUS system for performing sonobiopsy in patients. The proposed clinical trial will accomplish two specific aims: 1) Demonstrate enrichment of GBM plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to a detectable level with sonobiopsy and 2) Define the safety profile of sonobiopsy in GBM patients. Under the first aim, we will enroll forty presurgical GBM patients who will be randomized (1 :1) for sonobiopsy versus sham. Immediately prior to surgical resection, sonobiopsy or sham will be performed, and plasma will be collected pre- and post-sonication. Genetic sequencing will be performed on plasma samples, as well as surgically resected sonicated tumor samples. We will compare: 1) the frequency of GBM-specific variants in the blood pre- and post-sonobiopsy, 2) the differences in ctDNA enrichment between sonobiopsy and sham, and 3) the concordance in mutation detection between post-sonobiopsy plasma samples and standard sequencing of tumor samples. For the second aim, because the sonobiopsy or sham intervention will be performed in an intraoperative MRI surgical suite prior to resection, we will use MR imaging to define the blood-brain barrier permeability changes and detect tissue injury or edema/hemorrhage at the surrounding healthy tissue and sonicated sites if they occur, Histological analysis of surgically resected sonicated and un-sonicated tumors will be performed to define the safety profile of sonobiopsy by staining for hemorrhage, necrosis, apoptosis, and inflammation markers. This project is innovative because it is a substantial departure from the status quo by using FUS in a novel fashion to substantially increase the presence of tumor biomarkers in the blood. The proposed research is significant because it will establish the foundation of knowledge to enable the translation of this innovative technique and ultimately advance the diagnosis and monitoring of brain cancer patients by identifying genetic signatures of the tumor without surgery. In addition to the standard diagnostics of anatomic imaging and surgical histology, sonobiopsy has the potential to become the third pillar for brain tumor management which will have a dramatic impact on patient survival and quality of life."

 Polyploidy frequently arises in response to injury, aging, and disease. Despite its prevalence, major gaps
exist in our understanding of how polyploid cells alter cell, tissue, and organ physiology. This is part because
polyploid cells are heterogeneous and arise in distinct ploidy states (mononucleated and multinucleated) with
each nucleus having varying sets of chromosomes. It is therefore hypothesized that the heterogeneity of ploidy
states provides cells with a vast repertoire of mechanisms for tissue growth, repair, and adaption to stress. Using
the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model my laboratory has identified the core cellular and genetic
mechanisms regulating polyploid cell growth in epithelial wound repair and aging as well as novel physiological
roles for polyploidy in resistance to genotoxic stress and enhancing tissue mechanics. Since mononucleated
and multinucleated cells arise in adult Drosophila epithelium in response to injury, similar to vertebrates, we can
determine how a cell’s ploidy state affects its cellular, tissue, and organ physiology and disease susceptibility.
The goals of this project are to 1) determine how ploidy state, both mononucleated and multinucleated epithelial
cells responds to and protect against UV-induced DNA damage and 2) elucidate how ploidy state alters a cell’s
actomyosin network to enhance epithelial tension and restore organ movement in the fruit fly post wound repair.
Doing so, will provide fundamental insights into the versatility of polyploidy and how a cell’s ploidy state impacts
human health and disease."

The revolution in genome sequencing technologies over the past 15 years has created an explosion of
population genomic data but has left in its wake a gap in our ability to make sense of data at this scale. This is
in part because traditional population genetic models do not reflect the genomic and geographic processes
producing the tremendously diverse data now being collected. To capitalize on this flood of information we
need new methods and modes of analysis.
 In recent years our group has made great strides in using supervised machine learning for population
genomic analysis (reviewed in part in Schrider and Kern 2018). In particular, we have pioneered the
development and application of deep learning techniques for a wide variety of tasks including detecting
selection (Kern and Schrider 2018, Xue et al., 2021), localizing introgression tracts in the genome (Schrider et
al. 2018), characterizing the landscape of recombination (Adrion et al. 2020), predicting geographic origin
(Battey et al. 2020), as well as visualizing population genetic data (Battey et al. 2021). A particular focus of our
efforts during the last funding period has been understanding evolution of Anopheles gambiae in response to
vector control efforts underway in sub-Saharan Africa, thus we have been and continue to develop statistical
methods with these important data in mind.
 Our work on Anopheles has reinforced in us the importance of studying spatial variation, particular in
the context of adaption. In this proposal we build upon ideas we have been developing during the previous
funding period and discuss three facets of our ongoing research program. The proposal has three sections: 1)
we will continue our work on spatial population genetics, and propose to develop methods for inferring
dispersal parameters directly from population genomic data, as well as to improve our understanding of the
ways in which spatial structure can impact GWAS and related techniques. 2) To develop methods to further
characterize the population genomics of adaptation. In this section we are particularly interested in developing
deep learning methods that account for the geographic spread of an allele relative to its surrounding pattern of
genomic variation to discover beneficial alleles. In addition we will develop methods for discovering selection
that build upon recent improvements in our ability to infer population-scale genealogies (Kelleher et al., 2019,
Speidel et al., 2019). Finally, 3) we propose new avenues of development of a community resource project
which our group has been leading, the stdpopsim project, which aims to provide an open source, highly
reproducible and accessible method for doing population genetic simulation in a number of common study
systems. We outline plans towards more realistic simulation of genomes under selection, with a particular
focus on implementing previously published estimates of selective parameters. Moreover we will use the
stdpopsim library to benchmark commonly used methods in demographic and selective inference"
10843035,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Olfactory receptors (ORs) are one of the largest family of chemical detecting cell-surface receptors in
humans. ORs are expressed beyond the olfactory tissue, with 55 ORs highly expressed ectopically (exORs) in
18 different tissues, where they drive tissue-specific processes including sperm chemotaxis and muscle
regeneration. The majority of exORs, however, have no known ligands; they are orphans, which limits the ability
to understand their role in human health, including 1) elucidation of exOR downstream pathways in the
endogenous tissue, 2) the identification of exOR endogenous ligands, and ultimately 3) an assessment of exORs
as potential therapeutic targets. During the MIRA renewal period, the goal is to leverage the OR-based sensor
technology to generate large sets of high-quality experimental exOR-ligand data to train machine learning
models to predict ligands for the 36 currently orphaned exORs. Such an algorithm would vastly accelerate exOR
deorphanization, and may prove to be general, enabling the deorphanization of all 302 orphan ORs. The long-
term goal is to use the identified ligands that activate the exORs to tease out their role in human health, including
identifying the endogenous exOR ligands in the tissues in which they are overexpressed, and determining the
downstream processes in which they are involved. This understanding will enable an assessment of exORs as
therapeutic targets, and open the door to new, first-in-class therapeutics.
 Olfactory receptors belong to the class of cell surface proteins called G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).
Non-sensory GPCRs are involved in a myriad of biological process, from cell migration to immunity, making them
important therapeutic targets. GPCRs signal combinatorially, with ~100s of GPCRs expressed in mammalian
cells signaling via a total of 17 G-protein subtypes—resulting in extensive crosstalk between GPCR signaling
pathways, often with important therapeutic implications. A gap in knowledge exists in understanding the extent
of GPCR signaling pathway crosstalk and its effect on cellular processes and animal behavior. Dissecting GPCR
signaling pathway crosstalk will enable 1) the identification of GPCR signaling pathways leading to
therapeutically desired outcomes, vis a vis pathways leading to side effects, towards the development of more
precise and safer therapeutics, and 2) a more nuanced understanding of GPCR signaling that will be crucial for
the engineering of next-generation therapeutic cells. During the MIRA renewal period the goal is to develop a
chemogenetic toolset to combinatorially activate/deactivate multiple (≥ 3) GPCR signaling pathways while
leaving the rest of the cell intact in order to fully dissect the effects of GPCR signaling crosstalk and its biomedical
implications. The long-term goal is to ultimately enable combinatorial control of up to 17 different GPCR signaling
pathways, providing access to cellular phenotypes that may explain how combinatorial GPCR activation can be
leveraged for the development of new therapies and the GPCR-based circuit architecture could inspire the
development of next-generation sense and response therapeutic cells."

Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) have generated great excitement for their
promise to regenerate the injured myocardium. In pre-clinical studies, we have demonstrated that iCMs have
significant functional benefit; however, substantial challenges remain, including ventricular arrhythmia,
teratoma formation, and poor engraftment in the host myocardium. Furthermore, reliable regeneration of the
injured myocardium has yet to be seen. While no effective strategy for permanent restoration has emerged,
paracrine factors appear to underlie the beneficial effects of iCM therapy. Recently, we discovered the
mitochondria-rich extracellular vesicles (M-EVs), which are secreted from the iCMs. These M-EVs effectively
repair the injured cardiomyocytes and myocardium through restoration of intracellular bioenergetics. The
paracrine effect is achieved by mitochondrial transfer and biogenesis to augment ATP production.
This proposal will re-shape the future of heart failure (HF) therapeutics. There is clear clinical indication and need
to improve the high mortality and morbidity of HF patients. The shortcoming of current standard of care may be
due to the unmet need in understanding the bioenergetic imbalance in HF. The disruption of the balance
between energy supply and demand underlies the pathogenesis of HF. Cardiac tissues from patients with
hypertrophic, dilated, or ischemic cardiomyopathy all exhibit structural abnormalities of mitochondria and
diminished ATP production despite increased metabolic energy demands in the failing heart. Although
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) serves as a master regulator of
mitochondrial biogenesis and function, PGC-1α levels are decreased in the myocardium of the HF patients.
Insufficient energy generation results in the loss of cardiomyocyte contractility, myocardial dysfunction, and,
ultimately, decompensated HF. Proteomic analysis of M-EVs demonstrated a novel cluster of 6 enriched M-EV
proteins (PC), which interact with PGC-1α. PC was found to up-regulate energy metabolism, including oxidative
phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and glycolysis. Therefore, we hope to develop an innovative therapy
that targets the intracellular bioenergetics directly through the following 3 Specific Aims:
Specific Aim 1 – Confirm the role of enriched M-EV protein cluster (PC) in mitochondrial biogenesis.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the mechanism of the protective effects of M-EVs in an in vitro iCM model of
hypoxic injury.
Specific Aim 3: Assess the functional benefits of mitochondrial augmentation and/or biogenesis in an in
vivo mouse model of chronic myocardial injury.
Upon conclusion of this study, the bioenergetic mechanism of mitochondrial augmentation and biogenesis will be
confirmed in M-EVs for significant and sustained restoration of the injured myocardium."

Our preliminary results support a prominent role for dysregulation of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) in cancer
progression. In fact, our analysis of the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) transcriptome data shows that RBPs, as
a group, are significantly more dysregulated in cancer than transcription factors. We propose a multi-faceted
set of computational and experimental studies to systematically identify the set of RBPs that causally
contribute to cancer progression and to characterize their downstream effector mechanisms. In one strategy,
we propose to identify dysregulated RBPs by first discovering their cis-regulatory recognition elements in the 3’
and 5’ UTR of genes that show dynamic mRNA expression—both between tumor vs. normal samples, and
across each of the 25 cancer cohorts in TCGA. This will be accomplished using information-theoretic
algorithms that discover de novo linear and structural RNA motif elements with high sensitivity and low false
discovery rates. We have previously shown that such RNA motifs are the binding sites for RBPs that modulate
mRNA stability, a subset of which regulate tumorigenesis and metastasis. The genes harboring these motifs
constitute an orphan RBP regulon (or RBP module) with a suspected role in cancer progression. In order to
identify clinically significant RBP modules, we propose to develop a computational framework that quantifies
the degree to which the expression of each module stratifies patient survival across the TCGA primary tumor
samples. Our preliminary results have led to the discovery of many such modules with remarkable stratification
of patient survival across multiple cancer types. For the subset of the most clinically prognostic modules, we
will identify their cognate RBPs using both biochemical and CRISPR-based parallel genetic screens. In a
complementary strategy, we will computationally identify such clinically prognostic RBP modules from a
compendium of ENCODE transcriptome data obtained following shRNA knockdowns of each of ~250 RBPs. In
order to identify RBPs that causally contribute to cancer progression, we propose to develop a parallel
CRISPR loss-of-function screen for all RBPs in mouse xenograft models of tumor formation and metastasis.
We will then conduct a more focused CRISPR screen on the top ~20 RBPs that show both significant patient
survival stratification and mouse in vivo tumor effects in our primary comprehensive screen. The top validated
RBPs will then be individually characterized for their roles in a variety of in vitro and in vivo cancer cell
phenotypes. Finally, we propose to develop a parallel mouse in vivo CRISPR epistasis platform to efficiently
determine the specific downstream genes through which the RBP exerts its effects on tumor formation and
metastasis. Our integrated computational/experimental strategy will expand our molecular understanding of a
largely unexplored domain of cancer pathway dysregulation and potentially reveal new principles at work.
Furthermore, our focus on causal pathways of cancer progression will impact the diagnostic, prognostic, and
therapeutic precision with which we approach clinical oncology."

10758952,"Numerous studies have shown that induction of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity can have a profound
beneficial impact on cardiac structure and function following myocardial infarction. It has also been shown that
genetic background can impact the intrinsic rate of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in mice. We have observed
that mice in a DBA/2J genetic background (abbreviated DBA) have very low levels of cardiomyocyte cell cycle
activity following myocardial infarction. However, when crossed with C57Bl6/NCR mice (abbreviated NCR), the
resulting (DBA x NCR)-F1 animals mice exhibit a marked increase in cardiomyocyte S-phase activity following
infarction, indicating the presence of an autosomal gene (or genes) in the NCR background which acts in a
dominant manner to facilitate cell cycle re-entry. Analysis of backcross mice established that this gene (or genes)
resides in a region of interest (ROI) located on the distal end of chromosome 3. The experiments proposed in
Aim 1 will test hypothesis that a single gene within the ROI is responsible for elevated cardiomyocyte S-phase
activity post-infarction. Candidate genes within this region will be identified based on expression patterns
observed in infarcted DBA vs. NCR hearts as well as by the presence of sequence variants predicted to impact
protein structure and/or activity. The candidates will be systematically tested by generating genetically modified
animals, subjecting them to myocardial infarction, and then monitoring the level of cardiomyocyte S-phase
activity; an induction of cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity would confirm that the candidate gene being tested is
responsible for the trait. The experiments proposed in Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the elevated cell cycle
activity encoded by the NCR ROI alleles has a positive impact on the diminished cardiac function and adverse
myocardial remodeling which is encountered post-infarction. Congenic mice in a DBA genetic background which
retain heterozygosity on the distal end of chromosome 3 and thus carry the NCR allele (or alleles) which is a
major contributor to cardiomyocyte S-phase induction will be generated. The mice will then be subjected to
myocardial infarction and longitudinal functional analysis. Terminal analyses will include comprehensive
hemodynamic measurements as well as assessment of adverse remodeling (cardiomyocyte apoptosis,
hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis); relative improvements in cardiac function and structure would indicate a
beneficial effect from the NCR-encoded cell cycle activity following myocardial injury. Ultimately, the identification
and validation of genes underlying intrinsic differences in cardiomyocyte cell cycle rates observed in different
strains of mice could suggest potential therapeutic targets with which to enhance regenerative growth in injured
hearts."

It has been suggested that the future of medicine rests in cell and gene therapy. While this assertion may be premature,
it seems clear that these innovative therapies have extraordinary, paradigm shifting potential. For cell-based therapies,
this is best exemplified by the powerful impact of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in the treatment of hematological
malignancies refractory to current standard of care (5). In the transplant realm, MSC’s, stem cell derived islets, and
facilitator cells to promote bone marrow tolerance to renal grafts have shown encouraging results as cell-based
therapeutics (6-8). In addition, numerous early phase clinical trials are underway exploring the potential of regulatory T
cells (Tregs) to mitigate rejection of liver and kidney allografts (9, 10). More recently, CAR technology has been employed
to generate CAR Tregs as more potent, off-the-shelf, donor antigen-specific regulatory populations (11).
In the current proposal, we investigate the regulatory properties in the other arm of adaptive immunity to focus on the
regulatory activities of B cells. After finding that B cells were required for tolerance in varied experimental transplant
models and that B cells (or Bregs) isolated from mice tolerant to islets could adoptively transfer tolerance to otherwise
untreated B cell deficient hosts, we sought to expand the tolerogenic Breg population ex vivo. In so doing, we made the
unexpected observation that even naïve B cells stimulated ex vivo by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) manifested potent
suppressive activity in MLRs and prevented graft rejection in vivo (12). With further study, we demonstrate that a variety
of B cell activating signals induce Breg suppression and that, depending on the activating trigger, the mechanism of
suppression in vivo varies. Our overarching hypothesis is that Breg suppression is executed through antigen presentation
in the context of local immunoregulatory cytokine elaboration, such as TGF-ß and IL-10. Supporting this notion, we found
that B cell specificity for the donor was essential to suppressive function, perhaps indicating cognate Breg-T cell/Treg
communication (13, 14). Also noteworthy is our finding that clonal Breg populations with specificity for donor antigens
exhibited the greatest suppressive potency in vitro and in vivo (13). Based on these findings, in Aim 3, we will conduct
innovative studies to determine whether Bregs, imbued with donor specificity, through either transient or permanent
expression of a donor-specific CAR, prevent allograft rejection. Furthermore, recent studies indicate that CAR can be
delivered effectively in vivo using lipid nanoparticles (LNP) decorated with antibodies to target select cell populations,
such as host B cells (15). The LNP approach developed for vaccine delivery also lends itself to parallel transfer and
expression of mRNA payloads encoding suppressive molecules (IL-10, TGF-ß, etc.) to augment potency (16). Collectively,
our proposed work will advance understanding of Breg mechanisms of differentiation and suppression, optimize Breg
function and evaluate the potential of Bregs and CAR Bregs as cellular therapeutics."

Pancreatic cancer (PDAC) is the 3rd most common cause of cancer-related mortality in the US. Our veterans
and military personnel bear significant brunt of this disease. One of the major obstacles in devising effective
treatment strategies against PDAC is the incomplete understanding of its pathogenesis. For instance, smoking
is one of the major life style factors, which affects PDAC incidence and outcomes. However, our understanding
of the mechanism(s) by which smoking affects PDAC development is still rudimentary. Thus, to develop novel
and effective treatment strategies, we need a better understanding of the pathogenesis of PDAC.
Our recent work has demonstrated that gut microbiome modulates adaptive immune response and promotes
PDAC growth and metastases. Interestingly, few studies suggest that cigarette smoking significantly impact gut
microbiome. Whether, this modulation of gut microbiome in any way mediates the pro-tumorigenic effects of
smoking is not known. Intriguingly, our preliminary data in animal models suggest that gut microbiome is critical
for the smoking induced tumor initiation and progression. Furthermore, with respect to the mechanism, our
preliminary data suggest that smoking induced dysbiosis attenuates anti-cancer immune response. The current
study is the next logical step and clinical investigation of the findings generated from the pre-clinical
models. Based on our preliminary studies we have hypothesized that ‘the cigarette smoking alters gut
microbiome, which in turn promotes tumor initiation and progression in a immune dependent fashion.
This hypothesis will be tested through a combination of a clinical, observational, non-interventional study in
humans, and translational studies in Human Gut Microbiome Avatar Mice (AVATAR) generated using the
samples collected from humans. The study will be executed through the following three specific aims:
In Aim 1, to characterize the effect of smoking on gut metagenome and metabolome, stool samples will be
collected from smokers and non-smoker generally healthy volunteers as well as PDAC patients, and analyzed
by shotgun meta-genomics (for gut metagenome) and LC-MS (unbiased-metabolome). This analysis will help
elucidate the specific gut microbial colonies as well as metabolites, which are enriched in the gut of smokers and
might contribute to the increased incidence and worse outcomes of PDAC and other cancers in them. In Aim 2,
to directly evaluate the effect of the smoking induced dysbiosis on PDAC growth and to elucidate the mechanism
of this effect, we will leverage AVATAR model. Stool from healthy volunteers (smokers and non-smokers, in aim
1), will be transplanted into germ free genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC to yield patient specific
AVATAR mice. The tumor initiation and progression in AVATAR mice generated from the stool of smokers
(healthy volunteers/PDAC patients) will be measured, and compared with those generated from stools of non-
smokers. These studies will provide direct evidence whether gut microbiome of smokers promote tumor initiation
and/or progression, when compared to that of non-smokers. Finally, in Aim 3, we will build on our preliminary
studies which suggest that smoking induced pro-tumorigenic gut microbiome promotes cancer progression.
Specifically, we will evaluate therapeutic strategies by which the pro-tumorigenic effect of gut microbiome from
smokers can be negated.
Impact Statement: Pancreatic cancer is a leading source of morbidity and mortality in the veterans population.
Moreover, tobacco product use is alarmingly high in the military veterans, with 1 in 3 using some form of tobacco.
Our study can potentially uncover a new molecular pathway of pancreatic cancer growth in smokers, which can
be easily translated into the clinical paradigm for management of these patients"
10795821,"In the field of tumor immunology, while the generation and maintenance of anti-tumor CD8 T cell
memory responses are considered crucial for the long-term host survival, the basic tenets of memory
formation remain to be established. We propose to study and manipulate the CD8 T cell
NKG2D/DAP10  ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6) pathway as a means to generate durable and protective
anti-tumor immunity. The scientific premise of this study is derived from our work demonstrating that
NKG2D signaling provides CD8 T cells with pro-memory signals. We hypothesize that NKG2D,
through finely tuned DAP10PI3K/Grb2 signaling (as NKG2D cannot signal by itself, instead uses
DAP10PI3K/Grb2 as signaling adaptor), activates rpS6 resulting in the development of functionally
capable CD8 memory T cells. This proposal will define the underlying players required for rpS6

immunological memory against tumors including TRM cells. Here we will conduct proof-of-concept

The interface of Behavioral and Biomedical sciences is one of the most vibrant frontiers of science today.
The overarching objective of our proposed predoctoral Training Program, Understanding Health and
Disease at the Behavioral-Biomedical Interface, is to train the next generation of diverse behavioral science
researchers to utilize rigorous biomedical methodologies and conceptual frameworks that stretch the
boundaries of their thinking and research to position them to make transformative breakthroughs in
addressing issues of health and disease. The program is built on a foundation of an existing NIGMS-funded
T32 established in 2014, adding new programmatic, evaluation, and curricular plans, which bring greater
evidence-based focus on mentorship, rigorous and reproducible research, and career development. The
Program provides predoctoral behavioral science students in the Department of Psychological and Brain
Sciences (PBS) at the University of Iowa with an integrated program of coursework and laboratory
experiences. These include: (1) Broad-based training in the fundamentals of behavioral science including
rigor, transparency, and reproducible science, quantitative methodology and experimental design,
responsible conduct of research, and key issues in health psychology and neuroscience; (2) In-depth
training in pathophysiology and specific biomedical research areas (including conceptual frameworks,
driving hypotheses, and laboratory techniques); (3) Guidance and mentoring for development and
implementation of an innovative independent research program that spans both behavioral and biomedical
science; (4) Career development; and (5) Cohort building activities that support development of an inclusive
and supportive peer group. Behavioral mentors are from PBS; biomedical mentors are from the Colleges of
Medicine and Public Health. In the current grant, we have used the T32 support and two matching slots from
the Graduate College to recruit outstanding students (including ones from underrepresented backgrounds)
and to provide a catalyst for the Program, which has matured into a dynamic setting for scientific exchange
between behavioral science students and biomedical mentors and their labs. Since the start of the current
program, 51 outstanding students have participated in the Training Program including 12 URM students, 2
students with disabilities, and 5 first generation students. (19 have had T32 support) We have developed
Seminars and Retreats, featuring career development, science communication, manuscript and grant
writing, cohort-building, networking, and discussions of cutting-edge research at the Behavioral-Biomedical
interface, which we will continue in the new Program. The application requests 6 slots/year to provide these
impactful training experiences to our talented pool of trainees. The program is highly relevant to public
health, as training at the behavioral-biomedical interface will enable these scientists to innovatively address
mechanisms influencing human health and disease."

A safe, effective vaccine continues to be the best hope for controlling the Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV) pandemic. Due to similarities between the Indian-origin rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) and human
immune systems, vaccine development, as well as other approaches for controlling AIDS, are heavily
dependent upon the SIV and SHIV macaque models. There is a continuing need for Indian-origin rhesus
macaques to support this work. Domestic breeding programs that are designed to efficiently produce well
characterized Indian-origin rhesus macaques are necessary to ensure the supply of biomedical research
subjects required for AIDS vaccine development and treatments, and pathogenesis studies. The purpose of
this proposal is to provide support for the genetically characterized, specific pathogen free, Indian-origin rhesus
macaque AIDS Research Colony resource that was established in 2001 at the Oregon National Primate
Research Center."

The critical preliminary data for this proposal relates to dendritic cells, a critical immune cell that links innate
detection of infection to adaptive immune responses that can uniquely target and destroy targets. These same
principles apply to initiate and control immune responses to cancer. We discovered that in tumors that are
unable to generate adaptive immunity to assist in tumor cure following radiation therapy, dendritic cells fail to
mature. These dendritic cells that fail to mature express a novel target gene called Dnase1l3, which has been
shown to negatively regulate innate stimuli, and to negatively regulate autoimmune responses. This proposal is
an innovative investigation into the role of this gene in anti-tumor immunity, and the mechanisms by which it is
regulated in dendritic cells in tumors.
We hypothesize that DNAse1l3 represses innate and adaptive immune responses in the tumor environment.
The specific aims of this study are to 1: Determine the consequence of myeloid expression of Dnase1l3 on
the immune response to radiation therapy; 2: Unbiased analysis of the consequence of myeloid expression of
Dnase1l3 on the tumor immune environment following radiation therapy. Our study design incorporates CT-
guided radiation therapy of multiple authentic pancreatic tumor models and using a range of RT doses and
fractionations. These are combined with unique knockouts and assays that allow us to identify divergent
responses in vitro and in vivo. Our analyses of clinical samples use high quality bioinformatic approaches that
allow us to evaluate effect of the tumor environment on the biological response to innate adjuvants in patient
samples."

The human pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the disease cholera, regulates
virulence factor production, biofilm formation, competence, and other important processes
through quorum sensing (QS), a cell-cell communication mechanism that relies on the production,
detection, and response to chemical signal molecules called autoinducers. QS allows bacteria to
coordinate population-wide gene expression and function as coordinated groups. We have
identified four QS signaling pathways that integrate into the central QS circuit of V. cholerae.
Importantly, we found that disruption of these four sensory pathways altogether renders V.
cholerae unable to colonize animal hosts. Our data also suggest that ethanolamine and cyclic
AMP (cAMP), respectively, are responsible for controlling two of these receptors, CqsR and VpsS.
In Aim 1, we will determine how ethanolamine and other related molecules regulate CqsR. In Aim
2, we will determine how cAMP regulates VpsS. In Aim 3, we will define the regulatory hierarchy
in the V. cholerae QS circuit. Specifically, we will determine the roles of a recently discovered
cyclic dinucleotide called cyclic GMP-AMP in QS gene regulation. Together, our work will not only
define the role of QS in V. cholerae pathogenesis, it will also illustrate how integration of multiple
signals results in a coherent response in a bacterial cell-cell communication process. It is now
well established that QS is employed by many bacterial species to regulate both harmful and
beneficial traits. A long standing goal in the field is to develop pro-QS and/or anti-QS molecules
to manipulate bacterial group behaviors. Our hope is to harness the knowledge on QS to enable
the design of interference strategies that can be translated into new therapies to combat infectious
diseases."

The purpose of this proposal is to provide opportunities for undergraduate students from under-represented or
disadvantaged backgrounds to engage in an intensive, summer research training experience. Individuals from
diverse backgrounds are under-represented in biomedical and behavioral sciences. While the underpinnings of
this issue are complex, the problem has been perpetuated in no small part due to major limitations in the
educational pathways of trainees from diverse backgrounds. As a reflection of our commitment to this issue,
the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine has been running an NHLBI-funded program for students
from under-represented or disadvantaged backgrounds for the past 20 years, 15 of those as the current R25
program. We wish to build on this foundation and sustain this initiative. Our program was developed on the
premise that the principal barrier to diversity in science is not a lack of talent, but rather a lack of opportunity.
The program was created around an intensive research experience with an individual mentor, complemented
by activities important to building communication and networking skills, such as making presentations in journal
club and at a closing poster session, as well as seminars and workshops that address issues relevant to
career-building in biomedical sciences. To date, through this R25 we have trained 194 students. Of the 167
students that participated in our program and have now graduated from their undergraduate institution, 148
have been accepted to, enrolled in or received advanced degrees from medical/graduate school. In addition,
16 students are working full-time in research positions with plans to apply to graduate/medical school, bringing
the number of past participants actively engaged in the biomedical sciences to 98%. Of note, 111 students
continued to publish after their R25 participation. Many of these students are physicians, evidence of continued
engagement in research as they pursued medical training, creating an accomplished pool of physician
scientists. In pursuing funding through this R25 program, we have three principal goals. The first is to provide a
high-quality scientific experience to students of diverse backgrounds as a means of exposing them to, and
persuading them of, the excitement of careers in biomedical sciences. The second goal is to provide students
exposure to activities that will enhance their chances for success in biomedical careers, such as organizing
material for presentations and seminars on the mentee-mentor relationship. Finally, we hope to continue to
develop a network of contacts, role models and information that will help these individuals surmount historical
issues of access to improve entry and success. Over the past 15 years, we have demonstrated our
commitment to enhancing diversity in the biomedical sciences and success in expanding the pool of
underrepresented individuals pursing biomedical science careers. Through this renewal, we look forward to
extending this commitment and further broadening our impact."

Skp2, an F-box protein that constitutes one of the four subunits of the SCF ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, regulates
cell-cycle progression by targeting ubiquitination and degradation of its substrates, such as the cell-cycle inhibitor
p27. Skp2 E3 ligase has a broad implication in cancer, especially for androgen-independent human metastatic
prostate cancer. We showed that Skp2 expression was upregulated in metastatic prostate cancer specimens
and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and correlated with Myc expression. We further demonstrated
that Skp2 is a novel E3 ligase for Akt that triggers nonproteolytic K63-linked ubiquitination of Akt, facilitating
growth factor-mediated Akt membrane recruitment and activation. All together suggest that Skp2 simultaneously
regulates Akt signaling and p27 degradation, and TWIST-mediated EMT to promote CRPC progression and
resistance to androgen deprivation therapy (ABT). Although Skp2 SCF complex E3 ligase is a highly validated
drug target for cancer, due to the lack of an effective protein-protein interaction inhibitors, Skp2 SCF complex
E3 ligase is still considered as non-drugable. The proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) approach could
increase potency of non-drugable inhibitors due to its catalytic degradation. In this proposal, we have discovered
a potent Skp2 PRO-1 by improving therapeutic window more than 100 fold in vitro over small molecule inhibitors.
Skp2-PRO-1 can completely degrade Skp2 with 100 nM concentration in cancer cells and demonstrate the
complete in vivo Skp2 degradation and robust antitumor efficacy in challenging and advanced CRPC tumor
models including the genetic CRPC mouse model with intact immunity. To obtain two clinical candidates, we
will evaluate the PK properties of Skp2-PRO-1, a Cereblon based PROTAC and improve its PK and drug
properties as the first clincial candidate. We will further develop a VHL/or MDM2 based Skp2 PROTAC as the
back-up candidate. Finally we will validate the clinical candidates in advanced CRPC in vivo models using
diverse xenograft modes, cancer organoids, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and genetic mouse models. The
resulted clinical candidates will be advanced into the IND enabling studies for the phase I clinical trials for the
treatment of cancer."

 Pharmacological targeting of driver receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) can yield strong clinical responses, but
lung cancer patients treated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
inhibitors inevitably experience disease recurrence due to acquired resistance. More and better generations of RTK-
targeting molecular therapies are developed, but still acquired resistance remains as a major and persistent clinical
challenge. Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies are used to treat lung cancer, yet lung cancer patients with EGFR
mutations and ALK rearrangements have low response rates. We have mapped the protein networks in EGFR-
mutant and ALK-rearranged lung cancers, and shown growth factor bound protein 2 (GRB2) is a key oncogenic
driver that causes acquired resistance to EGFR or ALK targeted therapies. The recent discovery of covalent
targeted therapies for KRAS G12C offers an unprecedented opportunity to target KRAS directly. However, the
resistance against KRAS G12C drugs is being observed in the treatment of KRAS-mutant lung cancer patients. A
genome-wide analysis shows the activation of RTK signaling pathways and that GRB2 is a crucial gene for KRAS
G12C drug resistance. To overcome this problem, we will develop the first drug that selectively degrades GRB2
and disrupts GRB2 interactions with driver RTKs. In preliminary studies, we have obtained a potent GRB2 binder
TX-1-124 and solved the crystal structure of GRB2 bound with this compound. In this R21 application, we will
design and synthesize the first-in-class cell-permeable proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to degrade
intracellular GRB2, and evaluate potency of new GRB2-PROTACs against EGFR-mutant, ALK-rearranged, and
KRAS G12C lung cancer cells including those cells resistant to first-line EGFR-, ALK- and KRAS G12C targeted
therapies. The success of this project will offer the proof-of-concept that pharmacological downregulation of GRB2
using GRB2-PROTACs will block oncogenic RTK signaling and overcome acquired resistance mediated by RTK
pathway activation or reactivation. The Specific Aim is the design, synthesis, and characterization of GRB2-
PROTACs based on GRB2 binder TX-1-124."
10905988,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Neutrophil activation in response to infection is a double-edged sword that can either kill invading pathogens
and/or inflict tissue damage. Thus, neutrophils inextricably define whether the innate immune response to
infection is beneficial or deleterious to the host. The interdependence of neutrophil degranulation and release of
extracellular traps (NETs) has emerged as an important player in acute and chronic inflammation. This new R21
proposal is based on the unexpected discovery that the amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulates
neutrophil degranulation and NETosis during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the lung.
 While APP is known to drive the pathology of Alzheimer's disease via production of neurotoxic β-amyloid
peptides, a growing body of evidence highlights an interplay between APP, β-amyloid, and innate immunity. Mice
lacking APP are more susceptible to bacterial meningitis, and β-amyloid is an antimicrobial peptide. Preliminary
data are presented to support the premise that App knockout mice show increased mortality and lung injury
compared to wild type controls in response to P. aeruginosa infection. Surprisingly, P. aeruginosa-infected App
knockout mice also exhibit increased neutrophil influx compared to wild type controls. In addition, in vitro studies
demonstrate that isolated bone marrow-derived neutrophils from App knockout mice display increased
degranulation and NETosis. Together, these published and preliminary data support a conceptually innovative
and technically feasible approach for two Specific Aims that will test the HYPOTHESIS that APP modulates
neutrophil degranulation and NETosis to limit lung injury during P. aeruginosa infection. Aim 1 will
elucidate the protective role of APP during P. aeruginosa-induced lung injury. Aim 2 will test the utility of APP
and β-amyloid peptides as predictors of outcome in critically ill patients.
 Our discovery that APP protects the host during P. aeruginosa lung infection is a highly significant
conceptual advance with broad impact across the fields of lung biology and neurobiology. P. aeruginosa is the
most frequent Gram-negative pathogen causing pneumonia in patients with chronic lung disease (e.g., chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis), and is prevalent in critically ill patients with respiratory failure
in the intensive care unit. In the most severe cases, pneumonia progresses to acute lung injury, sepsis, and
multi-organ failure. Importantly, survivors often suffer long-term sequelae such as post-intensive care syndrome
(PICS) and neurocognitive dysfunction that reduce overall quality of life. Thus, our proposed studies may reveal
potentially transformative links between a pathogen-mediated dysfunctional APP response in neutrophils and
organ dysfunction and neurocognitive sequelae."

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is working to finalize a ban on menthol cigarettes. Finalizing a ban,
navigating litigation from the tobacco industry, and implementing the ban will be a lengthy process. Some
organizations have advocated that non-tobacco flavorings, including menthol, should also be banned from other
tobacco products like e-cigarettes. Despite the wealth of cross-sectional and uncontrolled studies of menthol,
we have very little prospective, experimental data investigating the impact of a menthol ban on tobacco use for
menthol smokers in the United States, and even less evidence on how a menthol ban for e-liquids might interact
with a cigarette menthol ban. If menthol is banned from both cigarettes and e-cigarettes, menthol smokers who
otherwise would have tried to switch to e-cigarettes may continue to smoke cigarettes or quit using tobacco
altogether. Thus, the impact of a cigarette menthol ban on changes in tobacco use may depend on whether
menthol is banned in e-cigarettes. The proposed trial is a 2x2 between-subjects randomized controlled trial
investigating the impact of a menthol bans for cigarettes and e-cigarettes on tobacco use patterns including
cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, use of medicinal nicotine, and cessation-related behaviors. Current menthol
smokers (N=240) will complete a 1-week baseline period before being assigned to either menthol or non-menthol
cigarettes and either menthol or tobacco-flavored e-liquid for 7 weeks. To model a ban, smokers will be instructed
to only use their assigned products, and adherence will be assessed using self-report and a urinary biomarker
for menthol. Changes in tobacco use patterns (cigarettes smoked per day, e-cigarette use, ability to abstain from
smoking) will be assessed through electronic daily diaries (Aim 1). Secondary outcomes include cigarette and
e-cigarette subjective effects, and cigarette and e-cigarette dependence (Aim 2). To assess the ability to abstain
from smoking, participants will complete a 1-week practice quit attempt in Week 7, and we will assess the time
to first smoking lapse. Self-reported tobacco use is corroborated by biomarkers for smoke and nicotine exposure
(expired carbon monoxide, urinary cotinine). Finally, it is critical to understand how menthol regulation will impact
the entire population of US menthol smokers, as well as the effect on vulnerable groups where menthol smoking
is concentrated. Thus, we will use advanced statistical techniques to assess whether any baseline demographic
or smoking variables moderate the treatment effect. Then, we will calibrate the treatment effects to the US
population of menthol smokers, and model the impact on smoking and vaping attributable deaths and life years
lost (Aim 3). The strong investigative team, coupled with our success using the proposed methodology, enhances
the probability of success in achieving our aims. This project will be the largest, most rigorous clinical trial to
directly test the impact of menthol regulation for cigarettes and e-cigarettes on current menthol smokers."

 Aging is associated with reductions in the rates of gastric emptying for liquids, and solids, as well as the frequency
 of peristaltic contractions. In humans, dysmotility of the gut potentiates infections, causes nutrient malabsorption,
and manifests with debilitating symptoms, such as gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, diarrhea,
constipation, Hirschprung’s disease, and fecal incontinence. About 20% of older adults experience chronic
constipation that profoundly affect health and quality of life. In the USA, gastrointestinal diseases cost $135.9
billion annually. Gut motility is regulated by coordinated activities from smooth muscle cells, interstitial cells
of Cajal (ICCs), central nervous system neurons and motor neurons in the enteric nervous system (ENS, “the
brain of the gut”). ENS motor neurons release excitatory neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine (ACh)
and substance P (SP). Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 4 receptor (5-HT4R) and dopamine (DA) 2
receptor (D2R) are widely expressed in neurites within enteric ganglia. DA inhibits release of ACh from
intrinsic cholinergic motor neurons by activating pre-junctional D2Rs. 5-HT enhances gut motility by
evoking ACh release via activation of 5-HT4R. CgA is proteolytically processed to several biologically
active peptides including catestatin (CST: hCgA352-372). Recently, we found that gut motility is
compromised in CST-KO mice, which was restored after supplementation with CST. Furthermore, CST-KO
mice show the following phenotypes: (i) enlarged stomach (gastroparesis), (ii) delayed gastric emptying, (iii)
decreased 5-HT, and (iv) increased DA. CST acts as a short-term antagonist to ACh receptor (AChR),
inhibiting catecholamine secretion and a long- term agonist, stimulating ACh secretion. Therefore, CST
might modulate gut dysmotility by increasing secretion of ACh at the myenteric plexus and decreasing
secretion of DA. Since we found decreased plasma CST in older WT mice and decreased CST in the gut of
older mice, we reason that CST would play a role in attenuating gut dysmotility. We have formulated four
independent synergistic hypotheses that may mediate CST’s regulation of gut motility: (i) activation of
AChR, (ii) promotion of 5-HT production by enterochromaffin cells, (iii) inhibition of DA production by ENS,
and (iv) maintenance of intramuscular ICC (ICC-IM) population by increasing tolerance. To validated or refute
the above hypotheses, we have proposed experiments in two specific aims: Aim I: Test the hypothesis that
CST improves gut motility and gastric emptying in aging mice by promoting AChR signaling,
increasing 5-HT production, inhibiting DA release, and preventing loss of ICC population. Aim II:
Translate CST-inspired therapeutics to combat age-associated gut dysmotility. IMPACT: The
overarching focus of this proposal is to generate important information on the impact of CST and its mimetics
on alleviation of age-associated gut dysmotility. Our study will be the first to directly link CST and its mimetics
to gut motility, and potentially establish CST pathway as a therapeutic target for gut motility. If the outcome
is positive, then new therapeutic avenues could come to light, making the risk worthwhile."

The Pilot and Feasibility program at the University of Chicago (UChicago) Digestive Diseases Research Core
Center (DDRCC) for Interdisciplinary Study of Inflammatory Intestinal Disorders (C-IID) is designed to provide a
mechanism to promote new initiatives in digestive diseases (DD)-related research. The overall objectives of this
program are to support investigations which would allow the development of preliminary data sufficient for grant
funding by conventional mechanisms (pilot studies) or testing of an innovative hypothesis which might have
important implications or yield significant results for digestive diseases related research (feasibility studies). Both of
these broad aims have been pursued in the context of research focused on maintenance of homeostasis and an
understanding of the pathobiology that accompanies intestinal inflammation. In the previous two renewal cycles
(2010-2019), 45 P&F projects were awarded, and in the current period (2015-2019), 20 were awarded. The
return on investment (ROI) over the past 10 years has exceeded 20:1. The P&F program remains an
important vehicle for promoting multidisciplinary collaboration and a strong supportive scientific network for the
young investigators funded by this program. Track I (new) investigators are given highest priority, followed by
Tract II (non-DD) and Tract III (DD, new direction) investigators. We are requesting continuing support at the level
of $110,000 per year. The funds will be combined with the $50,000 per year in supplemental funding committed by
the GI section, bringing the total award amount to $160,000 or $30,000-37,500 for each award depending on the
number of awards selected by the External Advisory Board. With the higher award size, the P&F awards are far
more attractive to potential applicants and substantial enough to improve the odds that they will be successful in
obtaining independent federal and extramural funding. A key feature of the program is the multi-disciplinary
nature of the submitted proposals, coming from numerous departments, programs, and institutional affiliate within
the University of Chicago network including the two of the University of Chicago affiliates, Argonne National
Laboratory (ANL) and Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL). This large catchment of investigator talent reflects the
overall scientific diversity of the research base of the C-IID. The P&F program has therefore made a difference for
many investigators, fostered collaboration and interaction, pushed the envelope of scholarship and discovery, and
is one of the jewels of our C-IID program."

Early life stress (ELS) acts as a strong etiological factor establishing conditions for subsequent stressors to
trigger many psychological and physiological disorders. There is a strong association between adverse childhood
experiences and cardiometabolic pathologies, including hypertension. When studying the role of the central
nervous system (CNS) in the long-term regulation of blood pressure (BP), we discovered that the hypertensive
response can be sensitized by exposure to mild stressors present earlier in life. Both Dr. Pollock’s laboratory
(Project 1) and our laboratory (Project 2) have found that the psychological stress produced by repeated brief
periods of maternal separation of rodent pups from their mothers (MaSep) will produce hypertensive response
sensitization (HTRS). Our studies suggest that CNS inflammatory mechanisms play a key role in inducing and
maintaining HTRS and therefore increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The central hypothesis of Project
2 is that the psychological stress of MaSep produces inflammatory mediators that reprogram the central neural
network controlling sympathetic tone and BP and thereby exacerbates hypertension when new stressors are
encountered in adulthood. Unfortunately, there are critical gaps in our understanding of exactly how ELS acts to
induce the reprogramming of the CNS and maintain HTRS especially when it is expressed by ecologically
relevant stressors such as eating high fat and high salt diets. Furthermore, we do not know what specific
interventions can reverse the effects of ELS. The Specific Aims of Project 2 are designed to address these
issues. Specific Aim 1 studies will determine whether the dietary risk factors of high dietary fat or salt (i.e.,
“second hits”) consumed after weaning exacerbate the hypertensive response in adult MaSep animals. Also,
key brain nuclei controlling sympathetic tone and BP will be analyzed to identify molecular changes mediating
HTRS. Specific Aim 2 will test the role of CNS inflammatory mechanisms in MaSep induction of HTRS and
investigate strategies to reverse the effects of MaSep ELS and produce resilience. Project 2 is conceptually and
technically innovative in that it tests an original hypothesis of how ELS sensitizes the hypertensive response to
elicit frank HT in adults by using an experimental paradigm developed by the Johnson laboratory to separate the
effects of HTRS induction from HTRS expression. Project 2 findings will provide important new information that
will be relevant for directing the interpretation of results from other projects. Projects 1 and 2 enhance one
another by both investigating the role of brain macrophages and inflammation in ELS-specific vascular
dysfunction and HTRS. Project 2 will provide key mechanistic insights to both clinical projects (3 and 4) by
clarifying involvement of dietary metabolites, exercise, and inflammation. New knowledge gained about
mechanisms involved in HTRS will contribute to understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of essential HT
and will provide valuable insights into intervention strategies for preventing high blood pressure."

The Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study has been a major source of new knowledge about the course of
OA and factors that affect it, having published over 180 articles ranging from studies of pain and pain
sensitization, to investigations of biomechanics, to inquiries into structural joint pathology as visualized by MRI,
and to studies of decline in function, buckling and falls, among others. The initial cohort enrolled 3026 participants
with or at risk of knee OA; a new cohort consisting of 1525 subjects was recruited at the last cycle (MOST3) who
were slightly younger and unlikely to have advanced disease. We will recruit an additional 150 participants from
underrepresented minority groups for a total projected sample size of 2293 in this next cycle of MOST (MOST4).
In addition to its scientific output, the study has been remarkable in recruiting and encouraging talented young
investigators to take on career defining investigations within MOST, having served as the basis for 31 career
development awards. Our overall goal is to advance our understanding of OA and its consequences to open
doors to new treatment approaches including stratified approaches to treatments. We will use an integrated
approach in the next cycle of MOST (MOST4) overseen by an Administrative Core, involving a Clinical Data
Collection and Management Core, Analysis Core, and Imaging Core, with guidance from an Observational Safety
Monitoring Board and input from a Community Advisory Board, to efficiently address key knowledge gaps
through the conduct of three Projects. Our Specific Aims are to: 1. Evaluate impaired exercise-induced
hypoalgesia (EIH) in knee OA, evaluate the relation of nervous system alterations to EIH, and determine the
impact of EIH on pain, function, physical activity, and fear-avoidance related to exercise (Project 1); 2. Carry out
proteomics analysis of synovial fluid to determine networks of proteins associated with generalized vs. localized
OA, pain and disease progression (Project 2); 3. Differentiate types of calcium crystals deposited in the joint and,
for each of them, understand the clinical and structural consequences of crystal deposition (Project 3); 4. Take
advantage of comprehensive longitudinal data already collected in MOST to address a wide range of questions
related to OA and its impact on outcomes; 5. Bring a multidisciplinary approach to bear on this complex disease
and offer career development opportunities to investigators including pilot project grants in this understudied
condition. MOST4 will introduce new approaches to understanding disease and will continue to comprehensively
assess pain, structural, and functional outcomes so that the specific effects of the factors proposed in the Projects
and other risk factors can be examined. This work will produce new actionable insights regarding pain, structural
deterioration and function loss in knee OA."

 This research program centers on the bioinorganic chemistry of methanotrophic bacteria, microbes that
convert methane, a potent greenhouse gas, to methanol in the first step of their metabolic pathway. As the
primary methane sink in nature, methanotrophs are promising tools to mitigate the deleterious effects of global
warming on human health, and may be deployed to generate fuels and chemicals from methane in an
environmentally-friendly fashion. Moreover, some methanotrophs produce copper-binding natural products that
are under investigation as therapeutics. The proposed projects take an integrated biochemical, biophysical,
structural, and genetic approach to understanding these processes on the molecular level.
 The first project addresses the structure and function of particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO),
an integral membrane, copper-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of methane to methanol. Despite
the availability of pMMO crystal structures and a range of spectroscopic data, the location and atomic details of
the copper active site remain unclear, and the sites of substrate, product, and reductant binding have not been
elucidated, all prerequisites for elucidating the chemical mechanism. The experimental approach involves
characterization of new pMMOs with highly divergent sequences, structural determination of pMMOs in a lipid
environment that maintains enzymatic activity, and genetic manipulation of native methanotrophs. The results
will lead to a comprehensive understanding of this critically important metalloenzyme and will further
understanding of homologs such as ammonia monooxygenase (AMO), another contributor to climate change.
 The second project focuses on methanobactins (Mbns), ribosomally produced, post-translationally
modified natural products secreted by methanotrophs to scavenge copper from the environment. The machinery
to biosynthesize and transport Mbns is encoded in Mbn operons, which are also present in a wide range of non-
methanotrophic bacteria, suggesting additional functions and unexplored diversity in structure. Mechanistic and
structural studies of the core biosynthetic enzyme complex, the iron-containing MbnBC heterodimer, along with
characterization of other biosynthetic proteins will be conducted. In addition, the involvement of other operon
proteins in release of copper from Mbn will be investigated using both biochemical and in vivo strategies. Taken
together, the results will provide new insights into natural products biosynthesis and will impact the use of these
molecules as therapeutics for Wilson disease and other disorders of copper metabolism."

Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. While a number of evidence-
based therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with HF, nearly half of these patients are
not regularly taking their medications. Although medication adherence can be improved through timely
interventions, it is challenging for clinicians to accurately identify and predict medication non-adherence at the
point of care. The challenge persists partly because medication adherence is a complex process influenced by
an interplay of a multitude of patient-, provider-, system-, community-, and therapy-related factors. This gap in
identifying patients at risk of non-adherence can be addressed through increasing availability of relevant data
from electronic health records (EHRs), which affords the potential to make accurate, real time predictions of
adherence in HF. In particular, recent linkages of EHR and pharmacy data has created opportunity for
incorporation of prior medication fills into EHR-based adherence prediction models that are updated
continuously. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with such data allows for incorporation of a large
number of intercorrelated risk factors and their interactions into models and for accommodating continuous
updates as new information becomes available. Our objective is to build a ML-based algorithm to predict
adherence among patients with HF. The specific aims are: 1) to develop supervised ML algorithms to predict
medication adherence among HF patients, using EHR clinical data, linked pharmacy fill data, and location-
based social determinants data from a large, urban health system that cares for a diverse patient population; 2)
to assess fairness of the developed algorithms by evaluating cross-validated prediction and calibration on
patient subgroups based on social and economic factors, to ensure that the desirable prediction performance
is maintained for the diverse groups; and 3) to assess generalizability of the algorithms through validation in a
second large, urban health system caring for a diverse population. Our approach is innovative and novel in
several ways. First, we will take advantage of linkages between pharmacy fill information and the EHR to
incorporate pharmacy data in our models. Second, we utilize geocoding of patient addresses combined with
publicly available data to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants of health, which are among the
most important predictors of adherence, into our models. Third, we will assess fairness of the model by
evaluating the predictive performance and calibration on patients from diverse backgrounds. Fourth, we will
ensure generalizability of the prediction algorithm by developing it in one diverse health system and validating
the algorithm in a second diverse health system. These models will be developed such that they can be used
for point-of-care adherence prediction. Our long term goal is to be able to implement them into the EHR, at
which point they can be incorporated into interventions to address medication adherence and, ultimately,
improve both adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with HF."

Sepsis remains to be associated with a high mortality of 20 to 30% with annual cost of $24 billion, accounting
for nearly one-fifth of the total aggregate costs in all the hospitalizations in the United States. Current sepsis
management is supportive. Therefore, identifying therapeutic approaches is an urgent task to improve the
outcome of sepsis. Neutrophils eradicate microbes as the first-line defense innate immune cells. In sepsis,
exaggerated de novo neutrophil production called emergency granulopoiesis occurs mainly via G-CSF
production. However, immature neutrophils are also released into a circulation to meet a high demand for
neutrophil number, but they have less antimicrobial defense functions, leading to worse host defense in septic
patients. G-CSF itself does not trigger full neutrophil maturation. Thus, an intervention to attain the
enhancement of neutrophil maturation is critical in sepsis for better host defense. Integrin CD11c was
considered a sensitive marker to differentiate sepsis from systemic inflammatory response syndrome. We
previously showed that CD11c KO mice had worse survival in the polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal
ligation and puncture (CLP) surgery, indicating the critical role of CD11c in sepsis. There has been a paucity of
research about its functional role in vivo. We unexpectedly identified that CD11c was expressed in the bone
marrow (BM) neutrophils (largely intracellular) and its deficiency was associated with less BM neutrophil
maturation. In a mouse model to recapitulate emergency granulopoiesis, mature neutrophils were released in
significantly less quantity in CD11c KO mice compared to wild type (WT) mice, further suggesting its
importance in neutrophil maturation. We created CD11c constitutively active knock-in (KI) mice, which
demonstrated to have more mature neutrophils in the BM in a steady-state condition and during infection with
better bacterial eradication and outcomes. In addition, our in vitro neutrophil maturation experiments using
primary murine CD11c KO neutrophils or HL-60 cells devoid of CD11c by CRISPR/Cas9 technology showed
less neutrophil maturation. Based on these results, we hypothesized that CD11c activity would significantly
regulate the degree of neutrophil maturation in a steady state and emergency granulopoiesis in a cell-intrinsic
manner. Our preliminary data suggested that CD11c would also regulate a subset of neutrophil effector
functions irrelevant of maturation. Thus, we will determine the role of CD11c in neutrophil maturation and
effector functions in a steady state and sepsis in Aim 1 and Aim 2. Because IQGAP1 was suggested to be a
binding partner for CD11c, its role will also be studied to delineate the mechanism of how CD11c regulates
neutrophil maturation and effector functions. Studies will be done by using human sepsis subjects and murine
models. Because there are no CD11c small molecule agonists and antagonists available, we will screen them
in Aim 3. Upon the completion of the proposal, we expect that we would solidify that CD11c would be a critical
regulator of neutrophil maturation and effector functions for a therapeutic intervention in sepsis."
10769715,"Pediatric glioma is characterized by activation of the MAPK pathway, either through a tandem duplication of
the BRAFA locus, or through point mutations (most frequently the V600E mutation). Approximately 1400 new
cases of BRAF-activated childhood brain tumors are diagnosed annually in the US. Recent phase I/II trials have
confirmed the efficacy of MEK inhibitors ((MEKi) for teatment of these cancers. However, for tumors driven by
the BRAF(V600E) mutant patients may progress on selumetinib treatment (i.e. become resistant), or rapidly
progress if drug dose is reduced or treatment stopped (at 2 years as in the recent phase II trial). Thus, while
MEKi is effective in causing tumor regression, it is not curative. Clinical results suggest that selumetinib is equally
as effective as conventional chemo-radiation therapy, but without toxicities associated with intensive chemo-
radiation treatment. Hence, MEK inhibitors usher in a new era in treatment for these patients.
 Our studies were some of the only PDX preclinical data that lead to testing of selumetinib (MEK inhibitor) in
the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium trial (PBTC029), with efficacy confirmed in the subsequent phase II trial
(NCT01089101). Here we propose preclinical studies that could lead to the next generation of clinical trials
building on the results from current MEKi trials. The studies proposed in this application will use a unique panel
of BRAF(V600E) pediatric brain tumor PDX models to focus on two critical issues: 1) to develop MAPK inhibitor
combinations that selectively enhance tumor cell kill in combination with radiation therapy (RT), and 2) to develop
therapeutic approaches to prevent development of drug resistance. The central hypothesis is that sensitivity
to MAPKi is a consequence of dual MAPK/TORC1 inhibition, and low-dose intermittent rapamycin can prevent
emergence of resistance to MEKi, and also to radiation therapy. These studies will also explore mechanisms of
resistance to MAPK inhibitor combinations and radiation treatment (RT), alone or in combination, and
characterize the mechanism/s by which rapamycin prevents emergence of resistance.
 Our overall goal is to identify optimal MAPK/TORC1 inhibitor drug combinations that retard or prevent
emergence of drug or RT resistance, determine the mechanism/s by which rapamycin retards/prevents
emergence of MAPKi and RT resistance, and determine whether such combinations can maintain tumor control
at lower doses of RT. Potentially, the proposed studies will identify novel regimens that will be more efficacious
than selumetinib and ultimately result in the ability to reduce the RT dose in patients, thus improving long-term
outcomes and quality of life."
10782968,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Background: Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease associated with an ~50% increased risk
of cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to matched controls. The influence of psoriasis-related systemic
inflammation on vascular health and subsequent cardiovascular (CV) risk is not fully known. Vascular endothelial
dysfunction, activated platelets, and the interaction between the two are instrumental to the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis. As a way to understand mechanisms of increased CV risk in psoriasis, this study will test the
overarching hypothesis that the vascular endothelium in psoriasis is inflamed, dysfunctional, and contributes to
CVD development as assessed by endovascular and platelet phenotyping, and that platelets from patients with
psoriasis act as effector cells promoting impaired vascular health. To develop therapeutic targets to reduce CV
risk, mechanism(s) that lead to the development of clinical CVD must be clarified.
Preliminary Data: Our group has shown using direct brachial vein endothelial cell analysis, that patients with
psoriasis exhibit impaired vascular endothelial health. Furthermore, unbiased analysis highlights
inflammasome (IL-1β) signaling with downstream IL-6 protein production as the highest differentially expressed
systemic pathway in psoriasis and correlated with impaired endothelial vascular health. Our preliminary data
also reveal that patients with psoriasis overexpress P-selectin (a marker of platelet activation), directly activate
cultured human aortic endothelial cells in vitro, and that markers of platelet activation correlate with serum IL-6
levels. This suggests that platelets contribute to the impaired vascular health we observe in psoriasis. These
findings have clinical implications because randomized clinical trials targeting the inflammasome pathway (with
a corresponding circulating IL-6 reduction) in patients with established CVD reduced cardiac events.
Methods: We will recruit 100 psoriasis and 50 healthy age-, sex-, race/ethnicity matched controls across the
spectrum of psoriatic disease and various treatment modalities to explore: (1) Vascular health in vivo by flow-
mediated brachial artery reactivity testing and pulse wave velocity studies, and directly ex vivo via analysis of
endothelial cells obtained from brachial veins; (2) Platelet biology through investigations into platelet reactivity,
platelet aggregation, and the platelets ability to activate endothelial cells in vitro.
Objectives and Career Development: No study has shown that targeting psoriatic disease activity reduces
the development of CVD. This proposal uses a highly collaborative environment between experts in CV and
platelet biology, immunology, dermatology, and rheumatology. It will lay the groundwork to propose future
larger-scale studies designed to reduce CV risk in patients with psoriasis. Furthermore, it will allow the PI to
become an expert in pro-inflammatory conditions, refine innovative methodologies and laboratory techniques
to study mechanisms of subclinical CVD, and provide a framework to become an independent clinical-
translational investigator."
10775741,"Long-term transfemoral (i.e., above-knee) prosthesis users are at an increased risk of developing secondary
musculoskeletal conditions compared to the general able-bodied population. Significant resources have been
devoted to the immediate rehabilitation needs of persons undergoing lower-limb amputation, but there needs to
be greater consideration for the early identification and modification of potential risk factors responsible for long-
term development of secondary health conditions such as low back pain (LBP). The etiology for the development
of LBP is not entirely known or understood, but in persons with unilateral amputations it is believed to relate to
the asymmetries and gait deviations that are typically demonstrated and required to walk with a prosthesis.
Previous studies have primarily focused on the lumbar spine and pelvis, while neglecting trunk posture and spinal
segmental motions. There have been limited studies to date that have investigated or determined if transfemoral
prosthesis users adopt standing and gait postures and pelvic rotation patterns that put them at increased risk of
developing or worsening LBP.
We propose to conduct a preliminary investigation of the trunk and pelvic positioning and motions during standing
and walking to determine if long-term unilateral, transfemoral prosthesis users are at an increased risk of
developing LBP due to socket design and prosthetic alignment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to
investigate and compare the effects of the standard ischial containment (IC) socket to a sub-ischial (SI) socket
design on the trunk posture and pelvic motions of transfemoral prosthesis users. We propose the following
specific aims for this project:
 • Aim 1: To measure kinematics of the pelvis and spinal segments in unilateral, transfemoral
 prosthesis users during gait. We will perform quantitative motion analyses on two groups of 6 research
 subjects with lower limb amputation using 2 different socket designs (IC and SI) walking over level ground
 at three self-selected walking speeds (slow, normal, fast). Data will be compared between socket type
 and to an able-bodied control group. Hypothesis 1a—IC socket wearers will have greater anterior pelvic
tilt compared to SI socket wearers and able-bodied controls, and they will exhibit considerably greater
sagittal-plane rotations of the pelvis and spinal segments during walking. Hypothesis 1b—IC socket
wearers will exhibit greater lumbar erector spinae activity while walking compared to SI socket wearers
and able-bodied controls.
• Aim 2: To measure trunk posture and pelvic orientation in unilateral, transfemoral prosthesis
 users during standing. We will use a multi-segment model of the spine and pelvis of the research and
 control subjects to determine neutral spinal, pelvis and prosthetic alignment during standing. Hypothesis
2a—IC socket wearers will demonstrate greater trunk flexion and anterior pelvic tilt during standing
compared to SI socket wearers and control subjects. Hypothesis 2b—IC socket wearers will exhibit
greater erector spinae activity during standing compared to SI socket wearers and able-bodied controls.
These preliminary data could be used in the future as a rationale to conduct larger, more in-depth and focused
studies to investigate LBP associated with amputation and prosthesis use. Additionally, our results may suggest
that conventional prosthetic socket designs should be reassessed to allow greater rotation between the pelvis
and femur of the residual limb. Understanding spinal motion and compensations would improve our
comprehension of the factors contributing to LBP and possibly lead to the development of new prosthetic and
therapeutic interventions designed to prevent or alleviate LBP."

 The correlation between health and income is one of the most persistent observations in the social sciences,
supported by research across countries, demographic groups, and time periods. The relationship between
income and health is large, emerges early in life, and is present across many indicators considered proxies for
health. Despite the striking nature of the association, there is relatively little evidence in the U.S. context on
whether income has a causal impact on health outcomes, and less information on what mechanisms may be
responsible for such a causal relationship if one exists. Income and health may be correlated because higher
income has a direct impact on health (e.g., by allowing individuals to purchase medical care), or health may
directly affect income (e.g., because poor health makes it difficult to work). It may also be the case that a third
factor—such as education—influences both income and health, driving the observed correlation between the
variables. Without the ability to randomize variation in income, discerning the true nature of this relationship is
difficult. We propose to provide new evidence from a large-scale, randomized intervention in the U.S. on the
relationship between income and mental and physical health through a randomized evaluation of a sustained
unconditional cash transfer program being implemented by two non-profit organizations. This program will
randomly assign participants to a treatment group that receives $1,000 per month or to a control group that
receives $50. Both groups will receive the transfer monthly for three years. We will examine treatment/control
differences to estimate the effect of the additional income on behaviors and environmental factors (e.g.,
nutrition, food security, exercise, substance use, sleep quality, and neighborhood characteristics) that could
affect longer-term health outcomes (Aim 1) and on medical care access and utilization (Aim 2). In order to
understand the effect of the increase in income on health, we will assess treatment/control differences in
subjective measures of physical and mental health as well as blood pressure, height, weight, and blood spots that
can be analyzed to provide cholesterol, A1c (a measure of glycated hemoglobin that indicates diabetes risk), and
C-reactive protein (Aim 3). We will measure the outcomes associated with these aims using a combination of in
person and online survey questions, nutrition diaries (ASA 24), time diaries, and biomarkers collected in person
by trained enumerators. We will also conduct long term follow up after the end of the payments. This study will
provide groundbreaking, policy-relevant new information on the impact of income on health, healthy behaviors,
and well-being."

For decades, the tobacco industry has manipulated moist snuff (i.e., dip) to become as appealing and addictive
as possible. These manipulations have resulted in moist snuff accounting for 90% of the smokeless tobacco
(SLT) market share in the United States and have slowed progress in reducing the prevalence of SLT use. The
public health burden of the tobacco industry’s actions has not been equitable; males living in Appalachian regions
of the United States continue to use SLT at high rates, leading to regional inequities in cardiovascular disease,
cancer, and poor oral health. The goal of this research is to identify local, state, and/or federal regulations for
moist snuff that reduce its addiction potential. This research will evaluate two features of moist snuff that are key
targets of manipulation from the tobacco industry and drivers of its addiction potential: length of tobacco cut (long
vs. fine) and nicotine form (low vs. high levels of nicotine in the free-base form). Finer tobacco cuts and higher
levels of free-base nicotine (FBN) result in faster, greater nicotine delivery. Building on the PI’s areas of expertise
and providing crucially-needed training, evaluations of tobacco cut and nicotine form will be done
epidemiologically, using analytical chemistry, and using experimental human laboratory methods. For the
epidemiological evaluation, we will complete a secondary data analysis of recent population-based cohorts to
evaluate associations between level of SLT dependence and product characteristics (i.e., cut, flavor, brand) of
moist snuff used by adolescents and adults in Appalachian Ohio. For the analytical chemistry evaluation, we will
quantitate the levels of total nicotine and FBN present in moist snuff products used by adolescent and adult
participants in our Appalachian Ohio cohorts; these characteristics of products will be compared according to
level of SLT dependence of the user as well as other product features (e.g., tobacco cut and flavor). For the
human laboratory evaluation, we will use a 2x2 within-subjects cross-over design to test how moist snuff use
(amount and duration), nicotine delivery, and appeal differ according to variations in cut (long vs. fine) and level
of FBN (low vs. high). We will also evaluate whether the association between style of moist snuff and outcomes
varies according to level of SLT dependence. Participants will be adults who live in Appalachian Ohio and are
daily moist snuff users. Altogether, this research will provide a foundation for understanding the characteristics
of moist snuff used in Appalachia—where the burden of SLT use remains stubbornly high—and the effects that
regulations on tobacco cut and nicotine form could have on reducing health inequities in this region. The conduct
of this research and implementation of the proposed training plan will also provide the PI, a promising scientist
with strong foundations in epidemiology and biostatistics, Appalachian health disparities research, and other
areas of tobacco regulatory science with needed training in addiction research, tobacco product evaluation, and
human laboratory experimental designs."
10772968,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
SRC Family Kinases (SFKs) are a group of 9 non-receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate the effects of many
extracellular and intracellular signaling pathways. While these proteins have often been considered to be
functionally similar to SRC, the founding member of the family, it is now clear that they have non-redundant and
unique activities. In cancer, these proteins are differentially expressed and their roles can even be antagonistic.
This project launches from our discovery that one of these family members, YES1, is selectively overexpressed
in Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC), is associated with poor outcomes, and is necessary for sustained
growth of TNBC cells. TNBC is a collection of highly aggressive diseases with limited therapeutic options
primarily involving cytotoxic chemotherapy. While many patients initially respond to these treatments, resistance
is common, resulting in poor patient outcomes. Thus, identifying vulnerabilities in this group of diseases is
essential to yield approaches for improving survivorship. We propose that YES1 is one of these vulnerabilities.
In preliminary data, we show that YES1 is essential for maintaining expression of Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR) as well as ensuring mitotic fidelity. EGFR is a major driver of TNBC growth. When YES1 is
depleted, EGFR is degraded and its signaling is lost. In addition, we report that YES1 silencing causes several
nuclear defects including micro-, multi-, and dysmorphic nuclei indicating that YES1 is essential for accurate
completion of mitosis. We hypothesize that these two functions of YES1 are essential for cellular viability in
TNBC. Moreover, we propose that YES1 may be a useful therapeutic target to improve the efficacy of drugs
targeting EGFR and mitosis. In Aim 1, we will determine how YES1 controls EGFR degradation and assess
whether YES1 overexpression underlies resistance to EGFR inhibitors in TNBC. Aim 2 will focus on identifying
specific events in mitosis that are impacted by YES1 and the mechanisms involved. It will also discern whether
modulating YES1 can impact response to taxanes, mainstay chemotherapies for TNBC. Lastly, in Aim 3, we will
determine if EGFR and YES1 participate in a feedforward loop that controls mitosis. This will involve interrogating
the role of EGFR in mediating the effects of YES1 on mitosis and determining if EGFR is also an upstream
regulator of YES1. Major innovations of this project include the identification of YES1 as a new oncogenic driver
of TNBC, the discovery that YES1 and EGFR may control the genomic complexity that is associated with this
disease, the therapeutic assessment of a novel inhibitor of YES1 in PDX models of TNBC, and the potential for
improving the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors and taxanes in a disease that requires new therapeutic approaches to
improve patient outcomes."

We have discovered a new mechanism for inflammation on the ocular surface. First, we
discovered the presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) on the ocular surface of dry eye
disease (DED) patients and subsequently, the presence of citrullinated proteins and anti-
citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). ACPAs not only cause ocular surface disease, but also
stimulate formation of NETs, thus creating a self-perpetuating cycle of chronic inflammation on
the ocular surface. We present an innovative pathophysiological concept: DED is characterized
by breach of self-tolerance towards citrullinated antigens with generation of autoantibodies
(ACPAs) and NETs could represent a source of citrullinated antigens fueling the ACPA
autoimmune response over the ocular surface. We performed a first-in-human pilot clinical trial
and showed that ocular surface immune globulin (OSIG) eye drops, formulated from pooled
human immune globulin products (IVIG), were safe and efficacious in treating DED patients. Our
findings shift the current paradigm that focuses on T-cell mediated inflammation as central to the
pathophysiology of DED to also include autoimmune inflammation that is driven by post-
translational modifications in self-proteins (citrullination) and autoantibodies (ACPAs). The
purpose of this R24 application is to produce preclinical data that supports a commercial
Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The
longer-term goal is for testing the efficacy of OSIG eye drops in clinical trials and positioning OSIG
eye drops as a new topical biologic immunotherapy for DED patients. Therefore, in Aim A, we
seek to develop an optimum OSIG eye drop formulation using Quality by Design (QbD) principles,
test critical quality attributes (CQAs) and GMP manufacture clinical supplies. In order to use OSIG
ophthalmic formulation in human, an FDA IND is a prerequisite, therefore, in Aim B, we propose
to perform pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo toxicology and efficacy studies using the OSIG
ophthalmic formulation to meet regulatory requirements for IND studies. In Aim C, we propose to
perform a clinical study to identify DED subtypes, clinical presentations and patient characteristics
that are most associated with ACPAs or NETs, hence most likely to show therapeutic benefit with
OSIG therapy. To successfully achieve these three Aims, we have established a highly qualified,
multi-disciplinary team that is experienced in ophthalmic drug development, and FDA processes
and regulations. If the aims of this grant proposal are successfully achieved, we will be one-step
closer to introducing the first immunotherapy for ocular surface diseases into clinical practice."

 How does the brain generate and maintain a persistent high-aggression state? While
pathological, persistent aggression is a common symptom in many diverse mental health disorders
including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, autism, Rett syndrome, and
traumatic brain injury, we lack a fundamental understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying
persistent social states. Many models of aggression posit that this dysregulation occurs through the
failure of “top-down” inhibitory control of subcortical circuits for aggression, through the circuit and
synaptic basis for these models remain unclear. Here, we propose that pathological aggression may
hijack circuit mechanisms used to generate persistent aggressive states in adaptive contexts. In
particular, the experience of aggression has long been known to facilitate the emergence of a persistent
high-aggression state, enabling animals to defend territory and status across long periods of time.
Examining how experience “updates” neural circuits in the healthy brain to facilitate future aggression
provides a unique window on how these circuits become dysregulated under pathological conditions.
 What are the neural mechanisms underlying experience-dependent updating? To explore this,
we will look longitudinally at the changing relationship between neural activity in the ventromedial
hypothalamus, ventrolateral area (VMHvl), an aggression output area with a well-described role in
aggression in both sexes, and its “upstream” inhibitory inputs. In this proposal, we will test the novel
hypothesis that aggression experience stabilizes a persistent aggressive state through a circuit
“rerouting” mechanism rather than changes in the activity of inhibitory control loci.
 Using a variety of methods for supervised and unsupervised behavioral analysis, virally
mediated anatomical tracing, synaptic physiology, optogenetics and cellular resolution high-density
recordings, we will look longitudinally at how experience alters the fundamental properties of this circuit
to implement behavioral change. First, we will map the putative identity of circuit nodes with the
architectural capacity to reroute inhibition and characterize the changes in synaptic strength of this
circuit across experience. Next, we will specifically examine the relationship between the activity of the
regulatory input and the circuit-level output across experience. Lastly, we will perform high-density
population recordings to elucidate the changes in the underlying computations being performed by the
circuit to stabilize a high aggression state. Together, these data will provide a comprehensive
integrated framework for understanding how experience generates a persistent behavioral state, and
will pave the way for novel activity-dependent tools that may be able to detect neural signatures of
experience and behavioral persistence in patient populations at risk for aggression dysregulation."

The excessive intake of saturated fat and added sugars has been identified as a leading cause of premature
mortality among adults in the U.S. contributing to approximately 700,000 deaths each year. The 2015-2020
Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting these nutrients to <10% total energy intake to prevent
disease. Achieving these public health recommendations will require understanding the patterns of saturated fat
and added sugar intake so more effective dietary interventions can be developed. Traditionally, estimates of
saturated fat and added sugar intake are measured using food frequency questionnaires or 24-hr dietary recalls
(24HR). These methods are time-intensive and cognitively taxing for users and costly for researchers. They are
also highly prone to recall bias and misreporting related due, in part, to the reliance on a person’s memory over
long recall intervals and errors in portion size estimation. The proposed dietary assessment method aims to
address these limitations with ecological momentary assessment (EMA). EMA uses updated technology and
sampling methods that can update and improve upon traditional assessment methods. EMA studies often use
mobile phone apps to assess events with brief, automated surveys delivered periodically throughout the day.
EMA can, thereby, shorten recall intervals to improve reporting errors and reduce user and researcher burden
while maximizing the ecological validity. To date, mobile EMA methods for diet assessment (mEMDA) used in
research have been study specific. They have not been systematically developed nor optimized for widespread
use in research. This project would represent the first research-quality and fully automated, EMA-based mobile
dietary assessment research tool. In recent pilot work, we demonstrated the potential utility of mEMDA. A brief
mobile survey performed as well as web-assisted 24HR to estimate the intake of predefined snack foods. Here,
the goal of the proposed project is to systematically develop and test a mEMDA app and sampling approach to
accurately estimate the intake of saturated fat and added sugars in a diverse population. To do this we will derive
a culturally- and demographically representative list of foods and beverages that contribute a majority (>70%) of
the saturated fat and added sugars in the American diet using recent NHANES data (Aim 1); develop with a
user-centered design the mEMDA app and analysis platform with visual food images for portion size estimation
and nutrient analysis capabilities (Aim 2); determine the best mEMDA sampling approach (event-contingent vs.
interval-contingent sampling) (Aim 3); and compare the accuracy of estimating energy intake from saturated fat
and added sugars using the optimized mEMDA app and sampling approach vs. interviewer-assisted 24HR in a
controlled-feeding study. Future applications of the mEMDA app include: (1) reliably assessing momentary
intakes of other foods or nutrients (e.g., fruit and vegetable intake, sodium), (2) integration with mobile
intervention platforms to give real-time, dietary feedback to participants (3) concurrent-capturing meal context
variables (e.g., social, environmental, and psycho-social variables) for future, just-in-time dietary interventions."

Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation has profound effects upon skin and generates systemic consequences from fever
to immunosuppression to vitamin D production. As UVB only penetrates the epidermis, a major unanswered
question in photobiology is how UVB-treated epidermal skin sends systemic signals. Recent studies have
indicated that small membrane-bound vesicles known as microvesicle particles (MVP) released from cells in
response to various stressors can act as potent signaling agents due to their ability to carry nuclear and
cytoplasmic components. We have demonstrated that UVB generates MVP release from epithelial cells and
skin, which could provide a potential mechanism for UVB-mediated systemic signaling. Our group and others
have demonstrated that UVB radiation generates high levels of the lipid mediator Platelet-activating factor
(PAF) produced enzymatically and PAF-receptor (PAFR) agonists produced non-enzymatically via reactive
oxygen species. Our ongoing studies using antioxidants and PAFR-expressing/null cell lines and
pharmacologic/genetic inhibition of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) have implicated involvement
of PAFR signaling resulting in aSMase activation in UVB generated MVP (UVB-MVP). Finally, we provide
evidence that UVB-MVP do not carry significant amounts of protein cytokines, yet carry bioactive PAF
agonists. We have evidence that metabolically labile PAF agonists are protected traveling in MVP and these
bioactive lipids are involved in acute pro-inflammatory and delayed immunosuppressive effects of UVB. Yet
knowledge gaps exist as to how UVB-MVP are generated and if this new pathway can be exploited to treat
photosensitivity diseases. Two aims are designed to test the hypothesis that UVB generates MVP in human
skin in a PAF-dependent manner involving aSMase and transfers both local and systemic effects via their
carried PAF agonists. Aim 1 will use in vitro cell lines and murine genetic and pharmacologic models to
determine the mechanisms of UVB-MVP generation. This aim will validate tools to define the roles of UVB-
MVP in acute pro-inflammatory effects of UVB, using a murine model of photosensitivity that we have
previously demonstrated is PAF-dependent and a separate photosensitive murine lupus model. Aim 2 will use
both ex vivo skin explants and in vivo human subjects to test the ability of human skin to generate UVB-MVP.
Moreover, we will define if oral antioxidants and topical aSMase inhibitor treatments will block UVB-MVP
generation and UVB-mediated acute inflammation in humans. Finally, we will test if human subjects exhibiting
clinical photosensitivity respond to UVB with increased UVB-MVP and if a topical aSMase inhibitor blocks the
UVB-MVP and the exaggerated skin reactions. Successful completion of this project will (i) address an
important question in photobiology as to how a keratinocyte-specific stimulus can generate systemic signaling
effects, (ii) offer pharmacologic mechanisms to block UVB local and systemic effects. These studies also have
implications for understanding the effects of other pro-oxidative stressors including ionizing radiation."
10774191,"Summary: The exquisite specificity, amplitude, and quality of T cells govern tumor initiation, progression, and responses to therapy. Two of the most revolutionary and promising immunotherapies are the immune checkpoint blockade and the adoptive cell transfer, which are both dependent on the robust engagement of cytotoxic T effector (Teff) cells to control or eradicate cancer. A robust T cell-mediated anti-tumor response requires the coordination of nutrient and energy supplies with Teff cell expansion and function. However, the high metabolic demands of tumor cells compromise the function of Teff cells by competing for nutrients within the tumor micro-environment (TME). We propose that the critical barrier, which limits the patient’s response to immunotherapy, is the hostile metabolic microenvironment within tumors. We have previously shown that the transcription factors c-Myc and HIF1alpha are differentially required for driving the central carbon metabolic programs during T cell acti-vation and differentiation. We recently revealed that asparagine (Asn) is the most upregulated amino acid upon T cell activation, and its bioavailability represents a key metabolic node that governs the central carbon metab-olism and effector function in Teff cells. Some cancer cells solely rely on extracellular Asn to support growth and proliferation, representing a metabolic vulnerability of cancer. However, Teff cells can maintain an intracellular Asn pool for cell growth and function either through the uptake of extracellular Asn or through de novo biosyn-thesis of Asn, indicating a layer of metabolic plasticity of T cells. Enforced restriction of extracellular Asn rewires central carbon catabolic programs, leading to enhanced anti-tumor effector function in Teff cells. Moreover, these Teff cells are characterized by an enhanced ATF4 and Nrf2 signaling response. Hence, we hypothesize that modulation of Asn bioavailability can optimize carbon assimilation and integrate stress-response sig-naling pathways, enabling a robust anti-tumor response in metabolically restricted tumor microenviron-ments. To test our hypothesis, we propose to 1) decipher the reprogramming of central carbon metabolic path-ways and assess the impact of key metabolic steps on Teff cells in the context of Asn restriction; 2) determine the role of ATF4/Nrf2 axis in regulating the effector function of Teff cells; 3) target critical signaling and metabolic  nodes to engineer central carbon catabolic programs, thus enhancing function and persistence of Teff cells, and 4) develop and test strategies to simultaneously exploit Asn dependence as a cancer cell metabolic vulnerability and maximize systemic anti-tumor immunity. Collectively, the completion of this project will reveal fundamental principles of the emerging connections between the tumor’s microenvironment, cell metabolism, and anti-tumor immunity. These studies are critical to developing novel approaches that improve clinical outcomes of cancer immunotherapy substantially."
10827393,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genetic factors play a significant role in the etiology of colorectal cancer (CRC). To date, approximately 180
genetic susceptibility loci have been identified for CRC through genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
However, causal genes for the large majority of these loci remain unknown, hindering the translation of GWAS
findings into disease prevention and treatment. Recently, we and others have identified many putative CRC
susceptibility genes using transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) that focus exclusively on mRNAs.
However, it is the proteins not mRNAs that primarily perform cellular functions. Furthermore, cellular proteins
are only moderately correlated with their corresponding mRNAs, and for many proteins, correlation is poor as
many factors affect protein synthesis and post-translation stability. Herein, we propose a well-powered
proteome-wide association study (PWAS) to systematically search the proteome to identify proteins associated
with CRC risk and further characterize their roles in colorectal tumor progression and cellular functions.
Specifically, we propose the following aims. Aim 1: To conduct a well-powered PWAS to identify proteins for
CRC risk. We will generate proteomics (~10,000 proteins) and genomics data in normal colon tissues from 300
subjects to build genetic models to predict protein expression across the proteome. These models will be
applied to the GWAS data of 125,487 individuals (58,131 cases) of European descent to evaluate associations
of genetically predicted proteins with CRC risk. We will integrate PWAS findings, along with results from
GWAS/TWAS to assess inter-relationships of genes, mRNAs and proteins in the pathogenesis of CRC. Aim 2:
To investigate potential roles of PWAS-identified proteins in the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. We will
analyze spatial expression of 30 selected PWAS-identified proteins in FFPE samples from 150 early-, late-
stage adenoma, and invasive carcinoma from white patients (N= 50 for each group) to investigate if these
proteins affect the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. Aim 3: To conduct a nested case-control study to evaluate
associations of CRC risk with promising blood proteins uncovered in Aims 1/2: We will analyze circulating
levels of 21 proteins selected from Aims 1 and 2 in pre-diagnostic blood samples collected from 1,000 and their
matched 1,200 controls of Asian, African and European ancestry. Aim 4: To investigate effects of up to 10
selected PWAS-identified proteins on cellular functions using CRISPRi/a perturbation experiments in multiple
normal colon epithelial, and CRC cell lines. We will also assess their potential roles in regulating known CRC
signaling, and newly identified CRC pathways uncovered from our study by performing RNA-sequencing and
further in vitro verification in both treated and vehicle cells. Given the rigorous study design, the unique
resources, and the methodological strengths, we expect that this proposed study will greatly advance our
understanding of CRC biology to accelerate the translation of genetic findings in CRC prevention and the
development of therapeutic targets."
10815705,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
This application focuses on the contribution of transplant hemorrhage-induced iron overload in the dysregulation
of pulmonary macrophages (mɸs) and the promotion of invasive aspergillosis. Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) is a
ubiquitous mold that releases airborne spores (conidia) and affects nearly 20 million people worldwide. One-in-
three lung transplant recipients (LTRs) suffers from Aspergillus-related pulmonary disease. While lung
transplantation can be a life-saving treatment for thousands of people, survival post-transplant is often limited by
Af infection. To better understand the transplant (host)-Af (pathogen) relationship, we developed a murine
orthotopic tracheal transplant (OTT) model of Af infection. We have shown that transplant rejection-mediated
microhemorrhage increases tissue iron levels and determines Af invasion. However, the exact interaction
between immunity, iron overload and infection are still poorly understood. Mɸs are the first line of defense against
Af and are also central to restoring tissue iron homeostasis. Importantly, our preliminary results indicate that
microhemorrhage-mediated iron overload: (i) profoundly impacts the ability of mfs to kill Af conidia through a
defect in lysosomal acidification; (ii) the innate immune response is polarized toward a pro-inflammatory mɸs
state that results in high levels of tissue damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS); and (iii) iron promotes mɸ
ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is a newly recognized form of regulated cell death that results from the production of iron
toxic lipid ROS. Ferroptosis was first recognized in cancer but is now known to contribute to Alzheimer’s and
Parkinson’s disease, ischemia reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, acute kidney injury and the response to acute
hemorrhage. However, the role of ferroptosis in lowering the host’s defense against pathogens, if any, remains
unknown. The proposed studies are designed to address these questions in terms of Af invasion. The central
hypothesis is that transplant microhemorrhage-mediated iron overload induces mf ferroptosis and polarization
into an unrestrained pro-inflammatory phenotype that promotes Af invasion. Specific aim 1 utilizes in vitro and
in vivo experiments to investigate the concept that ferroptosis is dictated by mɸs polarization state and
contributes to the inability of transplant mɸs to mitigate Af infection and studies the role of iron lowering agents
and anti-ferroptotic drugs to decrease fungal invasion. Specific aim 2 uses state-of-art omics techniques to define
iron induced Af proteases and tests the concept that fungal protease inhibition can mitigate ferroptosis and
improve outcomes in the tracheal transplant model. Specific aim 3 studies the ability of alveolar mɸs isolated
from human LTRs compared to non-lung transplants to kill Af conidia and correlates the ability of mɸs to kill
conidia with mɸs-polarization state and ferroptosis, using mass cytometry. This aim will provide a direct
translatability of the hypothesis that iron overload induces ferroptosis and a pro-inflammatory phenotype that
promotes fungal invasion. Successful completion of these studies will allow for the discovery of a fundamental
new biology and provide novel targets for the treatment of fungal infections."
10808051,"The eye lens is a transparent tissue that refracts and focuses light on the retina to allow clear vision. If the lens
loses its transparency, vision is impaired, and the disease is termed “cataract”. Cataract is the major cause of
blindness worldwide, commonly found in aged individuals (about half of Americans aged 80 or older develop
cataract), but can also be present at birth or develop in early childhood – termed pediatric cataract. Genetic
anomalies are estimated to account for about 25-50% of pediatric cataract cases, and the etiology of majority of
these are unknown. Importantly, while the role of signaling and transcription factors in lens development and
cataract have been well defined over the last few decades, that of proteins involved in post-transcriptional gene
expression control is grossly understudied – indeed, only four such proteins have been characterized so far in
the lens. Our efforts in characterizing these proteins have demonstrated that post-transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms are critical for lens development, and their loss results in early onset cataract and eye defects.
Identification of these factors was made possible by our novel bioinformatics approach iSyTE (integrated
Systems Tool for Eye gene discovery), which is effective in identifying high-priority target genes linked to lens
development and cataract. We have now used iSyTE to identify a new post-transcriptional regulator in the lens,
namely, Elavl1 (Embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) like RNA-binding protein). The function of Elavl1 has
not been examined in the lens. Therefore, we developed a new Elavl1-targeted lens-specific conditional knockout
(KO) mouse model and find that Elavl1cKO mice exhibit early onset eye defects namely, cataract and
microphthalmia. In this proposal, we will test the overarching hypothesis that Elavl1 mediates post-transcriptional
gene expression control over key regulators of lens development, disruption of which causes cataract and
microphthalmia. Specifically, we will address the following goals. (Aim 1) Characterize the pathogenesis of lens
defects in Elavl1cKO mice and gain insights into the structural and molecular underpinning of these defects by
comparative analysis of lens morphology, transcriptome and proteome. (Aim 2) Test the mechanism of Elavl1-
mediated control of post-transcriptional gene expression in the lens. Specifically, we will investigate the
molecular mechanism of Elavl1 function in control of the key lens development/differentiation transcription factors
Pax6, c-Maf and Prox1 among other targets. Identify direct RNA targets of Elavl1 by RNA-immunoprecipitation
followed by RNA-Sequencing. (Aim 3) Examine how Elavl1 and Celf1 coordinately mediate post-transcriptional
control in the lens and integrate and analyze all the molecular, genomic and functional data generated above to
derive Elavl1 and Celf1-regulatory networks in the lens. The expected overall impact of these innovative
investigative approaches aimed at uncovering the mechanism of Elavl1 function is that it will continue to advance
our knowledge of gene expression regulation in the lens at the post-transcriptional level while informing on the
nature of RBP-based combinatorial control, in turn leading to identification of new targets linked to cataract."
10773103,"Background and Rationale: Black adults with asthma are an appropriate target for shared decision-making
(SDM) interventions that support disease self-management as they experience a higher asthma burden and
worse clinical outcomes than non-black adults and/or children with asthma of any racial-ethnic background. To
date, the application of SDM and community-based interventions targeting black adults have failed to address
these disparities. Therefore, we used patient input to develop BREATHE - BRief intervention to Evaluate
Asthma THErapy – a 9-minute SDM intervention focused on reducing the impact of erroneous beliefs on
asthma control - and established its efficacy in this health disparity population. Our intervention is unique in
that is a one-time brief, tailored intervention integrated into office visits, using the patient's own provider as the
interventionist (e.g. scalable). Our pilot trial demonstrated high fidelity to BREATHE delivery and improved
asthma control and reduced symptoms among BREATHE participants compared to a dose-matched attention
control condition. Objective: We propose an efficacy-implementation trial to: (1) evaluate systematically the
efficacy of BREATHE in 200 black adults receiving care at urban federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) for
uncontrolled asthma; and (2) identify multi-level barriers and facilitators to the widespread adoption and
implementation of BREATHE. Hypotheses: Hyp 1.1 (primary outcome): Over 1 year, relative to controls,
BREATHE participants will have significantly better asthma control as measured by higher scores on the
Asthma Control Questionnaire. Hyp 1.2 (secondary outcomes): Over 1 year, relative to controls, BREATHE
participants will have significantly better (a) SDM scores, (b) ICS adherence, (c) asthma and ICS beliefs, (d)
asthma quality of life; and significantly lower rates of (e) asthma exacerbations, (f) symptoms days, (g) nights
woken, (h) activity limitations, (i) shortness of breath, (j) wheeze, and (k) rescue medicine use. Methods: We
will enroll 200 black adults with uncontrolled asthma from 2 New York City and 2 New Jersey urban FQHCs.
Using a group-randomized design, clinicians in the FQHCs will be randomized to either BREATHE or a dose-
matched attention control condition and trained to deliver the 9-minute active or control intervention during
clinic visits. We will follow patient participants for 12-months post-treatment. For the process evaluation, which
uses all dimensions of RE-AIM and all CFIR constructs together, we will collect qualitative and quantitative
data from patient participants, their loved ones and providers. Together with stakeholders, we will develop
strategies for the widespread implementation of BREATHE informed by our clinical efficacy and
implementation results. Significance: The study has high public health significance because (1) it targets a
population impacted greatly by asthma in unique care settings, (2) it concurrently targets the influence of
asthma and treatment beliefs on asthma control, (3) it offers a highly scalable intervention, and (4) it bridges a
gap between research and practice by identifying factors associated with implementation."

Rates of childhood obesity in the U.S. remain at historic highs. Before the age of 11 years, 18% of all children
in the U.S. are already obese; 26% of Hispanic and 24% of Black children are obese. Pediatric primary care
settings are underutilized in preventing and treating childhood obesity. An evidence-based method for
treatment of childhood obesity to help engage and motivate patients is Motivational Interviewing (MI). One
recent successful study, BMI2 (for Brief Motivational Interviewing to Reduce Child Body Mass Index) directed at
the parents of children in pediatric care practices lowered BMI significantly. MI-based approaches have been
particularly successful for racial/ethnic minorities and low-income populations. However, the targeted MI dose
of BMI2 requires significant resources, with MI sessions administered by the PCP and a registered dietician. It
is unclear whether the impressive results of BMI2 can be replicated in a health care system with real-world
conditions. It is challenging to find an effective intervention that is feasible and sustainable without requiring
significant resources. Our overall goal is to reduce excess body weight in children in primary care. We will
conduct a cluster-randomized pragmatic trial in 36 pediatric clinics in Kaiser Permanente Southern California
(KPSC) to test the effectiveness of a modified version of BMI2 intervention in pediatric clinics (18 intervention,
18 usual care with attention control, = 10,800 children). The clinics serve over 45,000 children aged 2-8 yrs
who are overweight or obese with high racial/ethnic and socioeconomic diversity (53% Hispanic; 23% state-
subsidized insurance). Using MI techniques, PCPs will initiate and maintain discussion about weight
management with parent (6 x 20 min) and refer patients electronically to experienced and MI-trained lifestyle
coaches. With full access to the EMR, coaches will call referred families (child’s BMI-for-age ≥85th percentile)
and deliver intervention via telephonic MI counseling over two years (6 x 45 min). Usual care clinics with
attention control will include regular encounters and educational videos as attention control. Primary Aim:
Determine the effectiveness and dose-response relationship of a pragmatic, system-integrated childhood
obesity intervention using mBMI2Kids (a modified BMI2 approach) on BMI at 2-yr follow-up. Secondary Aim:
Investigate how patient characteristics such as minority or low-income background and parental obesity modify
the effect of the mBMI2Kids intervention (Heterogeneity of effects). IMPACT: This study has the potential for a
highly significant shift in pediatric primary care practices. Our results will provide valuable guidance to
providers and health care systems to help them effectively halt and reverse the childhood obesity epidemic.
Our results can be quickly translated into other clinical care settings and endorse the meaningful use of EMR
systems to support providers using tools and centralized approaches that make interventions scalable."

 This proposal aims to continue our research to identify and characterize resting state functional MRI
signals within the grey matter of the spinal cord, and to validate the interpretation of resting state functional
connectivity (rsFC) networks in the spine that appear to reflect specific, behaviorally-relevant functions. In the
current funding period we have found resting state networks within the cord exhibit more complex connectivity
than previously reported, both within and across segments, including significant correlations with the
intermediate region and grey commissure that are relevant for autonomic functions and left-right coordination.
Importantly, by implementing a dorsal column injury to the cervical spine in a non-human primate, we have
confirmed that the strengths of connectivity within these networks are in general related to functional
performance, and changes in the networks correspond to behavioral changes in, for example, skilled hand use.
We next aim to fully characterize the sub-components of rsFC and relate them to more specific functions. We
will acquire sub-millimeter, multi-parametric MR images at high field (9.4T) in squirrel monkeys and address
three main aims. (1) We will identify and differentiate rsFC networks within spinal cord using selective lesions
and pharmacological interventions to determine which components and network connectivities are affected by
specific disruptions of normal sensory or motor pathways. We will isolate circuits affected by (a) reversible
block of motor or sensory inputs with pharmacological agents; (b) permanently ablating the drive of motor
neurons from primary motor cortex in ventral horn; and (c) disrupting sensory signals to dorsal horn neurons by
sectioning dorsal spinal nerve roots. We will follow the evolution of each injury using CEST and DTI to
measure the extent and severity of the injury, and DTI and qMT to validate injury severity and quantify changes
in axonal integrity and myelination. (2) We will validate the rsFC measures from MRI by comparisons with
electrophysiology, micro-stimulation and tract-tracing histology. We will (a) directly stimulate specific nodes
while monitoring down-stream activity with electrophysiology and fMRI; (b) perform longitudinal fMRI and
microarray recordings of electrical coherences in each monkey subjected to specific interventions (Aim 1); and
(c) determine whether regions which appear to be functionally connected by fMRI also show strong anatomical
connections by injecting tracers and performing histological assessments post mortem. (3) We will determine
the functional and behavioral relevance of rsFC by disrupting each circuit, identifying corresponding changes
in rsFC, and relating these changes to performance of skilled hand sensorimotor behavior. By the completion
of the study, we will validate rsFC measurements as indicators of spinal cord functions, and establish the fine-
grained intrinsic architecture of intra-spinal circuits. These studies will provide new information on the neural
organization of the spinal cord, validate the interpretation of BOLD measurements of connectivity, and provide
a roadmap for the use of fMRI for studying human spinal cord functions."
10814363,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Low-dose methotrexate (MTX) is a cost-effective, first-line therapy for millions of individuals with inflammatory
arthritis or skin disease, but as many as 50-70% of patients do not adequately respond to MTX. Modifying factors
that limit MTX response would enable more patients to benefit from this anchor drug that synergistically increases
the efficacy of other anti-inflammatory drugs. We recently showed that the gut microbiome of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA) patients predicts MTX responsiveness, raising the possibility that the gut microbiome contributes to MTX
response. Unexpectedly, we found that MTX, originally designed to inhibit human folate enzymes, exerts growth-
inhibitory effects on gut microbiota, and transplantation of MTX-exposed microbiotas into gnotobiotic mice led to
decreased immune activation. These findings suggest that one mechanism by which MTX exerts its anti-
inflammatory effects is via modulation of the gut microbiota. Thus, the gut microbiome may be a modifiable factor
that can be targeted to enable more patients to benefit from MTX. What remains lacking, however, is knowledge
of the mechanisms by which MTX-microbiota interactions shape host immunity. Such knowledge would enable
us to specifically target these gut microbial mechanisms, which may lead to improved drug response in the host.
There is, therefore, a critical need to identify mechanisms by which MTX affects the microbiota to shape host
immunity. With this information, we can advance precision medicine for patients with autoimmune disease. The
long-term goal of our lab is to identify the molecular mechanisms by which the human gut microbiome impacts
the treatment of rheumatic and autoimmune diseases. The overall objectives of this application are to identify
MTX-induced gut metabolomic changes in vivo and test the impact of microbial adenosine pathways in mediating
MTX response. Here we test the hypothesis that MTX acts on the gut microbiota to increase extracellular
adenosine and reduce inflammation in the host. Using an innovative combination of metabolomics, bacterial
genetics, and pre-clinical models of arthritis, we will (1) evaluate the metabolic consequences of MTX on gut
microbiota in vivo, and (2) test the impact of microbial adenosine metabolism on MTX response in vivo. We
expect to identify microbial mechanisms that impact MTX response. This project is significant because MTX non-
response affects a majority of MTX users and identifying microbial contributions to non-response has the
potential to advance the field and clinical practice. It is innovative because it probes drug-microbiota interactions
and how these contribute to MTX response in patients. The results may have a positive impact by laying the
foundation for the development of microbially-directed therapies to improve MTX response, potentially enabling
a greater number of patients to benefit from an anchor drug in rheumatology."

Virtually all optical microscopes for biological imaging are based on refractive objective lenses.
The performance of these lenses approaches the theoretical limit, however, their use is limited
to the visible to near-infrared spectral range. Even within this range, their performance is only
guaranteed over a relatively narrow range, and broadband use is invariably affected by
chromatic aberrations. Another problem is the group delay dispersion that these lenses
introduce to short optical pulses, which reduces the efficiency of nonlinear optical (NLO) signal
generation in the microscope. Taken together, these shortcomings seriously compromise the
imaging properties of several NLO imaging modalities such as three-photon excited
fluorescence and third-harmonic generation. In addition, refractive objectives simply cannot be
used for NLO techniques that incorporate excitation light in the mid-infrared (MIR) range, such
as photothermal imaging and sum-frequency generation, promising technologies based on MIR
molecular contrast. The only viable alternative is the all-reflective Schwarzschild-Cassegrain
(SC) objective, which is inherently achromatic but suffers from a non-ideal pointspread function
and a center obscuration that limits throughput. Because of these limitations, SC lenses have
not found widespread use in biological imaging applications. This lack of performance is also
the reason why advances in exciting new MIR-based NLO imaging technologies have been
stifled: there simply are no high-performance high numerical focusing options available to
support these emerging imaging technologies.
 In this project, we develop a novel all-reflective high numerical aperture lens that
overcomes all limitations of the SC focusing lens. Based on a non-concentric design, this new
design features perfect color correction from the ultra-violet to the mid-infrared, exhibits a wide
field of view, dramatically reduces group delay dispersion and significantly improves throughput
by eliminating the center obscuration all together. This lens not only advances existing NLO
modalities that rely on broadband radiation, but also enables new technologies such as
photothermal imaging and SFG microscopy that have thus far suffered from low performance
focusing optics."

 Near UV radiation (254nm light) induces DNA damage that blocks replication can result
in genomic rearrangements when it resumes from the wrong place, mutagenesis when the
incorrect base is incorporated opposite to the lesion, or cell death when the block to replication
cannot be overcome. Inaccurate replication in the presence of environmental mutagens such as
UV is responsible for the majority of mutagenesis and rearrangements observed in cancer cells.
Thus, understanding how disrupted replication forks are restored is critical to developing
therapeutics and strategies for preventing instabilities associated with these events. In humans,
the role of BRCA2 and RECQ proteins in maintaining and processing replication forks that
encounter DNA damage is well known. However, the mechanism by which replication is
restored remains unclear. Different models have suggested that either repair, translesion
synthesis, or recombination may operate to allow replication to resume. Yet, these pathways do
not all share equally beneficial outcomes. Whereas DNA repair is error free, translesion
synthesis and recombination are associated with elevated rates of mutations and genome
rearrangements respectively. Thus critical to advancing the field, is a clear determination of the
mechanism by which DNA replication resumes following disruption.
 This work will demonstrate that replication forks disrupted by UV-induced DNA damage
are primarily processed through a general recovery mechanism that allows nucleotide excision
repair enzymes to access to the blocking lesion and effect repair. Most in vitro studies suggest
that the replisome is disrupted by DNA lesions in the leading strand template, but not lagging
strand template. Further leading strand lesion on plasmid substrates are preferentially processed
through nucleotide excision repair. Thus the first aim of this proposal will utilize CPD-seq, an
established high-throughput sequencing approach, to map the repair of UV lesions over time on
E. coli genome and demonstrate that leading strand lesions are preferentially repaired during
replication. The second aim of the proposal characterizes the role that holC, encoding the χ
subunit of the replisome, play in the replication-coupled repair. holC mutations are epistatic with
recF mutants which is specifically required to process and resume replication after disruption by
UV-induced damage. Further, HolC (χ) is reported to physically interact with UvrA. Therefore
this aim seeks to and demonstrate that the interaction occurs in response to and functions
following UV damage and demonstrate that the replication-coupled repair depends on the
presence of holC."
10753580,"After the 9/11/2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center (WTC), >100,000 residents, police, firemen,
emergency medical technicians, and others were chronically exposed to an environmental toxic cloud of dust and
chemicals for more than a year during the massive cleanup effort. Adequate respiratory protective equipment was
not consistently available, so these exposures contributed to health consequences presenting years later.
Understanding the impact of 9/11 on long-term cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk is critical because federally
funded healthcare is only provided to responders for diseases certified to be related to 9/11 exposure. Current
evidence of WTC health effects is mostly limited to respiratory and cancer risk, while myocardial infarction (MI)
and diabetes are not certified. This has vast implications for health care costs and accessibility of treatment. We
propose a retrospective cohort study using the WTC Health Program (WTCHP) General Responder Cohort to
identify WTC-related CMD risk. Mount Sinai is home to the WTCHP Data Center, a repository of all monitoring
and treatment data from all five Clinical Centers of Excellence that longitudinally monitor responders involved in
the 9/11 tragedy. The WTCHP has assessed more than 43,000 responders during 20 years of follow-up with
physical examinations, laboratory tests, and exposure and health questionnaires. With this cohort we will
innovatively address gaps in WTC-related CMD research; assess the effect of the 9/11 attack on diabetes and
MI incidence, as well as glucose and total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels; and identify how this exposure
interacts with subsequent environmental exposures. In Aim 1, we will estimate the association between WTC-
related exposures and CMD. In Aim 2 we will assess the association between long-term exposure to fine
particulate air pollution (PM2.5) chemical components and CMD. We have developed a novel spatiotemporal
model that can identify PM2.5 components at very high spatial resolution, allowing us to identify mixtures that
define effects. Unlike most current research, we will address the complexity of PM2.5 exposure as a mixture of
chemical components rather than focusing on PM2.5 mass. In Aim 3, we will determine whether subsequent
environmental exposures (i.e., air pollution, greenness, noise, walkability, food environment, social
vulnerability, and temperature) interact with the effects of WTC-related exposures on CMD. We will assess
whether WTC-related exposures among responders altered their susceptibility to subsequent air pollution
exposure, setting up distinct cardiometabolic health trajectories. We will also identify beneficial environmental
exposures that mitigate the cardiometabolic effect of WTC-related exposures. To our knowledge, this will be the
first study to examine whether subsequent environmental exposures interact with WTC-related exposure
effects on CMD. This research will leverage a rich cohort with 20 years of follow-up data to uncover the long-
term trajectories of how environmental exposures contribute to CMD, revealing critical insights to inform future
interventions and policies to protect human health from hazardous exposures."

10757411,"In the United States, over 80% of prostate cancer patients die with bone metastases.
Second line hormonal therapies such as enzalutamide only improve overall patient
survival by a few months in about 50% of the patients, and almost all patients develop
drug resistance. Thus, there is an urgent need to determine the mechanisms of drug
resistance and to develop new approaches for overcoming such resistance and for
better treatment of prostate cancer bone metastasis.
Enzalutamide is a small-molecule inhibitor of the androgen receptor (AR). Our
preliminary study demonstrated that although enzalutamide inhibited the tumor growth of
castration-resistant prostate cancer C4-2B cells when xenografted orthotopically or
subcutaneously, it had no effect on the growth of C4-2B tumors in the bone and the
development of bone lesions. This data highlights a crucial role of the microenvironment
in enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer bone metastasis. Interestingly, we found
that enzalutamide significantly and specifically reduced the TGF-β type II receptor
(TGFBR2) protein in osteoblasts. This observation was also confirmed in prostate
cancer patients who had undergone the second line hormonal therapies such as
enzalutamide. To determine the role of TGFBR2 in the osteoblasts during bone
metastasis, we used a mouse model (Tgfbr2Col1CreERT KO) with inducible Tgfbr2 knockout
specifically in the osteoblasts. We found that Tgfbr2 KO in osteoblasts significantly
promoted prostate cancer bone metastasis. Based on these results, we hypothesize
that reduction of TGFBR2 in osteoblasts caused by enzalutamide results in resistance to
the drug in prostate cancer bone metastasis. The objectives of this proposal are to
determine how enzalutamide decreases osteoblast TGFBR2 and thus promotes prostate
cancer bone metastasis and to identify novel approaches to counteracting the
enzalutamide resistance."
10838362,"The Antimicrobial Resistance Crisis (AMR) has been recognized for years, and the significance of this global
human health problem sets it apart from other types of diseases, because it affects not only individuals, but
has a potential to disrupt the life of society. We have a stark reminder of the ability of a pathogen to bring
normal life to a halt, as we experience the COVID-19 pandemic. In the case of a virus, we can usually count on
a reasonably rapid development of a vaccine. For multidrug-resistant bacteria, we do not have a similarly
reliable approach, and the pipeline of novel compounds against the most problematic pathogens, MDR Gram-
negative bacteria, is very thin (Lewis, Cell 2020). We recently discovered a novel class of compounds acting
against important Gram-negative pathogens, the darobactins (Imai et al., Nature 2019). Darobactin A is a 7-
mer modified peptide containing two unusual fused rings. This creates a rigid β-strain from the peptide
backbone. The target is BamA, an essential chaperone that inserts proteins such as porins into the outer
membrane. BamA recognizes a signal sequence of incoming peptides that bind to one of its β-strands.
Darobactin, which has a unique preformed β-strand, is a better binder and prevents substrates from interacting
with BamA. Importantly, BamA mutants resistant to darobactin A lose virulence. Darobactin A has no
cytotoxicity and shows good efficacy in mouse septicemia and thigh models against such pathogens as
polymyxin-resistant E. coli and KPC K. pneumoniae. Darobactin A is ribosomally translated and coded by a
RiPP operon. Bioinformatics search of the NCBI genomes database resulted in identifying 8 analogs with the
same scaffold, and 6 darobactin-like analogs. The goal of this project is to evaluate the darobactins and
identify the best leads. Additional analogs will be identified by searching through the raw data of the
metagenomics database. We will synthesize the dar operons, clone them into E. coli and optimize production.
For this, we will use an approach we recently developed, screening mutagenized producers in agarose
microdroplets containing a YFP-labeled test pathogen. FACS analysis allows to sort droplets in which the test
strain is inhibited. Spectrum of action will be determined, resistant mutants will either confirm BamA as a
target, or point to a new one. We will analyze virulence of resistant mutants in detail. Compounds will be tested
for cytotoxicity and animal safety and efficacy with target pathogens. This project will result in leads ready to
enter into development to treat pathogens of critical priority."
10805387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
There is a critical need to stop atherosclerosis initiation and progression, rather than trying to treat its progression
in an advanced state. It is widely recognized that entry and retention of low density lipoproteins (LDL) are key
steps in atherogenesis. However, our data show high density lipoproteins (HDL) can compete with LDL to bind
SR-BI and HDL can interact with LDL to decrease binding to proteoglycans. With the recent realization that
lipoproteins, both LDL and HDL, exist a series of related but compositionally distinct subpopulations, new
questions have arisen as to how lipoprotein subspeciation may affect these igniting steps of atherosclerosis.
This work builds on data generated under PI Shah’s K award (K23HL118132) showing that 1) HDL and LDL
exist as multiple subspecies, 2) specific HDL subspecies, their amount, composition (lipids, proteins) and
function are altered in the plasma of individuals with type 2 diabetes, and 3) the amount of large HDL subspecies
in plasma are inversely correlated with early markers of cardiovascular risk. This proposal also builds on our
preliminary data that shows HDL modulates both LDL transcytosis and binding to proteoglycans, but this is
disrupted in the context of type 2 diabetes. Our overarching hypothesis that that LDL and HDL subspecies
differentially impact transcytosis and proteoglycan binding and disruption of their balance in type 2 diabetes
contributes to the high risk of cardiovascular disease in this population. Using complementary approaches that
include in-vitro cell based assays with animal models and patient samples in adolescents and adults, we aim to
identify and characterize the LDL and HDL subspecies involved in endothelial cell transcytosis (Aim 1) and
extracellular proteoglycan binding (Aim 2) and to understand the impact of type 2 diabetes on these lipoprotein
subspecies (Aim 3). These results have the potential to inform future therapeutic strategies to use recombinant
particles or mimetic peptides to prevent atherosclerosis initiation. The ability to block atherosclerosis initiation
and progression will benefit both youth and adults, and particularly individuals with type 2 diabetes who are at
increased risk for cardiovascular disease."
10794245,"Explore the signaling mechanisms of acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in AML
Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant hematopoietic disease and the most common type of acute
leukemia in adults. One major obstacle to greater success with target therapy of leukemia is drug resistance.
The mechanisms underlying drug resistance in AML are poorly understood. FLT3 is a cytokine receptor which
belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) class III. Activating mutations in FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3
(FLT3) are now recognized as the most common molecular abnormality in AML and FLT3ITD mutations are
found in nearly 30% of AML patients. Quizartinib (AC220) is a potent and selective second-generation inhibitor
of FLT3. It is in clinical trials for the treatment of relapsed or refractory FLT3ITD positive and negative AML
patients and as maintenance therapy. Remarkably, those clinical trials have showed very promising result.
However, drug resistance to AC220 has also been reported through the early clinical studies.
To understand the underlying mechanisms of drug resistance to AC220, we undertook an unbiased approach
with a novel CRISPR pooled library to screen new genes whose loss of function confers resistance to AC220.
In our screen, we identified SPRY3, an intracellular inhibitor of RTK signaling, and GSK3, a canonical Wnt
signaling antagonist, and demonstrated that re-activation of downstream RTK/Ras/ERK and Wnt signaling as
major mechanisms of resistance to the FLT3 inhibitor. Furthermore, we also confirmed our findings in primary
AML patient samples. We demonstrated that the expression level of SPRY3 and GSK3A is dramatically
reduced in AC220 resistant AML samples and SPRY3 deleted primary AML cells are resistant to AC220.
Additionally, we treated SPRY3 and GSK3 knockout AML cells with a potent MAP kinase inhibitor and β-
catenin inhibitor respectively, demonstrated that both inhibitors re-sensitized AML cells to AC220. Intriguingly,
we found that expression of SPRY3 is greatly reduced in GSK3 knockout AML cells, which positioned SPRY3
downstream of GSK3 in the resistance pathway.
In this proposal, we hypothesize that Sprouty (SPRY) and GSK3 play critical roles in the response to
tyrosine kinase inhibitor in AML. The Ras/MEK/ERK and Wnt pathways regulated by SPRY3 and GSK3
are important for the acquired drug resistance in AML. Next, we will perform a series comprehensive study
to explore novel downstream effectors/ interacting partners of SPRY3 and GSK3 in AMLs and the molecular
mechanisms of their action. Furthermore, we will examine the possibility to translate our findings into new
clinical therapies.
Taken together, our study identified novel genes whose loss of function confers resistance to a selective FLT3
inhibitor and revealed the underlying mechanism, thereby providing new insight into signaling pathways that
contribute to the acquired resistance in AML. The knowledge learned may lead to the development of more
efficient combined therapeutic avenues for AML."

 Maladaptive grief negatively impacts 25-40% of older adult family caregivers of persons with a serious chronic
illness, with adverse health outcomes including increased morbidity and mortality, reduced independence, and
diminished immune function.1-4 Losses associated with aging, such as the death of multiple close family and
friends, are highly traumatic and contribute to the devastating impact of maladaptive grief among older
adults.8,10 Brief, effective interventions that address maladaptive grief early in the grief trajectory are urgently
needed.
 Accelerated Resolution Therapy (ART) is an evidence-based treatment for post-traumatic distress in civilians
and veterans14-17 that may be useful in alleviating maladaptive grief prior to bereavement and could prevent
prolonged, complicated grief following bereavement. We are proposing to test the efficacy of ART, a low-risk,
brief therapy with a strong theoretical rationale for treatment success in maladaptive grief and supported by the
promising results of our recently completed preliminary trial (R21AG056584). Additional aims of the study are
to examine changes in cognitive appraisal and integration of loss following ART using a mixed methods
approach and to evaluate personal, social, and psychological factors predictors of response.
 During the proposed double blinded, randomized, controlled two arm clinical trial, 472 older adult family
caregivers from two different geographic locations will receive either ART or an educational program that is
matched for time and attention. Each participant will receive four sessions of either the ART intervention or the
control intervention. Data collection will occur at screening/enrollment (T1), at the end of the 4-session
intervention period (T2) and at 6-months (T3) and 12-months post bereavement (T4). A subgroup of 20
participants randomly assigned to ART will participate in semi-structured interviews to enhance understanding
of cognitive appraisal and integration of loss.
This trial will provide critical information on the efficacy of the ART intervention as a potential first-line treatment
option for pre-loss grief and preventative option for complicated grief and contribute new information about
characteristics of individuals most likely to benefit from ART."
10782483,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a disease of the pulmonary arterial vasculature and its
remodeling, in which patient mortality is significantly associated with impaired RV function. The
prognosis of patients with PAH is very poor with five-year survival <50%, and there are no
available therapies to prevent right heart failure in PAH. Recent studies by the applicant’s group
in animal models of PAH and clinical studies have shown that altered RV diastolic stiffness to be
an important feature of PAH pathogenesis. Here we propose to investigate the structural
mechanisms by which remodeling of RV extracellular matrix (ECM) alters their mechanical
properties and the cellular mechanisms by which changes in RV mechanical loading and material
properties in turn regulate the phenotype and pro-fibrotic signaling of cardiac fibroblasts. Using a
comprehensive time-course in a well-established animal model of PAH progression, we will
conduct detailed in-vivo physiological studies and biaxial tissue biomechanical testing of intact
and decellularized RV samples together with microstructural mathematical modeling to determine
how ECM remodeling alters RV myocardial mechanic and diastolic function. We will then
recapitulate these alterations in RV ECM structure and mechanics in a novel in-vitro model to
investigate how altered ECM structure and loading conditions in PAH regulate RV cardiac
fibroblasts (CFB) differentiation, activation, and pro-fibrotic ECM expression. Finally, we will use
these new in-vitro measurements to extend and validate a mathematical model of mechano-
regulated CBF cell signaling. The specific aims of this proposal will determine the time course
of changes in RV geometry, contractility and diastolic material properties that compensate for
altered hemodynamic loads during PAH and determine how these mechanisms become
maladaptive (Aim 1); the changes in RV myocardial structure and mechanics during adaptive and
maladaptive RV ECM remodeling, and identify the biomechanical stimuli driving these changes
in PAH (Aim 2); and the mechanobiological mechanisms regulating adaptive and maladaptive RV
ECM remodeling during PAH (Aim 3). The overall outcome of the proposed research will be the
discovery of quantitative biological principles of the RV extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling that
contribute to the changes in diastolic function that occur during the progression of PAH and the
transition to decompensated RV dysfunction."

I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition at The
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. My long-term career goal is to become an independent
researcher investigating genetic drivers of inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is
thought to result from critical environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals. However, much of
the genetic susceptibility remains unaccounted for. In this regard, mechanistic studies of defined genetic variants
associated with IBD can help us fill these critical gaps and may provide novel therapeutic targets.
I have previously reported the identification of a mutation in the SCGN gene causing early-onset ulcerative colitis.
SCGN encodes secretagogin, a calcium sensor exclusively expressed in neuroendocrine lineages, including
enteroendocrine cells and gut neurons and participates in SNARE mediated secretion. The mutation identified
in humans leads to abnormal SCGN-SNAP-25 membranous localization resulting in impaired hormone secretion,
mimicking complete SCGN loss. Scgn deficiency in mice results in enhanced DSS colitis susceptibility. Our data
suggests that the enteric nervous system might be responsible for the observed colitic phenotype. Subsequent
preliminary data indicates that Scgn loss in mice results in hyperactivation of intestinal epithelial type I interferon
response.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that neuroendocrine dysfunction resulting from SCGN deficiency plays
a role in IBD pathogenesis through disruption of innate immune responses, specifically Type I interferon
activation in the epithelium. The project’s overall goal is to study the role of SCGN in intestinal inflammation
through the following specific aims:
Aim 1 – To define the neuroendocrine lineage cells responsible for SCGN-dependent intestinal inflammation.
Aim 2 – Determine the contribution of type I interferon signaling in SCGN-associated colitis susceptibility.
Aim 3 – To identify SCGN-dependent immunoregulatory factors
To carry out the work proposed in this mentored Career Development Award, I have developed a career
development plan that takes advantage of the scientific environment at UTSW, with a specific focus on
development of skills related to in-vivo models of intestinal inflammation and next-generation sequencing data
analysis. I have brought together a mentorship/advisory committee composed of experienced clinical and basic
science researchers with a focus on human genetics, intestinal inflammation and IBD. My main mentor, Dr. Ezra
Burstein, leads this team. In summary, the information gained from the studies proposed here will shed light on
the immune-regulatory role a group of cells not commonly thought to be key mediators of inflammation, have in
the intestine, with the ultimate promise of propelling me towards independence."

 Pregnant Mexican-American women (the largest subgroup of Hispanic women), hereafter
referred to as Latinas, are at increasing risk for psychological distress which leads to adverse
birth outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB, gestational age < 37 weeks) and low birthweight
(LBW, <2500 grams). Our prior research, using a psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) framework,
has identified psychological risk factors (depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, coping) and
neuroendocrine risk factors (high Corticotropin Releasing Hormone [CRH], lower progesterone,
higher estriol) at 22-24 weeks gestation as strong predictors of PTB in Latina women. New
interventions targeting these risk factors need to be identified and rigorously tested. To address
the gaps related to interventions for Latinas, we have developed and successfully pilot tested
the Mastery Lifestyle Intervention (MLI): a culturally-relevant, manualized psychosocial group
intervention that integrates two evidence-based behavioral therapies – Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Problem-Solving Therapy (PST). The MLI is a 6-week program
designed to be integrated into regular prenatal care to facilitate more comprehensive care
delivered by a nurse practitioner (NP) or certified nurse midwife (CNM). We propose the
following aims for a randomized controlled trial: Primary Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of the
MLI in pregnant Latina women to decrease depressive symptoms, anxiety, perceived and
acculturative stress, and to improve coping, versus usual care (UC), from baseline (14-20
weeks gestation) to end-of-treatment (20-26 weeks gestation) and at a 6 week follow-up (26-32
weeks gestation), with acculturation and psychological flexibility as mediators. Exploratory Aim
2: Explore the effect of the MLI on neuroendocrine risk factors of PTB (CRH, progesterone, and
estriol) versus UC from baseline to end-of treatment. Exploratory Aim 3: Explore the effect of
the MLI on infant birth outcomes (gestational age, birthweight, NICU admission). Analyses for
each hypothesis will rely on generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) with random effects for
participant and time as necessary to account for correlated observations. Longitudinal analyses
will model each outcome as a function of treatment group, time, and the interaction between
treatment group and time. We will also use SEM to analyze for mediators.
 We expect the MLI will provide a greatly needed, novel, feasible, and effective
nonpharmacological program added to the toolbox of treatments assisting providers to improve
health during pregnancy. Embedded into prenatal care, it targets psychological distress among
pregnant Latina women, an underserved population. It may substantially reduce the risks for
poor birth outcomes, thus reducing devastating and long-term effects for both mother and infant."

This award will promote the development of the applicant who seeks to acquire the skills and knowledge
necessary to become an independent physician scientist focused on human rheumatic diseases. The research
focus of this grant is the retroelement LINE1, and its potential interaction with the cytoplasmic DNA sensor IFI16,
in the context of the autoimmune disease Sjögren’s syndrome (SS). Persistent activation of immune responses
against nucleic acid-containing autoantigens is a hallmark of several rheumatic diseases, including SS, where
an “interferon (IFN) signature” is found in the blood and affected tissues. Activation of innate nucleic acid sensors
is a key driver of IFN signaling that has been implicated in SS and related diseases. In this proposal, we will
examine the retroelement LINE1 as a potential endogenous driver of both the innate and humoral immune
response in SS, and examine the role that autophagy plays in regulating the IFN response to LINE1. These
studies will build upon our recent observation that the DNA sensor and SS autoantigen IFI16 is activated in a
filamentous form in some SS salivary ductal epithelial cells – a process which seems linked to the presence of
anti-IFI16 antibodies in SS sera. Preliminary data reveal that the LINE1 protein ORF1p appears to be an SS
autoantigen as well, and is strikingly associated with anti-IFI16 antibodies in these patients. Moreover, LINE1
protein expression can be detected in the same ductal epithelial cell layer that harbors activated IFI16 in SS
glands, suggesting that LINE1 expression in these cells could be a potential source of nucleic acid responsible
for IFI16 filament formation observed at that site. Based on these preliminary findings, we hypothesize that IFI16
binding to LINE1 nucleic acids in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells could explain the association between anti-
IFI16 and anti-ORF1p antibodies in some SS patients. Using cultured cells, we have also visualized co-
localization of IFI16-DNA complexes with autophagy proteins, and have observed evidence of autophagy
activation following cytoplasmic DNA sensing. We propose that autophagy mediates homeostatic disposal of
interferogenic IFI16-LINE1 complexes, and could therefore represent an augmentable pathway in this diseases.
These hypotheses will be tested using a combination of human tissues, cellular assays, and in vitro studies. This
work will benefit from the expertise of two key collaborators: Dr. Kathy Burns, an expert in retroelements, and
Dr. Jungsan Sohn, a biophysicist expert in innate immune sensors. In addition to completion of the proposed
experimental work, the applicant will perform formal coursework, receive hands on technical training, attend
relevant conferences, and obtain careful mentorship from a multi-disciplinary team of accomplished investigators
over the duration of this award. Completion of this work will foster the development of the candidate into an
independent physician researcher with expertise in the mechanistic study of human rheumatic disease, with
particular focus on the relationship between retroelements and innate immunity."

Although the implementation of whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) in a
clinical setting has greatly facilitated the identification of birth defect-associated genetic variants, distinguishing
the specific variants that cause congenital defects remains a major challenge. More specifically, most variants
detected in clinical sequencing occur in genes not previously associated with disease or in noncoding regions of
the genome that lack predictable functional consequences. Enhancing the ability to illuminate causal variants
holds the promise of improving the quality of life for patients and in some cases may provide a window for
therapeutic intervention that would otherwise be missed. In this proposal we leverage our institute’s unparalleled
pediatric genetic data repository to guide the development of scalable cell-based systems that, when coupled
with phenotypic validation in both animal and patient-derived organoid models, will systematically identify genetic
variants that are responsible for congenital defects in our undiagnosed rare disease patient population. We will
(Aim 1) catalog loss-of-function variants associated with the most prevalent congenital defects in our patient
population, perform genome-scale CRISPR screens in relevant organoid models to distinguish variant-harboring
genes that play a role in development, and validate the phenotypic consequences of gene loss in a zebrafish
model. In parallel, we will (Aim 2) catalog noncoding variants (i.e. intronic, putative cis-regulatory) associated
with prevalent congenital defects, develop a suite of massively parallel genomic assays capable of profiling the
regulatory impact of noncoding genetic variants at scale, and perturb the expression of candidate variant-
associated genes in a zebrafish model to determine the phenotypic consequences. Finally, we will (Aim 3)
generate patient-derived organoid models, utilize precision genome engineering in combination with single-cell
transcriptomics in patient-derived organoids to validate the causal role of specific variants in congenital defects,
and characterize the impact of variants on development using spatial transcriptomics in patient-derived
organoids as a proxy. We anticipate that the work outlined in this proposal will establish an experimental
framework that can be deployed to identify genetic variants that are responsible for a wide variety of congenital
defects."

Child exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) is linked to multiple forms of cancer throughout the
lifespan. Young children living in low-socioeconomic status households are at increased risk for
SHS exposure. Families involved with the child protection system as the result of substantiated
child maltreatment are an especially high-risk group for SHS, as these families are often living in
poverty and report high daily smoking rates. Importantly, child maltreatment victimization also
increases risk of cancer and premature death from cancer, independent of parent smoking
behavior. Identifying ways to broadly disseminate effective SHS prevention programs to these
high-risk families is an important strategy for reducing cancer disparities. We propose an
effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial type 1 to examine the impact of integrating two
evidence-based programs, Some Things are Better Outside (SHS prevention program) and
SafeCare® (Child Maltreatment Prevention Program), on establishing a smoke-free home and
on implementation process outcomes. Aim 1 focuses on the refinement of the standardized
integration (systematic braiding) of the two programs into “Smoke-Free SafeCare (SFSC).” Aims
2 and 3 focus on the hybrid trial. Fifty certified SafeCare Providers will be recruited and
randomly assigned to deliver either SFSC or Standard SafeCare. Providers will each serve ten
research families (N = 500) who meet the inclusion criteria (Mother or another person residing in
the home smokes at home). The primary outcome, smoke-free home status, will be measured
via self-report at 4-timepoints (baseline, 8-weeks, 20-weeks, and 1-year), and validated via air
nicotine monitor at 8 weeks and 1-year (Aim 2). Process measures will be collected to examine
how the braided intervention impacts provider fidelity, delivery time and costs, and other
process measures (Aim 3). If effective, SFSC can be efficiently disseminated for widespread
adoption by the National SafeCare Training and Research Center to the over 100 accredited
SafeCare agencies across the United States and worldwide that serve parents involved with
child protection services, reducing cancer risk and disparities for a high-risk population."

Methods for rapidly generating synthetic nucleic acid constructs have dramatically changed biological and
biomedical research. Improvements in these arenas will continue to impact varied areas of genomics and
biomedicine such as synthetic genomics and associated functional screens. Enabling significant advances with
new nucleic acid synthesis and synthetic construct capabilities has the potential to lead to remarkable
improvements in the understanding, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease; advances in agriculture,
environmental science and remediation; and our understanding of evolution and ecological systems.
Current abilities to work with a variety of synthetic constructs have been enabled by cost reductions in
oligonucleotide synthesis along with vastly improved techniques for hierarchal assembly of larger constructs,
largely in yeast. Our group has led the way both in assembling the yeast genome (i.e. the international Sc2.0
project) and in a NHGRI-sponsored CEGS that has launched the “Dark Matter Project”, aiming to functionally
dissect noncoding DNA and its contribution to human/mammalian transcriptional regulation. We have also
developed an in-house design software application environment linked to our LIMS called MenDEL (Mentored
Design Environment and LIMS). But we need to do much more to make such projects ever easier to do –
ultimately, in any lab.
In this project we plan to develop the “Assemblatron”, a workflow/Design platform/Host vector system that
systematically optimizes the “Yeast assembly” process, and is capable of producing very large DNA molecules
of up to a megabase in size. We will develop a system in which one person can assemble 1-2 Megabases
of 20-30 kb DNA pieces in a few days’ work, and 1-2 Mb of ~100 kb pieces in 2-4 weeks. The specific goal
is >10X improvement in Big DNA assembly efficiency, manifested as the ability of a single researcher, starting
with 3 kb starting materials, to do the following: 1) Assemble 1-2 Mb of DNA in 1-2 weeks and 2) Finalize
assembly into 10 to 20 100+ kb pieces in 2-4 weeks. Ultimately this research program will lead to development
of an Assemblatron device that automates much or all of the process. We plan to achieve this improvement in
efficiency, which is currently limited by a series of bottlenecks that exist throughout the workflow using a
combination of dry lab and wet lab methods, outlined below."

The long-term goal of this work is to facilitate the faithful regeneration of damaged human tissues. Regeneration
in adult mammals is extremely limited; damaged tissue in most major organs fails to regenerate, and instead
undergoes scar-based repair. The lack of adult regenerative capacity is an enormous burden on the healthcare
system and society as a whole. Although both human and mouse digit tips can undergo a true regenerative
response, this regeneration is positionally restricted to the terminal distal phalanx bone. Importantly, amputations
with an axis point below the terminal distal phalanx bone or too close to the nail bed result in regeneration failure.
Notably, salamander limbs have an anatomy similar to that of human limbs, but uniquely regenerate after
amputation from any position throughout adult life. The biological mechanisms limiting regeneration in adult
mammals is poorly understood. Although the immune system is a powerful regulator of wound repair, the exact
role of immune-cell networks as a determinant of regenerative success has been grossly understudied. In our
regeneration studies, including those proposed here, we use the mouse digit-tip model, examining regeneration
following tissue removal at different digit locations. This is a powerful model, as regeneration can be measured
non-invasively with high-resolution micro-computed tomography 3D-imaging (bone/soft tissue volume), and
analyzed comprehensively using histology and molecular analysis. We identified several lymphoid immune-cell
types that inhibit mouse digit-tip regeneration via cytotoxic activity against progenitor cells and showed that T-
regulatory cells (Tregs) play a critical role in protecting progenitors from these cells. We also found that in mice
lacking lymphoid immunity, novel regeneration is induced, providing new models to identify pro-regenerative
cells and molecular pathways that can be exploited therapeutically. Importantly, we also identified several
lymphoid-cell types that support regeneration, suggesting the potential to therapeutically enhance human repair
through targeted immunomodulation. This project aims to identify and characterize the mechanisms by which
lymphoid cells regulate adult regeneration. Specifically, we will: Aim 1: Dissect and characterize lymphoid-cell
mechanisms inhibiting regeneration. We will use a range of mouse strains with mutations in cytotoxic function in
ex vivo and in vivo analyses. Aim 2: Define mechanisms of pro-regenerative Treg suppression of lymphoid-cell
cytotoxicity using Treg-specific deletion of functional genes in vivo. Aim 3: Test the hypothesis that targeted
disarming of lymphoid cells could enhance regeneration in vivo. We will test tolerogenic molecules in ex vivo
cytotoxicity assays and then evaluate tolerogenic antigen overexpression in vivo both direct transgenic and viral
approaches and then via a modified Treg delivery strategy. This project will fuse developmental biology and
immunological methods to identify the critical biological pathways and genetic modifiers required for transient
immunomodulation strategies directed at inducing latent regenerative potential in adult tissues in mammals. This
work will lay the groundwork for translation studies aimed at enhancing tissue repair in human patients."

Gliomas are major primary brain tumors, of which glioblastomas (GBM) are the most common and aggressive
forms. The poor outcome of traditional treatment for these tumors demands targeted therapies based on
identified mechanisms that drive tumor development. Molecular pathology has classified GBM into subtypes,
among which the mesenchymal (MES) group is the most malignant. It is still unclear how GBM MES
differentiation is achieved. Recent anatomically based transcriptome studies found that tumor cells associated
with the necrotic region have higher expression of the MES signature genes, suggesting that the necrotic tumor
microenvironment may contribute to MES differentiation and could be exploited as a therapeutic target. The goal
of this project is to mechanistically and functionally study GBM necrosis, and identify vulnerabilities of GBM MES
progression for therapeutics. We have established the follow premise for the proposed studies. First, we have
developed novel pathologically relevant GBM mouse models showing MES differentiation and extensive necrosis.
Second, we identified ferroptosis as a novel mechanism for GBM necrosis. Third, in both patient GBM samples
and mouse models, we found that the necrotic tumor areas are infiltrated by neutrophils. Our studies suggested
that these tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are necessary and sufficient to induce tumor cell ferroptosis.
Furthermore, we found that ferroptosis and TANs are associated with the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We
hypothesize that GBM necrosis occurs through neutrophil-triggered ferroptosis, and this process is orchestrated
by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment. We further hypothesize that ferroptosis could promote tumor
progression and be targeted for therapeutic purposes. We propose the following three specific aims: 1) to
determine the mechanism of tumor cell ferroptosis induced by TANs; 2) to determine the role of hypoxic tumor
microenvironment in tumor cell ferroptosis; 3) to demonstrate the role of ferroptosis in GBM progression and
evaluate therapeutic effects of ferroptosis blockade. We will employ a panel of established human GBM cell lines,
newly isolated human GBM cells, and mouse GBM models. GBM necrosis is a diagnostic hallmark, predicts
tumor aggressiveness, and has deleterious effects on treatments. The nature and mechanism of cell death
associated with this necrosis remain obscure. In addition, whether tumor necrosis blockade could benefit
therapies is still unknown. By establishing the GBM models faithfully recapitulating the extent of necrosis
observed in GBM patients and identification of ferroptosis as the underlying mechanism of tumor necrosis, this
proposal will reveal vulnerabilities of GBM MES progression, which could be a novel avenue for GBM
therapeutics."

Cognitive dysfunction, including the inappropriate generalization (i.e., overgeneralization) of negative episodic
memories, is a core diagnostic criterion of major depression, and is recognized as a key determinant of severe
affective symptoms. For this reason, we believe that studying the neurobiology of memory generalization could
have considerable translational impact for depression. We propose to identify the cellular and circuit
mechanisms subserving generalization of negative context (episodic-like) memories using a newly developed
paradigm of stress-induced generalization (SIG). Aim 1 will rely on most recent approaches that allow us to
visualize and manipulate neuronal populations coding either specific and general features of context
memories. Through these techniques, we expect to determine whether stress promotes or disrupts the
reactivation of these neuronal populations during memory retrieval. Aim 2 will utilize chemogenetic and
optogenetic approaches, alone or in combination with neuronal labeling, to determine whether excitatory
ventral tegmental area (VTA) to dorsal hippocampus (DH) projections, which signal negative valence,
contribute to SIG. Inhibition of these projections is expected to reduce generalization, especially in females.
Aim 3 will focus on the role of MS to DH projections, which we suspect play a more prominent role in SIG in
males than in females. In addition to the approaches used in Aim 2, we will determine the effects of stress and
cholinergic neuromodulation on hippocampal oscillations and acetylcholine release, and we will explore the
stress-mediated changes of global brain activity using manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging.
Upon competition of this project, we expect to have identified the main cellular and circuit (mal)adaptations
induced by stress that result in lasting generalization of negative context memories. Approaches that prove
effective in reversing SIG could be the foundation for novel treatments of cognitive deficits associated with
depression and affective disorders."
10759394,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The rate of Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD) is nearly twice as high among African
Americans when compared to Whites. African Americans are more likely than others to age with ADRD in the
community and rely heavily on family members or other informal sources for support. African American
caregivers spend more time providing care than their White counterparts, and report need for daytime respite
care. The greater time spent providing care to relatives and unmet need for respite services may accelerate
aging and the negative health effects of stress associated with caregiving among African Americans. Adult day
services (ADS) may offer respite to alleviate caregiving-related stressors among African American dementia
caregivers. Adult day services offer community-based, out-of-home, supervised support for persons with
dementia. Guided by the NIH-Stage Model, this NIA-K01 award will allow completion of the initial stage of the
model to identify the mechanisms which ADS influence caregiving-related stressors and needs for African
American ADRD caregivers. A convergent parallel mixed methods design will be used. The aims will employ
quantitative methods of survey assessment of psychosocial stress (caregiver stress, perceived stress), the
collection of salivary biologics (Alpha-Amylase, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, cortisol and telomere length)
to assess physiological stress, and descriptive interviews and daily diaries to explore African American
caregivers’ daily stressors, health seeking and coping behaviors. Over a 5-day period, 50 African American
caregivers’ will be asked to keep a daily diary of stressful events they encounter during the day, and strategies
used to manage stress. During this period, the caregivers will also be asked to self-collect salivary biomarkers
four times a day (upon waking, 30-minutes are waking, before dinner, and bedtime) for five consecutive days
(20 samples per caregiver), to include at least two days of ADS use and a weekend day. Descriptive interviews
will also be used to elicit caregivers’ experiences with daily stressors and coping behaviors. The specific
research aims of this study are focused on African American ADRD caregivers, who utilize ADS at least twice
a week for a person with dementia. The three specific aims are to: 1) Identify daily stressors, health seeking
and coping behaviors among African American dementia caregivers, 2) Identify the association between
caregiver stress and physiological stress, and 3) Evaluate diurnal patterns in physiological stress on ADS vs
non-ADS day usage. Outcomes of this proposed project will inform a R01 award to develop a culturally-tailored
stress reduction intervention for African American dementia-caregivers at the ADS site, to be submitted during
year 4. The candidate’s training plan capitalizes on the expertise of a diverse mentoring team, and lays out a
comprehensive plan to gain training in mixed-methods, intervention development, and the integration of
physiological indicators of stress into dementia-related research."

 Increased susceptibility to infectious disease is the most prominent consequence of aging of the immune
system. In addition to generating basic knowledge, Projects 1-3 of the “Thymic and peripheral aspects of T
cell aging and rejuvenation” Program Project (Program) will provide an array of potential rejuvenation
strategies. The Immunological Response & Rejuvenation Strategy Monitoring Core (Core D), located at the
University of Arizona, will provide the final experimental pipeline for testing those rejuvenation strategies.
Specifically, the global objective of Core D is to assess thymic export and peripheral maintenance of
naïve T cells following T cell rejuvenation in old mice, and determine whether such interventions can
improve adaptive and protective immunity against viral infection in old mice.
 The Core will provide dedicated personnel with the appropriate infectious disease expertise to ensure
consistency and quality control in the execution of study protocols, application of experimental procedures, and
animal observations and data collection necessary to meet the Program’s major research objectives. This
testing pipeline will not only separate candidate interventions by their efficacy, but will also identify potential
stages at which some rejuvenation strategies may fail to translate into improved immune function. Core D will
also combine treatments from different projects, as appropriate, to synergistically increase T cell production
and improve their maintenance in secondary lymphoid organs. The use of rigorous in vivo analysis to track
recent thymic emigrants, and immunity in response to West Nile virus, a pathogen that shows disproportionally
high morbidity and mortality within the elderly, will provide this Program and its Projects with stringent testing of
a full spectrum of peripheral immune functions and protective immunity following T cell rejuvenation in old
mice. Thereby, the Core will deliver rigorous preclinical data to enable translational rejuvenation efforts in
humans."
10851684,"PROJECT 1- Abstract
 Even though the thymus is exquisitely sensitive to acute injury such as that caused by infection, shock,
or common cancer therapies such as cytoreductive chemo- or radiation therapy, it also has a remarkable
capacity for endogenous repair. However, this capacity declines with age and is a major clinical hurdle in
elderly patients who receive an immune insult such as that caused by common cancer cytoreductive therapies
and the conditioning required for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT).
 The premise of this project is that the thymic regenerative response to acute injury is weakened
with age and correlates with age-related thymic involution. We will compare and contrast what we know
about the cellular and molecular pathways that underpin thymic regeneration in young animals, to the
regenerative response in mice during normal thymic aging; and develop rational intervention strategies to
improve regeneration in aged mice. In this project, we will comprehensively assess the endogenous
regenerative response over lifespan, with particular emphasis on sex differences with age (SA1); perform
studies to better understand the underlying mechanisms governing endogenous thymic regeneration and their
breakdown in aged mice, focusing on the balance between inflammatory and pro-regenerative signals from
dying cells after acute damage (SA2); and develop therapeutic strategies based on these test known and
putative strategies to determine their effectiveness in promoting thymopoiesis in aged tissue at baseline or that
has undergone damage (SA3).
 Our project has multiple points of interaction with the other projects and cores of this P01, including a
focus on the hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic stromal microenvironment, regulation of Notch-DLL4
interactions, and of utmost importance, a comprehensive shared sequencing dataset that can be leveraged
across the program. Together, these aims and interactions support the overarching goal of the P01 to identify
the mechanisms responsible for defects in thymic production of naïve T cells with age and develop methods to
improve or reverse them. Therefore, the mechanistic and pre-clinical studies outlined have the potential to
define important novel pathways underlying thymic regeneration, which could result in clinical approaches to
enhance T cell immunity in patients whose thymus has been decimated due to age-related involution."
10851685,"ABSTRACT-Project 2
 During the process of age-associated thymus involution, T cell output progressively declines, contributing to
a reduction in naive T cells in older humans and mice. The resultant decline in new T-cell responses to
pathogens, vaccines, and cancers, leads to compromised immunity and increased morbidity with age. Thus, it
is important to elucidate mechanisms underlying reduced thymic function in order to improve human health
throughout the lifespan. In the past Project period, we found that early T-cell progenitors (ETPs), which give rise
to all downstream thymocyte subsets, decline in numbers surprisingly early, by 3 months (mo) of age. ETP
cellularity remains proportional to downstream thymocyte subsets at all ages, indicating the early decline in ETPs
sets the stage for diminished thymopoiesis during thymic involution. Because ETPs are the direct progeny of
circulating thymic seeding progenitors (TSPs), we anticipated a decline in the number of functional TSP niches
by 3mo of age. However, our data reveal that the available TSP niches do not decline through at least 12mo of
age, raising the question of what mechanisms underlie the early reduction in ETPs. Our preliminary data suggest
that changes in the BM and thymus microenvironments contribute to the early loss in ETPs. Although the
underlying mechanisms are not yet resolved, preliminary data suggest diminished NOTCH signaling in BM
lymphoid progenitors and thymic ETPs contribute. Thus, we will use genetic mouse models and advanced
imaging approaches to test if reduced expression of Notch ligands, and/or changes in other signals identified
through additional single-cell transcriptional profiling (Core B), are responsible for the early decline in lymphoid
progenitors in the BM (Aim 1) and ETPs in the thymus (Aim 2), and whether comparable mechanisms impact
the aging human thymus (Core C). We will also test if restoring NOTCH signaling rescues cellularity of BM
lymphoid progenitors, ETPs and thymocytes, and downstream T cell function in aging mice (P3 and Core D).
 Changes in the cellular composition and organization of the thymic microenvironment during involution
may impact not only the quantity, but also the quality of developing T cells with age. During the previous Project
period, we found that by middle age, the thymus becomes impaired in its ability to support central tolerance
through both negative selection and regulatory T cell generation, particularly in response to low avidity self-
antigens. New onset autoimmunity also peaks at middle age in humans, suggesting a role for impaired central
tolerance. Thus, we will analyze current single-cell transcriptional profiling datasets from P2 and P1 (Core B)
and perform live 2-photon imaging and thymic slice assays to identify age-associated changes in the mouse and
human (Core C) thymic microenvironments that impair central tolerance and increase autoimmune susceptibility
by middle-age (Aim 3). P2 is tightly integrated with P1, P3, and the Cores. P2 results will be integral to achieving
the overall Program goals of elucidating mechanisms underlying age-associated defects in T-cell production and
selection and devising therapeutic strategies to restore functional T cell output and immunity with age."
10851687,"PROJECT 3- Abstract
 Naïve T cells (Tn) are produced in the thymus, but require peripheral mechanisms to maintain their
homeostasis and function. The premise of this project is that, while thymic involution is a proximal cause of
reduced Tn numbers with aging, defects in peripheral maintenance mechanisms in secondary lymphoid organs
(SLO) also significantly contribute to immunosenescence. Indeed, in the past project period we have
demonstrated that uncorrected defects in peripheral maintenance of Tn cells can powerfully undermine the
benefits of reawakening T cell production by the rejuvenated thymus. We further pinpointed a precise
chronological sequence of degenerative structural and functional changes in different SLO.
 This renewal application will continue to dissect mechanistic molecular and cellular basis of SLO aging
and regeneration. Based on the order of changes and the evidence supporting cross-talk between Tn cells and
SLO stroma, we hypothesize that reduced thymic production of Tn cells reduces trophic signals to SLO
stroma, leading to initial stromal niche and network disorganization, that in turn deprives Tn cells of
vital trophic signals and initiates a negative feed-forward loop of deterioration in both Tn cell and SLO
stromal responses. Our specific aims are:
 SA1. To elucidate molecular changes in lymph node stroma with aging and IL-7 complex
rejuvenation, using a hierarchy of in vitro and in vivo approaches to test a pipeline of candidates identified by
miniarray and scRNASeq approaches in the past support period; and SA2. To dissect the intrinsic and
extrinsic age-related defects in SLO stromal cells and the role of Tn:stromal crosstalk in LN
homeostasis with aging, by examining the roles of oxidative stress, senescent cell accumulation, persistent
Tn cell influx and natural polymicrobial exposure (to pet store mice) in LN/SLO aging.
Once the defects are dissected, we will formulate interventions that improve peripheral T cell
maintenance in aged organisms. These interventions will be tested by Core D, individually or combined with
thymic rejuvenation treatments coming from P1&2, for the ability to improve protective immunity against
infection. Together with powerful analytical pipelines from Cores A&B, as well as human molecular target
verification by Core C, that will correlate age-related changes in mouse T cell and lymphoid organ aging to
those in humans, this will provide direct preclinical data that are expected to pave the way for human T cell
rejuvenation in older adults."
10746139,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in males. Prostate cancer cells are dependent on
a transcription factor called the androgen receptor (AR), which is activated by the androgens testosterone and
dihydrotestosterone. Accordingly, an effective treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer is
androgen deprivation therapy, which blocks the effects of androgens, inhibits the AR, and halts the growth of
prostate cancer cells. Although this form of treatment is very effective for advanced prostate cancer, the stress
of this therapy will eventually lead to the prostate cancer cells developing resistance. In approximately 25-30%
of cases, the stress of prostate cancer therapy will cause the prostate cancer cells to transform into cellular
states where they no longer resemble the original disease. These prostate cancer cells take on features of
alternative cell types through a process called lineage plasticity. These lineage plastic prostate cancers are
very difficult to treat because they do not contain AR and there are no effective therapeutics available.
Additionally, the processes by which standard prostate cancer therapies can cause prostate cancer lineage
plasticity is poorly understood. This proposal seeks to understand the biology of prostate cancer lineage
plasticity and develop new therapeutic strategies to treat, prevent, or reverse this disease stage. Our
preliminary data demonstrates the stem cell transcription factor KLF5 is up-regulated by standard prostate
cancer therapies that inhibit the AR. Up-regulation of KLF5 enhances androgen-independent growth of
prostate cancer cells, as well as migration and colony formation phenotypes. Functionally, the transcriptional
program initiated by up-regulated KLF5 clashes with the transcriptional program activated by the AR. Because
the AR transcriptional program controls prostate cancer cell identity, KLF5 up-regulation breaks down this
identity and promotes very early steps in lineage plasticity of prostate cancer cells. We hypothesize that
targeting this early step in therapy-induced prostate cancer lineage plasticity will block later events that lead to
very aggressive, treatment-resistant manifestations of the disease. We have identified ERBB2 as a focal point
of this tug-of-war between AR and KLF5, and shown that ERBB2 inhibitors can block the oncogenic effects of
KLF5. To advance these findings and identify additional therapeutic vulnerabilities in this pathway, we propose
2 Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will study induction of KLF5 and lineage plasticity phenotypes in CRPC. In Aim 2,
we will test therapeutic potential of blocking early steps in CRPC lineage plasticity. A successful outcome can
lead to rapid development of clinical trials testing these therapeutic strategies for treatment or prevention of
lineage plastic prostate cancer."
10811683,"Project Summary/Abstract
Poor decision making and elevated risk taking may be due to chronic drug exposure and contribute to continued
drug use and/or promote relapse. Animal models have been invaluable in identifying whether such elevated risk
taking arises from drug-induced alterations in neural substrates that govern risk taking in drug-naïve states (i.e.,
prior to drug exposure). Although there has been significant progress in answering such questions, we still face
a significant barrier in translating these findings to the clinical setting. Not only is our understanding of the neural
substrates of risk taking based on studies using only males, but prior studies have also primarily focused on how
hypersensitivity to reward (as opposed to hyposensitivity to punishment) promotes elevated risk taking after drug
use. Little is known about the neural substrates underlying risk taking in females, let alone how such substrates
are altered after drug exposure. The long-term goal of our research is to uncover the neural and hormonal
mechanisms mediating decision making involving risk of punishment in females in order to identify how these
processes become compromised by substance use. To meet this goal, we will use a rat model of risk taking in
which females are more risk averse and exhibit greater sensitivity to risk of punishment than males. In this model,
female risk aversion is largely mediated by estradiol (E2) and such E2-dependent risk aversion requires estrogen
receptor (ER) β. We have also established a role for the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in promoting risk averse
behavior. Preliminary data show activation of D2 dopamine receptors (D2R) in the BLA leads to risk aversion in
females, but not males, suggesting differences in BLA function may underlie sex differences in risk taking. This
would be consistent with greater overall BLA activity in females than males either at baseline or in response to
aversive stimuli. Prior work shows female-specific BLA activity and BLA-dependent behavior are due to E2’s
ability to modulate BLA function. Hence, our overarching hypothesis is that female risk aversion depends on
E2’s ability to regulate BLA excitability via modulation of ERβ and D2R function and suppression of interneuron
activity. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the ER mechanisms
in the BLA that contribute to E2-dependent female risk aversion using behavioral pharmacology, in vivo
electrophysiology and RNA interference-mediated ER gene reduction. Aim 2 will identify the contribution of E2
modulation of BLA D2R function to female risk aversion using genetic ablation and optogenetic manipulation of
BLA neurons that selectively express D2Rs. Aim 3 will evaluate the role of BLA parvalbumin-expressing
interneurons in E2-dependent female risk aversion using fiber photometry and optogenetics. Completion of these
experiments will reveal mechanisms by which E2 mediates risk aversion in females. This information will be
significant because it will provide the necessary foundation from which we can assess the efficacy of targeting
E2-dependent neural mechanisms to alleviate elevated risk taking associated with substance use."

To better understand the short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health and
development, we will leverage our existing randomized controlled trial of a school-based healthy relationships
program. In 2018, we randomized 24 Texas middle schools in disadvantaged communities in which students
(n=2865; Mean age = 12.7; 50% female; 36% Black/African American, 26% Latinx; 14% Asian) received either
standard health curriculum (n=12 control schools) or Fourth R (n=12 intervention schools). Participants
completed baseline and three annual comprehensive follow-up assessments of their mental (e.g., depression,
anxiety, hostility), social (e.g., living situation, socio-economic status, school climate, stress), and behavioral
(e.g., dating violence, substance use, sexual behavior, (cyber)bullying, coping strategies) health. This
longitudinal data, with relevant measures established prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-
home orders, provides a powerful opportunity to understand the long-term impact of this global crisis on youth
development, mental health, risk behaviors, and academic achievement and explore risk and protective factors
moderating this impact. Thus, we will 1) administer an additional four years of annual follow-up surveys,
beginning in the 12th grade and follow students until they are, on average, 21 years of age; 2) recruit and
assess parents of participants; 3) augment our already extensive student-level data with comprehensive
pandemic-related measures, as well as school-, neighborhood-, and environmental-level factors that may
moderate impact; and 4) conduct qualitative interviews of educators (n=24), students (n=24), and parents
(n=24) to obtain a richer understanding of factors that mitigated or exacerbated the impact of COVID-19 and
resulting disruptions to school, family, mental health, and development. Specific aims are to 1) Determine the
short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' mental, behavioral, and social health,
as well as their academic performance and career potential; 2) Examine the moderating impact of family and
income stability, parent-child relationships, parent mental health, equity (access to education, digital divide),
learning model (in-person, online, hybrid), school disruptions, and school and neighborhood climate on COVID-
19 impacts for youth; 3) Investigate whether and how pandemic-related stressors (individual/family COVID
impacts of job interruption, food access, media consumption, and vaccine uptake) are linked to short- and long-
term health behaviors and outcomes; and 4) Evaluate the secondary benefits of Fourth R in mitigating the
negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given that the intervention targets mental wellbeing, conflict
resolution, coping, and help-seeking, we hypothesize that students exposed to the intervention will evidence
improved mental, social, and behavioral health relative to their counterparts in control schools. Our study will
provide a rigorous and comprehensive understanding of the impact of COVID-19 – quantitatively by leveraging
data from an ongoing cohort and contextually through qualitative investigation."

Sleep deprivation in American youth and young adults is a major public health problem and can impair mental
and physical health, cognitive functioning and stress response systems. Significant gaps in this research
include scarce investigations of long- term developmental trajectories of adaptation and maladaptation
associated with sleep disturbances in the context of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities. Identifying
mechanisms that explain SES and racial disparities in sleep and broader health outcomes, as well as factors
that prevent or protect against broader health disparities are high scientific priorities (Healthy People 2030).
The proposed study addresses these gaps and advances parent grant discoveries. The design builds on a
well-characterized two-wave study with adolescents (16-19 years; n=300) and involves two additional waves
with young adults (~ 21-24 years; target n=300); analyses will also capitalize on existing data for a subsample
(n=199) who participated during childhood (9,10,11 years). The sample consists of young adults from semi-
rural Alabama; 54% women; high representation of Black participants (39%) and socioeconomic adversity.
This sample is unique, underrepresented in the literature, and ideal for testing the research questions.
Strengths of the design include the large and diverse sample, high retention rates, breadth and rigor of
measurement across important outcome domains, a four-wave design spanning adolescence and young
adulthood, a large subsample with three additional waves in childhood, and analyses of long-term trajectories
of mental and physical health, cognitive functioning and autonomic nervous system activity. Towards scientific
rigor and reproducibility, well-established procedures, questionnaires, hardware and software will be used.
Sleep is examined objectively with actigraphy and subjectively. Comparable long-term investigations of health
disparities utilizing objectively-assessed sleep and developmental trajectories of multiple health domains in
such a sample do not exist. The study will advance understanding of the long-term effects of sleep across
development in the context of socioeconomic and racial health disparities by identifying the role of sleep in
transmitting risk or functioning as a vulnerability or protective factor. Study goals are consistent with the
strategic goals and high-priority research areas of the 2021 NIH Sleep Research Plan including advancing
understanding of sleep’s contributions to health disparities in socioeconomically disadvantaged and
minoritized groups. Findings will help identify individuals at greatest risk for negative health outcomes and
identify behavioral and ecological targets for prevention and intervention."
10748407,"Urogynecologic meshes are often implanted in women to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ
prolapse, two most common pelvic floor disorders. While peri-operative glycemic control is the standard of care,
women with diabetes experience ~5-fold higher risk of developing mesh-related complications such as mesh
exposure into vaginal cavity and pelvic chronic pain. These complications significantly impair women’s life quality
and increase health costs. Since diabetes affects 1 in 10 adult women in the US and the incidence continues to
increase, defining the mechanism underlying the diabetes-associated risk of mesh complications is critical to
improve patient care and decrease societal expenses.
Studies have demonstrated that the beneficial effects of intensive glycemic control are markedly decreased if
long episodes of hyperglycemia precede the treatment, referred to as “hyperglycemic memory” (HgM). To date,
there has been no investigation into how this phenomenon impacts the outcomes of women receiving
urogynecologic meshes. Our preliminary data in a rat model support that hyperglycemia is harmful to vaginal
immune response to mesh in the long term and that HgM in bone marrow (BM) cells may impact mesh outcomes.
Here we hypothesize that hyperglycemia leaves epigenetic marks in BM progenitor cells, which drives
macrophage dysfunction at mesh-tissue interface, leading to an increased risk of mesh complications despite
later glucose normalization. As epigenetic modification is reversible with long-term glycemic normalization, we
further hypothesize that tight and long-term peri-operative glycemic control attenuates the negative impact of
HgM, thereby improves mesh outcomes in women with diabetes.
We have assembled an interdisciplinary team to test the hypotheses with the following specific aims: (1) Define
the role of HgM in host response to mesh. In vitro experiments using hyperglycemia-impacted vs. normal BM
cells will be performed to define impact of HgM on macrophage phenotype and function. In vivo experiments
using BM transplantation in a diabetic rat model with mesh implanted via sacrocolpopexy will be performed to
define the impact of HgM in BM cells vs. HgM in vaginal tissue on the long-term mesh outcomes at 90 days. (2)
Define the effect of peri-operative glycemic control regimens on host response to mesh and long-term mesh
outcomes. Three peri-operative glycemic control procedures – early and strict, immediately before surgery, and
poor glycemic control will be implemented. Mesh outcomes at short-, medium-, and long-terms (i.e., 7-, 42-, and
90-days post-surgery) will be compared between groups. (3) Define the relationship between HgM and diabetes-
associated risk of mesh complications via an in-depth analysis of host response in human mesh-tissue samples
obtained from women with mesh complications.
This study will provide insight into the mechanism of long-term implant complications in women with diabetes
and inform future preventive strategies to improve health outcomes in this rapidly expanding demographic."
10764919,"Plasticity in the hippocampus leads to persistent changes in synaptic structure and function that
underlie learning and memory. Intracellular Ca2+ signaling pathways activated downstream of NMDA receptors
(NMDAR) and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (LTCC) contribute to changes synaptic function that are
required for initial expression of plasticity as well as changes in gene expression that support long-term
maintenance of plasticity. In particular, activation of LTCCs plays a key role in dendritic spine structural
plasticity and excitation-transcription (E-T) coupling to control the activity of transcription factors in the nucleus,
such as cAMP/Ca2+-response element binding protein (CREB), nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), and
myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2). Alterations in LTCC function have been linked to multiple neurological and
neuropsychiatric diseases. Importantly, NFAT-dependent transcription may control the expression of a number
of target genes that play key roles in regulating E/I balance and excitability, including GABAA-Rs and voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. Our previous work established the scaffold protein AKAP79/150, which
anchors the cAMP-dependent kinase PKA and the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) near
LTCCs, as an essential regulator of E-T coupling via CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of NFAT. However,
due to the large distances between synapses in dendrites and the nucleus in the soma, neurons face unique
challenges in converting synaptic input into biochemical signals that control transcription. We recently found
that LTP stimulated NMDAR-LTCC-NFAT synapse-to-nucleus signaling utilizes dendritic Ca2+ spike
propagation to the soma as a novel E-T coupling mechanism. In addition, we found that this NMDAR-LTCC
activation during LTP induction promotes Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in dendrites that engages the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sensor STIM1 to trigger negative-feedback regulation of LTCC Ca2+ influx
while also mediating novel structural plasticity of the dendritic spine ER. However, there are still critical gaps in
our knowledge regarding how NMDARs, LTCCs, and STIM1 operate over different spatial and temporal scales
to control both local dendritic structural plasticity and distal dendrite-to-soma spike propagation to regulate
transcription. Furthermore, we do not understand how the transcription of specific activity-regulated target
genes is controlled by different patterns of activity transduced by these mechanisms to modulate key aspects
of neuronal function, such as E/I balance. Thus, here we propose research to fill these gaps by characterizing
the roles of postsynaptic LTCC Ca2+ signaling in mediating local structural plasticity in dendrites and Ca2+ spike
relay from dendrites to soma (aim 1) in control gene of expression through NFAT and its co-regulators to

Their RNA-dependent RNA polymerases are prone to mutation, lack proof-reading capabilities (with the unique exception of coronaviruses) and frequently undergo recombination between both homologous and non-homologous templates. This confers the ability to rapidly adapt to new environments, evade immune responses and side-step anti-viral therapies. In many RNA viruses, RNA recombination is co-regulated with replication fidelity and is required to correct deleterious mutations and thus is a critical determinant of viral fitness. Through the combined generation subgenomic messenger RNAs, structural variants (SVs), and Defective RNAs (D-RNAs), RNA recombination is an essential property of CoV replication and evolution. With the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2, recombination has been highlighted as a major factor driving the emergence of novel variants. SARS-CoV-2 variants have developed mutations thought to improve receptor binding, disrupt innate immune responses, or evade adaptive immunity. We recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is >10-fold more recombinogenic than other CoVs such as MERS and MHV (Gribble et al, 2021, PLoS Path). Interestingly, RNA recombination events that give rise to SVs and D- RNAs were predominantly found adjacent to U-rich tracts. Using ‘Tiled-ClickSeq’, developed in our lab (Jaworski et al, 2021, eLife), we found the same trends in COVID19 patient samples. We also demonstrated that micro- deletions flanked by U-rich motifs in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 spontaneously arise during passaging in cell culture and alter viral pathogenesis (Johnson et al, 2021, Nature). Notably, microindels in novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 (e.g. Alpha variant) are also flanked by U-rich motifs. Altogether, this evidence suggests U-rich tracts define RNA recombination hotspots which have given rise to the emergence of novel CoVs variants. However, while recombination rates are demonstrably high, SARS-CoV-2 has a strong transmission bottleneck restricting the dissemination of minority variants. Novel variants such as Alpha and Omicron contain multiple recombination events and may have arisen during intrahost adaption in a chronically infected (e.g. immunocompromised) patient. Therefore, characterizing RNA recombination in the correct physiological setting is crucial to understand which RNA recombinant species are able to emerge and how these are selected. In this proposal, we will characterize the molecular mechanisms of RNA recombination and characterize how the physiological aspects and site of infection determines whether a novel variant is selected for and thus emergence. Characterizing the factors that give rise to new emergent strains and variants will be critical in our understanding of both historical and future outbreaks events. Furthermore, these studies will inform on the basic and fundamental principles that drive RNA virus evolution. The current pandemic presents a unique situation in which to characterize the basic principles of virus emergence and may impact our understanding of a range of viral pathogens."
10932109,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Reducing overdose mortality immediately and long-term is a top public health priority as the overdose epidemic
in the U.S. continues to worsen. The COVID-19 pandemic, which began hitting the U.S. in early 2020, has
exacerbated the overdose crisis - particularly among African Americans and Latinxs. Opioid overdose deaths,
which accounted for the most overdose deaths in 2020, continue to drive the epidemic. Overdose deaths linked
to synthetic opioids, such as illicitly manufactured fentanyl, have increased significantly and comprised most of
the opioid-related deaths in 2020. Despite increasing availability and acceptability of naloxone among
laypersons, opioid overdose deaths remain catastrophically high in communities across the U.S. The UnityPhilly
smartphone app was developed in 2018-19 alongside several community-based organizations as a public health
intervention in response to the opioid overdose crisis in Philadelphia, which has the most acute overdose
epidemic among large cities in the U.S. UnityPhilly automatically connects bystanders and victims of opioid
overdose with nearby community members who can respond immediately with naloxone. The objective of this
proposal, following a successful feasibility study (R34) and clear evidence of overdose reversal supported by
UnityPhilly, is to create an easy-to-use, effective, sustainable, and scalable smartphone app to be deployed
across the city of Philadelphia. This objective will be achieved by studying subgroups of people equipped with
naloxone and UnityPhilly (n=450) and disseminating UnityPhilly to 3,000 citizen volunteers for everyday use to
respond to opioid overdose emergencies. The long-term goal of this research is to create a scalable app that
can be disseminated to communities across the U.S. experiencing high levels of opioid overdose death. The
rationale for this study is that expanding the availability of the UnityPhilly app to laypersons citywide will increase
the speed and delivery of naloxone to opioid overdose events across Philadelphia while laying the groundwork
for scalability and broader national uptake. Our goals will be achieved with three specific aims: 1) Redevelop
UnityPhilly to ensure ease of use; 2) Assess differences in the effectiveness of UnityPhilly across varied urban
environments and participant profiles; and 3) Build and study a sustainable environment for UnityPhilly to expand
city-wide. This 5-year study will have significant impact by providing actionable evidence regarding the
effectiveness of an app-based naloxone intervention to scale up for nationwide use. The study will be conducted
in partnership with long-standing community-based organizations to ensure usability and acceptability. This
intervention is highly significant since it directly addresses one of the most significant public health problems in
the U.S. – the opioid overdose epidemic – which is worsening due to the effects of COVID-19. This intervention
is highly innovative as it improves upon a previous developed successful mobile phone app and expands its use
to a broader population of users in a large city most impacted by the opioid crisis."

Gastric cancer is a major global disease burden and leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide.
Current treatment decision is made primarily on the basis of staging, which divides patients into
several prognostic groups. For patients with localized and locally advanced disease, curative-intent
surgery with chemotherapy is the standard treatment. However, survival outcomes vary widely, even
among patients with disease of the same stage. Certain patients with early-stage disease have a
sufficiently low risk of recurrence and may not benefit from, or could even be harmed by,
chemotherapy given the associated toxicity and side effects. Conversely, many patients with
aggressive tumors do not respond well to standard chemotherapy and still recur despite receiving
extensive but ineffective treatment. Therefore, current one-size-fits-all approach is suboptimal,
leading to over- and under-treatment in many patients. There is an unmet need for reliable prognostic
and predictive models to guide personalized treatment of gastric cancer. To address this unmet need,
we propose robust radiomics features of tumor morphology and spatial heterogeneity and establish
their prognostic value. In addition, we will incorporate pathobiological knowledge into the design of
deep learning models for predicting prognosis. Further, we will develop novel deep learning
architecture to analyze longitudinal images for predicting pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy.
Finally, by leveraging the complementary value of imaging data, clinicopathologic variables and serial
serum markers, we will construct integrative models to further improve prediction. If successful, the
proposed models will be useful in two ways: (1), identify which patients with early gastric cancer may
safely forego chemotherapy and avoid toxicity; (2), select the most effective chemotherapy regimen
for a given patient. Further, the models can also identify patients with advanced disease who do not
respond to standard chemotherapy and may benefit from novel targeted therapy or immunotherapy.
The proposed computational imaging approaches are generally applicable for response monitoring
and disease surveillance in many solid tumor types. Finally, the AI-based imaging technology
developed here can bring benefit to underserved populations in minority groups and community
settings. Progress made in gastric cancer will not only improve outcomes for patients in the US but
also have global impact given its high incidence and mortality worldwide."
10916173,"Targeting neutrophils to harness myeloid responses for wound healing
 Chronic wounds represent a significant health problem in the United States. Delayed or non-resolving
inflammation is a hallmark of the chronic wound and is sustained by myeloid cell accumulation and upregulated
myelopoiesis. Metabolic conditions such as obesity contribute to this growing problem and influence myeloid
response to wounds. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that obesity and diabetes dysregulate myeloid
responses and thereby impairs wound healing. Our preliminary study using mouse models suggests a
mechanistic link of neutrophil clearance in the bone marrow with myelopoiesis. We propose a translational study
involving both mouse models and human specimens with three Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will determine the
mechanism by which neutrophil clearance in the bone marrow regulates myelopoiesis, with the hypothesis that
neutrophils release extracellular vesicles that regulate myelopoiesis during their clearance. In Aim 2, we will
determine the mechanism of inhibited neutrophil clearance in the bone marrow in chronic wounds and obesity,
with the hypothesis that chronic wounds and obesity increase glutamine utilization in neutrophils and inhibit their
clearance in the bone marrow. In Aim 3, we will bioengineer a nano-drug that target neutrophils and modify
myeloid response. To achieve this, we will utilize a well-defined versatile telodendrimer to selectively deliver
glutaminase inhibitor to neutrophils and will test the nano-drug in the preclinical mouse model of impaired wound
healing in obesity. The proposed experiments will improve knowledge of myeloid responses during wound
healing. The impact of these studies lies in the potential for translation to therapies that stimulate healing
responses in hard-to-heal wounds. Also, the studies could lead to the development of assays that involve
monitoring blood neutrophil survival as cellular biomarkers to aid in the selection of treatment options for patients
with chronic wounds and/or obesity."
10798250,"ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related deaths in the US.
Immunotherapy is a promising new treatment approach for HCC, but there are numerous barriers to
immunotherapy in HCC. Local intratumoral injection of immunotherapies is a logical solution to overcoming
these barriers, particularly given the fact that local immune activation can drive systemic tumor immunity.
However, there are substantial gaps in knowledge regarding the intratumoral delivery of immunotherapies.
When delivered through conventional needles, injected medications track along the needle path and leak out
into the surrounding normal tissue. Not only does this minimize treatment efficacy due to diminished on-target
delivery, but it also increases systemic toxicities. Moreover, even with local deposition of immunotherapies,
persistent microenvironmental barriers can inhibit the generation of tumor immunity. This application will
evaluate a novel intratumoral drug delivery system with an adjustable, electrically insulating sleeve specifically
designed for intratumoral delivery of immunotherapies (ImFusion system). In addition to the controlled delivery
of injected drugs, ImFusion also allows for radiofrequency-mediated intratumoral hyperthermia generation.
Preliminary data show that the ImFusion system results in a substantial improvement in intratumoral drug
delivery relative to conventional needles, and that its hyperthermia capabilities can “prime” the tumor
microenvironment for immune activation. Our central hypothesis is not only that our ImFusion needle design
will improve i.t. drug delivery, but also that the hyperthermia-mediated alterations to tumor vascularity will
countervail immunologic barriers and augment i.t. immunotherapy efficacy. Accordingly, the overall objectives
of this proposal are to understand how 1) variations in injection technique and thermal dose influence i.t. drug
deposition, 2) hyperthermia affects tumor vascularity and immune microenvironments, and 3) hyperthermia
complements i.t. immunotherapy in a syngeneic rat model of HCC. We will test our hypothesis in the following
specific aims: 1) Define the influence of injection technique and hyperthermia on i.t. delivery; 2) Determine the
tumor microenvironmental ramifications of hyperthermia as a function of thermal dose and time; and 3)
Characterize the local and abscopal effects of hyperthermia when combined with i.t. immunotherapy. The
proposal is innovative because it pursues a multimodality image-guided approach to maximize tumor immunity.
In doing so, the paradigm of hyperthermia as a locoregional therapy is replaced with the paradigm of
hyperthermia as an “immune primer.” The proposed research is significant because it is expected to have a
broad translational impact on the efficacy of immunotherapy for patients with advanced HCC."
10746862,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Locally advanced cancers remain a therapeutic challenge to eradicate. The most successful treatments for
such patients continue to combine decades old classical cytotoxic chemotherapies with radiotherapy. While
chemo-radiotherapy improves tumor control, using non-targeted drugs increases normal tissue damage in the
irradiated field along with systemic toxicities precluding further treatment intensification. Targeted delivery
approaches can improve the chemo-radiotherapy paradigm by restricting highly potent radiosensitizers
specifically to irradiated tumor targets that activate anti-tumor immune responses while simultaneously
avoiding normal tissues. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged antibody drug conjugate (ADC) technology for
receptor-restricted radiosensitization. ADCs split the roles of tumor targeting and killing into two distinct
molecular tasks. Targeting is achieved by the antibody portion recognizing cell surface receptors preferentially
found on tumor cells. Following cell surface receptor binding, ADCs are endocytosed and the attached drug
payload warhead intracellularly released specifically within target cells. ADCs have been exclusively built by
linking cytotoxic drugs to tumor targeting antibodies. The potent anti-tubulin drug monomethyl auristatin E
(MMAE) is the most common ADC warhead. We discovered MMAE could also radiosensitize. Advancing to
syngeneic murine models using our novel drug delivery vehicles, we have now provided the first demonstration
that MMAE produces durable irradiated tumor control which is dependent on CD8 T cells and is enhanced by
immune checkpoint inhibition. While antibody coupled, MMAE is target restricted. However once released,
MMAE has dose limiting toxicities. To achieve increasingly precise tumor radiosensitization, we used
orthogonal strategies and rationally constructed a first-in-class radiosensitizing ADC designed to inhibit DNA
damage repair. As proof of concept, we conjugated anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab to ATM inhibitor AZD0156
(cetux-AZD0156). Cetux-AZD0156 specifically bound and delivered drug to EGFR+ tumors while avoiding
adjacent peri-tumoral normal tissue. Moreover, cetux-AZD0156 radiosensitized and increased irradiated tumor
control. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that anti-ErbB ADCs coupled to radiosensitizing warheads
improve spatial precision of radiosensitization and engage the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). The
goals of this proposal are to methodically test this hypothesis by evaluating radiosensitizing ADC warheads in
murine tumor models using our innovative toolbox of tumor-targeted radiosensitizing ADC warheads. In Aim 1,
we will test the ability of auristatins to sculpt the irradiated TIME and promote immunogenic tumor control. In
Aim 2, we will test if immunotherapies potentiate radiosensitizing auristatins to achieve durable tumor control.
In Aim 3, we will test first-in-class ADCs with ATM inhibitor warheads for tissue selective radiosensitization.
Rigorously testing radiosensitizing ADCs in advanced murine models will provide rationale for moving away
from non-targeted chemo-radiotherapy toward molecularly guided precision radio-chemo-immunotherapies."
10873671,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Evidence-based obesity treatment is inaccessible to most children in the United States. This lack of access is a
source of health inequity, whereby children from rural and minority communities, who have the highest rates of
childhood obesity, are also the least likely to receive an evidence-based intervention. Developing strategies to
improve access to evidence-based obesity interventions could reduce health disparities by improving reach to
these underserved communities. The premise of this study is that using a systematic framework to adapt a
community-based behavioral intervention for childhood obesity that accounts for individual, family, and
community factors will increase reach and effectiveness among low-income, minority, and rural populations.
COACH is a multi-level obesity intervention that supports 1) the individual child through developmentally
appropriate health behavior curriculum, 2) the family by directly addressing parent weight loss and engaging
parents as agents of change for their children, and 3) the community by building the capacity of local
community centers to offer parent-child programming. COACH has been tested in a prior RCT and
demonstrated effectiveness at reducing child BMI at 1-year follow-up. We propose testing the process of
adapting COACH in a cluster-randomized trial. In Aim 1, we will conduct a community readiness assessment
for COACH in 50 community centers serving rural, minority, and low-income families in middle TN. This
assessment was developed and pilot-tested by our team and assesses barriers to study implementation in
multiple domains. In 25 randomly selected community centers, we will use a systematic process to adapt the
intervention protocol based on the assessment results, while maintaining fidelity to COACH’s core
components. In Aim 2, in a cluster-randomized trial, we will test the comparative effectiveness of each
implementation strategy (adaptation vs. original program) on the implementation outcomes of reach, adoption,
implementation, and maintenance. In Aim 3, we will test the comparative effectiveness of the adapted and
original intervention on child BMI-Z at 6-month follow-up. Children with obesity (BMI percentile ≥95th) ages 6-11
and their families (N=750; 15 index children/center) will be recruited from communities served by each center.
This research is innovative because it uses adaptation science as a potential solution to reduce health
disparities in childhood obesity. By testing this intervention in a community resource available to 230 million
Americans (community centers), we will create a scalable obesity intervention that could be implemented in
traditionally underserved populations across the country. This study will also develop and test a theory-based
process for adapting behavioral interventions for both obesity and other health outcomes among diverse rural
and urban communities. This research aligns with the NHLBI’s mission to identify the best strategies for
ensuring successful integration of evidence-based interventions within public health settings."

10752672,"The preferred vascular access for hemodialysis to treat end-stage renal disease involves using a vein
as a conduit to increase blood flow by surgically creating an arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Successful adaptation
of a venous conduit to the fistula or arterial environment requires remodeling of the vein wall without excessive
wall thickening, enabling mechanical strength to resist hemodialysis procedures that puncture the AVF wall
with large bore needles 3 times a week. However, the poor maturation and patency of AVF, especially in
women and requiring additional re-do procedures and surgery, reflects our imperfect understanding of the
biology of venous remodeling that leads to successful venous adaptation to the fistula environment. This
knowledge gap creates an unmet need for novel approaches to enhance venous remodeling and thereby to
increase successful clinical use of venous conduits.
 Using a mouse AVF model that recapitulates human AVF maturation and shows sex differences, we
have shown that both an innate immune response as well as an adaptive immune response regulate venous
remodeling. We present exciting new data that sex hormones mediate sex differences in wall thickness during
venous remodeling. In addition, we have developed the mouse model further to incorporate chronic kidney
disease (CKD) via 5/6-nephrectomy; AVF in the CKD environment show altered venous remodeling compared
with control mice and these AVF faithfully recapitulate human AVF maturation. We hypothesize that since T
cells mediate venous remodeling, modulating adaptive immunity will alter venous remodeling, thereby
improving AVF patency and ultimately fistula utilization in human patients. We will use our translationally
relevant in vivo model, an innovative tool encapsulating cyclosporine in nanoparticles for local drug delivery,
innovative methodology to analyze the immune cell composition within the AVF wall, as well as advanced next-
generation analyses using transcriptomics techniques that are available at Yale, to test our innovative
hypothesis with the following specific aims:
Aim I: Determine whether sex differences in adaptive immunity between women and men affect AVF
remodeling in vivo. Aim II: Determine whether sex hormones mediate sex differences in the immune response
during AVF remodeling in mice with CKD. Aim III: Determine whether PD-L1 expression regulates the effects
of adaptive immunity on AVF remodeling in mice with CKD.
 A successful outcome of this investigation will have lasting impact by establishing whether there is a T
cell basis underlying venous remodeling and thus manipulation of adaptive immunity is a valuable strategy for
clinical translation to enhance AVF patency. We will also determine whether reduced AVF maturation in
women is due to sex differences in adaptive immunity. We use an innovative strategy and novel tools and
models to manipulate adaptive immunity to alter venous remodeling and thereby improve AVF patency."

The cardiac inflammatory disorder myocarditis is a rare but important complication following vaccination
against COVID-19. Other than younger age and male sex, no risk factors for this adverse outcome have been
found. Recognition of host factors that predispose to vaccine-associated myocarditis (VAM) would highlight
those individuals for whom the risk of vaccination may be higher than the risk of COVID-19 infection and
should therefore avoid or alter vaccination. Furthermore, fundamental insights into the pathogenesis of this
complication and the interaction of innate cardiac immune responses with host genetics are lacking. We
previously discovered that ~16% of adults and children with idiopathic or viral myocarditis harbor rare
putatively damaging variants in a set of cardiac genes. Our findings suggest that genetically-mediated
impairments in the structural integrity of cardiomyocytes render them susceptible to injury by cardiotoxic agents
and, therefore, such variants may similarly underlie VAM. Leading a multi-institution consortium, we will recruit
50 individuals aged ≥ 5 years with VAM and perform exome sequencing to interrogate for relevant variation in
92 myocarditis-related genes, in comparison to exome sequencing of individuals with a history of
uncomplicated COVID-19 vaccination. This directed genomic approach is well-powered to identify host genetic
risk factors for VAM and enable precision risk stratification to minimize potential harms in genetically vulnerable
individuals. Additionally, we will perform multi-scale immunophenotyping via single cell RNA sequencing
(scRNA), cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF), cytokine and autoantibody assays to uncover the pathogenesis
of this condition. Comparing immune responses in those with and without susceptible genotypes will improve
understanding of VAM susceptibility and new prophylactic/treatment strategies."
10757911,"Functions of a novel suppressor of oncogenic Ras
Oncogenic Ras accounts for more than 30% of all human cancers. Ras normally controls mitogenic pathways
and functions as an on/off switch controlling cell proliferation. Heterochromatin appears to be a form of cellular
restraint in both flies and humans that oncogenic Ras has to overcome to induce cell proliferation. Many tumor
suppressors, such as Rb and BRCAs, play a role in heterochromatin formation, and an inability to form
heterochromatin formation itself permits tumorigenesis in response to oncogenic Ras. However, how
heterochromatin formation counteracts oncogenic Ras and how Ras can overcome heterochromatin-mediated
tumor suppression remain unclear. Understanding how heterochromatin counteracts oncogenic signals and
how oncogenic pathways overcome heterochromatin to induce growth and proliferation may lead to novel
epigenetic cancer therapeutics.
 To investigate the connection from oncogenic mutations to epigenetic alterations, we have used Drosophila
genetics to identify new players mediating cellular responses to oncogenic Ras, with a particular attention to
nonconventional Ras signaling components. Among the novel suppressors of oncogenic Ras, we found that
CRIF regulates both cell proliferation and heterochromatin formation. The objective of this project is to
understand the mechanism by which the putative tumor suppressor CRIF antagonizes the effects of oncogenic
Ras on cell proliferation. The long-term goal of the research is to elucidate how heterochromatin formation
functions in epigenetic tumor suppression and how oncoproteins reorganize chromatin to induce cell
proliferation and tumorigenesis. We hypothesize that CRIF counteracts oncogenic Ras by inhibiting cell
proliferation and increasing heterochromatin formation, an epigenetic tumor suppression system. In this
proposal, we plan to elucidate the molecular functions CRIF in counteracting oncogenic Ras-induced
proliferation and in heterochromatin regulation. Specifically, we will investigate how CRIF resist oncogenic Ras
in controlling proliferation, and the role of CRIF in regulating heterochromatin. Results from these studies will
break new grounds for investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the epigenetic effects of oncogenic
Ras, the role of epigenetic dysregulation in cancer development, and the role heterochromatin in tumor
suppression."
10795665,"Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi-
ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration
of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements
near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As
a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in-
complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our
ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of
our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism
of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem-
ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop
an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of
computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning
techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be-
tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position
to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion
recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane
enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction
is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our
project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad-
vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution.
The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech-
anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both
fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules."

The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the
balance of benefits vs harms of screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer's disease and
related disorders (ADRD), first published in 2014 and recently updated. Instead, the USPSTF has called for more
research, publishing a research plan in 2017 to evaluate the evidence of dementia screening. Community
detection of MCI and early ADRD may be limited due to the lack of screening tests characterizing the earliest
signs of impairment, monitoring response to interventions, correspondence to biomarkers, and the potential
benefits versus harms from screening. The inability to detect MCI and ADRD may affect eligibility determination
for care and services, and impede case ascertainment and recruitment in clinical research. In our prior 5-year
funding cycle, we asked important questions regarding (a) the best methods to screen, (b) effective of these
methods across relevant biological variables (age, sex, race, and ethnicity), (c) how measures correspond to “Gold
Standard” evaluations, and (d) what individuals do with results. Our overarching GOAL of the current proposed
investigation is to address the major challenges to improve the detection of MCI and early ADRD. We emphasize
deep phenotyping—the acquisition of multiple types of data from the same individual repeated over time from
multiple individuals. Although interested in broader MCI/ADRD detection, we leverage the amyloid, tau,
neurodegeneration (ATN) research framework to anchor this work, particularly how biomarkers and relevant
biological variables (e.g., age, sex, race, ethnicity) explain differential risk for transition across the ATN
Framework stages. To do this, we propose 3 SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) Determine population-based MCI/ADRD
prevalence in 2500 adults age 55+ enrolled in Florida Blue Cross medical insurance (total sampling frame: 5.2
million) using a novel on-line evaluation; (2) Recruit 500 individuals from Aim 1 for annual in-person
comprehensive visits with deep phenotyping to determine the accuracy of on-line evaluation against longitudinal
cognitive, fluid, genetic, MRI, and amyloid and tau PET imaging biomarkers, and evaluate the ability of baseline
measures to predict longitudinal cognitive decline and transition across NIA-AA stages and by relevant biological
variables; and (3) Define the benefits vs. harms of MCI/ADRD screening by testing improved decision-making
(advance care planning, medications), patient-centered (health-related quality of life, physical functionality,
health care utilization) and caregiver-centered outcomes (burden, strain, mood, health-related quality of life) in
the longitudinal cohort characterized in Aim 2. Our long-term goal is to increase “real world” early MCI and ADRD
detection, diagnosis, and treatment; address USPSTF Key Questions; and reduce disparities in health outcomes. This
resonates strongly with the three guiding principles of the National Alzheimer's Project Act (NAPA), especially
its third principle: “Transform the way we approach Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.”"
10808858,"SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Discovering Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers for early diagnosis, tracking of disease progression and timely
therapeutic interventions is a significant need. Despite the utility of existing neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid
biomarkers, there is an urgent need to develop cost-effective and blood-based biomarkers to apply at the
population level. Large-scale multi-omics studies identified a multitude of molecular perturbations in AD. These
discoveries support the rationale for discovery of peripheral biomarkers that capture the full spectrum of central
changes that occur in this disease. Our proposal aims to leverage combined blood and brain multi-omics data in
well-characterized cohorts to identify peripheral molecular signatures which reflect the central molecular
perturbations that occur in AD brains. We hypothesize that blood molecular signatures can serve as centrally-
linked peripheral biomarkers (CLPBM) since many brain multi-omics changes can also be observed in blood
and vice versa. As they are linked with brain molecular perturbations, such CLPBM can provide mechanistic
information on potential drivers of disease and its progression. CLPBM can also be expected to aid in patient
stratification according to biological subtypes and disease stage, ultimately paving the way for personalized
medicine. There are, however, no sizable studies that simultaneously analyze brain and blood samples from the
same individuals to discover centrally-linked peripheral molecular signatures (CLPMS) that can serve as future
centrally-linked peripheral biomarkers (CLPBM). In Project 1, we leverage three studies with complementary
strengths, Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Mayo Clinic Florida post-
mortem African American and Latino American cohorts, to accomplish our specific aims to: 1. Discover brain
region-specific CLPMS through molecular profiling (transcriptome, genome, methylome, proteome,
metabolome/lipidome) in up to 5 brain regions and in matched blood samples. 2. Identify cell-type specific
CLPMS through single nucleus transcriptome profiling across 5 brain regions and in matched blood samples. 3.
Establish CLPMS in diverse populations by profiling of same -omics measures across the same brain regions
from LA and AA participants. 4. Discover CLPMS that reflect biological subtypes and temporal progression of
AD through use of advanced analytics approaches of the molecular data. We expect to identify brain region and
cell-type specific CLPMS, which reflect the heterogeneous neuropathology in AD; associate with or drive
antemortem clinical, neuroimaging and cognitive progression and outcomes of AD; define biological subtypes
and predict molecular stage of AD in multi-ethnic populations. Findings from Project 1, together with those from
Projects 2 and 3, collectively comprising >20,000 multi-omics and >48,000 AD phenotypes from >3,700 multi-
ethnic participants will be analyzed applying our well-defined Roadmap to Translation approach to prioritize
CLPMS for translation to precision medicine biomarkers for AD. Further, the data, outcomes and knowledge
from this Project will be shared broadly and serve as an unprecedented resource for the research community."
10808861,"ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition leading to dementia. Despite intensive
efforts, there are no disease modifying therapies proven to arrest or slow the course. Numerous clinical trials
have failed due to incomplete understanding of pathophysiology, patient heterogeneity, and lack of precision in
selection strategies based on stage and other features for which widely accessible predictive biomarkers would
have a major impact. The overall goal of the U19 is to identify and validate Centrally-linked Longitudinal
pEripheral biomARkers of AD (CLEAR-AD) in multi-ethnic populations by integrating longitudinal multi-omics
and multimodal imaging and fluid endophenotypes from multiple independent cohorts. Project 2 will conduct the
first longitudinal blood-based multi-omics study of the well-characterized ADNI cohort including 4,120
biospecimens and up to 7 time points. ADNI is the only cohort study to our knowledge with whole genome
sequencing, longitudinal DNA and RNA samples, DNA methylation, metabolomics/lipidomics profiling and
proteomics, along with longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging, and fluid AD biomarkers on the same participants.
Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that we will be able to identify the relationship between
longitudinal molecular signature changes and longitudinal “A/T/N/V” (amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration, and
cerebrovascular) biomarker changes including network alterations in brain connectivity. The overarching goal of
Project 2 is to identify novel, non-invasive, centrally-linked molecular signatures that can serve as candidate
biomarkers suitable for early detection and design of tailored therapeutics supporting the future precision
medicine of AD/ADRD. A 3-Tier approach will 1) test 4 hypothesized biological pathways (immune, vascular,
myelination, synaptic integrity), 2) assess 20 additional ADRD pathways, and 3) discover novel molecular
signatures using an unbiased search and Artificial Intelligence (AI) strategies. Aim 1 is to identify molecular
signatures in peripheral blood associated with changes in cognitive status, both cross-sectionally and
longitudinally. Aim 2 will identify molecular signatures in blood associated with changes in A/T/N/V AD
biomarkers, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Aim 3 will assess the ability of multi-omics based molecular
profiling at baseline and over time to predict future disease progression. Aim 4 will replicate and validate ADNI
findings using blood- and brain tissue-based data (with Project 1) and data from multiethnic populations including
African- and Latino- American ancestry (with Project 3). Project 2 will employ an integrative translational
approach supported by the U19 Cores, combining longitudinal clinical, multi-omics, and AD biomarker data,
including advanced neuroimaging, to enable deeper mechanistic insights into the molecular basis of AD and to
identify new potential therapeutic targets and biomarker strategies. These outcomes directly support the
NIA/NAPA goal of precision medicine for AD/ADRD."
10899412,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Prostate cancer is a significant worldwide health problem for which new treatments are needed. The goal
of our laboratory for the past twenty years has been to develop immunotherapy treatments for prostate cancer.
We have evaluated multiple cancer-associated proteins as anti-tumor vaccine targets and have focused recent
efforts on the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor (AR LBD) as a target. We demonstrated that a
DNA vaccine encoding the AR LBD (pTVG-AR) can elicit epitope-specific cytolytic CD8+ T cells in HLA-A2
transgenic mice, and immunization of prostate tumor-bearing mice elicited anti-tumor responses and significantly
prolonged their overall survival. Based on these results, we recently completed a multi-center phase I clinical
trial using the pTVG-AR vaccine for patients with metastatic prostate cancer and demonstrated that vaccination
is safe and immunologically active. Consistent with our preclinical studies, the development of T-cell immune
response to the AR LBD was associated with a prolonged time to castration resistance.
 In preclinical studies, we have found that androgen deprivation (AD) leads to overexpression of the AR
protein in prostate cancer cells, and this in turn makes them more recognized by CD8+ T cells activated by AR-
targeted vaccination. We have subsequently demonstrated that AD can thus be used strategically with
immunization. In other preclinical studies, we have further found that CD8+ T cells activated by vaccination
express multiple immune checkpoint receptors (ICR), and that blockade of certain ICR with vaccination leads to
greater anti-tumor effects.
 Together, these findings have led to the hypothesis to be tested in this proposal that combined AD, with
AR-targeted vaccination and T-cell checkpoint blockade, will lead to increased tumor-specific CD8+ T cell
infiltration, tumor eradication, and persistent immune memory. We will use relevant murine models of prostate
cancer to conduct a mechanistic evaluation of the effects of AD with vaccination and ICR blockade on the
development of T cell memory and antigen spread. This approach will also be evaluated in an investigator-
initiated clinical trial in patients with high-risk prostate cancer prior to prostatectomy, with a design amenable to
modification of study arms depending on the outcomes from the preclinical studies. This proposal, consequently,
capitalizes on development of a novel anti-tumor vaccine that has now completed phase I clinical trial evaluation,
and explores methods to increase its therapeutic effect in preclinical models and in a biomarker-driven clinical
trial. Results from this proposal will identify optimal strategies and clinical scenarios for further clinical
development of this treatment approach."
10899413,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Development of treatment resistance is the main reason for disease progression in patients with mCRPC. What
is under-appreciated is that many patients who are experiencing progression have the majority of individual
lesions that continue to respond to therapy. Identification of resistant lesions would allow for administration of
localized ablative therapies, especially if the systemic therapy is still effective for the majority of metastases.
We hypothesize that selective treatment of resistant lesions (e.g. with stereotactic body radiation therapy) will
extend duration of clinical benefit in men with mCRPC. We will identify resistant lesions by employing our unique
advanced quantitative molecular image analytics - Quantitative Total Extensible Imaging (QTxI) which allows
lesion-level assessment of treatment dynamics. We will test our hypothesis through the following aims: (1) To
characterize resistance at early progression in men with mCRPC treated with second-generation androgen-
signaling inhibitors by employing QTxI of PET/CT starting at nadir PSA response, PSA progression, and again
in 12 weeks, (2) To conduct virtual selective radio-ablation study using different PET metrics for target lesion
selection of resistant lesions and to model impact of radio-ablation on total tumor burden and anticipated
improvement in clinical benefit and (3) To test clinical feasibility of radio-ablation using SBRT to selective
resistant lesions in a prospective therapeutic clinical trial.
This project is highly innovative as it explores lesion-level treatment resistance in mCRPC, uniquely
characterized by our technology, as a treatment target. Assessment of resistance at the time of clinical
progression is critical, as it triggers high anxiety in the patient and provider, and thus it is an urgent area of unmet
clinical need. We will conduct the first trial of its kind to identify and treat resistant lesions in the setting of wide-
spread metastatic disease with the goal of improving clinical benefit."
10894596,"Project Summary – Project 4 Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
A prominent feature of multiple myeloma (MM) and other malignancies is significant genomic instability leading
to clonal evolution and disease progression. We have previously described the mutational landscape in multiple
myeloma (MM) and shown that the number of mutations correlates with overall and event free survival in MM. In
the current funding period, using deep WGS, we investigated 183 newly diagnosed patients with MM and
demonstrated a significant variability in mutational load in MM. Moreover, all MM subgroups had activated
mutational signatures indicative of homologous recombination (HR) and NER dysfunction as a prominent late
mutational process, whereas APOBEC signature is activated in the intermediate phase of disease progression
in high-risk MM. Importantly, a subgroup with low DNA damage had a superior outcome. Our recent studies also
demonstrate the acquisition of significantly higher number of mutations at relapse following high-dose therapy
compared to RVD (a 3-drug standard-dose combination) and identify HR dysfunction as a prominent underlying
mechanism. These observations are also consistent with our previous data which show that HR is dysregulated
and significantly contributes to genomic instability and development of drug resistance in MM. Investigating the
mechanisms underlying genomic evolution, we have also identified a kinase gene signature impacting DNA
repair (especially HR) and genome stability in cancer cells including MM. We further demonstrate that PDZ
Binding Kinase (PBK), a member of this signature, impacts DNA repair and genome stability in MM cells through
direct phosphorylation of DNA repair genes and that of a transcription factor FOXM1, which regulates major DNA
repair pathways. Based on these and other data, we hypothesize that MM genome is defined by complex clonal
architecture that drives the disease at diagnosis and evolves further at relapse and it is mediated by dysregulated
DNA repair and related genes. Towards this goal, we will investigate myeloma cell clonal complexity at diagnosis
and relapse and their impact on outcome (Specific Aim 1); functionally validate PDZ Binding Kinase (PBK) for
its impact on MM cell clonal evolution, growth and survival (Specific Aim 2); and evaluate PBK inhibitors, alone
and in combination with existing MM drugs, in vitro and in murine models of MM (Specific Aim 3). This study
will improve our understanding of mechanisms which contribute to genetic instability, clonal evolution and
progression in MM and will identify novel targets and therapeutic strategies to inhibit growth and prevent/delay
evolution of the disease."
10843726,"ABSTRACT Analysis Core
The overarching goal of the Analysis Core is to ensure the success of the MOST4 projects by providing an
outstanding data analytic service for analysis plan management, advising on appropriate methodologic
approaches, and implementation of high quality analyses. The Analysis Core will provide analytic support for the
three major scientific projects in this grant cycle that address key gaps in knowledge in osteoarthritis (OA). This
core will institute a process to ensure that rigorous and high quality study design and analytic methods will be
instituted in MOST projects and studies, which will be critical for making valid inferences. The MOST Study has
made major contributions to our understanding of the course of knee OA, largely due to the sophisticated
analyses applied to the comprehensive data collected over the prior three funded cycles of MOST. The specific
aims of the Analysis Core are as follows: 1) Provide detailed critical reviews of analysis plans to ensure that
appropriate and high quality methods are used to ensure rigor and reproducibility of findings; 2) Develop detailed
operational procedures with the Executive Committee to incorporate overall MOST4 study dissemination
priorities and help ensure Project leads meet internal and external deadlines; 3) Conduct all analyses for MOST4-
approved analysis plans using state-of-the-art methods that address unique statistical issues encountered in OA
research and in MOST; 4) Provide ongoing education and training to MOST analysts and investigators to enable
projects that rely on imaging and/or multidimensional data (e.g., Project 3: Mineralization) to take advantage of
current and evolving methods in advanced analytic techniques including machine learning and visualization. By
implementing high quality methods with standardized policies and procedures, the Analysis Core will efficiently
manage a large number of analyses in an efficient, rigorous, and transparent manner to contribute to the scientific
insights that will be made possible by the vast and rich data collection planned in MOST4."
10852813,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Developing novel polytherapies for Non-Clear Cell Renal Carcinoma
 Non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (NCCRCC) is the therapeutic outlier in kidney cancer because there
are no approved treatments for these patients. Consequently, diverse treatments that are currently given to
NCCRCC patients result in variable, incomplete and short-lived responses, contributing to a dismal 5-year
survival rate of just 8%. Accordingly, the lack of mechanistically-guided therapies to treat NCCRCC is a critical
unmet need in cancer treatment. We recently reported that a therapeutic approach combining JAK and AKT
inhibitors (JAK-AKT) potently extinguished both signaling pathways to restrain NCCRCC tumor growth, with good
tolerability1. However, despite effective inhibition of critical growth, survival and bypass signals, we did not
achieve deep tumor regressions. Consequently, metabolic and transcriptomic profiling of JAK-AKT treated
NCCRCC cells and patient tumors revealed that while the co-treatment inhibited glycolysis with decreases in
glucose consumption and lactate production, it also paradoxically induced phospholipid hydrolysis with release
of free fatty acids within 24 hours to meet their bioenergetic needs, therefore enabling their survival. We have
termed this rapidly emergent non-mutational metabolic survival adaptation: treatment-induced
metabolic reprogramming (TIMR).
 Here, we now show that TIMR is associated with increased mitochondrial mass and respiration.
Importantly, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration synergizes with JAK-AKT inhibitors to cause tumor regressions
in vivo. Further, JAK-AKT induced TIMR in cells and patient tumors promotes phospholipid hydrolysis, with
subsequent release of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as arachidonic acid and linoleic acid in NCCRCC
cells and treated patient tumors, establishing the clinical relevance of our findings. We observed that the increase
in PUFAs enhanced lipid peroxidation, causing increased sensitivity to glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) inhibition
and ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic regulated cell death program. Taken together, co-targeting TIMR and JAK-
AKT was synthetically lethal in NCCRCC tumors in cells and mouse models.
 Therefore, the long-term goal of this new research proposal is to improve the outcomes for patients with
NCCRCC by leveraging the momentum of our findings into mechanistically guided new combination treatment
strategies. Accordingly, our objective now is to identify the mechanisms regulating TIMR, and to provide proof-
of-concept that targeting TIMR is a valuable therapeutic strategy in NCCRCC. Our central hypothesis is that
TIMR enables cancer cells to adapt and survive anti-cancer therapies by hijacking metabolic processes, and that
these vulnerabilities can be therapeutically exploited. We will test this hypothesis in the following specific aims:
Aim 1: Determining the extent to which inhibition of mitochondrial respiration enhances the effect of JAK-AKT
inhibitors in NCCRCC.
Aim 2: Establish the therapeutic effect of inducing ferroptosis in the setting of JAK-AKT inhibition."
10764220,"Abstract
Internationally, hypertension is the leading single risk factor for mortality. However, in more than 90% of
hypertensive patients, the cause is unknown. There is a critical need to understand the mechanisms behind
the origins of hypertension to enable the development of new therapies. Connecting tubule-glomerular
feedback (CNTGF) is an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)-dependent kidney feedback mechanism that
facilitates sodium excretion under certain physiological situations by inducing vasodilation. It has been
previously demonstrated that amino acids, mediated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAr), can
induce renal vasodilation. The NMDAr-induced vasodilation mechanism is unknown. Dr. Romero’s long-term
objectives are to explore the consequences of impaired vasodilation in the kidney as a cause of hypertension
and develop a program to thoroughly understand some of the causes of human hypertension. The main
hypothesis is that the mechanisms of NMDAr-mediated vasodilation and CNTGF are closely related and that
impairments of these biological pathways induce hypertension. The hypothesis will be addressed through the
following specific aims. AIM I: To determine the mechanism of NMDAr-induced renal vasodilation. We will
evaluate the role of NMDAr in CNTGF-induced vasodilation in vitro using microperfusion, and in-vivo using
NMDAr NR2C null mice. Aim II: To determine the mechanism by which NMDAr interacts with ENaC.
Using tubule microperfusion, electrophysiology, confocal imaging techniques, and proteoteomic approaches,
we will explore the molecular signaling associated with the interaction between NMDAr and ENaC which
induces the vasodilation. Aim III: To test the effect of NMDAr on blood pressure and renal
hemodynamics. We will evaluate the role of NMDA on blood pressure and renal hemodynamics by treating
ENaC channel gain-in-function mice (Liddle syndrome) with NMDAr inhibitors. The objective and hypothesis of
this proposal align with those of the NHLBI that promote the prevention and treatment of heart and blood
diseases by stimulating basic discoveries about the causes of diseases. Dr. Romero’s development plan
during these funding years include: 1) Increasing his research experience by consolidating the microperfusion
technique and exploring two new areas relating to electrophysiology and proteomics while expanding his
critical thinking and laboratory management skills; 2) Increasing his teaching and mentoring experience; 3)
Further developing his communication skills and publication record. Dr. Romero will be guided by Dr. Wall as a
principal mentor as well as Dr. Eaton and Dr. Hoover as a co-mentors. In addition, an advisory committee will
be supporting the development of this plan. Dr. Romero’s career goal is to be an independently funded
principal investigator in a highly ranked U.S. university to study renal hemodynamics and tubular transport
interactions and their roles in hypertension. This career development plan will be performed entirely at Emory
University, GA, USA."
10845670,"Psychiatry is a fertile medical specialty for translational research and physician-scientists bring a
unique perspective to research through the blend of clinical and research experiences. Physician scientists
are uniquely poised to bridge the gap between basic neurobiology and clinical disease and excel as leaders
in translational research in psychiatry. However, the pipeline of physician scientists in psychiatry is in
danger. The number and proportion of clinically trained physicians (MD or MD/PhD) who remain involved
in research after residency has decreased substantially. Residency training is a critical period that can
“make or break” a research career. Years of clinical training without adequate protected research time
between pre-residency research training and residency graduation often result in a decline in research
skills and psychiatry residency graduates often need to retrain in research skills, delaying the transition to
independent research. Together with high indebtedness and low funding rates, this results in few
psychiatrists applying for K or R01 Awards after residency training.
 Our proposed R25 program aims to train the next generation of psychiatrists-scientists during the
critical period of psychiatry residency, to equip them to conduct translational research in psychiatry and
accelerate the launch of independent research careers. Our program will help trainees acquire research
skills and pilot data to obtain a career development (K) award. We will provide ample research protected
time and coursework organized based on an Individual Development Plan. This training, coupled with
outstanding mentoring and networking opportunities, grant writing seminars and an internal K award review
process, will prepare promising physician scientists and help accelerate the launch of productive,
independent careers in translational psychiatry research.
 Mount Sinai is the ideal place for this R25 program because of the strength of our Departments of
Psychiatry, Neuroscience and Genetics/Genomics, which have been among the top departments
nationwide in NIH funding over the past years, and have a wealth of potential mentors, including 123 NIH-
funded PIs. Our exponential success in research accomplishments and funding is the result of a focused
institutional effort to support physician-scientists and translational research. As an example of our
commitment to recruitment, training and retention of physician-scientists, we have retained or recruited
back over 50% of the graduates from our pilot physician-scientist training program."

As the number of older people increases worldwide, the need for scientists and clinicians in aging research is
greater than ever with a critical need for interdisciplinary research on diseases and disabilities that affect a
more diverse older population. The objective of years 26-30 of this successful training program is to continue
training 5 pre- and 4 post-doctoral fellows to conduct independent and innovative original research in the
epidemiology of aging, with an emphasis on the prevention of late life disability and functional decline and the
maximization of function in those with existing disabilities and disabling conditions. The program emphasizes
four broad substantive areas in which program faculty have gerontologic research experience and are
conducting ongoing projects: musculoskeletal epidemiology; neuroepidemiology; genetic epidemiology and
genomics; and pharmacoepidemiology.
The program prepares trainees to: 1) participate in an interdisciplinary research team under supervision of a
primary mentor expert in the epidemiology of aging and secondary mentors expert in epidemiology methods
and/or biostatistics, gerontology, and content areas relevant to trainee research; 2) develop a research
question, articulate hypotheses, and design and perform an epidemiologic study; 3) become expert in one
substantive area relevant to the prevention of disability and functional decline; 4) demonstrate excellence in the
conduct of independent, innovative research; 5) gain experience in the presentation of research results, using
written, visual, and oral formats; 6) integrate a core curriculum in epidemiology, gerontology, and biostatistics;
7) master the principles of responsible conduct of research and scientific rigor and reproducibility; 8) apply
epidemiology of aging methods within clinical contexts; and 9) be prepared for the transition to a research
career in academia, government, industry, or non-profit sector using capabilities in the epidemiology of aging.
The program is located within the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health (EPH) of the University of
Maryland School of Medicine. Major program strengths include: 1) expert faculty in epidemiology of aging,
gerontology, biostatistics, and other substantive areas; 2) interdisciplinary training and research opportunities
in aging and related areas; 3) graduate training opportunities including advanced coursework through the four
supporting doctoral programs; 4) increased training of clinician scientists; 5) commitment to fostering inclusive
training; and 6) ability to capitalize on Baltimore/Washington corridor to leverage resources across multiple
domains (academia, government, industry, and non-profit). The highly qualified faculty and rich training
environment of our program are uniquely suited to provide this interdisciplinary approach needed to train the
next generation of scholars with a commitment to epidemiology of aging to find the solutions required to
improve the quality of life for older persons. The MPIs bring complementary expertise essential to the success
of the program; each has over 20 years of experience in interdisciplinary research, education, and mentorship."

Penn State MSTP Training Program: Recruiting, Retaining, and Training Physician-Scientists
Penn State College of Medicine
Co-Program Directors: Robert Levenson, PhD and Leslie Parent, MD;
Overview: This T32 proposal is a new application for MSTP funding for the Penn State MD/PhD program. Led
by experienced researchers, physician-scientists, and educators, the MSTP Program will train physician-
scientists to conduct innovative, rigorous biomedical research. Physician-scientists, by virtue of their combined
research and clinical training, play a unique role in generating new discoveries and are essential for translating
these discoveries into interventions that improve health. The number of physician-scientists entering the
workforce, however, has decreased in recent years. The proposed MSTP is needed to contribute
knowledgeable and skilled physician-scientists who can expand the biomedical research workforce.
Measurable Objectives & Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the proportion of students who graduate
to careers with a research focus. Secondary measures include students’ research output (peer-reviewed
abstracts and publications; submitted and awarded grants), trainee retention, and diversity-specific metrics.
Process-level measures will include repeated assessments of mentorship and training quality/impact, clinical
and research skills through surveys of students and mentors, and post-graduate surveys. This MSTP provides
an intellectually rich and nurturing environment with committed, diverse, experienced, collaborative faculty,
leveraging the PD’s prior successful T32 leadership, educational, and research expertise.
Project Accomplishment: This five-year proposal will support the training of 44 NIH-funded MSTP students
with planned one year appointments, primarily during the preclinical curriculum years. The MSTP will ensure
the training of diverse students for the conduct of rigorous, high-quality research through an integrated
curriculum, including coursework, seminars, workshops and individually mentored research.
Training Plan: The MSTP is guided by three curricular tenets: (1) basic and translational research; (2)
experiential learning; and (3) active mentorship from training faculty for career development. The MSTP
synergizes with institutional partners, including the Clinical and Translational Science Institute, Woodward
Center for Excellence in Health Sciences Education, Institute for Personalized Medicine, Neuroscience
Institute, and Cancer Institute. The MSTP also partners with robust graduate programs: Biomedical Sciences,
Neuroscience; Bioinformatics and Genomics; Molecular and Cellular Integrative Biosciences; Engineering
Sciences and Mechanics; and Anthropology. By integrating clinical and research training over the entire course
of the program, we aim to provide trainees with the skills to transition seamlessly between medical and
graduate school, preparing them to enter the biomedical workforce as rigorously trained physician-scientists."

10794292,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall goal of the BCM-CARBIRU is to explore non-antibiotic therapeutic approaches to
combating antibiotic resistant bacterial pathogens that are deemed urgent and serious threats. To
meet this goal, the establishment of the Microbial and Phage Cultivation (MPC) core will provide to
the projects the ability to cultivate bacteria and phage in multiple formats and under different
atmospheric conditions. The core will also provide sequencing support of newly identified bacteria
and phage that emerge from each of the three projects. The MPC organized around three primary
objectives.
Objective 1. Cultivation of complex microbial communities and individual microbes.
Objective 2. Isolation and optimization of bacteriophage for AMR pathogens.
Objective 3. Sequencing of individual microbes, phage and complex microbial communities.
Centralization of these objectives into the MPC core will reduce costs by allowing all of the projects
access to the infrastructure (such as anaerobic and microoxic chambers), bulk purchasing of
reagents, and the reduction in labor costs by having dedicated technicians to assist in generation of
bacteria and phage. The MPC will facilitate the transfer of expertise in microbial and phage
cultivation from the core to trainees from all three projects. Finally, a centralized resource for
sequencing of bacteria and phage will allow more coordination between the projects in regard to
genomic analysis and data integration. The MPC will be an essential part of the BCM-CARBIRU that,
along with the Organoid Cultivation Core, will help achieve the overall goals proposed."
10794297,"Project Summary
The human mucosal surface is a complex ecosystem made of bacteria, viruses, epithelial cells,
mucus, and molecules such as proteins, sugars, and other solutes whose balance is key to the
health of the host. It is also the first line of defense against invading bacteria, and a site of
colonization by diverse microbiota. Some members of this microbiota, termed pathobionts,
cause serious local and systemic infections. However, the use of antibiotics to treat these
infections is a classic Catch-22; there may temporary relief but down the road the very solution
generates a bigger version of the original problem. Whereas one may rid the environment of the
pathobiont, one also eliminates the beneficial microbiota that antagonize the pathobiont while
creating a selection that further increases rates of resistance. In addition, the destruction of the
balance of the ecosystem further predisposes that system to invasion by other pathobionts, and,
in the long run, increases the risk of infection and inflammation. There is a real need to develop
an alternative line of antibacterials that lack these limitations.
 The overall objective of this project is to discover bacteriophage, viruses that infect and kill
bacteria, that are specifically active against drug-resistant pathobionts in the complex
environment of a human mucosal surface. These phage should be specific for their bacterial
target, as well as have evolved features that promote enhanced activity in the face of the
complexity presented by such surfaces. Furthermore, should the pathobiont spread
systemically, these phage should synergize with conventional antibiotics while simultaneously
generating a steep evolutionary path for the emergence of new resistance. Using one of the
world’s largest collections of therapeutic phages and characterizing them for enhanced activity
in human mucosal biomimetics, the research program described here lays the foundation for the
development of a novel class of mucosal-active antibacterials that clear problematic pathobionts
while simultaneously maintaining balance of the native microbiota."
10794307,"Project Summary
Before the discovery of antibiotics, infectious diseases were the three leading causes of death in the United
States and constituted nearly 50% of the deaths annually. Today only one infectious disease, pneumonia, is
among the top 10 causes of death in the US, largely due to the success of antibiotics in treating bacterial
infections. Unfortunately, the public health benefits provided by antibiotics are at serious risk due to the
emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria, an inevitable consequence of the evolutionary pressure exerted on
bacteria by these drugs. Eventually the bacterial pathogens we hope to keep at bay will become resistant to all
clinically relevant antibiotics, plunging humans back into a pre-antibiotic world in which infectious disease is the
leading cause of death. Therefore, we need to find innovative, and rapidly implementable, ways to reduce or
supplement antibiotics to preserve their utility in controlling bacterial infections. Many bacterial pathogens,
termed pathobionts, reside within the human microbiota in the absence of disease and only instigate
pathogenesis after disruption of the microbial community driven by abrupt environmental changes such as acute
inflammation. While there is general acceptance that the commensal microbes provide pathogen colonization
resistance and suppression of pathobiont virulence in a healthy state, the mechanistic understanding for how
they provide these benefits is lacking. In this project, we explore using the human microbiome to identify
ecological principles that allow for the design and implementation of microbial communities that suppress
bacterial pathogens. We have selected Clostridioides difficile and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) as
the two main pathogens to study as they are deemed antibiotic resistance threats by the CDC and necessitate
millions of antibiotic prescriptions each year. Even with antibiotic treatment, recurrent infections with both of
these pathogens is common, and there is currently a lack of long-lasting preventative strategies. Using a novel
method to simplify human microbiome communities and advanced in vitro human tissue culture and humanized
murine models, we seek to identify key microbial consortia for suppressing these pathogens. We ultimately
expect to optimize a small number of defined microbial communities that can be used to eradicate or prevent
these infections in people."
10794318,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Project 3
The overall objective and significance of Project 3 is to generate preclinical validation of nasal microbiota-based
therapeutics to block nasal colonization by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our
innovative approach to achieve this is to cultivate human nasal bacteria on human nasal organoids. Together,
S. aureus and S. pneumoniae account for 39% of cases and 29% of deaths attributed to antibiotic-resistant
bacteria in the U.S. Nasal colonization is the primary source of invasive infection by each and the reservoir for
their transmission; blocking colonization reduces both infection and transmission. Lacking effective vaccines
against S. aureus or nonvaccine serotypes of S. pneumoniae, there is an urgent need for new nonantibiotic
approaches to prevent infections by both. Current therapies for nasal decolonization of S. aureus depend on a
topical antibiotic and are temporally correlated with rising antibiotic resistance. Here, we address a gap in
knowledge in how to repopulate with pathobiont-resistant microbiota to improve long-term outcomes. Multiple
nasal microbiota studies report benign bacterial species present when adults are free of S. aureus and when
children are free of S. pneumoniae. For example, nasal colonization by the benign bacterium Dolosigranulum
pigrum, often with harmless Corynebacterium, is associated with the absence of S. pneumoniae in children. In
adults, D. pigrum is inversely associated with S. aureus nasal colonization. Our preliminary data indicate many
strains of D. pigrum inhibit S. aureus growth in vitro. Also, cocultivation of D. pigrum with Corynebacterium
pseudodiphtheriticum robustly inhibits S. pneumoniae growth in vitro, versus either alone. Moreover,
Corynebacterium enhance D. pigrum growth. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that reproducible consortia of
benign human nasal bacteria can confer colonization resistance to S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, preventing
infection by and transmission of these antibiotic-resistant threats. Moreover, antipathobiont mucosal-active lytic
phage may augment this. Networks of interactions underpin microbiota composition. Relying on consortia avoids
the risk of unexpected community interactions that can occur when adding a single strain and increases the
likelihood of successful repopulation with a desired community. A major hurdle to clinical trials is to identify fully
defined consortia of benign nasal bacterial strains that confer colonization resistance in the context of human
nasal epithelium and promote a healthy, intact epithelial barrier. Our Organoid Cultivation Core has successfully
generated human airway organoids. Thus, we will overcome this hurdle using advances in nasal epithelial
organoids combined with our expertise in cultivating human nasal bacteria and identifying molecular mechanisms
of interactions within nasal microbiota. With methods routinely used by us, Project 1 and the Organoid Cultivation
Core, we will achieve two aims: identify and characterize reproducible human nasal microbial consortia to 1)
protect nasal epithelium from colonization by S. aureus/S. pneumoniae and 2) to promote epithelial barrier
integrity and block epithelial invasion by S. aureus/S. pneumoniae in vitro, and identify underlying mechanisms."
10784767,"Project Summary
The purpose of this grant is to study a model of mental health navigation for African American
and Latinx children in high poverty urban communities focused on reducing key parental
attitudinal barriers to care. Reducing persistent racial and ethnic disparities in children’s mental
health is a national priority and patient navigation is a highly promising approach that is rarely
used in children’s mental health services. The study will examine the effectiveness of two types
of navigators: paraprofessionals (PP) who have strong community knowledge, and case
managers (CM) who are formally trained. The study will examine specific mechanisms of
navigator effectiveness in children’s mental health and compare the two types of navigators to
provide a rigorous test of the proposed mechanisms. The knowledge gained from this
application may be important to reducing disparities and employing the workforce best suited to
navigation in the community mental health system. Two community boards, one focused on
identifying factors important to supporting navigators at the agencies, and the other focused on
implications for state and federal policy, will meet annually with the goal of identifying key
findings with the potential to influence local, state, and national priorities for children’s mental

10806227,"Complexities in treating breast cancer (BCa) with bone metastasis are aggravated by a vicious protumorigenic
pathology involving a shift in skeletal homeostasis towards aggressive osteoclast activity and polarization of
myeloid cells, favoring M2 macrophage (MФ) and myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) accumulation as key
mediators of immunosuppression. In addition to the tumor cells, protumorigenic myeloid cells contribute to the
cascade by expressing checkpoint ligands, blunting antitumor functions of effector T cells. Hence, a better
understanding of key signaling mechanisms that alter skeletal and immune homeostasis towards protumorigenic
functions will enable the designing of new combination therapies targeting this biphasic effect. In this pursuit, we
have identified that in addition to robust activation of osteoclast precursors, receptor activator of nuclear factor
kappa-Β ligand (RANKL) plays an important role as an osteoimmune link in MФ polarization and programmed
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. We identified that elevated RANKL from BCa cells induce paracrine effects
on differentiation of monocytes to immunosuppressive M2 MФ in a spatiotemporal manner. Preliminary studies
presented in this application indicate that whereas RANKL canonical autocrine signaling via RANK activates a
feed-forward loop in BCa cells, non-canonical RANKL signaling enhances PD-L1 expression in M2 MФ and
MDSCs via the leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein coupled receptor (Lgr4).
 Based on our published and preliminary findings, the overarching goal of this proposal is to expand our
understanding on the pleiotropic mechanisms of RANKL in BCa immunosuppression and bone damage, and to
test the potential of combining a novel osteoprotegerin (OPG) cell therapy without interfering in TNF-related
apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) function, with checkpoint blockade and chemotherapies, to reverse tumor-
associated pathology in the immune and skeletal systems. We recently adopted a protein structure-based
engineering approach and identified a critical domain on OPG for TRAIL binding and successfully developed
and validated in vivo an OPG variant (OPGY49R) that retains RANKL binding, but lacks TRAIL binding. Preliminary
studies, directly comparing a cell-based, single-application OPGY49R treatment with multiple applications of a
neutralizing RANKL mAb therapy indicated systemically stable levels of OPGY49R from a single injection and a
significant decrease in CD8+ T cell exhaustion, compared to RANKL mAb treatment. More importantly, OPGY49R
greatly decreased metastasis of primary tumors in vivo, demonstrating its potential advantage over the RANKL
mAb, denosumab, which failed to delay bone metastasis or disease recurrence in patients with high-risk early-
stage BCa in a recent international double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled, phase 3 study (D-CARE).
This proposal will test this novel, biologically driven combination therapy approach by using immunocompetent
mouse models of BCa, as applicable to both pre-metastatic and metastatic disease."
10815701,"Project Abstract/Summary.
T cells are unique in their requirement for two activation signals to become functional. This separation of
powers between the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptors, such as CD28, allows exquisite regulation of T
cell responses. In recent years, T cell co-receptors have emerged as valuable targets of immunotherapy for
autoimmune diseases and cancer. In autoimmunity blocking activating co-receptors can reduce the destructive
effects of T cells on normal tissue, while in cancer blocking inhibitory co-receptors can activate a T cell
response against malignant cells. However, co-receptor targeted immunotherapy often fails to produce desired
results. Moreover, there remain large gaps in knowledge of how co-receptors coordinate the myriad cellular
changes that allow T-cells to gain functional properties. The project proposed in this grant application will
explore a novel mechanism by which T cell co-receptors coordinate changes in RNA maturation important for
T-cells to generate sufficient numbers and make key molecules that allow them to kill other cells. These killer
properties underlie the ability of T cells to contain infectious diseases and control tumor growth or to damage
healthy tissue in autoimmune diseases. Preliminary studies provide evidence that CD28 signaling coordinates
many changes in alternative splicing of newly made RNAs through effects on the RNA binding protein ARS2.
Alternative splicing allows one gene to code for several different proteins by changing how the RNA produced
from that gene is assembled. We find that in activated T cells CD28-ARS2 dependent alternative splicing of the
mRNA coding for metabolic enzyme pyruvate kinase favors production of an isoform, known as PKM2, with
known proliferation promoting properties. Proposed studies seek to 1) determine if alternative splicing to PKM2
induces changes in how T cells use nutrients to fuel proliferation, 2) examine how ARS2 regulates alternative
splicing in T cells, and 3) establish CD28 regulated changes in alternative splicing as potential modulators of
immunotherapy. The long-term goals of these studies are to understand how RNA binding proteins and RNA
maturation shapes gene expression during the process of T-cell activation and to determine if such
mechanisms of gene regulation can be therapeutically targeted to alter T-cell function in patients with cancer or
autoimmune diseases."

CAR T-cells have revolutionized the treatment of pediatric leukemia. However, ~50% of responsive patients
eventually relapse and in ~50-70% of patients, this therapy induces devastating side effects (i.e. neurotoxicity
(NTX) and cytokine release syndrome (CRS)), potentially leading to long term neurological damage and death.
There are no clinical biomarkers to predict survival or toxicity despite a crucial need. SCRI has made a substantial
investment in CAR T therapy and is a world leader in pediatric CAR T cell clinical trials. This proposed project
will build upon this program by helping to predict and mitigate the devastating, life-threatening side effects caused
by this revolutionary therapy and may aide in the prediction of non-response cases. Data from our pilot
experiments utilizing samples from patients on CAR-T trials at SCRI suggests that pre-monocyte activation
status and cytokine profiles from the monocyte fraction of a patient can predict CAR T toxicity across both blood
and solid tumors, in particular we see trends in the IL-18- IFN𝛾𝛾 axis. We plan to act on this encouraging pilot
data in this proposal to develop a series of validated monocytic biomarkers (cytokine, flow and transcriptional)
and machine learning algorithms which can be utilized prior to patients going on trial in order to save time and
resources for patients who are set to fail treatment and allow medical teams to be more prepared to mitigate
toxicity in those who are more prone to it. The proposal further expands to the development a humanized mouse
model that can adopt the healthy donor and pediatric patient immune systems recapturing natural variability in
human immunity to investigate causality of the IL-18- IFN𝛾𝛾 axis in driving both therapeutic toxicity. The project
combines existing but unused large bank of SCRI CAR T patient samples/data with monocytic omics profiling to
develop predictive biomarkers for therapeutic toxicity (AIM 1). We aim to further extend the impact of this work
to mechanistically understand why certain patients’ cells are working against them through the use of novel
humanized mouse models (AIM2). This is built upon to develop therapeutics or strategies to improve safety and
efficacy of CAR-T treatments. Importantly, our team of experts in clinical CAR T (Dr. Rebecca Gardner, Dr. Navin
Pinto), machine learning (Dr. Bobbie-Jo Webb-Robertson), humanized mice (Dr. James Keck), and myeloid
tumor biology (Dr. Heather Gustafson) pose this grant for optimal success."

Label to Table: New Insights into Supermarket Food Labeling is a comprehensive, real-world evaluation of
nutrition labeling policies and programs that impact all Americans who purchase food. Nutrition labeling provides
information on food and beverage nutrients and healthfulness and is intended to help individuals compare
products and make healthier dietary choices. The study will use supermarket transaction data, an experiment in
a naturalistic online supermarket, and surveys of shoppers’ experiences while shopping in supermarkets to
determine whether and how these labeling programs improve the nutritional quality of purchases. We will
evaluate two nutrition labels: 1) the Nutrition Facts Label, a nutrient-based label mandated for all packaged
goods sold in the US, that was updated in 2016 and required to be implemented by 2021, and 2) Guiding Stars,
a shelf-tag labeling system identifying healthy foods with 1 to 3 stars that is used in nearly 2000 US supermarkets
and was revised in 2021.
In the first two Aims of the project, we will use comprehensive transaction data linked to nutritional information
from a supermarket chain located in five Northeastern US states with nearly 12 million transactions monthly.
These data, available from 2016 to 2023, will allow us to evaluate the implementation of the new Nutrition Facts
Label and updates to the Guiding Stars labeling system. In Aim 3, we will explore an expansion of Guiding Stars
to include labels of both healthier and unhealthier foods and beverages in a virtual supermarket study of 3100
individuals, followed by an evaluation of these expanded labels in two actual supermarkets. In Aim 4, we will
enroll 3000 shoppers who participate in a national consumer panel and use novel technologies to track when
they have shopped and survey them about their use of labels while shopping for different products. Having real-
time data will allow us to investigate whether use of labels is associated with healthier choices and if this
relationship differs by the race, ethnicity, education, and household income of shoppers. We also will conduct
detailed interviews with 30 of these shoppers to learn more about their experiences shopping and using labels,
with a focus on social and cultural factors that influence supermarket purchases and use of labels. This study
will be one of the first to use real-world data to investigate these labels and will use innovative methods and
technologies. Because of the expansive nature of this evaluation, we expect that results will help inform
policymakers, retailers, and manufacturers regarding how labels can improve the diet quality of Americans."

Society needs effective non-operative therapies to manage chronic knee symptoms (CKS)
resulting from knee osteoarthritis (KOA). CKS is associated with pain, loss of independence,
and increased mortality. Rates of CKS are increasing, fueled by an aging, obese, and sedentary
society. Because CKS first presents in working age adults, it is a major cause of work disability
and work productivity loss. Over 13 million US adults 45 years and older have symptomatic
KOA and CKS,1 and one-third of working adults (45-64 years) have arthritis.2-4 Of those with
KOA, over half have severe disability and will have a total knee replacement (TKR). Sadly,
persons with CKS engage in treatments with low effectiveness while waiting for TKR, in part due
to the behavioral challenges of engaging in regular physical activity(PA). Physical activity has
been shown to relieve pain, improve function, and prevent losses in independence in individuals
across the KOA disease spectrum. Despite its value, PA levels remain low among adults with
CKS and for adults in the workplace. Low PA is linked to high healthcare spending and losses in
worker productivity creating an incentive for employer-support PA initiatives. Many workplaces
have embraced wellness programs to support employees in improving their health, however
employees with CKS struggle with lower rates of PA than their peers without CKS.
 Previous research has found that Fitbit tracking can improve behavior for some with CKS
but others benefit from more intensive forms of coaching. The exact amount of coaching needed
remains unknown. Employee stakeholders have asked for low resource forms of coaching
available through the workplace. The potential exists to support employees with CKS using an
acceptable, low-resource coaching strategy. The goal of this program is to test a brief, scalable
PA coaching intervention that can assist employees with CKS attain and maintain healthy PA
behavior in two worksites in the Midwest. CAPPA is a 12-week pilot randomized controlled
trial that will 1) use computer-guided action-planning behavioral intervention to support
employees in making PA action plans for their health, 2) use data transmitted from a personal
fitness tracker (Fitbit) to support coach and employee knowledge about PA performance, and 3)
Inform on optimal step up times for participants who do not substantially increase PA. CAPPA
will put PA feedback in a Movement Dashboard to support study participants. The CAPPA
intervention will use each participant’s preferred communication mode (text, voice call, or video
chat) to attain and sustain healthy PA behavior at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois and
Advocate Aurora Health. Follow-up measures of PA, pain and physical function are planned at
treatment completion and three months following study completion.
 Specific aims are to: 1) Estimate the efficacy of the intervention to increase objectively-
measured physical activity, 2) Examine the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of the
CAPPA intervention for the respective workplaces, and 3) Inform the initial step up time for
future stepped interventions among participants not substantially increasing their physical
activity. This study leverages the combined clinical and technologic expertise of the
members of the Physical Activity in Rheumatology Research group at Northwestern University,
Northwestern’s Arthritis Center Accelerometer unit, Marquette University’s Behavior,
Engagement and Health Technology Assessment Lab and Ubiquitous Computing Lab, the Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Illinois Corporation, and Advocate Aurora Health. If CAPPA is feasible and
shows preliminary effectiveness, a multi-site randomized controlled trial/U01 proposal will follow
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the CAPPA intervention in larger worksite populations. This
research could have a tremendous impact on improving symptoms and quality of life for those
with CKS and early KOA. If treatments are successful at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois and
Advocate Aurora Health they may be employed in the services they provide to other
organizations."

Cancer-associated cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by the involuntary loss of body and
skeletal muscle mass (with or without fat loss) that reduces tolerance to cancer treatments, increases
complications following surgery and is strongly predictive of reduced survival. However, there are currently no
effective therapies to preserve, or reverse the loss of, muscle mass in cancer patients, highlighting a major gap
in treatment. Unpublished work from our lab implicates a key role for Cellular Communication Network Factor 2
(CCN2), also known as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), in mediating cachexia induced by pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a cancer type with high prevalence of cachexia. CTGF is a hypoxia-inducible
matricellular protein produced by pancreatic cancer cells and PDAC tumors which functions locally to induce
stromal remodeling, tumor growth and metastasis. In a mouse models of PDAC, we found that Ctgf and Hif1a
are upregulated in tumors at time points corresponding to cachexia initiation and progression, suggesting CTGF
production by hypoxic PDAC tumors could also be involved in cachexia. In preliminary studies we found that
genetic or pharmacological targeting of CTGF inhibited cachexia and blocked host- and tumor cell-secretion of
key circulating mediators of cachexia, despite controlling for CTGF-dependent effects on tumor growth, leading
us to hypothesize that CTGF promotes PDAC cachexia, at least in part, through promoting cytokine-dependent
signaling in peripheral tissues, which will be investigated in Aim 1. In addition to CTGF production within PDAC
tumors, CTGF is also upregulated in skeletal muscles of cachectic patients and mice with PDAC. We therefore
hypothesize that local production of CTGF within muscle tissue may also play a direct role in muscle wasting in
response to PDAC, which was supported through targeting of Ctgf-shRNA to muscle tissue using AAV. Through
single nucleus RNAseq we further identified Ctgf to be upregulated in both respiratory and peripheral skeletal
muscles of PDAC mice in a cell type-specific manner, with Ctgf commonly upregulated within a subpopulation
of mature skeletal muscle nuclei that show increased expression of atrophy-related genes. Using both in vitro
and in vivo models, Aim 2 will thus further investigate the cell-autonomous role of Ctgf in mediating skeletal
muscle wasting and dysfunction in response to PDAC, and the mechanisms involved. We anticipate that our
findings will elucidate key tissue-specific mechanisms of muscle wasting and weakness associated with cancer,
with high translational potential."

Alcohol-related risks are highest in young adulthood and this age group is most likely to be exposed to the
alcohol use of their peers. Young adults are also highly influenced by their peers, both for high-risk behaviors
and for prosocial actions. Bystander helping is one way that peer influence in potentially dangerous alcohol
consumption circumstances can reduce harm to those at risk. Bystander helping is the phenomenon when
witnesses to a problematic event step in to intervene in some way, but bystander helping has been under-
investigated when hazardous alcohol use is the target behavior. In order to develop interventions that
effectively leverage peer influence for harm reduction in the young adult community, research must be
conducted on the circumstances of alcohol-related events, and specifically the experiences of those who could
be bystander helpers. Drawing from bystander intervention research on sexual assault and bullying prevention,
we propose to investigate the contexts and conditions under which bystander helping for hazardous alcohol
use occurs naturalistically. The aims of this research are to investigate the event-level (Aim 1) and individual
difference (Aim 2) predictors of bystander helping in response to peer alcohol-related risk, and to investigate
the relationship between helping approaches and bystander and peer outcomes (Aim 3). Following community
engagement with an advisory group and a pilot phase in which we will finalize procedures and assessments,
we will conduct an assessment study with a sample of young adults (N = 200; ages 18-25) balanced on gender
and reflecting the US in race/ethnicity, who will report on their exposure to the hazardous drinking of others in
their environment for 28 days using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) methods. Participants will
complete random and morning reports on their own smartphones that will collect information about alcohol-
related behavior witnessed, the social context, the characteristics of the person showing the risk behavior, the
nature of the relationship between that person and the bystander, the bystander’s own state including their own
level of intoxication, perceived barriers to intervention, bystander strategies used, outcomes of any bystander
helping, and the outcomes to the person showing the hazardous behavior. Each evening survey will pull
forward information from the previous survey to allow for assessment of subsequent observations, and
morning surveys will assess further the risks observed, behavioral responses, and outcomes. Methods used
during the baseline assessment and orientation, including a social network interview, will facilitate brief,
accurate and private EMA reports. We expect the information derived from this investigation will contribute in a
substantive way to the development of effective trainings for individuals who are exposed to the hazardous
drinking of others."

Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of many tumors. However, most GBM patients
have not, so far, benefited from immunotherapeutic treatment. With the goal of exploring ways to
boost anti-GBM immunity, we've developed a B-cell-based vaccine (BVax) that consists of 4-1BBL+
B cells activated with CD40 agonism, BAFF and IFNγ stimulation. BVax migrate to key secondary
lymphoid organs and are proficient at antigen cross-presentation, which promotes both the
survival and functionality of CD8+ T cells. A combination of radiation, BVax, and PD-L1 blockade
conferred tumor eradication in 80% of treated tumor-bearing animals. This research proposal
aims to understand the immune mechanisms underlying this protection and prevention of tumor
growth. We will focus on two processes: generation of CD8+ T-cell memory formation (Aim 1) and
Ab production (Aim 2). We hypothesize that both effector functions elicit protective anti-GBM
immunity.
We have been successful at generating GBM patient-derived BVax that activated autologous CD8+
T cells, which shows a strong ability to kill autologous glioma cells. This demonstrates that BVax
can be produced from patient's peripheral blood. We now aim to further characterize and optimize
BVax treatment protocol to inform future clinical application of this therapeutic approach (Aim 3).
Overall, our study provides a novel alternative to current immunotherapeutic approaches that can
be readily translated to the clinic."

Early life stress (ELS), defined as adverse experiences occurring before age 18, is a highly prevalent risk
factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the development of effective strategies to prevent
CVD in individuals exposed to ELS is hindered by lack of knowledge about physiological pathways
underlying ELS effects on CVD, as well as malleable lifestyle factors that may mitigate these effects.
Cross-species animal studies guiding Project 1 and Project 2 implicate specific mechanistic pathways
that link ELS with CVD, including upregulation of histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), NADPH oxidase 2
(NOX2), and cytokines; reduced diversity in the gut microbiome; and reduction of short-chain fatty acids
(SCFA). Together, these pathways induce CVD through reprogramming of the immune and vascular
system in rodent models of ELS. However, we do not know whether these pathways lead to CVD in
people who experienced ELS and whether they can be modified by lifestyle factors, such as diet,
physical activity, and supportive parenting, during development. Project 4 will leverage an existing,
ethnically diverse cohort of 1,000 adults (age 29) from Birmingham, Alabama, who have been
characterized for ELS and lifestyle factors at ages 11, 13, 16, and 19, to test the hypotheses that 1) ELS
induces vascular dysfunction and hypertension through sustained pro-inflammatory reprogramming of
the gut microbiome and peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptome, and that 2) these effects may
be modified by protective lifestyle factors during development. The proposed assessment at age 29 will
include a comprehensive evaluation of stress and lifestyle factors in adulthood; vascular function; gut
microbiome; SCFAs; and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptome. Data from all five
time points spanning ages 11 to 29 will be integrated to test 1) the relationship between prospectively
measured ELS and immune and vascular function in adulthood; 2) whether these relationships are
mediated by pro-inflammatory profiles of the gut microbiome and PBMC transcriptome in adulthood; and
3) whether diet quality, physical activity, and supportive parenting during development modify the
relationships between ELS and adult gut microbiome, PBMC transcriptome, and immune and vascular
function. Project 4 is conceptually and translationally innovative by testing specific gut microbiome and
transcriptome pathways discovered in rodents in humans. Together with Project 3 which tests
complementary metabolome and methylome pathways in adolescence, the two human projects will guide
future mechanistic studies by identifying new multi-omic pathways that link ELS with vascular dysfunction
during critical developmental periods spanning adolescence to young adulthood. The integrated findings
from this PPG will elucidate causal pathways and protective factors related to ELS-induced CVD risk,
directly informing the development of novel evidence-based interventions."

 Significant advances have been made in the genetic risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), from
identification of early onset familial mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin, to discovery
of late onset Alzheimer’s disease risk alleles like APOE ε4 and over 30 loci through genome wide
association studies. Similarly, the development of biomarkers for pathology, for beta-amyloid (Ab, A) and
Tau (T) have advanced through detection by positive emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF). Additional biomarkers of neurodegeneration (N), neurofilament light chain (NfL)- an astrogliosis
marker and glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP) have increased the accuracy of diagnosis in early disease
stages, or even prodromal to AD.
 Despite these advances, there still are major limitations to understanding and diagnosing AD. A
major limitation of large cohort studies has been the under-representation of ethnic/racial minorities as most
studies have evaluated predominantly homogenous cohorts of European ancestry. This does not reflect
the cross ancestral diversity in the United States, Canada and globally. For example, the most robust late-
onset Alzheimer’s disease risk variant, APOE ε4, confers a higher risk of disease in individuals of European
ancestry than it does in Hispanics and African-Americans, particularly in carriers with only one APOE ε4
allele.
 Biomarkers that identify AD through PET imaging or lumbar puncture-acquired CSF are also limited
due to the need for expensive technology or invasive procedures. Advancement of blood-based biomarkers
offers promise of an accessible diagnostic tool to identify AD as early as possible. Establishing cohorts that
investigate other groups, such as Asians in this study, is critical to understanding AD in ethnically and
racially diverse countries like the United States and Canada.
 To address this gap in knowledge, the Asian Cohort for Alzheimer’s disease (ACAD) was
established. The goal of this Core is to establish a biorepository of genetic data and blood samples from
Asian populations for the investigation of AD. With over 5000 DNA samples and 3000 plasma and serum
samples from elderly participants, it will be one of the largest collections in the world dedicated to Asian
groups in North America. DNA will be stored and processed at NCRAD analyzed by the Center for Applied
Genomics, with data accessible through NIAGADS. NCRAD will use Plasma to measure biomarkers for
amyloid, tau, neurodegeneration. Analysis of genetic data and blood biomarkers will be done in Project 1 and 2
and compared to other datasets to identify Asian-specific genetic and biomarker profiles, genetic variants of
interest, and thresholds for diagnostic detection of AD."

10933385,"Project Summary
Cellular stress-responsive mechanisms are essential for cells to adapt to various environmental and
physiological conditions. The overall goal of the research program is to understand how cells regulate mRNA
translation as part of their stress adaptation process. Of particular interest is a pathway referred to as the
Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which is initiated by stress-activated eIF2a kinases that respond to several
distinct types of stress. Abnormal regulation of ISR is associated with various metabolic and neurodegenerative
diseases, including ribosomopathies caused by heterozygosity in ribosome subunit genes and Charcot Marie
Tooth Disease caused by certain tRNA synthetase mutations. The ISR signaling mechanism is intriguing
because this pathway induces stress-responsive gene transcription, and coincidentally, suppresses general
mRNA translation. ISR inhibits mRNA translation at multiple levels, including the specific inhibition of translation
initiation factors, eIF2a and eIF-4E. In addition, recent evidence indicates that ribosome stalling on mRNAs is
associated with ISR. These observations raise a fundamental question regarding how stress-responsive
transcripts overcome these multiple translational blocks, and in some cases, increase their translation as part of
ISR signaling. To address this, we propose to use the facile genetic tools of Drosophila. The ISR regulatory
mechanisms are conserved in this organism, and there are genetic mutations that serve as models for human
diseases with abnormal ISR signaling. Our preliminary genetic screen in Drosophila has identified several
poorly characterized translational regulators as factors required for ISR signaling. Building on these
observations, we will test the central hypothesis that the newly identified factors specifically mediate the
translation of stress-responsive transcripts, thereby helping those mRNAs to bypass translational blocks
imposed by ISR. We will further determine the physiological significances of the newly identified translational
regulatory mechanisms in the Drosophila models of ribosomopathies and Charcot Marie Tooth Disease. A
successful realization of the proposed plan will advance our conceptual understanding of stress-responsive
gene expression, and help develop new therapeutic strategies against diseases associated with ISR."
10804597,"ABSTRACT
Protein synthesis, or translation, connects genotype to phenotype in all forms of life. The Cate lab has a
longstanding interest in the mechanisms of protein synthesis, from universal principles gleaned from bacterial
translation to the basis of translation regulation in humans. This application tackles fundamental questions
about how translation is regulated in humans. We propose to explore the regulation of translation initiation in
specific cells and tissues, and mechanisms of translation elongation that affect the speed and accuracy of the
ribosome. We think these two broad lines of investigation will lead to many discoveries about protein synthesis
that could eventually be leveraged to treat human disease.
The canonical mechanism of translation initiation in eukaryotes involves many general translation initiation
factors. We recently discovered that one of these–eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3)–serves specialized roles
to either activate or repress the translation of specific mRNAs. We also found that eIF3 unexpectedly includes
its own 5’-m7G cap binding subunit. In this application, we will probe how and when eIF3 carries out its specific
regulatory functions. We will use molecular and structural approaches to decipher how eIF3 and trans-acting
factors interact with structured RNA elements to regulate the translation of specific mRNAs. We will also
examine the role of eIF3 in regulating translation in activated T cells. Finally, we will determine how eIF3
regulation of T cell receptor translation affects T cell development. Answers to these questions will reveal
fundamental insights into translational control and will provide a foundation for future engineering of improved
cell-based immunotherapies.
Protein targets for many human diseases remain “undruggable” due to their underlying biochemical functions
and behavior. These limits to small molecule drug discovery hold back the promise of developing affordable
therapeutics. We recently showed that small molecules that bind the ribosome can selectively stall the
translation of human proteins, revealing an entirely new mechanism of action that could enable targeting
previously “undruggable” proteins. These drug-like compounds directly and selectively modulate the translation
of specific nascent polypeptides during translation elongation or termination. We also found these compounds
impact ribosome quality control pathways. We will explore whether similar mechanisms are employed by
cellular metabolites to regulate the translation of specific mRNAs. We will also map new ribosome quality
control pathways that target translation frameshifting, a process sensitive to the mechanisms employed by the
drug-like compounds to selectively stall translation. Taken together, these experiments will provide new
molecular insights that could aid in the design of new small molecule modulators of human translation."
10931318,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are highly abundant in eukaryotes and play a central role in key
cellular regulatory pathways and in the spatial organization of the cell. Approximately half of the proteins
in the human proteome are either fully disordered or contain long disordered regions (IDRs). The cellular
abundance of disordered proteins is tightly regulated and dysregulation or mutation of IDPs and IDRs is
associated with devastating diseases such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
neurodegenerative disease. Disordered proteins are highly flexible and undergo transient and dynamic
intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that are central to their regulatory functions. Molecular
level characterization of the numerous human regulatory proteins that contain both structured and
disordered domains represents an enormous challenge to the traditional methods of structural biology.
Most studies to date have relied upon a reductionist, divide-and-conquer approach, in which the ordered
and disordered regions are expressed independently and studied in isolation. However, within the cell,
the folded and disordered domains of a given protein act synergistically to allow it to perform its biological
function and a full understanding of the underlying molecular mechanism can only be achieved through
a holistic, rather than reductionist, approach. An overarching goal of our research is to utilize a non-
reductionist approach, aided by intein-based segmental isotope labeling, to characterize the structural
ensemble, dynamics, and interactions of eukaryotic proteins containing both folded and disordered
domains. This strategy is broadly applicable to large, dynamic proteins with disordered domains since it
is relatively straightforward to identify or engineer optimal intein splice sites within disordered regions.
Importantly, traceless ligation, where no cysteine or other non-native residues are introduced at the splice
site, can be accomplished using the Nrdj1 intein, allowing retention of the native protein sequence and
cysteine-mediated coupling of spin labels or fluorophores at desired probe sites. Initial efforts will focus
on the full-length, 180 kDa tumor suppressor p53. Current structural information on p53 is largely limited
to isolated domains and fails to explain how the disordered and folded regions function synergistically to
control p53 activity. There is a large and growing body of evidence that the intrinsically disordered regions
of p53 regulate its activity through dynamic intramolecular and intermolecular interactions that are
modulated by constitutive and stress-induced post-translational modifications. This research will provide
new molecular-level insights into the mechanisms by which this important tumor suppressor is regulated,
as well as providing new tools for structural and dynamic characterization of large eukaryotic regulatory
proteins that contain disordered regions."
10768551,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Age-related defects of the immune response contribute to reduced efficacy of the influenza vaccine in older
adults. Influenza A virus (IAV) infection results in greater risk of complications and higher hospitalization rates
in older adults, with approximately 90% of deaths occurring in adults over age 65. Therefore, the development
of a safe and effective vaccine that promotes protective immunity for the aged is an urgent public health need.
The overall goal of this revised R01 application is to identify the effect of vaccine biomaterials and adjuvants on
DC metabolism, and subsequent effects on antibody and T cell memory to develop a nanovaccine to overcome
age-related immune impairments. Vaccines for older adults can be further optimized with biomaterials that
enhance multiple arms of the immune system and provide a platform to expand antigen selection, broadening
protection. Our studies will establish the contribution of specific biomaterials and adjuvants in improving B and
T cell outcomes resulting in protection by enhancing vaccine efficacy. The goals are to: 1) develop an
efficacious influenza nanovaccine for older populations; and 2) to understand the mechanisms by which
rational selection of biomaterials and co-adjuvants in vaccines can enhance immune capabilities of aged
individuals. Our two polymeric nanovaccine platforms, polyanhydride nanoparticles and pentablock copolymer
micelles, have been shown to increase antibody titers, improve cell-mediated immunity, and prolong antigen
delivery resulting in a protective immune response with reduced viral load upon delivery of recombinant
hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein in an IAV challenge model. Compelling preliminary data demonstrates that
these formulations differentially alter dendritic cell (DC) metabolic profile compared to traditional adjuvants. Aim
1 will identify how nanovaccine biomaterials and adjuvants that promote DC metabolic health augment the
immune response in aged mice. Different vaccine formulations will compare adjuvants that produce high
glycolytic responses with formulations that retain some oxidative phosphorylation and spare respiratory
capacity to optimize DC function. In the second aim, we will optimize the nanovaccine formulation(s) that
enhance B cell activation in aged mice and peripheral blood B cells from aged humans. Additionally, we will
identify mechanisms by which our nanovaccine improves T follicular helper responses and the induction of
protective immunity on an aging background. Traditional inactivated IAV vaccine will be used as a control so as
to identify the formulation providing superior protection than the current vaccine. In Aim 3, we will determine
how nanovaccine-induced metabolically-optimized DC-T cell priming contributes to T cell memory and
heterologous protection against IAV in aged mice. Measures of viral load, serum antibody, and lung T cell
responses will be evaluated in homologous and heterosubtypic IAV challenges in aged mice. The long-term
goal of this research is to define the mechanisms responsible for induction of protective immune responses in
aging populations, thus facilitating the rational design of improved vaccines for this underserved population."
10769749,"The USA sent approximately 700,000 troops to the Persian Gulf to participate in the
1990-91 Gulf War. Of those who returned, 25-30% complained of a generalized
malaise with gastrointestinal, endocrinological, respiratory and neurological
complaints, which was named Gulf War Illness (GWI). Many of those returning with
GWI are still sick nearly 30 years after their exposure, with no cure. What changes
allow these symptoms to persist over many years? Genetic variation among the
troops may have caused them to respond differently to the exposure. Epigenetic
alterations in gene regulation are the most likely candidate for the persistence of
symptoms. We and others have developed an exposure regime in mice that mimics
both troop exposures and biological effects of GWI. This model uses corticosterone
pretreatment (CORT; to simulate physiological stress) combined with an irreversible
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP); as troops were
exposed to many acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Initial studies showed acute
changes in proinflammatory cytokine genes and changes in methylation of genes
following exposure to CORT combined with DFP. PI Jones and colleagues have
seen significant differences in proinflammatory gene expression response to the
treatment among more than 25 different genotypes (i.e., inbred mouse strains) and
have been able to map quantitative trait loci which mediate this effect. The proposed
research takes the next step to understand the genetics of epigenetic changes
related to the persistence of GWI."
10818366,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The therapeutic benefit of transfusion presumes a direct correlation between blood oxygen carrying capacity and
oxygen delivery. However, our preclinical and clinical studies show that stored blood loses its ability to oxygenate
tissues. The sequelae that can occur after transfusion (renal injury, myocardial infarction, death) are consistent
with the idea that banked blood may exacerbate rather than correct anemia-induced hypoxia.
We have discovered that banked blood has markedly diminished levels of nitric oxide/S-nitrosothiol (NO/SNO)
bioactivity including the S-nitrosylated form of hemoglobin (SNO-Hb), a major mediator of blood flow and
peripheral oxygen delivery. This decline in SNO provides a mechanistic basis for the impaired vasodilatory
activity of stored red blood cells (RBCs) and an explanation for why transfusion of even small amounts of blood
may impair tissue perfusion. We have built on this novel finding by demonstrating that restoration of SNO-Hb
levels (renitrosylation) corrects storage-induced deficiencies in RBC oxygen delivery and transfusion-induced
organ dysfunction in multiple preclinical transfusion paradigms, and we have initiated clinical studies to assess
the effects of transfusion on tissue oxygenation. We have also developed first-in-class renitrosylating agents that
are already undergoing clinical testing.
We are positioned to provide critically needed data on the effects of transfusion on tissue oxygenation in humans
and to advance the benefits of renitrosylation therapy on oxygen delivery through the following aims:
 1. To further advance understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which RBCs export SNO bioactivity
 to regulate tissue oxygenation;
 2. To develop a device for controlled ex vivo renitrosylation;
 3. To determine if renitrosylation can improve post-surgical outcome in an animal model of pediatric bypass;
and
 4. To conduct an autologous transfusion study in humans to determine the benefits of renitrosylation on
 tissue oxygenation.
Collectively, our studies should provide much-needed insight into the effects of transfusion on tissue oxygenation,
shed light on the mechanistic basis of adverse ischemic events associated with transfusion, and accelerate
development of therapeutic approaches (repletion of SNO-Hb). Restoration of the oxygen delivery capabilities
of banked blood should result in blood transfusion achieving its clinical purpose: vasodilation in the
microcirculation to improve end-organ oxygen delivery in the anemic patient. To the extent that the world’s
supplies of banked RBCs are deficient in SNO-Hb, renitrosylation may hold significant therapeutic promise."
10764304,"Mucociliary Innate Defense Mechanism in the Human Distal Airway
Project summary
Airway mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a critical innate defense system for maintenance of lung health. Failed
mucus transport is common to the pathogenesis of muco-obstructive lung diseases (MOLDs). Mucociliary
transport (MCT) rates, governed by cilial and mucus properties, are reportedly slower in vivo in distal airways,
reflecting in part shorter cilia and reduced ciliary cell density. Mucus concentration is another key parameter that
determines MCT. However, mechanisms that integrate regional cilial and mucus properties into MCT are not
understood. This question is particularly important in small airways (< 2 mm in diameter), as they are the earliest
and most affected region in MOLDs. Our prior studies have demonstrated reduced mucin secretion with robust
CFTR-mediated fluid secretion in small airways, both activities dominated by secretory club cells, suggesting
that mucus is less concentrated in the small airways relative to proximal airways in health. Basic physiology
questions include: 1) why do small airways exhibit slower MCT; 2) how is slower MCT produced by integrated
small airway epithelial cellular activities; and 3) what is the cost for the slower MCT with less concentrated mucus
to the small airway region? Answers to these questions likely relate in part to the exponential decrease in surface
area from distal to proximal airways. Accordingly, we hypothesize that mucus production and clearance in
small airways is tightly regulated to achieve a balance between airway protection and efficient
intraregional mucus clearance. Small airway epithelia produce a relatively dilute mucus that is
transported at relatively slow rates to prevent accumulation in central airways. While this property is
necessary to accommodate decrease in surface area from distal to proximal airways, the dilute mucus
layer and slower clearance rates also lead to increased vulnerability to inhaled toxicants in small airway
regions. To test this central hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1) Identify region- and cell type-
specific regulatory mechanisms for the MCT in human airways. We will identify region-specific MCC
regulatory mechanisms, utilizing human large and small airway cell and tissue explant culture models. We will
then relate region-specific MCC functions to epigenetic regulatory elements determining region-specific airway
epithelial cell types, utilizing multi-omics approaches. 2) Identify pathways determining the distal airway
secretory club cell as a multi-dimensional ion/mucin regulatory cell that controls small airway mucus
properties. 3) Identify mechanisms that produce failure of mucociliary innate defense systems in the
distal airway in MOLDs. We will test whether failure of the transcriptional regulation required to maintain distal
airway specificity causes local MCC dysfunction in small airway epithelia. Our overarching goal is to generate
mechanistic insights into region-specific mucociliary innate defense mechanisms with a focus on small
airways. Achievement of our goal should provide a new paradigm to understand MCC in the normal lung and
how to approach novel therapies for MOLDs."
10791877,"The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) nourishes and promotes survival of photoreceptors. The RPE
contains abundant mitochondria, consistent with a metabolically active tissue with a variety of energy intensive
tasks. Our characterization of the retinal phenotype of mice with postnatal RPE-selective ablation of Tfam
(RPEΔTfam) demonstrates the necessity of RPE mitochondrial function for the integrity of this epithelium, and
for the well being of photoreceptors. RPE-selective knockout of Tfam results in RPE-cell autonomous and non-
cell autonomous effects including a progressive loss of photoreceptor function and numbers. Our findings
complement studies implicating the RPE as the site of ocular pathology in individuals with inherited
mitochondrial defects, and support a causal role for for RPE mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related macular
degeneration (AMD). Our preliminary studies have uncovered a signaling pathway that is quiescent in normal
RPE cells and induced by diverse stressors; striking upregulation of FGF21 in the RPE of RPEΔTfam mice and
dispersion to the neural retina implicates this secreted molecule as a critical signal capable of propagating the
negative effects of RPE mitochondrial distress. We propose to test this hypothesis and understand the
mechanisms by which FGF21 affects the stressed mouse retina. In Aim 1, we will use mouse models to
determine the consequences of loss and gain of FGF21 function on retinal phenotype in the context of RPE
mitochondrial dysfunction. In Aim 2, we will determine the FGF21 autocrine and paracrine contributions to the
retinal phenotype in this context, including cellular transcriptional responses. In Aim 3, we will develop
molecular inhibitors of FGF21 and test their efficacy in mouse models of RPE distress. Given the centrality of
RPE mitochondrial function to retinal homeostasis and the relevance of chronic stress responses to human
diseases, including AMD, a mechanistic understanding of the consequences of this RPE-derived mitochondrial
distress signal could have a substantial long term impact from both basic and applied perspectives."
10746858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disease with a median survival of 3 years after diagnosis.
There are no cures for this disease. Although the etiology is still unclear, one of the major risk factors associated
with IPF is inhaled iron-rich particulate matter, such as asbestos and cigarette smoke. However, the specific role
of iron in the pathogenesis of IPF is an understudied area. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the
pathogenesis of IPF and thus to advance the development of effective therapies. The objective of the current
application is to understand the contribution of iron to the pathogenesis of IPF and the underlying mechanisms
with a focus on the iron-mediated activation of lung fibroblasts.
There is evidence showing that iron accumulates in the lung and contributes to lung fibrosis. However, the
molecular mechanisms for both processes are unclear. Our preliminary studies have identified the iron export
gene solute carrier family 40 member 1 (SLC40A1) as a key gene for iron accumulation in lung fibroblasts. We
have also identified two novel iron-regulated genes, SH3 domain-containing ring finger 1 (SH3RF1), an E3
ubiquitin protein ligase, and homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2), a cotranscriptional regulator and
provided evidence that both genes regulate lung fibroblast activation. Based on our preliminary studies, our
overall hypothesis is that an elevated level of iron in lung fibroblasts due to reduced SLC40A1 leads to the
activation of lung fibroblasts via the downregulation of SH3RF1 expression and the upregulation of HIPK2
expression. The hypothesis will be tested by a combination of in vitro studies using primary human lung
fibroblasts and in vivo strategies in two mouse lung fibrosis models using pharmacological and genetic
interventions. Aim I will determine the mechanisms by which iron accumulates in lung fibroblasts via SLC40A1
and the regulation and functional roles of SH3RF1 in iron-mediated lung fibroblast activation using loss- and
gain-of-function and mutagenesis approaches. Aim II will define the mechanisms by which iron activates lung
fibroblasts via HIPK2 using gene manipulation, coimmunoprecipitation, ubiquitination and molecular signaling
pathway analyses. Aim III will determine the in vivo effects of iron and HIPK2 on lung fibrosis in two preclinical
mouse models of bleomycin- and asbestos-induced lung fibrosis using fibroblast-specific genetic deletion of
Hipk2 and pharmacological inhibitors. The proposed studies will establish the molecular mechanisms of iron
accumulation in lung fibroblasts and novel roles for SH3RF1 and HIPK2 in lung fibroblast activation."
10771134,"The Initiative for Maximizing Student Development at Vanderbilt University (V-IMSD) seeks to continue
advancing diversity and inclusion in our PhD graduate programs. V-IMSD is firmly grounded in a successful 15
year history of the Vanderbilt IMSD in promoting diversity, so that we have become a top producer of PhDs
awarded to historically underrepresented students. We know that diversity in all its forms, including a diversity
of individuals, thoughts, and approaches, will be essential to adequately prepare the next generation of
scientific investigators and realize the potential of biomedical research. And yet we also know that the benefits
of diversity are only fully realized through inclusion. Thus, V-IMSD will serve as an essential catalyst for
creating a more inclusive training environment. Reflecting the inextricable link between diversity and inclusion,
the purpose of this training program is to ensure that students from diverse backgrounds and identities not only
acquire the knowledge and skills to pursue successful careers in biomedical research and related areas, but do
so in an environment that provides a sense of belonging, where they are comfortable bringing their authentic
self to the training experience and empowered to reach their full potential.
 We plan to continue the IMSD programming that has led to substantial gains in diversity. Our current
programming covers five key competencies: research excellence, oral and written communication skills,
leadership and management, teaching skills, and responsible conduct of research. Going forward, V-IMSD will
expand programming to cover additional competencies such as study design and reproducibility, and
quantitative skills. Students will matriculate into V-IMSD as first and second year students, staying associated
with the program until degree completion. This enables the development of a community of scholars modeled
on Wegner's “community of practice.” Through (1) joint enterprises, such as Data Club, Journal Club and
Writing group, (2) mutual engagement, in the form of networking, peer mentoring and social/recreational
events, and (3) shared accomplishments via the annual town hall, newsletter, and social media tools, we build
a community that offers the mentoring and psychosocial support needed for the success of diverse students.
 While working to sustain the level of diversity we have achieved in our biomedical PhD programs, we
plan to take the training experience to the next level with a focus on improving the inclusivity of our training
environment, providing mentee education, or “mentoring up” to help mentees engage with agency in their
mentoring relationships, expanding quantitative and computational training, especially for trainees who are not
comfortable with these skill sets, leveraging our career development resources in a more UR-centric way, and
developing strategic partnerships with the discipline-specific T32 training programs to ensure all students
benefit from V-IMSD programming and our leadership efforts on inclusion, particularly focusing on mentorship
that is effective and intentionally responsive to different identities."
10757457,"ABSTRACT
Most of understanding of how the spliceosome operates in vivo comes from studies of mutants in S. cerevisiae,
yet human splicing displays major differences, including massive variation in length, much more variable intron
signals, numerous additional subunits in the spliceosome, and much more regulation. While RNA-binding
proteins (RBPs) that interact with the spliceosome enable many of these differences, we hypothesize that there
are relevant human-specific factors and mechanisms within the spliceosome itself. However, unbiased discovery
of such factors/mechanisms is extremely challenging because no forward genetic system for analyzing pre-
mRNA splicing in human cells has been described. Standard CRISPR approaches are designed to produce null
alleles rather than informative viable point mutations that are hypomorphic and/or disrupt specific functions.
Thus, we have implemented CRISPR base editing, a method to program point mutations, in haploid human cells
to mutagenize the spliceosome at thousands of residues in over 150 spliceosomal proteins. In preliminary work,
we have conducted a screen using the inhibitor pladienolide B (plaB), which targets U2 snRNP protein SF3b.
 Following validation, sequencing of the base edits responsible for resistance revealed anticipated
changes in SF3b subunits near the plaB binding pocket, validating the approach. Unexpectedly, we also
identified missense mutations in SUGP1, which encodes a human-specific spliceosomal protein unknown
function recently revealed to be a cancer driver gene, as well as C-terminal truncation mutations in Splicing
Factor 1 (SF1), a conserved sequence-specific RNA binding protein that recognizes the intron branchpoint
whose in vivo function is poorly understood. This work demonstrates large scale base editing screens in haploid
human cells to investigate the function of spliceosomal proteins in vivo.
 Our global hypothesis is that unbiased genetics can reveal functions for human spliceosomal proteins
that enable human-specific features of pre-mRNA splicing. First, we will test this hypothesis combining clonal
cell lines mutant in SUGP1 or SF1 already in hand with powerful methods to investigate the phenotypic
consequences of these mutations on splicing and protein interactions. This includes the global quantification of
branchpoint-3’ splice site decisions made in vivo and the proximity labeling to investigate the impact of mutations
on protein interactions in vivo. Analysis of these mutant molecular phenotypes will begin to inform our
understanding of the functions of the core spliceosomal factors in vivo. We will also modify our genetic strategy
to use bichromatic reporter-based assays to begin to identify core spliceosomal residues that promote splicing
fidelity. The impact of these studies is anticipated to be high as these as this work is the first to deploy a forward
genetic approach to understand the functions of essential spliceosomal components in human cells."
10843733,"ABSTRACT Project 3: Intra-Articular Mineralization
Intra-articular (IA) mineralization due to calcium crystal deposition is common in knee osteoarthritis (OA), and
may contribute to inflammation, structural pathology, and pain. However, prior studies have been conflicting
regarding its clinical relevance, likely partly due to reliance on relatively insensitive radiographs. In addition, the
particular crystal type may have different consequences in OA. We plan to address these key knowledge gaps
by use of dual energy CT (DECT) to more sensitively detect IA mineralization, and apply a novel image analysis
method to differentiate type of crystal present in the IA mineralization. We hypothesize that IA calcium crystal
deposition may induce low-grade inflammation that can contribute to pain and its fluctuation in OA. Further,
particular types of calcium crystal (calcium pyrophosphate [CPP] vs. basic calcium phosphate [BCP]) may
contribute differently to OA outcomes. Clarification of potential consequences of IA mineralization and specific
crystal types in knee OA would enable examination of IA mineralization as a treatment target in OA with therapies
such as anti-IL-1β or other anti-cytokine therapy addressing inflammation due to crystals. We will leverage data
collected in the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) Study, including previously acquired DECT and stored blood
biospecimens, and take advantage of the planned synovial fluid acquisition in conjunction with the proposed
MOST4 Project 4 on synovial fluid proteomics. Using these rich data, we propose to evaluate the following: 1)
the relation of IA mineralization to pain fluctuation over two years; 2) the relation of IA mineralization to serum
inflammatory markers; 3) type of crystal (CPP vs. BCP) and volume of each type using novel DECT image
analysis, and determine the extent to which each crystal type is related to serum inflammatory signatures,
structural progression, and pain; 4) To examine the synovial inflammatory signatures via proteomics in knees
with crystal-proven CPP vs. BCP (exploratory pilot aim). We will work with Dr. Fabio Becce who has developed
the novel image analysis methods to differentiate crystal type on DECT, as well as with Dr. Ann Rosenthal who
will use Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to identify crystal type in synovial fluid to permit proteomics
analysis of synovial fluid containing CPP vs. BCP. In exploratory analysis using deep learning, we will evaluate
the relationship of crystal type to co-localized predicted cartilage loss. These proposed studies are innovative as
they will provide novel insights into the inter-relationships between IA crystals, inflammation, pain, and pathology
in OA. The proposed research is significant as such insights would lay the foundation for identifying an important
OA phenotype targetable by effective anti-cytokine therapy leading to disease modification. This would provide
an important breakthrough for this disease in which there are no disease-modifying therapies available to date."

To address the limited participation among Asian Americans and Canadians (ASACs) in Alzheimer’s disaesae

Health Education and Risk of Dementia (B-HEARD), is to provide the education/outreach tools to engage
and recruit older ASACs in ADRD research, which is relevant to both proposed ACAD projects (i.e.,
education/outreach on what research is, especially ADRD genetics, lifestyles, and biomarkers research). We
will use community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods, and leverage/expand on the multi-lingual
outreach resources in Multiple Principal Investigator (MPI) Park’s NIA-funded Collaborative Approach for Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders Research and Education (CARE) research recruitment registry. The proposed
aims will be conducted in five written languages (English, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
Vietnamese) and five spoken languages (Cantonese, English, Korean, Mandarin, and Vietnamese): Aim 1. To
develop and promote the use of culturally and linguistically appropriate educational resources for
recruitment and retention in ADRD research including ACAD; Aim 2. To monitor ACAD
recruitment/outreach, develop metrics of success, and provide support for recruitment success; and
Aim 3. To develop and provide training to ADRD researchers on the best practices of CBPR and
communication approaches with older Chinese-, Korean-, and Vietnamese Americans and Canadians
about ADRD research participation. B-HEARD aligns with two major goals of the NIA’s strategic directions
for research which are to 1) Support the infrastructure and resources needed to promote high-quality research;
and 2) Disseminate information to the public; scientific and medical communities; stakeholder advocacy,
community, and older adult-support organizations; the media; and policymakers about research and
interventions. The proposed resources may be added to the NIA ADORE, which may assist other ADRD
researchers in recruitment and retention of ASACs, thereby, helping to improve diversity and inclusion of
underrepresented populations (i.e., ASACs) in ADRD research."
10748405,"ABSTRACT
The KCNT1 gene encodes a Na+-activated K+ channel (KNa channel) termed Slack. These channels are bound
directly to regulators of mRNA translation in neurons. Mutations in KCNT1 give rise to several childhood
epilepsies as well as autism. These gain-of-function mutations produce a 3-20-fold increase in K+ current and
all result in very severe intellectual disability. In a mouse model of epilepsy expressing the Slack-R455H
mutation, KNa currents are increased in both excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons. The characteristics of
the increased KNa current are, however, different in the two types of cells, and the firing of excitatory neurons is
increased while that of GABAergic interneurons is suppressed. This proposal will test the hypothesis that
excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons preferentially express either Slack-A or Slack-B splice isoforms, which
differ substantially in their activation properties. In situ hybridization and immunolocalization experiments,
coupled with the use of antisense oligonucleotides, will localize and suppress the expression of each isoform.
The second part of the proposal will investigate the finding that, in addition to increased KNa currents, cortical
neurons in Slack mutant mice have greatly increased Na+ currents and levels of NaV subunits. Because both
physiological and pathophysiological (Slack mutant) activation of Slack channels triggers increased translation
of mRNAs for β-actin and for mRNA translation reporter constructs, we will test whether this mechanism
contributes to increased synthesis of NaV channel subunits. The ability of Slack channels to stimulate
translation will be tested using reporter constructs containing 5’ and 3’ UTR domains of NaV genes, as well as
assays of the rate of synthesis of nascent NaV peptides in cortical neurons. Finally, experiments will determine
if specific domains in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of Slack channels, or K+ flux through the channels,
are required for stimulation of mRNA reporter constructs or increased Na+ channel synthesis. The findings will
provide essential information on the major unsolved question of how neurons coordinate expression of Na+ and
K+ channels to regulate intrinsic excitability, and on how disruption of this process leads to abnormal firing and
severe intellectual disability."
10792891,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A central question in neurobiology is how individual neurons precisely connect with each
other to form functional circuits during development. Understanding the mechanisms of
neural circuit assembly may provide insights into the etiology of human brain disorders.
The fruit fly olfactory circuit has been an excellent model to investigate the mechanisms
by which wiring specificity of neural circuits arises during development. In this circuit,
axons of 50 types of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) match precisely with dendrites
of 50 corresponding types of second-order olfactory projection neurons (PNs), forming
50 discrete glomeruli in the antennal lobe. This allows olfactory information to be
faithfully delivered from peripheral sensory organs to higher brain centers, enabling
innate and learned olfactory behavior.
Thanks to the continual support of this grant since 2003, our studies have made the
Drosophila antennal lobe one of the best-understood circuits in the molecular, cellular,
and developmental underpinnings of wiring specificity. During the last grant cycle, we
made three key advances: 1) we determined single-cell transcriptomes of PNs and
ORNs across development, which have produced differentially expressed genes as
candidate wiring molecules and cell-type-specific drivers for labelling and genetically
manipulating individual PN and ORN types; 2) we developed a cell-surface proteomic
profiling method that allowed us to identify new wiring molecules; 3) we established an
explant culture that recapitulates wiring specificity in vivo, allowing us to examine the
dynamic process of circuit assembly in wild-type and mutants using time-lapse imaging.
In this proposal, we will take advantage of these advances to further investigate the
cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the olfactory circuit is assembled and
wiring specificity is achieved. Specifically, we will utilize new genetic tools and time-lapse
imaging to determine the cellular events that lead to PN dendrite patterning, segregation,
and ORN-PN synaptic partner matching. We will investigate the mechanisms by which
cell surface receptor teneurins work with putative ligands and downstream signaling
molecules to instruct synaptic partner matching. We will also identify additional
instructive wiring molecules and study their mechanisms of actions using data from
single-cell transcriptomes and in vivo assays that can distinguish attraction vs. repulsion
in ligand-receptor interactions."
10757454,"Project Abstract
Despite the incredible diversity of potential T cell receptor (TCR) sequences, some are found widely in
the population; these are called ""public TCRs"" (pTCRs). There is a growing awareness that pTCRs
may sometimes play important functions; for example, they have been linked to long term control of
HIV. We have found 3 ""special-pTCRs"" (spTCRs) that are the subject of this proposal. As we show, the
presence of these spTCRs in the peripheral blood of cancer patients is highly associated with improved
progression free survival and overall survival in certain groups of patients. In this R21 proposal, we will
thoroughly interrogate the predictive power of spTCRs and characterize the cells that express them.
Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the prognostic value of spTCRs in diverse cohorts of cancer patients
receiving immunotherapy. We hypothesize the presence of spTCRs will be associated with improved
clinical outcomes in lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and melanoma patients treated at our institution,
as well as patients treated on Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network trials. We hypothesize that the
predictive value of these spTCRs will be highest in patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors.
Specific Aim 2: To identify the specificity and immunophenotypic features of spTCRs. Using a
combination of bead and flow-based cell sorting we will enrich spTCRs from PBMC for paired single-
cell TCR and RNA sequencing analysis to determine their phenotype and paired αβ sequence. Using
the αβ paired sequence, we will determine their specificities. By identifying the correct phenotype, other
cancer specific pTCRs may be identified for use as biomarkers or therapeutics."
10758594,"Project Summary
 Gain-of-function (GOF) p53 mutations are very frequent in all types of chemo- and radio-resistant intractable
lung cancers with poor prognosis. Depletion of endogenous mutant p53 eliminates the tumorigenic phenotype of
many human lung cancer cell lines. Therefore, small molecule inhibitors that specifically inactivate the oncogenic
function of GOF p53 should have a cancer cell-specific efficient impact on many lung cancer patients.
 Using genome wide analyses of lung cancer cells, we have traced the oncogenic properties of GOF p53 to its
ability to transcriptionally activate expression of cell proliferative genes. Our published genetic data showed that
transactivation deficient GOF p53 is defective in tumor formation and proliferation of lung cancer cells. Here we
propose to test a hypothesis that small molecule inhibitors of GOF p53-specific transcriptional activation (GOF
p53TAIn) specifically inhibit proliferation of lung cancer cells and tumors with GOF p53 mutation. Our short-
term goal is to test this hypothesis in cellular and animal models of lung cancer. Our long-term goal is to translate
our findings into novel targeted therapies for human lung cancer.
 In support of our hypothesis, our preliminary studies have identified novel small molecule inhibitors (GOF
p53TAIns) that specifically inhibit GOF p53-driven transcriptional activation sparing Wild-type (WT) p53-
induced transcription and basal transcription. Pilot experiments identified GOF p53TAIns that preferentially
inhibited growth of lung cancer cells with GOF p53, over p53-null lung cancer cells or lung cancer cells with WT
53. One of the GOF p53TAIns, Gloxazone, specifically inhibits GOF p53-induced transcription and cell growth,
and in addition specifically inhibits growth of tumors from xenografts of lung cancer cells with mutant p53 but
not from that of WT p53. The proposed hypothesis will be further tested via the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: Examine identified GOF p53TAIns for their ability to specifically inhibit GOF p53-induced
growth of lung cancer cells inducing cell death. Human lung cancer cell lines spanning different subtypes (non-
small cell, small cell, squamous cell) with or without various GOF p53 mutation (a), matched sets of gene-edited
lung cancer cell lines with GOF p53, WT p53 and p53-null alleles (b), and tumor cells isolated from primary or
passaged patient lung cancer samples (c) will be employed. Ability of GOF p53TAIns to alter GOF p53 stability
will be determined and analysis of mechanism of growth inhibition for selected compounds will be initiated.
 Aim 2: Examine identified GOF p53TAIns for their ability to specifically inhibit GOF p53-driven
tumor growth and induce tumor cell death using mouse models. Three mouse models, tumors from (a)
xenograft of lung cancer cells, implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically, and (b) patient-derived xenografts
(PDX) in immunocompromised mice will be used and (c) inducible GOF p53-dependent lung cancer mouse
models will be examined."
10578946,"The kidneys are highly sensitive to metabolic changes. Metabolic phenotyping uncovered a number
of pathways associated with high blood pressure and kidney diseases, which sheds light on the
complex pathophysiology of hypertension and associated kidney injury. However, the mechanisms
underlying the effects of dietary interventions on kidney function and associated changes in cellular
metabolic intermediates remain incompletely understood. L-lysine is one of the essential amino
acids, which is necessary for many physiological functions. Our recent metabolomics study revealed
that intrarenal levels of L-Lysine are reduced in Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats when animals are fed
an HS diet. This provided further evidence that L-Lysine is critical for metabolic states in the kidney.
The main hypothesis of this project is that dietary L-Lysine supplementation significantly enhances
cardiorenal protection via acute inhibition of metabolic load and oxidative stress triggered by
hypertension and renal damage-induced uptake of albumin in proximal tubule (PT) cells and on a
longer scale – via chemically modified entities that provide a sink for essential mitochondrial
metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis. Specifically, we propose that L-Lysine accumulates in the
kidneys, inhibits PT reabsorption, and promotes excretion of excessively accumulated intrarenal
albumin. These effects of L-Lysine, in conjunction with strong diuretic and natriuretic properties,
leads to the protection of PT from metabolic stress. Furthermore, our evidence supports that lysine
malonylation (recently described post-translational modification) plays an important role in salt-
induced hypertension and kidney injury. Proposed here research strategy represents a pioneering
effort to understand the mechanisms regulating metabolic states in the kidney and further
pathological changes associated with altered PT function during the development of salt-induced
hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Mechanistic insight into the protective effects of L-Lysine
and the contribution of Lysine malonylation in these mechanisms will be uncovered. Several
innovative approaches and unique rat models will be used to test the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1 will define the protective effects of L-Lysine dietary management on PT reabsorption, renal
oxidative stress, and the development of renal damage in salt-sensitive hypertension. The
hypothesis that Slc7a9 is a key transporter of L-Lysine in PT will also be tested in this aim.
Aim 2 will establish the contribution of the Lysine malonylation metabolic pathway in the control of
free fatty acid metabolism and mitochondria function. A combination of pharmacological (by using
potent MCD inhibitor CBM 301940) and genetic (novel SSMlycd-/- rat model) approaches will be further
utilized to understand the role of Malonyl-Lysine in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and the
regulation of malonyl-CoA in kidney function."

In contrast to the dramatic progress in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, prognostication for localized
melanoma has not advanced beyond the histomorphological measures of tumor thickness and ulceration that
comprise the staging system. The prognostic accuracy of these measures for locally advanced, node-negative
melanoma (Stage II) is generally poor. Post-surgical recurrence rates for stage II melanoma vary between 24%
for stage IIA to 46% for stage IIC. In contrast to breast and colon cancers, where molecular pathology tests are
routinely used to improve the accuracy of disease prognostication over routine histopathology, there are no
validated molecular tests for primary melanoma, despite claims from commercial entities to the contrary.
Recently, data from a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1
immunotherapeutic agent, was used to support its approval as adjuvant therapy for surgically resected stage IIB
and IIC melanoma. Although recurrence-free survival (RFS) at the 18-month post-surgical follow up showed a
statistically significant benefit associated with permbrolizumab, 11 patients needed to be treated to prevent one
recurrence. This is because the RFS in the placebo group is fairly high. Given the potential toxicity of
immunotherapy, and its variable efficacy and high cost, we need more accurate tools to appropriately select
patients for treatment who have a high probability of tumor recurrence, and spare surgically cured patients the
risks of overtreatment. A major obstacle to this approach is the lack of validated biomarkers that accurately
distinguish between high- and low-risk patients.
Several publications as well as our own Preliminary Data support alterations of the upstream regulatory region
of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (TERT) as potentially high-value prognostic biomarkers in
melanoma. These alterations include hotspot mutations in the promoter region (possibly cooperating with an
inherited germline variant), and/or methylation of an upstream regulatory region. In addition, data from large
published studies suggest that NRAS, and possibly BRAF mutations may each be associated with decreased
survival in stage II melanomas. In some datasets the effect is stronger if the mutations co-occur with TERT
promoter mutations. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that adding molecular measurements of the
upstream regulatory regions of TERT and mutations in NRAS or BRAF, either singly or in combination, will
improve the accuracy of a recurrence prediction model for stage II melanoma. Successful creation of an improved
model will generate interest from outside groups to collaborate on subsequent larger, multicenter validation and
clinical utility studies where the biomarkers may eventually be used to assist in treatment decision-making."
10932841,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic differentials and their influence on health of older adults is
disproportionately documented in high-income countries. Given socioeconomic, cultural and historical
differences between these countries and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), findings could be biased
or even invalid for a universal generalization. Thus, aging studies on socioeconomic characteristics and health
must be examined contextually. Among older adults, such investigations are rare and just published in the last
twenty years. The hypothesis central to the socioeconomic status-health association is the negative
relationship between socioeconomic characteristics and health outcomes, but the extent to which this
association exists within a low-resource setting is not known among older adults of LMICs in Southeast Asia,
particularly Cambodia. Considering individual nations' cultural and historical differences may impact how
socioeconomic characteristics are conceptualized and measured, a precise examination of the topic is
required. From the life course perspective, the older population with histories of violence and psychological
distress must be studied within their cultural and historical context. Using survey data collected by this
investigator in 2019, this study proposes to examine physical and psychological health of older Cambodians
residing in a rural and low-resource setting in the northwestern Cambodia, using contextually sensitive
measures and a rigorous theoretical framework. AIMS: This project aims 1) to characterize older Cambodians
in terms of demographic characteristics, social support, socioeconomic characteristics, and physical and
psychological health, 2) to examine associations of socioeconomic characteristics with physical health and
psychological health among older Cambodians, and 3) to investigate potential mediating roles of social support
and welfare support in the associations. METHODS: This study will use the most recent aging data of 220
older adults living in a rural setting of three Cambodian provinces. Dependent variables include the number of
health complaints and psychological well-being index. Independent variables are household wealth index and a
latent variable derived from three subjective self-perceived economic circumstances. Social support and
welfare support are operationalized using Social Support and Social Network scale and status of welfare
assistance, respectively. Descriptive analysis will be used to achieve Aim 1. Structural equation modeling will
be used to examined Aim 2 and Aim 3. IMPLICATION: Findings will reduce disparity in social aging research
in LMICs and have practical significance for development of programs and policies targeting older adults living
in rural and low-resource settings. This investigation will further our understanding of the contextual
socioeconomic characteristics and social support that may be modifiable to influence health for older adults in
low-resource communities. This project is in direct response to Objective F-3 of the NIA 2020-2025 Strategic
Direction to develop and implement strategies to increase inclusion of underrepresented populations in aging
research.

In our application entitled"" Lifespan extension by reverse fasting,"" we propose a new model connecting energy
metabolism and aging. In this model, longevity mechanisms are triggered by an energy deficit in which the food
intake does not provide enough energy to match the animal's energy expenditure (classical fasting). This
model further suggests that increasing energy expenditure while keeping food intake constant (reverse fasting)
should also generate an energy deficit that triggers longevity.
In this application, we use C. elegans to test these ideas. We find that the G protein-coupled receptor SER-7
controls energy expenditure. Activation of SER-7 by serotonin dose-dependently increases energy demand,
mitochondrial respiration, and subsequently food intake. In wild-type N2 animals increasing energy demand by
exogenous serotonin is consistently matched by an equivalent increase in food intake, preventing the
generation of an energy deficit. Testing eight different longevity mutants, we find that the ability to upregulate
energy expenditure and food intake is severely restricted in all but one of them, revealing the existence of a
general energy-saving mechanism in longevity mutants. For example, daf-2(e1370) mutants have roughly half
the respiration and food intake rate of wild-type animals, and their food intake in response to serotonin is
severely bunted. However, we identified a daf-2 mutant with an almost wild-type respiration and food intake
profile. Only the response to exogenous serotonin at high concentrations is slightly blunted, suggesting the
proposed energy-saving mechanism observed in daf-2(e1370) is not active. We find that the lack of an energy-
saving mechanism in that daf-2 mutant elevates the metabolic set point at which the dauer pathway is
triggered. The result is an animal that activates the dauer pathway at a point when it already eats twice as
much as wild type. This daf-2 mutant is the first confirmation of the reverse fasting hypothesis. It shows that it
is possible to generate animals that live long and overeat, as long as the energy expenditure is higher than the
energy intake. This application aims to identify the fasting/starvation-induced energy-saving mechanism and to
show that its inactivation will enable many longevity mutants to overeat and live long."

Impaired cognitive function after common surgical procedures is a growing concern especially among over 5
million people in the United States who suffer from dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and thus have
a 3-fold increased risk for fracture requiring surgical repair. After orthopedic surgery, acute changes in cognitive
function, often referred to as postoperative delirium, occur in up to 89% of patients with preexisting dementia,
and associate with poorer prognosis and even 2-fold greater risk for 1-year mortality compared to patients without
dementia or delirium. Our long-term goal is to define the mechanisms that underlie surgery-induced cognitive
dysfunction, and to provide safe and effective approaches to reduce this potentially devastating complication.
From R01-AG057525 we discovered that orthopedic surgery triggers an acute deposition of amyloid-β (A) in
the brains of transgenic Alzheimer’s (CVN‐AD) mice. This proposal continues to characterize the role of innate
immune dysregulation following a common orthopedic surgery (tibial fracture) on the blood-brain barrier (BBB)
and microglial activation using a model of postoperative delirium superimposed on dementia. The overall
objectives are to characterize the immune heterogeneity of delirium superimposed on dementia, and to evaluate
the efficacy of minimally-invasive percutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (pVNS) on microglial function and A
levels in AD-like mice after surgery. Our central hypothesis is that dysregulation of immune cell clusters and
elevated fibrinogen contribute to delirium-like behavior in AD mice after surgery, and that postoperative pVNS
attenuates this effect. This hypothesis is based on preliminary data acquired in the applicants’ laboratories, and
will be tested by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) Develop a single-cell atlas of the mouse brain with delirium
superimposed on dementia; 2) Analyze the mechanisms of microglial activation and A deposition after surgery
in AD-like mice with delirium; and 3) Define the impact of pVNS on BBB opening and microglial-dependent A
clearance after surgery. Feasibility for these models and techniques has been established in the applicants’
hands. In this innovative approach, we will employ functional transcriptomics with advanced computational
approaches to identify the innate immune single-cell landscape in response to surgical trauma and delirium-like
changes in the brain of dementia-prone mice. We will continue to characterize neuro-immune interactions and
changes in blood-brain function using both animal models as well as organ-on-chip technology. We will also test
the efficacy of pVNS to facilitate A clearance after surgery and limit the onset of postoperative delirium. The
rationale for the proposed research is that successful completion will advance and expand our understanding of
how surgery affects the innate immune system, and will provide new molecular mechanisms of relevance to
delirium, neurodegeneration, and aging. Such knowledge is highly significant because it has the potential to
explain how surgery impacts the vulnerable brain and identify novel targets to prevent postoperative delirium."

Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common form of blood cancer and is characterized by a
striking degree of genetic heterogeneity. It has been known for some time that African American patients have
poorer outcomes than Caucasian patients. After correcting for potential differences in socioeconomics and
access to care, our data indicate that the poorer outcomes in African Americans arise primarily from distinct
genetics of their tumors. The underlying genetic causes of these poorer outcomes have not been studied
systematically. Here, we propose to investigate tumor and germline genetics of African Americans to
comprehensively understand the genetic basis of their poorer outcomes. Preliminary genomic analysis of
African American DLBCL patients has revealed more frequent mutations in histone methyltransferase genes
and other genes. In this proposal, we seek to comprehensively define the genetic origins of poor outcomes in
African Americans with DLBCL and perform functional characterization of selected genomic alterations."

One of the major contributions of developmental psychology is the demonstration that early caregiving
experiences within the normative range (i.e., sensitive caregiving) not only contribute to offspring’s mental and
physical health disparities, but also that such associations are enduring over the life course. Research by the
PIs and others has identified brain mechanisms by which key maternal risk factors—depressive symptoms and
attachment insecurity—undermine caregiving behavior. However, given evidence documenting significant
change in the maternal brain over the transition to motherhood, there is a critical gap as to whether this transition
serves as a sensitive period during which maternal neural responding to infants is particularly impacted by
maternal depressive symptoms and insecurity that pose risk for caregiving behavior and infant adjustment.
Moreover, the majority of research has focused exclusively on mother-driven effects, limiting understanding of
the significance of infant characteristics for the maternal brain. Additionally, research on the maternal brain
primarily comprises samples of European ancestry women, thus, little is known about whether such processes
operate similarly in families of color. Therefore, this R01 application seeks to programmatically investigate
whether maternal psychological risk undermines maternal sensitivity and, in turn, infant adjustment via negatively
impacting change in maternal brain responding to infants over the transition to motherhood. Further, we will test
the role of infant characteristics (i.e., negative emotionality) in moderating this pathway. Critically, we include
expectant nulliparous European American (n=200) and African American (n=200) women to explore moderation
of our findings by maternal ethnicity. We further propose to identify person (parenting/emotion beliefs),
community (kinship/social support), and structural (discrimination) factors relevant to African American women
that may impact their neural adaptation to motherhood – comparing these findings to European Ancestry women.
We will examine maternal risk factors (depressive symptoms, attachment insecurity), multi-level factors relevant
to African American women, and brain responding to infant cues prenatally (3rd trimester) and postnatally (4 and
8 months). Postnatal assessments will include caregiving behavior (4, 8, and 12 months), infant negative
emotionality (4 and 8 months), and infant adjustment (12 months), including attachment security and behavior
problems. Our approach is innovative given its intergenerational, prospective, multi-level, and multi-time point
design and the ethnic diversity in the maternal sample enrolled. Our findings will inform models of the changing
maternal brain from pregnancy to the postpartum period and how maternal depression and attachment insecurity
may pose risk for maternal caregiving and infant adjustment as a function of infant negative emotionality and
maternal ethnicity. Furthermore, our approach will allow for more targeted intervention strategies for women
during their transition to motherhood to optimize mother and child well-being."
10757016,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term objective of this application is to improve the survival and quality of life for patients with
chondrosarcoma, a primary malignant bone tumor desperately in need of more effective treatments. The five-
year survival for chondrosarcoma, the most common bone sarcoma in adults, is an abysmal 10-25%, with most
patients succumbing to pulmonary metastases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has no effect on
chondrosarcoma, so the current standard of care is surgical resection. There has been no improvement in the
cure rate for chondrosarcoma in the last several decades. The goal of this proposal is to systematically evaluate
promising new treatment strategies that target aspartate β-hydroxylase (ASPH), a transmembrane protein that
is normally expressed during embryonic development, but not after birth. We have found that ASPH is re-
expressed in chondrosarcoma. In some carcinomas, ASPH signals through the Notch pathway to influence the
expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which support
cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. We have data suggesting that ASPH functions similarly in
chondrosarcoma. ASPH is highly expressed in >90% of chondrosarcomas, as are activated Notch and multiple
MMPs, and high ASPH expression correlates positively with tumor grade and poor long-term survival. Inhibition
of Notch is a long sought after but, as of yet, unachieved goal in cancer treatment. The work in this proposal will
advance ASPH as a potential therapeutic target by determining the relationship between ASPH and Notch in
chondrosarcoma. First, ASPH levels in human chondrosarcoma cell lines will be modulated using CRISPR-Cas9
gene editing, followed by treatment with a proven small molecule inhibitor (SMI) of ASPH. Changes in
proliferation, invasion, apoptosis, and Notch signaling will be used as mechanistic readouts of ASPH signaling
in vitro. Notch signaling will be manipulated in these ASPH-modulated cell lines with gain and loss of function
approaches to evaluate the role of Notch in ASPH signaling (Aim 1). Second, the role of ASPH and Notch in
chemotherapy resistance will be evaluated in human chondrosarcoma cell lines, and the ability of the SMI and
an ASPH-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) to enhance doxorubicin efficacy will be tested (Aim 2). Finally,
three different approaches to targeting ASPH will be evaluated in vivo using mouse chondrosarcoma models:
SMI inhibition of ASPH, SMI + doxorubicin, and an antibody-drug conjugate targeting ASPH linked to emtansine
(Aim 3). The completion of these aims will provide important insight into the biology of chondrosarcoma and
determine whether the therapeutic targeting of ASPH has potential as an effective strategy for the treatment of
these malignancies. The results may also have wider impact and be applicable to patients with other types of
bone and soft tissue sarcomas."
10746846,"Project Summary: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 3-5% of all cancers. Localized ablation is a
recommended treatment for T1a renal cancers (approximately 25% of all RCC) and particularly important for the
treatment of patients who are poor surgical candidates due to diminished renal function or with a solitary kidney.
Post-ablation imaging protocols for detection of recurrence vary, but mainly rely on contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) or contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CEMRI) at 3-12 months intervals.
However, detection of relapse based on detection of contrast enhancement within the ablation cavity can be
challenging on both modalities – due to most imaging findings of recurrence being nonspecific because of
changes in tumor size, enhancement from fat necrosis and scarring, and the development of calcifications
following therapy. Additionally, these techniques can be problematic due to modality and contrast agent
contraindications. As an alternative to CECT and CEMRI, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) has gained
acceptance for a variety of clinical applications. In small pilot studies, our group has demonstrated the ability of
CEUS to monitor for both residual and recurrent RCC following percutaneous ablation with 100% sensitivity and
no adverse events. While encouraging, our findings were based on a relatively small sample size and, with an
overall specificity of the technique that ranged from 75-96%, primarily due to an inability to properly identify the
boundaries of the ablation cavity from the surrounding renal cortex. To assess the clinical promise of CEUS, we
propose a larger, fully powered study, recruiting patients across multiple institutions and using multi-modality
imaging techniques to overcome these limitations and enable clinical adoption. In our first specific aim, we will
characterize the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and inter-reader agreement of both
2D CEUS and contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging for detecting recurrent RCC following ablation; we will
use a combination of long-term follow-up imaging and tissue pathology as a reference standard, instead of relying
on CECT or CEMRI. At each site, blinded radiologists with varying experience levels in CEUS will interpret
exams, enabling us to define these parameters while also quantifying reader variability. In the second aim, we
will evaluate the potential improvement to the qualitative assessments of 2D CEUS when fused with the patient's
pre-treatment cross-sectional imaging, which we hypothesize will provide better delineation of the initial tumor
boundary. In the third aim, we will assess the potential added value of using multi-modality volumetric CEUS for
detecting RCC recurrence post ablation and also an advanced Doppler non-contrast technique as an exploratory
sub-aim. Finally, we will explore use of quantitative parameters extracted from 2D/3D CEUS exams to determine
if this improves the overall performance of CEUS. At the study's conclusion, we hope to address the current
limitations in RCC recurrence surveillance imaging with fully powered CEUS study to support clinical adoption,
while also addressing prior limitations through the use of multi-modality and quantitative imaging."
10827908,"Differentiation is a fundamental process underlying cellular identity and plasticity. Traditionally, differentiation is
a transition between less committed/specialized cell states into more committed/specialized state, and this is
believed to be unidirectional. Differentiation is evident in development, division of stem cells, homeostasis or
normal turnover, regeneration following injury, and malignant transformation. Clusters of differentiated cells are
necessary for tumor cell invasion (collective invasion), intravasation, circulation, extravasation and metastasis
(colonization in a distant organ). We have unraveled the critical function of LIN28B (human), an RNA binding
protein, as a master regulator of reprogramming of differentiation in colorectal cancer (CRC) and metastasis.
Indeed, LIN28B plays essential roles in embryonic stem cell differentiation and inducible pluripotent stem cell
differentiation but its role in tumor metastasis is not elucidated. Having published that Lin28b (mouse) is
oncogenic in a genetic mouse model with the induction of colonic adenomas and CRC, and about one-third of
human CRC cancers overexpress LIN28B (in turn associated with worse outcomes), we have determined that
LIN28B induces the CDX2 transcriptional factor in promoting primary CRC differentiation. In addition, we have
new evidence that LIN28B directly targets Claudin-1 (CLDN1) mRNA to foster the formation of tight junctions
and cell-cell adhesion, which in turn induces NOTCH3 to modulate metastasis to the liver. We also have new
evidence that Lin28b endows in vivo mouse orthotopically implanted tumoroids that harbor Apc/Kras/p53
mutations to metastasize to the liver as they do not metastasize without Lin28b. Thus, we are defining new
mechanisms that reveal how LIN28B promotes differentiation at the primary CRC site and then leverages
previously unappreciated mechanisms to promote metastasis. We hypothesize that LIN28B promotes primary
CRC differentiation and mediates metastasis through induction and maintenance of a tumor differentiation
program that may involve distinct subclones destined for metastasis. This hypothesis will be pursued through
the following in vivo physiologically relevant interrelated Specific Aims: (1) To identify the molecular
mechanisms by which CLDN1 facilitates CRC metastatic progression in the context of LIN28B overexpression,
with NOTCH3 being an attractive target and determination of other targets; (2) To determine the contribution
of Lin28b to invasion, circulation and distant organ (liver) colonization in a syngeneic in vivo trackable model
of metastatic CRC, allowing us to span the entire metastatic cascade; and (3) To identify subpopulations in
primary CRC, potentially fated for metastasis (e.g. those cells that may display hybrid/partial EMT), and
determine the dependence of their phenotype on Lin28b by integrating single-cell RNA-seq with lineage tracing
(bar-coding). Our novel, mechanistic findings and innovative approaches allow us to provide insights into the
fundamental aspects of cellular differentiation in the context of primary CRC, and elucidate why such
differentiated tumor cells have a proclivity for metastasis, and thus address gaps in the field."
10753581,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a devastating disease of the blood vessels in the lung in which excessive
proliferation and impaired apoptosis contribute to vascular obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), RV
failure and eventually death. We discovered that the hyperproliferative phenotype in the pulmonary artery
smooth muscle layer is associated with a metabolic reprogramming that induces a Warburg phenotype. Further,
we demonstrated that the loss of mitochondrial bioenergetics in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMC)
isolated from pulmonary hypertensive rats (PH-PASMC) was due to a loss of electron transport chain (ETC)
Complex I assembly and activity. However, the mechanism by which the loss of Complex I assembly occurs is
unresolved and is the focus of our application. Our published studies have shown that cGMP-dependent protein
kinase G Iα (PKG-Iα) activity is attenuated in various models of PH through a mechanism that involves its
nitration. However, cGMP-independent PKG-Iα activity is increased in PH rats and is localized to mitochondria.
Interestingly, mitochondrial bioenergetics are also restored when PH-PASMC are incubated with a PKG inhibitor.
Overall hypothesis: Impaired mitochondrial function and the metabolic reprogramming in PH-PASMC occurs,
at least in part, through a previously unidentified signaling cascade mediated by the mitochondrial localized PKG-
Iα and is a viable therapeutic target in PH.
Approach: We will test our hypothesis using a variety of state-of-the-art methodologies that include structural,
biophysical, biochemical, functional assays as well as preclinical rodent models of PH. In specific Aim (SA) #1
we will elucidate the mechanism by which mitochondrial cGMP-independent PKG-Iα activity is enhanced during
the development of PH. SA#2 will then elucidate the role played by cGMP-independent PKG-Iα activity in the
loss of Complex I assembly in PASMC during the development of PH. SA#3 will validate cGMP-independent
mitochondrial PKG-Iα signaling as a PH target using novel therapeutic approaches.
Innovation and Impact: The discovery that mitochondrial targeted PKG-Iα disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics
and contributes to PH development is highly novel. Therapeutically, the observation that specifically blocking
mitochondrial PKG activity reverses the PH phenotype in monocrotaline (MCT)-treated rats suggests a new
metabolic and antiproliferative strategy. Overall, our explorations will significantly advance our mechanistic
knowledge of the interplay between PKG-Iα and PASMC metabolic reprogramming, promote a more thorough
understanding of the pathobiology of PH, while also evaluating novel therapies for treating these critically ill
individuals."
10907425,"Prompt closure of wounds is critical to prevention of infection and sepsis in patients suffering massive burn
injuries. The most common challenge associated with treating these patients is the lack of available donor skin.
Although new technologies are emerging to treat deep partial thickness burns, only one is commercially available
for the treatment of full-thickness burns (cultured epithelial autografts, CEAs). CEAs are a life-saving treatment
option; however, they are extremely fragile, prone to damage and require > 3 weeks to manufacture. As early
wound closure reduces the risk of infection, fluid loss, mortality and scarring, strategies to quickly and
permanently close full-thickness wounds are needed to increase survival and improve outcomes. The current
obstacles to rapid in situ regeneration of full-thickness wounds using cell sprays include the lack of viable dermis,
low engraftment efficiency and variable survivability of spray-on cells. Our team recently developed allogeneic
dermal substitutes with laser ablative dermal papillae that significantly enhanced keratinocyte proliferation. This
regenerative platform, consisting of freshly isolated autologous cell sprays and an off-the-shelf, allogeneic dermal
template with laser micropatterned dermal papillae and growth factor loaded rapid release nanoparticles, is
proposed to facilitate rapid, permanent wound closure via enhanced adhesion and survival of spray-on skin cells
and rapid angiogenesis. In Aim 1, spray-on skin cell engraftment and survivability will be examined as a function
of the form of the laser micropatterned dermal papillae (width, length, angle). Aim 2 seeks to further enhance
spray-on skin cell survivability and epidermal regeneration via enhanced angiogenesis. The role of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/ platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-releasing, high surface area to volume
polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles on the rate and extent of angiogenesis and downstream epidermal
regeneration will be assessed in a mouse model followed by a highly translational porcine model. In Aim 3,
gradient collagen-silk scaffolds will be fabricated to reduce contraction of the wounds while providing a physical
and chemical environment that promotes epidermal regeneration. Finally, the efficacy of the fully optimized laser
micropatterned dermal template (dermal papillae form, VEGF/PDGF-PDA loading and concentration and
scaffold mechanics) will be examined in a porcine burn model compared to standard autografting and spray-on
skin cells alone. The proposed studies leverage the expertise in regenerative medicine, vascularization and large
animal models to develop a novel, immediate use technology that can dramatically transform treatment for
patients suffering from massive burn injuries and improve outcomes and quality of life."
10744790,"ABSTRACT
The type and pattern of immune cell infiltrate in breast cancer is of growing clinical importance as they associate
with response to therapy and are the specific target of immunotherapy. `Cold' cancers that lack infiltrating T cells
exhibit pronounced transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) activity and predict poor outcomes in breast cancer
patients. However, the factors that influence the genesis of the type of tumor immune microenvironment (TiME)
have yet to be defined. We found that radiation-preceded breast cancers in women treated with radiation therapy
for Hodgkin's lymphoma are significantly enriched for TiME devoid of lymphocytes and rich in myeloid cells,
TGFβ and cyclooxygenase 2. We used a Trp53 null mammary chimera model to determine the factors
underpinning of this unexpected difference. Tumors with an immunosuppressive TiME lacking lymphocytes
arose only in irradiated mice, even when the transplant was not irradiated, indicating host biology was key, as
well as in mice lacking functional adaptive immunity, pointing to a role for innate immunity. Strikingly, transient
aspirin treatment before cancer developed blocked the development of cold tumors. We hypothesize that
systemic inflammation provokes the development of tumors with immunosuppressive, cold TiME. Chronic low-
level inflammation from aging, obesity, stress and chronic syndromes following viral infection is common. Here
we will test the specific hypothesis that inflammation-induced TGFβ during carcinogenesis alters tissue-resident
myeloid cells to promote the genesis of cancers with an immunosuppressive TiME. AIM 1 will use state-of-the-
art analysis of cytokines and immune characteristics that correlate with the development of tumors with cold
TiME using a novel biobank of blood, plasma, bone marrow, spleen, and nonmalignant mammary glands and
their associated cancers as a function of inflammation or anti-inflammatory aspirin conditions at 4-, 8- and 18-
months post-treatment. The relevance of these findings will be tested by immunoprofiling women with breast
cancer. AIM 2 will use parabiosis to test whether factors circulating during systemic inflammation contribute and
use macrophage depletion and a mouse in which myeloid cells cannot signal through TGFβ to test whether
circulating TGFβ elicits monocyte activation to promote the development of cold TiME. AIM 3 will analyze the
resulting high-content data using deep learning and bioinformatics methods to identify tumor subtypes and to
infer key events. The main goal of our study is to test the innovative hypothesis that inflammation-induced TGFβ
promotes cold tumors by altering tissue-resident myeloid cells during carcinogenesis. Our proposal to conduct
systematic, high content analysis and modeling of the mechanisms by which breast cancers develop with an
immunosuppressive TiME is highly significant in view of the growing clinical importance of the TiME."
10786072,"ABSTRACT: Complex mucosal networks impact the outcome of a urinary tract infection (UTI). UTIs caused
mostly by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) are common, highly recurrent, and a leading cause of antibiotic therapy
for otherwise healthy adult women. Thus, with dire predictions of antibiotic resistance reaching a tipping point, it
is imperative to better understand the mechanisms of recurrent UTIs (rUTIs) to avoid a future where ordinarily
treatable infections become unmanageable. 20-30% of women have a recurrence within 6 months of their initial
infection. In fact, history of UTI is an independent risk factor for subsequent UTI. Mouse models have shown that
upon UPEC infection of the bladder, a long-term remodeling of the bladder mucosa occurs, the nature of which
depends upon the inflammatory and infection history, which alters susceptibility to subsequent infection. This
remodeling, or “memory” of a prior infection, can include i) “trained immunity” of the bladder epithelium through
epigenetic reprogramming; ii) an adaptive immune response, which is sometimes protective; and iii) disruptions
of the gut microbiota due to oral antibiotic therapy leading to dysbiosis. Primary epithelial stem cells cultured
from bladders of mice with a history of infection recapitulate many of the reprogrammed morphologic and gene
expression features present in the convalescent mouse bladder. In addition, depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ T-
cells alters susceptibility to same-strain recurrence. UPEC also interact with the gastrointestinal tract (GIT)
microbiota, which is directly influenced by immune functions in the GIT, such as production of the cytokine
interleukin 22 (IL-22), which regulates mucin production and induces the expression of antimicrobial factors that
prevent invasive colonization. The GIT microbiota in turn shapes the composition of mucus. Understanding how
the GIT microbiota and mucosa work in concert to restrict UPEC colonization is therefore key to understanding
UPEC's relationship with the host. This proposal seeks to investigate how a prior infection leads to trained
immunity that alters the response and outcome of subsequent infections by: i) using robust mouse infection
models as well as cultured primary cells to probe chromatin modifications between cell lines derived from mice
with differential UTI disease histories and susceptibilities to rUTI, with particular focus on Programmed Cell
Death-associated genes, as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha and cyclooxygenase-2 (Aim 1); ii) probing how
prior infection shapes the formation of adaptive immunity at the bladder mucosa and how that modulates
susceptibility to recurrent infection (Aim 2); and iii) identifying microbial and mucosal immune mechanisms by
which the gut mucosa restricts UPEC colonization in health and dysbiosis and the roles of IL-22 and its binding
partner IL-22 binding protein in regulating the microbiota and mucus quantity and quality (Aim 3). The strength
of this proposal is that it seeks to understand different forms of infection memory that develop in response to an
initial infection including: i) trained immunity; ii) adaptive immunity; and iii) gut dysbiosis and how these host-
pathogen interactions lead to epigenetic imprints that predispose to future infections."
10798174,"Summary:
Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that is responsible for the conformational maturation of
signaling proteins associated with all ten hallmarks of cancer, making it a promising
target for the treatment of cancer, as multiple signaling nodes can be simultaneously
derailed as a consequence of Hsp90 inhibition. Moreover, researchers have shown that
Hsp90 inhibitors accumulate in tumors with high differential selectivity, making Hsp90 a
highly sought after target for cancer. Unfortunately, clinical trials with 17 small molecule
inhibitors have led to multiple detriments that have significantly dampened enthusiasm
for Hsp90 inhibitors, as increased levels of Hsp90 were observed in the clinic, which led
to dose-escalating toxicities among other concerns. Consequently, Hsp90 remains a
desirable target for the development of cancer chemotherapeutics, but new approaches
to inhibit the protein machinery are needed that do not induce Hsp90 levels. Through a
number of seminal studies, it has been shown that inhibitors of the Hsp90 C-terminal
domain can segregate Hsp90 inhibition from induction of Hsp90 levels, and therefore,
we propose in this application to optimize these compounds and to perform a number of
pre-IND studies on the best molecules in an effort to move them toward clinical

Craniofacial trauma leads to over 10 million emergency room visits per year in the US that cause a vast socio-
economic burden. Unlike small defects, large complex defects arising from traumatic avulsive injuries or
pathologic lesion resection require planned reconstruction or secondary surgery to regain bony union. Yet, these
defects do not spontaneously heal and are known as “critical size defects” (CSD). Attempts to induce bone
formation by vascularized autologous grafts led to donor site morbidity and low harvest volume. Further,
recombinant human bone morphogenic protein (rhBMP2) growth factor used with autograft often produces
harmful inflammation and swelling post-surgery. Alternatively, titanium (Ti) fixation plates lend structural support
to bony fragments but lack bioactivity to speed healing. Moreover, clinically available mesoporous BioglassTM,
FDA-approved polymers, or composite pastes or putties lack needed strength and bioactivity for bone healing.
Our goal is to bioengineer new biomaterials that target healing mechanisms for rapid defect repair. Bone healing
requires rapid regeneration of dense biomineral and vascular tissue, which depends on antioxidant activity to
promote cell migration and osteogenesis by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and angiogenesis by endothelial
cells (EC). Our objective is to stimulate bone healing by (1) revealing biomaterial chemistries that target MSC
and EC antioxidant activity (2) atomistically layer these biomaterials as coatings on Ti devices to enhance bone
defect healing; and (3) use new nanoparticles (NPs) chemistries embedded in biopolymer scaffolds for rapid
defect healing. We created silicon oxy-nitro-phosphide (SiONPx) by chemical vapor deposition as new coatings
for Ti mesh and nanoparticles (SiONPx-np) in biopolymer scaffolds that release antioxidant ions (Si4+). We
hypothesize that SiONPx enhances dense bone and vascular tissue healing and rapid bone repair via enhanced
antioxidant activity to promote angiogenesis and osteogenesis. In Aim 1, we will study the effect of Si4+ on the
promotion of these antioxidants during MSCs osteogenesis and ECs angiogenesis. In Aim 2, we will determine
the effect of SiONPx coatings to stimulate antioxidant promoters to hasten the local bone healing environment.
In Aim 3, we will use SiONPx-np-biopolymer scaffolds to stimulate antioxidant promoters to promote cell
migration, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis into scaffold structures to hasten the healing process.
Our central innovation is the development of a new class of implantable and printable materials that can
accelerate healing of craniofacial bone defects. Once such materials/devices become clinically available, there
is the promise that a significant advancement will have been made toward their translation in patients needing
rapid healing of large bone defects or fractures. These results will have a positive impact in supporting future
clinical trials of new antioxidant materials on biomedical devices that can reduce patient healing time, reduce
medical care cost, and increase the quality of newly formed bone in large defects."

Preterm birth (PTB), or birth before 37 weeks of gestation, was the second leading cause of infant death in the
US in 2017. Each year, more than $26 billion is spent on treatment and care of babies born prematurely, not
accounting for the lifelong impact of developmental and cognitive impairments. Earlier this year, the FDA
issued a recommendation that the synthetic progestin 17-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (OHPC, Makena®),
the only approved product for PTB prevention, be withdrawn from the market due to lack of clinical benefit in a
required post-market study. New and innovative therapeutic options for preventing PTB are desperately
needed, but the etiology of PTB is complex and the potential for tissue sampling and clinical trials during
pregnancy is limited. We recently developed an adapted mouse model of inflammation-induced PTB and a
unique nanomedicine-based approach for more efficient vaginal delivery of therapeutics to the reproductive
tract. Together, these new tools led to the first demonstration of therapeutic prevention of early intrauterine
inflammation-induced PTB that led to full term delivery of litters with high percentages of pup viability and
neurotypical motor development. The therapeutics delivered via the nanoformulation were histone deacetylase
inhibitors (HDACi) dosed with or without the need for additional exogenous progesterone (P4). HDACi prevent
deacetylation of histones, leading to more transcriptionally active chromatin, and thus, changes in gene
expression. We also observed that the P4/HDACi combination inhibited human myometrial cell contractility and
led to an increase in the ratio of P4 receptor (PR) isoform B (PR-B) compared to P4 receptor isoform A (PR-A),
which is thought to maintain uterine quiescence and cervical competence. This supports the idea that HDACi-
induced hyperacetylation creates a more favorable chromatin structure for ligand-bound PR to change the
gene expression profile in a manner that prevents PTB. The overarching goals of this proposal are to
determine the role of PR-B in the prevention of inflammation-induced PTB, to map epigenetic changes that are
specific to therapeutic treatment, and to evaluate whether the epigenetic changes are sufficient to reset the
uterine environment for normal fetal development. If these preclinical studies are successful, we will generate
fundamental mechanistic knowledge of epigenetic regulation in PTB, as well as identify new cellular pathways
that may be important targets for PTB prevention."

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and its subtype Crohn’s disease (CD) arise due to a loss of
tolerance to environmental antigens in genetically susceptible individuals. Longitudinal analysis
has identified an inverse correlation between rates of communicable parasitic diseases and IBD,
a phenomenon termed the “hygiene hypothesis.” Tuft cells have recently been identified as a
critical component for sensing and responding to parasitic infections. Our lab has recently
identified that tuft cells may be heterogeneous in their lineage and function in microbiome
response, and specific populations may be critical for mitigating inflammation in ileal inflammatory
disease. Here, we propose innovative experimental and computational approaches to dissect the
heterogeneity of tuft cell lineage, structure, and function as they relate to regulating immune
responses in in vivo models of CD. In aim 1, we will conduct single-cell sequencing, high
resolution microscopy, and functional secretory assays to understand lineage-structure-function
relationships in different tuft cell populations in mouse and enteroid models. In aim 2, we utilize
multiplex imaging, Cytometry Time-of-Flight (CyTOF), and cytokine profiling to probe the
downstream tuft-type 2 response network by utilizing several chemical and genetic models of
pathway ablation. Through our findings, we aim to make significant contributions to the current
understanding of tuft cell biology and epithelial-microbiome crosstalk in the intestine. Ultimately,
this research will allow us to diagnose, stratify, and, ultimately, treat patients with IBD and expand
the pool of targets in this complex, multifactorial disease."

 Catalytic Processes for Stereoselective Radical Cyclization Reactions
 Cyclic structures, including both carbocycles and heterocycles, are common motifs of natural
products and synthetic compounds with important biomedical activities. Among different approaches for
preparing cyclic molecules, radical cyclization represents one of the most powerful approaches for
construction of ring structures. Among a number of inherent synthetic advantages, radical reactions
typically proceed at fast reaction rates under mild and neutral conditions in a broad spectrum of
solvents and exhibit significantly high functional group tolerance. Furthermore, radical processes have
the capability to perform in a cascade fashion, allowing for the rapid construction of complex molecular
structures with generation of multiple stereogenic centers. To further enhance the synthetic applications
of radical cyclization, new approaches will be needed for achieving high control of their reactivity as well
as stereoselectivity, especially enantioselectivity, challenging issues that are intrinsically associated
with the “free” nature of radical chemistry.
 Guided by the mechanistic principles of metalloradical catalysis (MRC), this proposed research
explores a fundamentally different approach for controlling stereoselectivity of both C- and N-centered
radical reactions. Cobalt(II) porphyrins [Co(Por)], as stable 15e metalloradicals, can enable the
activation of diazo compounds and organic azides to cleanly generate C- and N-centered radicals,
respectively, with N2 as the only byproduct in a controlled and catalytic manner. The initially-formed C-
and N-centered radicals, which are termed as a-Co(III)-alkyl radicals and a-Co(III)-aminyl radicals,
respectively, remain covalently bonded with [Co(Por)]. They can undergo common radical reactions,
such as radical addition to alkenes and hydrogen-atom abstraction, but with effective control of
reactivity and stereoselectivity by the porphyrin ligand environment. In addition to the radical nature of
[Co(Por)], the low dissociation energy of Co–C and Co–N bonds plays a key role for the successful
turnover of the Co(II)-based catalytic processes, resulting in effective radical cyclization reactions.
Through the support of D2-symmetric chiral amidoporphyrin ligands with tunable electronic, steric, and
chiral environments, Co(II)-based metalloradical catalysis (Co(II)-MRC) will be applied for the
development of various radical cyclization processes for stereoselective construction of both carbocylic
and N-heterocyclic compounds with different ring sizes and varied degrees of molecular complexity.
 We hope these studies will ultimately lead to the development of cost-effective and environmentally
benign radical cyclization processes that can be successfully applied for the stereoselective synthesis
of biologically important natural products and pharmaceutically interesting small molecules."

 Innate immunity is an ancient defense response that evolved with the earliest metazoan creatures to
protect against microbial infection. These responses rely on the immediate recognition of microbes by
germline-encoded receptors, and drive the production of numerous chemical, biological, and cellular
responses to defend against infection. In the face of constant microbial assault, innate immunity is essential
for the survival of nearly all multicellular organisms. On the other hand, over-exuberant or inappropriate
innate immune responses are the underlying cause of morbidity and mortality associated with many
infectious, autoimmune, and autoinflammatory diseases. Thus, a thorough mechanistic understanding of
innate immunity has many potential applications in the development of the next generation of therapeutics.
This proposal exploits the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model for the study of innate immunity. Flies
offer many advantages for the study of innate immunity, including experimental tractability and a model
system without the complexity of adaptive immunity. The Drosophila immune response is also an excellent
model for vector insect species, and discoveries made in flies are being translated into new approaches to
control vector-borne diseases. Furthermore, many aspects of the Drosophila innate immune responses are
highly conserved with mammals, and this conservation has lead to paradigm shifting discoveries of Toll
receptors and NF-κB transcription factors. In the current cycle of this project, we have uncovered another
conserved aspect of innate immunity, implicating the SLC46 family of solute carriers in the delivery of
peptidoglycan fragments (muropeptides) to cytosolic innate immune receptors, in flies and mammals.
 In Drosophila, microbial infections are recognized by two distinct NF-κB signaling pathways, the Toll and
immune deficiency (Imd) pathways. The Imd pathway is triggered by DAP-type peptidoglycan from the cell
wall of certain bacteria, which binds and activates cell surface or the cytosolic receptors PGRP-LC or PGRP-
LE, respectively, and activates a NF-κB signal transduction system with significant similarity to the TNFR and
TLR/TRIF-dependent pathways in mammals. The long-term objective of this project is to understand in
molecular detail the mechanisms used by the Imd pathway to trigger effective immune responses, and to
translate key discoveries, made in this invertebrate model system, to mammals. In this proposal, we build on
past discoveries and move in important new directions, with two specific aims exploiting the Drosophila
model, and the third aim translating our recent discoveries to mammals. Aim1 investigates the expanded
SLC46 family of muropeptide transporters in flies, while Aim 2 is focused on the molecular and biochemical
mechanisms controlling signal transduction in the Drosophila Imd pathway. Aim 3 utilizes Slc46a2-/- mice to
elucidate the function of this transporter in the NOD1 pathway, and its role in inflammatory disease models ."
10788413,"Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are photosensitive, demonstrating an increased skin
sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) whereby even ambient exposure to sunlight can result in the
development of inflammatory skin lesions. Beyond the skin, however, UVR exposure can also trigger systemic
disease flares, with increased circulating autoantibodies and further injury of end organs. The mechanisms by
which UVR exposure at the skin can lead to flares of systemic autoimmunity are not well understood. Our
long-term goal is to delineate the mechanisms that connect photosensitivity with systemic disease flares. Skin
communicates with the immune system via lymphatic vessels which serve both to remove interstitial fluid from
skin and bring antigens and mediators to regulate draining lymph node immune function. Compromised
lymphatic flow results in increased and prolonged skin inflammation and alters the signals that reach the lymph
nodes, resulting in autoantibody generation over the long term. The importance of lymphatic flow in both skin
and lymph node regulation led us to examine lymphatic flow function in SLE. We show evidence of
compromised lymphatic flow in human SLE and multiple mouse models and that improving lymphatic flow in
SLE models reduces skin photosensitivity and draining lymph node plasmablast responses. Our goal with this
proposal is to understand the mechanisms by which lymphatic flow regulates draining lymph node immune
responses in lupus-like disease. We show preliminary data that improving lymphatic flow increases lymph
node fibroblastic reticular cell (FRC) expression of CCL2, driving the FRC-monocyte-plasmablast axis that
limits plasmablast survival. Improving lymphatic flow also downregulated skin interferon-I (IFN-I)-stimulated
gene expression and upregulated FRC CCL2 was dependent on the NOX2 subunit of NADPH oxidase.
Improving lymphatic flow additionally upregulated FRC expression of IMP2, an RNA binding protein that
detects N6-methyladenosine RNA modifications and stabilizes CCL2 mRNA, and regulatory T cell
accumulation in lymph nodes. These data suggest the following hypothesis: Improving lymphatic flow
reduces IFN-I signaling, upregulating FRC NOX2-mediated reactive oxygen species generation that drives an
IMP2-mediated program of FRC alterations. The resulting FRC CCL2 upregulation modulates monocyte and
regulatory T cell function in lymph nodes, limiting B cell responses. Our aims are to 1) delineate the
relationship between IFN-I and Nox2 in regulating FRC CCL2, 2) Understand the extent of contributions of
IMP2 to lymphatic-driven FRC phenotypic alterations, and 3) understand the mechanisms by which lymphatic-
driven FRC regulation reduces B cell responses. The proposal will help us understand how lymphatic function
contributes to lupus-like disease and delineate mechanisms by which FRCs are regulated and shape lymph
node function, paving the way to better understanding the relationship between photosensitivity and
autoimmunity."

Generating high quality oocytes is critical for a woman's fertility and health, and for healthy offspring. Nuclear
envelope membrane protein 1 (Nemp1) is a transmembrane protein of the inner nuclear envelope that we
found is needed for fertility in a wide range of organisms. Loss of Nemp1 in mice leads to near-sterility of
females, associated with loss of the oocytes that compose the primordial reserve. The remaining oocytes have
poor developmental competence, with defects in chromosome segregation, chromatin compaction and
completion of meiosis. GWAS studies show that variants in NEMP1 are associated with early menopause,
suggesting the role of Nemp1 in fertility is conserved to humans. Our long term goal is to understand how
Nemp1 functions at the nuclear envelope to promote oocyte quality and human fertility. In this grant we will use
mouse models to determine why loss of Nemp1 leads to reduced ovarian reserve and poor developmental
potential. We will determine when and how the ovarian reserve is lost, and define pathways involved in oocyte
loss. We will conduct gain of function and loss-of-function studies, to determine which cells require Nemp1 in
the mouse ovary. To identify Nemp1-interacting proteins, we will take advantage of novel mouse lines we
have generated, which allow us to conduct affinity-purification coupled mass spectrometry from resting and
growing oocytes. Our preliminary studies have revealed that Nemp1 accumulates into extremely large, regular
foci at the nuclear envelope, uncovering a novel nuclear envelope structure in growing oocytes. Proteomic
analysis will reveal other proteins that localize to these foci (which we term NECs). Super-resolution
microscopy and electron microscopy will define the structure of Nemp1 clusters and the adjacent nuclear
envelope. FRAP analysis will clarify the stability of the Nemp1 clusters, and associated proteins. Our
preliminary data indicate that chromatin compaction is disrupted in Nemp1 mutant oocytes, and that
transcription is deregulated. We will use RNAseq to define change in gene expression in Nemp1KO oocytes.
We will use ChIP-seq to define changes in histone modifications in mutant oocytes, and determine alterations
in 3D chromatin architecture using Hi-C. Our preliminary data indicate that a closely related gene, Nemp2, is
upregulated in Nemp1KO oocytes, so we will explore the contribution of Nemp2 to Nemp1 mutant
phenotypes. Our preliminary data indicate that the nucleoplasmic tail of Nemp1 can interact with chromatin in
cultured cells: we will clarify the regions of Nemp1-chromatin interactions in oocytes, using transgenic DamID
approaches. Together these studies will illuminate the function of the nuclear envelope, and the role of Nemp1
in supporting the creation of healthy oocytes."

FDA approved molecularly targeted therapies have not significantly reduced mortality in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Therefore, identification and characterization of novel targets
for developing effective therapies is warranted. In this proposal, we will develop endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) sensor IRE1 as a potential therapeutic target in NSCLC. Adverse conditions in
the tumor microenvironment (TME) can rapidly disrupt the protein folding capacity of the ER,
thereby triggering a state of cellular “ER stress”. The ER stress response arm of the unfolded
protein response, particularly the conserved IRE1-XBP1 pathway has emerged as a central
orchestrator of malignant progression. Activated during periods of ER stress, the IRE1 RNAse
domain cleaves its downstream target X-box binding protein (Xbp1) mRNA (inactive, XBP1u),
converting it to active isoform (XBP1s), which serves as a functionally active transcription factor.
We have determined that increased expression of XBP1s is associated with poor survival in
NSCLC, cancer cell-intrinsic deletion of IRE1 delayed malignant progression and extended
survival in mouse models of NSCLC. IRE1 deficiency triggered protective type-I IFN responses
associated with marked reprogramming of both the lymphoid and myeloid cell subsets. These
findings have led to the hypothesis that dysregulated IRE1-XBP1s signaling in cancer cells
facilitates NSCLC progression by governing key immunomodulatory programs in the tumor
microenvironment (TME). Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms has the potential
to generate unique therapeutic strategies against difficult to treat NSCLC.
We will determine mechanisms by which persistent activation of ER stress sensor IRE1 drives
immunosuppression in the TME (Aim 1), determine if pharmacological inhibition of IRE1α
sensitizes NSCLC to PARP inhibitors, and STING agonists by enhancing type-I IFN responses
(Aim 2), and assess the clinical relevance of a novel IRE1 gene signature in predicting treatment
outcomes in human NSCLC (Aim 3). This proposal is conceptually and technically innovative as it
seeks to investigate for the first time how cancer cell-intrinsic IRE1α activation drives
immunosuppression in the TME that facilitates immune evasion by disrupting cDC1 function and
blunting type-I IFN responses. We expect that the mechanistic insights from these studies will
generate unique translational opportunities that may lead to the design of future clinical trials with
clinical grade IRE1 inhibitors."

The goal of this NEW PROJECT is to engineer liver tissue grafts in which the timing and extent
of graft vascularization and expansion in a living host is directly manipulable. In vivo, cell-to-cell
communication mediated through paracrine signals is a hallmark of multicellular life, and in the
liver is thought to play a critical role in driving tissue vascularization and growth. In collaborative
studies, the investigators have recently established experimental models of liver tissue that
incorporate hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and stromal cells spatially patterned to bolster these
cell-cell interactions. These interactions enable vascularization regenerative expansion of
engineered human liver tissue both in vitro, in a microfluidic human liver model, and in vivo, in
an ectopically implanted human liver graft. In this proposal, the investigators will build upon
these model systems by leveraging synthetic transcription factors to take control over the
dynamics of paracrine signaling within the engineered livers to enable controlled, on-demand
tissue vascularization and expansion. The specific aims of this new proposal are: (1) To build
functional vasculature in engineered tissue through synthetic vascularization, (2) To establish
on-demand expansion of engineered functional liver tissue through synthetic regeneration, and
(3) To develop approaches for system integration and robustness in suboptimal host
environments. Together, leveraging both in vitro and in vivo models, these efforts will endow
precise control of function, expansion, and engraftment of engineered vasculature and hepatic
parenchyma and will more generally establish a new approach for synthetic control of
engineered tissues that will advance engineered organ grafts closer towards clinical utility."
10877165,"The proposed 5-year R01 study will examine maturational pathways of biomarkers (neural connectivity and
stress physiology) to adverse patterns of substance use (APSU) in adolescents with anxiety symptoms to
improve precision-based, targeted intervention. Anxiety remains one of the most commonly diagnosed clinical
symptom domains in adolescence and is a potent precursor to and exacerbator of substance use disorder,
although there is substantial heterogeneity in outcomes. As such, detection of anxiety symptoms alone
provides limited information about the predictability, pathophysiology, progression, and preventability of
anxiety-linked APSU. Key to understanding how anxiety symptoms increase risk for APSU may be found in a
disruption of neural pathways that subserve executive cognitive modulation of threat information processing
and response. We propose that local alterations in threat processing circuitry (e.g., the central extended
amygdala) during anticipation or unpredictability of threat, and stress physiological dysregulation (heart rate
variability and salivary cortisol) during a social stress task, underpin internalizing symptoms. However, local
intra-network alterations likely do not fully explain pathways from internalizing symptoms (anxiety) to
externalizing behaviors (APSU). Thus, we further propose that a breakdown in coordination between cognitive
control circuity (frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular) and threat processing circuitry will be expressed in both
weakened neural connectivity and poorer task performance, which will predict APSU in adolescents with
anxiety symptoms at high risk for SUD. Across development, we expect these neuronal and physiological
features will become even more pronounced and sex differences will become increasingly prominent.
 Our objective is to elucidate the role of maturational change across adolescence in neural connectivity
between fronto-limbic subsystems and physiological stress responses to an acute stressor in the relationship
between anxiety and APSU. We propose to chart the developmental progression of neural and stress
physiological factors that confer risk for APSU in adolescents with anxiety symptoms by conducting a
prospective, longitudinal study of adolescents (N=180, age 12-14), including three 12 month waves of data
collection. Eligible participants will report anxiety symptoms and substance use naïvete and will be
oversampled (50%) on the basis of high risk for adolescent SUD using an established cut-off on a well-
established risk inventory. Graph theory will be applied to functional connectivity estimates of MRI data at rest
and during cognitive control, inhibition, and threat processing tasks to test an integrative, multi-modal model
with physiological, behavioral and survey measures to track trajectories of neurodevelopment. Identifying
biomarkers predictive of APSU in at-risk adolescents is critical to the design of program components more
precisely targeted to neural and physiological systems that support self-regulation, with potential to achieve
more than the small to modest effect sizes currently produced by even our most efficacious interventions."
10752653,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – The incidence of gastric and breast cancers is increasing rapidly, rating
fourth and fifth leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide. In patients clinically classified as HER2-positive
(ERBB2 amplification and/or 2+/3+ protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry), antibody-drug conjugates
(ADC) prolong progression-free and overall survival. However, these therapies have low activity in HER2-low
cancer cells, and not all HER2-positive tumors benefit, or even those who initially respond inevitably develop
resistance over time. Guided by preclinical data we obtained in HER2 heterogeneous patient-derived xenografts
demonstrating that an increase in HER-ADC endocytosis enhances therapeutic efficacy, we developed
approaches of antibody delivery that result in a 15.5-fold increase of ADC internalization in cancer cells. Our
novel approach uses pertuzumab and trastuzumab-drug antibodies that click at the surface of cancer cells upon
binding distinct HER2 domains to increase the number of HER2-ADC complexes and further enhance the rate
of HER2-ADC endocytosis. Antibody-PET imaging studies that we have generated demonstrate that our
approach increases the uptake of 89Zr-ADC in heterogeneous tumors containing HER2-high and HER2-low
cancer cells. Here, we will optimize clickable pairs of two epitope-distinct antibody-ADC biomolecules to enhance
tumor targeting and drug delivery in resistant models of breast and gastric cancer. In addition to test the potential
of our approach in cancer cell lines and organoids, we will perform randomized imaging and therapeutic studies
in patient-derived breast and gastric xenografts representing three tumor populations: ADC-eligible tumors of
HER2 heterogeneity, ADC-ineligible tumors, and ADC-resistant tumors. We will determine the molecular imaging
(89Zr-Antibody PET), safety, pharmacokinetic profile, and therapeutic efficacy of ADC alone (no-click) versus
ADC plus pertuzumab conjugated with clicking pairs (click). These randomized preclinical studies will allow us
to identify molecular features that confer drug sensitivity or resistance to this promising investigational approach.
Aim 1 will optimize pertuzumab/ADC clicking pairs with improved tumor uptake and drug delivery when compared
with ADC monotherapies and Aim 2 will validate the use of antibody clicking pairs as a new therapeutic approach.
The two aims will provide important new preclinical data on the use of antibody clicking pairs to enhance drug
delivery, which could provide an excellent foundation for many future investigations, including the clinical
translation of using clicking pairs to enhance drug delivery and the potential broader application to other
membrane receptors and heterogeneous tumors. The long-term translational objectives of the studies proposed
are to establish a foundation for a clinical trial using antibody clicking to prevent or delay drug resistance in
patients with heterogeneous breast and gastric cancers."

Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment of patients with end-stage renal disease compared to dialysis
in terms of patient survival, quality of life and cost. One of the most common causes of premature graft loss
after kidney transplantation is alloimmune-mediated injury. HLA alloantigens represent a significant barrier to
long-term allograft outcome. Kidney allograft failure is often caused by recipient immune recognition of foreign
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins of the donor organ. The HLA gene complex comprises multiple loci
and has a high degree of genetic polymorphism. HLA amino acid (AA) polymorphisms strongly impact key
structural and functional features of HLA molecules, including allorecognition by T cells and alloantibody.
Previous studies have shown that mismatches (MMs) at HLA antigens are associated with worse outcomes,
with the highest risk of graft failure (GF) particularly associated with HLA-DRB1 MMs. However, the relative
impact of AA variation is unknown because organ allocation systems have not collected comprehensive
molecular HLA typing data. Single-center studies using high resolution HLA typing to evaluate MMs at surface-
exposed amino acids (termed “eplets”) have shown that the number of MMs correlates with the presence of de
novo donor specific antibodies (dnDSA) and GF. However, these studies involved relatively few subjects and
were not representative of the ethnically diverse transplant population. In addition, these studies assumed
monotonic risk increase, a gap that we plan to address in this grant application.
We will use HLA imputation methods that we have developed to unlock the capability to utilize the SRTR
database for association analysis of AA MM categories with graft failure. In addition, we will validate and
further investigate AA MM associations using a large multi-center cohort of kidney transplants wherein high
resolution HLA class I and class II typing is readily available. We will also evaluate associations of HLA AA MM
assortments with risk of dnDSA development. This project aims to answer several unresolved questions about
HLA AA MMs and outcomes: (1) Which HLA loci are most important to match? (2) On top of antigen-level
mismatches, can amino acid level mismatches further stratify outcomes? (3) Are some assortments of AA or
AA motifs more important to match for than others? Our team has developed a machine learning feature
engineering to discover and optimize AA MM groupings (bins) associated with GF and dnDSA. Improved
patient risk stratification may help identify which transplant recipients would benefit from less aggressive
immunosuppressive regimens and by reducing the number of repeat transplants due to graft failure with a
poorly matched donor. Our approach generalizes broadly to other organ transplantation and possibly to
hematopoietic cell transplantation."
10791789,"Project Summary
 Cortical activity is highly dependent on behavioral state of an animal with different states, such as sleep and
wake, having profound impact on cognition and cortical processing. At the brain level, behavioral states (such
as sleep and wakefulness) are associated with distinct patterns of cortical activity (or cortical states), that are
well captured by oscillatory activity measured with EEG and/or LFP. Recent work shows that cortical states
regulate processing of local neuronal information as well as the communication between brain areas, and despite
this important function, relatively little is known about the circuits underlying these distinct states of network
activity. Inhibitory neurons (INs), though they make up a minority of cells in the cortex, are well positioned to
regulate cortical state. While the vast majority INs in the cortex project locally, there is a subtype of cortical IN
that projects over a long distances in stark contrast to other INs. These cells arborize densely throughout the
cortex, can span over different cortical regions, and are remarkably unique in terms of gene expression and
morphology. Even though they constitute a very small portion of INs, they are evolutionarily conserved,
suggesting that these cells play an important role in brain function. Their massive axonal arborization suggests
that these cells can coordinate the activity of many downstream cells. Though this IN cell type is completely
unique in its morphology and potential role in cortical circuits, we do not understand its function, though, I
hypothesize it is crucial for regulating synchronized slow cortical rhythms. Here we will use new intersectional
genetic tools in the mouse, to gain access to this distinct neuronal type and to interrogate the in vivo functional
role of SST/nNOS INs in cortical circuits. The long projections and dense cortical arborizations of SST/nNOS
cells make them a good candidate to synchronize activity across large areas. Furthermore, ex-vivo studies
suggest that long-range inhibitory neurons are likely to be active during periods of highly synchronized brain of
slow wave sleep (SWS). This state is characterized by a slow oscillation between UP and DOWN states that is
tightly synchronized across millimeter distances in the cortex. While many believe transitions between UP and
DOWN states arise solely from interactions between pyramidal cells, recent work suggests that an unknown
mechanism exists to initiate the sharp and synchronous DOWN state transition across millimeter areas. I
hypothesize that the activity pf SST/nNOS cells is critical for the generation of slow cortical rhythms and the
transition from UP to DOWN states."

 PI: Eugene Pietzak, MD
SUMMARY
Our overall goal is to develop therapies that selectively target molecular alterations responsible for progression
of bladder cancers from non-invasive to the often-lethal muscle-invasive disease state. For patients with non-
muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), the current standard is bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), a
nonspecific immunotherapy instilled directly into the bladder lumen. While BCG can reduce the risk of disease
recurrence, a proportion of patients subsequently progress to muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Our
preliminary results indicate that this disease state, termed “secondary MIBC”, is resistant to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. The goals in the current proposal are to understand the genomic basis for treatment resistance
to BCG and to identify alternative molecularly directed treatments that can achieve disease cure without the
need for radical surgery. The studies proposed are based on preliminary data indicating that cytotoxic
chemotherapy sensitivity in bladder cancer is influenced by somatic and germline genomic profiles, in
particular mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) pathway genes, most commonly within the nucleotide
excision repair gene ERCC2. As our preliminary data suggest that mutations in DDR pathway genes may also
confer sensitivity to BCG, we hypothesize that prior treatment with BCG results in cross-resistance to
subsequent systemic chemotherapy. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage several prospectively assembled
bladder cancer cohorts, including tumor pairs collected pre-BCG and following progression to MIBC. These
cohorts will be used to validate DDR mutations as predictors of BCG and cisplatin-based chemotherapy
sensitivity and to identify mechanisms of progression from NMIBC to secondary MIBC. As genomic
heterogeneity is common in bladder cancer, we will supplement bulk sequencing studies with multi-regional
sequencing and analysis of cell-free DNA from urine to define the influence of tumor heterogeneity on cancer
outcomes in early-stage bladder cancer. Our preliminary analyses of high-risk NMIBC and secondary MIBC
have also identified ERBB2 mutations/amplifications as potential mediators of progression to muscle-invasive
disease. Several unique patient cohorts will be used to define the frequency of ERBB2 mutation/ amplification
and HER2 overexpression in high-risk NMIBC and secondary MIBC. Prior functional studies of the role of
HER2 in bladder cancer pathogenesis have been impeded by a lack of patient-derived models with ERBB2
mutations and gene amplification. We will thus leverage a recently developed biobank of patient-derived
organoid models containing ERBB2 mutation/amplification to study the associations between ERBB2
mutational status/HER2 expression, oncogenic dependence on HER2, and sensitivity to HER2-directed
antibody drug conjugate therapy, a promising breakthrough therapy for metastatic bladder cancer. In sum, our
long-term translational goals are to use integrated clinical and laboratory studies to develop more effective
and less toxic treatments for patients with localized bladder cancer, a frequently fatal yet understudied disease."

protect the fetus against xenobiotic exposures, many xenobiotics can cross the placental barrier, making the
SULTs especially important determinants of the impact of xenobiotic exposures on developmental processes.
Our research group has shed new light on the hepatic expression patterns of the SULTs during human
development. For example, we were the first to show that human estrogen sulfotransferase (SULT1E1), a
major estrogen-inactivating enzyme, is robustly expressed in liver during gestation and substantially down-
regulated after birth. However, the mechanisms that control the temporal expression of SULT1E1 and other
prenatally-expressed SULTs, such as SULT1C2, are unknown. Also, the substrate specificities and enzymatic
mechanisms of some SULTs are not adequately defined. In the proposed project, we will determine the
mechanisms that control SULT1C2 and 1E1 expression during human liver development and will characterize
in detail the enzymology of SULT1C2, one of the least studied of the SULTs, in order to understand its function
in the developing human. We hypothesize that expression of the SULT1C2 and 1E1 genes is first upregulated
and subsequently downregulated during human hepatocyte differentiation through the concerted action of a
network of liver-enriched transcription factors, additional differentiation-associated transcription factors, and
coregulators. We further hypothesize that the major substrates of SULT1C2 include endogenous molecules
that are abundant during prenatal life as well as multiple classes of xenobiotics, and that substrate selectivity
and catalytic activity are markedly influenced by structural rearrangements that are induced by binding of the
SULT co-factor 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate. The specific aims of this project are to: (1) define the
region(s) of the SULT1C2 and 1E1 genes that control their transcription in models of human hepatocyte
differentiation; (2) identify the transcription factors and coregulators that control SULT1C2 and 1E1
transcription in models of human hepatocyte differentiation and in human liver specimens; and (3) characterize
the structure-function activity of human SULT1C2. This project will increase our fundamental knowledge about
the mechanisms that control endogenous and foreign chemical metabolism during human development,
uncover new information about the function of a major SULT that is expressed during prenatal life, and provide
new insight into the types of environmental exposures that could dysregulate SULT expression and function
during this most vulnerable period of life."
10794964,"Sepsis, life-threatening organ dysfunction due to a dysregulated host response to infection, is prevalent and
highly lethal. Early detection is a major challenge, largely because, as we and others showed, sepsis is a
heterogeneous syndrome, with many patients presenting with vague symptoms and signs; improved biomarkers
would enable earlier diagnosis, especially of these patients. A second major challenge is the shortage of
treatments, as mechanisms of immune dysfunction and vascular leakage in sepsis are poorly understood,
limiting therapeutic development. We hypothesize that unbiased single-cell transcriptional profiling (scRNA-seq)
of circulating immune cells will identify transcriptional signatures that address both challenges. In our proof-of-
principle study (Reyes et al. Nat Med 2020), we discovered a unique monocyte cell state (MS1) that is expanded
in patients with urosepsis and absent in patients with milder urinary tract infection or healthy controls. MS1
discriminates septic patients from patients with other diseases in public transcriptomic data, in a second cohort
of bacterial sepsis, and in preliminary data from our new cohort of patients with sepsis from any body site. Our
goals in this proposal are to test the hypothesis that when extended to patients with sepsis from all body sites,
unbiased single-cell approaches will generate immune signatures that distinguish sepsis from non-infectious
organ dysfunction, define new clinically-relevant sepsis endotypes, identify markers that enhance sepsis
diagnostics and subtyping, and reveal critical mechanistic biology underlying the immune dysfunction and
vascular leak present in sepsis, thus facilitating future development of endotype-specific therapeutics. In this
proposal, we will test our hypothesis that among patients presenting to the ED with acute organ dysfunction,
transcriptional signatures can be identified that distinguish those with sepsis from those with non-infectious
etiologies. We propose to: (1) discover blood single-cell transcriptional signatures that discriminate sepsis from
non-infectious organ dysfunction, define unbiased molecular endotypes, and associate with clinical outcomes
(Aim 1); (2) identify cell surface markers associated with scRNA-seq-defined cell states, including MS1, that are
significantly expanded in sepsis (Aim 2); (3) define alterations in cellular functions in patients and mice with
sepsis and in response to sepsis-induced MS1 cells (Aim 3). The proposed studies are highly likely to lead to
substantially improved cellular and molecular signatures for sepsis that could be translated into clinical use and
to new insights into the nature of immune dysregulation in sepsis. Investigations into the function of genes and
pathways identified in our studies will impact mechanistic understanding of sepsis and may lead to new
therapeutic concepts, especially for subsets of sepsis patients stratified based on single cell-derived molecular
endotypes. Whereas sepsis remains among of the most challenging problems in human health, our use of a
high-resolution unbiased approaches to address the major questions of heterogeneity and mechanism will
provide highly useful datasets for the field and promote the development of new targeted therapeutics."
10781929,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The worldwide adoption of artemisinin (ART)-based combination therapies (ACTs) has been instrumental in
halving the global burden of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria since the early 2000s; however, progress has
stalled since 2015. Malaria’s impact remains vast, with an estimated 405,000 deaths in 2018. Now, Pf resistance
to ART derivatives and their ACT partner drugs threatens to overwhelm control efforts. Parasites resistant to
ART and piperaquine (PPQ), mediated primarily by mutations in the genes k13 and pfcrt respectively, have
swept through the low-transmission setting of Southeast Asia. The development of ACT resistance in Africa, with
94% of the global malaria burden, would be calamitous. A major warning sign is the increasing prevalence of an
ART resistance-conferring K13 mutant in Rwanda, and of other K13 mutations in nearby countries. Herein we
confront the prospect of ACT resistance emerging in Africa. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that African Pf
strains rarely pose a biological obstacle to K13 mutations driving ART resistance. By gene editing geographically
diverse African strains, we will identify the most resistant mutations and assess the impact of the parasite
background, which can substantially influence the levels of resistance and fitness. Having recently completed
two Pf genetic crosses between Cambodian ART-resistant K13 mutants and the drug-sensitive African parasite
NF54, we will map and confirm secondary ART resistance modulators. We will also test whether resistance can
be attributed to loss-of-function mutations that restrict hemoglobin endocytosis in early ring stages. In Aim 2, we
will test the hypothesis that mutant K13 will exert a substantial fitness cost in African parasites, which could
impede its spread in high-transmission settings. One approach will be to quantify growth rates of barcoded K13
mutant and wild-type isogenic lines. We also hypothesize that ART resistance in Asian parasites evolved via a
gain of K13 mutations combined with compensatory fitness mutations, and will use our genetic cross progeny to
map and confirm fitness modulators. In Aim 3, we will pursue determinants of Pf resistance to the ACT partner
drugs PPQ, lumefantrine (LMF), pyronaridine (PND) and amodiaquine (ADQ) in African parasites. Gene editing
will be used to test the hypothesis that PPQ resistance can arise through single point mutations in African PfCRT
haplotypes. Efforts to identify determinants of resistance to LMF and PND will employ selections with hyper-
mutable African lines. We will also leverage the discovery in one of our genetic crosses of a two-component
basis of ADQ resistance that includes pfcrt and an unknown determinant on chromosome 12. The identification
of these markers will provide a valuable tool to screen for ADQ resistance. This proposal, which aligns with the
NIAID priority of supporting research on antimicrobial drug resistance, is designed to proactively prepare for the
dire possibility of ART and ACT resistance emerging in Africa by identifying causal determinants and mutations
and assessing whether fitness costs can impede the spread of resistance in African transmission settings."

will best serve investigators from a variety of research areas. The DRPP integrates well into the programmatic
goals of the Overall Component Specific Aims 2 and 5 by providing research opportunities to faculty and
students that meet high standards of research excellence. An estimated pool of 700 faculty is eligible for the
DRPP. To accommodate diverse research/teaching appointments, three stratified levels of faculty research
participation, each with specific obligatory milestones, will be available. The top-tier, a DRP Investigator,
requires >50% research effort. An “on-ramp” (tier-two) to this level is a Pilot Project Investigator, requiring
>25% research effort. Although faculty at the research-intensive institutions are eligible, emphasis will be to (i)
strengthen the research environment at the primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), (ii) integrate research
into the PUI educator's career, and (iii) expose PUI students to meritorious research. To further encourage
research at the PUIs and community colleges, a third-tier of participation will be the Student Research Mentor

10798241,"The syndrome of knee pain and meniscal tear is prevalent in persons ≥ 45 years old, and associated with
substantial pain, disability, and cost. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that initiating
physical therapy (PT) in persons with this syndrome is associated with similar levels of pain relief as
performing arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM). As a result, initial treatment with PT is now the standard
of care. Those who do not respond to PT are often referred for APM, though there have been no trials of
whether APM is efficacious in this setting.
This planning grant lays groundwork for an RCT to address this important evidence gap. The study team at
Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and University of Buffalo plans an RCT that enrolls persons with knee
pain, meniscal tear and osteoarthritic changes into a run-in period in which subjects receive a standardized PT-
based regimen. We will identify those with persistent pain despite PT and invite them to be randomized to
either APM or a nonoperative regimen that includes intra-articular injections, an enhanced PT and exercise
program, and additional support provided with web-based, telehealth, and face-to-face encounters with the
research and clinical teams. We will assess pain relief and other outcomes over a two-year period. To prepare
for the RCT, we apply for a planning grant with the following specific aims:
• Finalize the operative and enhanced nonoperative regimen including choice of injection, specific exercise,
 and educational and support materials.
• Assess and ensure physician equipoise for the two treatment strategies.
• Estimate the number of eligible subjects/month and conduct model recruitment
• Obtain Single IRB approval with BWH as governing IRB
• Develop key study documents including clinical protocol, manual of operating procedures, safety
 monitoring and data monitoring and management plans, statistical analysis plan, recruitment and retention
 plan, and training/certification plans

10771266,"ABSTRACT
Infant brain and regulatory systems develop rapidly in the first months of life and set the stage for healthy
behavioral and emotional development. Research shows that these systems are shaped, to a large extent, by
the postpartum caregiving environment. In particular, mother-infant interactions that are characterized by shared
positive affect and mutually responsive behavior facilitate the development of infant emotional self-regulation via
mother-infant co-regulation of homeostatic and neural systems. In the context of postpartum depression (PPD)
however, growing evidence suggests that these processes are disrupted with potentially long-term adverse
implications for the infant. However, several critical gaps remain. First, little is known about the neural substrates
of dyadic co-regulation despite the promise of recent advances in portable neuroimaging tools (i.e., near-infrared
spectroscopy [NIRS] hyperscanning). Second, although positively valenced systems are fundamental to healthy
adjustment and to strengths-based parent-child behavioral interventions, research has focused predominantly
on negative affect and deficit models. Third, there is a lack of longitudinal research examining developmental
change in co-regulatory behaviors and PPD severity that could inform preventive interventions. The proposed
study aims to fill these gaps, and is supported by preliminary proof-of-concept data that mothers and children
show concordant responding in medial frontal and lateral frontal regions, which are implicated in social cognition,
bonding, and mentalizing, and that positive synchronous interactions heighten these concordant responses. The
Specific Aims are to: 1) Characterize mother-infant bio-behavioral synchrony (matching of affective behavior and
brain response) at 3 months postpartum; 2) Examine concurrent and prospective associations between PPD
severity and mother-infant positive bio-behavioral synchrony; and 3) Examine the extent to which improvements
in mother-infant positive bio-behavioral synchrony predict infant emotional regulation. Using a case-control
design, we will recruit 176 women endorsing PPD (n=140 at study completion) and 87 women with no prior
history of depression (n=70 at study completion) with their 3-month-old infants and conduct three research visits
in the home environment to increase participation of difficult-to-reach and vulnerable families. We will assess
bio-behavioral synchrony in mother-infant face-to-face interactions at 3-, 6- and 9-months during simultaneous
mother-infant NIRS. Micro-analytic coding will provide moment-to-moment measures of positive and negative
affect and contingent responding, and NIRS will provide measures of dyadic concordance in mother and infant
anterior medial and lateral prefrontal cortical activity. Change in PPD will be assessed via clinical interviews at
each home visit, in addition to monthly screening from 3 to 9 months. Infant emotional self-regulation will be
assessed at 9 months via independent observations and maternal report."
10807112,"Abstract
Obesity contributes to the development of type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases, while weight loss ameliorates the risk for these maladies. Current medical therapies remain inadequate to combatting the ongoing US obesity epidemic, however- in part because some of the most promising obesity drugs promote aversive responses (e.g., nausea) that limit their therapeutic utility. To design improved obesity therapies, we must understand the mechanisms of action for and relationships among circuits that control food intake and that mediate nausea. The area postrema (AP) senses nutrients and potentially harmful substances and contains receptors that represent important targets for obesity therapy. Single-cell analysis reveals that the AP contains two major populations of glutamatergic (GLU) neurons: The first (GLU10) contains Calcr-expressing (CalcrAP) neurons that also contain RAMP3 (and thus AmyR). The other (termed GLU4) consists of multiple subpopulations, including one marked by Prlhr (PrlhrAP cells) and another marked by Gfral (the receptor for GDF15; GfralAP cells); both subpopulations express Glp1r. A single population of GABAergic AP neurons contains Gipr-expressing (GiprAP) cells. We hypothesize that CalcrAP neurons respond to amylin and other nutrient-stimulated signals and promote non-aversive satiation, while pathologic signals stimulate GLU4 cells (including Glp1rAP, PrlhrAP, and GfralAP neurons) to promote aversive anorexia. Together with the ability of GIPR agonists to blunt some aversive responses, the predominantly local projection pattern of AP GABA neurons leads us to hypothesize that nutrient-responsive GiprAP cells represent “anti-nausea” neurons that inhibit GLU4 cells, attenuating their aversive effects. We also postulate that GiprAP neurons inhibit only specific GLU4 subpopulations and thus modify only a subset of AP-mediated aversive signals. While the mouse represents the most common mammalian genetic system, rats provide richer behavioral assays and permit the precise manipulation of AP neurons by stereotaxic methods. Rats also more closely model the human response to AmyR agonists. Hence, we have developed a panel of genetically-modified rat lines to target AP neurons that express receptors for key pharmacologic agents, enabling us to define the functions and mechanisms of action for distinct subsets of AP neurons. The results of these studies will permit the rational design of agents for the therapy of obesity that target the most advantageous components of these circuits."
10757707,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Vaccination is the greatest public health achievement of our time. With an explosion of antibiotic resistance,
new vaccines against multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens are more important than ever.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is an opportunistic human pathogen that causes severe infections in patients
with cystic fibrosis (CF), burns, severe wounds, pneumonia, as well as critically ill patients who require intubation
or catheterization. Clearing Pa has become problematic as it has become increasingly antibiotic resistant. This
is exacerbated by the fact that the biggest risk factor for negative outcomes associated with MDR Pa is advanced
age. After 60, there is a significant increase in morbidity and mortality resulting from MDR Pa. While there are
Pa vaccines in development, none are licensed.
 Like many Gram-negative pathogens, Pa strains of the PAO1/PA14-clades possess a type III secretion
system (T3SS), a virulence factor that allows avoidance of host innate immunity and is required for the onset of
infection. Structurally resembling a molecular syringe with an external needle, the T3SS apparatus (T3SA)
provides an energized conduit from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host cell for transporting effector proteins
that mediate key aspects of infection. A needle tip protein and the first of two translocator proteins localize to the
distal end of the T3SA needle to mediate host cell contact. These proteins, PcrV and PopB, respectively, are
required for pathogenesis and are 95-98% conserved among Pa. We have fused PcrV and PopB to give PaF.
After demonstrating the protective efficacy of PaF, we genetically fused LTA1, the active moiety of labile toxin
from ETEC, to the N-terminus of PaF (L-PaF). L-PaF reduces mouse and rat lung burdens significantly. When
compared to PBS-vaccinated mice, L-PaF-vaccinated mice possessed significantly higher OPK activity in the
sera and elevated levels of IL-17 were secreted from lung cells. Recently, Pa outliers have been identified that
are devoid of the T3SS entirely and use ExlA to disrupt host cell membranes. Thus, we have added ExlA to our
L-PaF (L-PaFE) emulsion and have demonstrated protection in PAO1/14/7 clades when delivered intranasally.
Furthermore, we have added BECC438, a novel monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) biosimilar (a TLR4 agonist), to
increase OPK activity (L-PaFEB438). The goal of the R01 is to continue to develop our broadly protective
Pa vaccine formulation by assessing the protective immune response in rodent models. Knowing the
vaccine efficacy and immune response in these models will allow us to finalize the vaccine formulation and the
demonstrate the potential utility of that formulation in humans."
10841397,"Surgical resection or liver transplantation remain the only curative options for patients with hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC). However, fewer than 20% of patients with HCC are candidates for resection. Transarterial
embolization with or without chemotherapy (TA(C)E) is an endovascular locoregional embolotherapy that
involves hepatic artery embolization with intra-arterial infusion of a chemotherapeutic agent. TA(C)E is
considered the standard of care for treating unresectable HCC in the remaining 80% of patients. While TA(C)E
has a proven survival benefit, local recurrence is common, and long-term survival rates are poor. Moreover, only
44% of treated HCCs demonstrate extensive necrosis on pathology following TA(C)E, indicating tumor cells
develop an adaptive metabolic stress response (MSR) enabling their survival under TA(C)E-induced nutrient
and oxygen deprivation.
In preliminary studies, we have demonstrated that HCC cells are pre-programmed to survive TA(C)E-induced
ischemia through enhanced function of autophagy. Moreover, TA(C)E-induced ischemia results in quiescence
in surviving HCC cells and a dependence on autophagy. As such, these data demonstrate that TA(C)E offers a
unique opportunity to constrain metabolic phenotypes in order to generate this targetable dependency in HCC.
The proposed project will build on this prior work to: 1) study a novel TA(C)E paradigm which targets this
ischemia-induced dependency on autophagy using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and 2) characterizes the efficacy
and evolution of autophagy inhibition using HCQ as well as associated alterations in anti-tumor immunity. To
achieve these goals, this submission proposes a first in human, early phase prospective clinical trial to
assess the safety and efficacy of autophagy inhibition using intra-arterial (IA) HCQ with TAE followed by
maintenance of autophagy inhibition with daily oral HCQ for 6 weeks following embolization. Follow-up tumor
biopsies and serum sampling 3-4 and 5-6 weeks after embolization will inform on the on-target efficacy of
autophagy inhibition and its effect on the tumor microenvironment and immune response.
We hypothesize that the induction of quiescence in HCC cells surviving embolization-induced ischemia renders
them dependent on autophagy which can be targeted to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of TAE as well enhance
the anti-tumor immune response. To test this hypothesis the proposed project will pursue three aims: (1) to
establish the clinical safety of the combination of the autophagy inhibitor HCQ with TAE to treat patients with
intermediate stage HCC (phase 1); (2) to compare the short-term efficacy of HCQ with TAE versus TAE alone
in patients with intermediate stage HCC (phase 2); and (3) to characterize differences in local and systemic
immune modulation following TAE as compared to IA HCQ TAE. The achievement of the proposed aims holds
the potential to transform treatment paradigms for patients with unresectable HCC, an incurable disease."

 Dr. Salehi-Rad has established clinically relevant murine models of NSCLC with increased mutational
burden and identified a novel targetable mechanism of resistance to immunotherapy in LKB1-deficient NSCLC.
Utilizing these murine models, Dr. Salehi-Rad has shown that in situ vaccination (ISV) with elite antigen cross-
presenting conventional type 1 DCs that are gene-modified to secrete FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L-
cDC1), a cytokine that promotes DC viability and expansion, sensitize immune refractory NSCLC to immune
checkpoint inhibition (ICI). In this proposal, Dr. Salehi-Rad aims to study the immune mechanisms of DC ISV.
Aim 1.1 builds on preliminary in vitro data indicating enhanced viability of FLT3L-cDC1 compared to cDC1 and
seeks to determine the molecular mechanisms that result in increased survival of FTL3L-cDC1. Aim 1.2 & 1.3
utilize various murine models to determine the vaccine and endogenous DC viability, antigen trafficking and
antigen-specific T cell priming following DC ISV. Aim 2 of the proposal focuses on elucidating the immune
determinants of response to DC ISV as monotherapy or as a combination therapy with ICI. Aim 2.1 & 2.2
combine single cell immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) with
spatial analysis by multiplex immunofluorescence (MIF) to develop a comprehensive understanding of the local
and systemic immune responses induced by DC ISV. Aim 2.3 utilizes antibody depletion studies to evaluate the
dependency of DC ISV on T cells and natural killer cells. Aim 3 will determine the evolution of T cell repertoires
by TCR-β CDR3 sequencing and tumor-neoantigen profiles by whole-exome sequencing (WES) to assess
whether DC ISV induces the expansion of the TCR repertoire and promotes tumor immunoediting. Improved
understanding of the nature of immunosuppression in NSCLC and the immunostimulatory mechanisms of DC
ISV will represent a significant contribution to the field of lung cancer immunology and could facilitate the clinical
translation of FLT3L-cDC1 ISV as an innovative therapeutic strategy for this devastating disease that affects
many of our Veterans."
10817259,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tumor cells produce and release large numbers of extracellular vesicles (EVs). A subset of small (30-150 nm)
EVs derived from the endocytic compartment of the tumor cell is called TEX (Tumor-derived Exosomes). TEX
carry various immunoregulatory molecules and relative to normal cell-derived exosomes, NTEX (Non-Tumor
cell-derived Exosomes), are enriched in inhibitory proteins which suppress functions of immune effector cells.
TEX have recently emerged as a major immunosuppressive system used by tumors to escape from the host
immune system. Our results indicate that adenosine (ADO), now considered a major immune checkpoint in
cancer, and the enzymes driving the adenosinergic pathway are carried and delivered to target immune cells by
TEX. We hypothesize that TEX-mediated suppression of immune cells in cancer is due to ADO distributed by
TEX, which thereby encourage tumor growth and metastasis. We will test this hypothesis first by comparing the
adenosinergic pathway activity in TEX versus NTEX isolated from plasma of patients with melanoma by a unique
immune capture method we have developed. In concert with newly introduced highly sensitive etheno-bridge
chemistry and a state-of-the-art UPLC-MS/MS system, we now have means to measure the activity of the
canonical and non-canonical ADO-producing biochemical pathways in paired TEX versus NTEX of each patient.
We will define “adenosinergic drive” as the capacity of TEX to produce immunosuppressive ADO and will link it
to in vitro functional assays performed with each patient’s immune cells. The discovery in Aim 1 of high
adenosinergic drive in melanoma patients TEX relative to NTEX is expected to confirm the major role of TEX in
tumor immune escape. Aim 1 will also provide an in vitro measure of adenosinergic drive in every melanoma
patient for use in Aims 2 and 3 studies. In Aim 2, TEX with “high” versus “low” adenosinergic drive will be
injected IV into mice to determine their in vivo effects on carcinogenesis, cancer growth, angiogenesis, immune
dysfunction and metastasis formation. This Aim extends the role of TEX from immune suppression to tumor
growth promoting activities. Various well-established mouse models will be used to measure adenosinergic
activity of TEX in vivo. We will also examine whether in vivo blocking of the adenosine pathway reverses
detrimental effects mediated by TEX. In Aim 3, we will assess the utility of adenosinergic drive in TEX as a
biomarker of prognosis and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Utilizing TEX isolated from banked
plasma of melanoma patients, we will correlate adenosinergic drive in the TEX with disease stage and
clinicopathological endpoints as well as with prognosis and response to immunotherapy. By elucidating the role
of TEX in ADO-mediated immune suppression as well as tumor progression in cancer, this study introduces new
therapeutic targets and new cancer biomarkers that are expected to improve cancer therapy and patient survival."
10808926,"Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is the second most common histological subtype of breast cancer after the
more common invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC). In 2020, ILC will affect up to 40,000 patients in the US, and
if considered an independent malignancy is the 6th most frequent cancer in women. Loss of E-cadherin
(CDH1) is the pathognomonic feature of ILC, which leads to a single-file pattern infiltration of small discohesive
cells into the stroma. Patients with ILC suffer from late recurrences and metastasis to unique sites such as the
urogenital tract (e.g. ovary) and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (e.g. peritoneum). Despite numerous studies
showing unique clinical, histopathological, and molecular features of ILC, clinical trials and guidelines mostly
ignore the unique aspects of ILC, and treat IDC and ILC as a single disease. Our long-term goal is to improve
outcome for patients with ILC, a disease associated with limited understanding and representing a great unmet
clinical need. ILC is currently understudied at least in part due to a lack of credentialed models and it is
currently unclear which ILC models are most appropriate to test clinically meaningful questions.
We will collaborate with the Cancer Dependency Map Project (DepMap - CCLE) and members of PDXNet to
comprehensively credential ILC models. We have established a team with complementary expertise in ILC
biology, rodent modeling, bioinformatics, immunology, pathology, medical oncology, and breast cancer
advocacy and will use innovative validation strategies to cross-compare in vitro and in vivo translational ILC
models. Our goal is to create a robust set of well-curated models that are credentialed to provide translationally
reliable information for evaluating targeted therapies in primary and metastatic ILC.
In Aim 1 we will molecularly characterize ILC models and compare them to human ILC. This will include 19 ILC
or ‘ILC-like’ cell lines, 20 primary ILC organoids, 8 patient derived xenografts, 2 homograft rodent models and 3
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM). We will assess histopathology and perform comprehensive
genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses. In Aim 2 we will focus on in vitro growth phenotypes and in
vivo metastasis to determine which models recapitulate the unique growth pattern seen in human ILC. Since
we have recently sequenced unique sites of ILC metastasis (ovary, GI) in the human disease, we will compare
the molecular profile of our metastasis models to human ILC metastasis. Finally, Aim 3 will focus on
therapeutic efficacy. We will work with the Broad Institute to perform CRISPR and drug screening on ILC cell
lines and organoids and make all data available in the DepMap portal. In vivo we will assess endocrine therapy
response in homografts and compare the results to an ongoing ILC clinical trial led by our group. We will also
characterize the immune cell infiltrate and response to checkpoint inhibitors in homograft rodent ILC models in
order to assess their suitability for the study of therapies targeting the immune system."
10866341,"A hallmark of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is advancing tubulointerstitial (TI) fibrosis. While new mechanisms
of fibrosis have been uncovered in recent decades, effective treatment to directly halt or reverse this process
remains elusive. Our group has a long-standing interest in defining how extracellular matrix (ECM) receptors
such as integrins and their binding partners regulate kidney development and response to injury. Among the
integrin binding partners, we focus on the integrin linked kinase (ILK); pinch; α-parvin complex of scaffold
proteins, also known as the IPP complex. We recently uncovered a novel modality to interfere with integrin
dependent signaling pathways mediated by the IPP complex that may represent a new strategy to treat and
prevent TI fibrosis and ultimately CKD.
Integrins are transmembrane receptors composed of non-covalently bound α and β subunits. β1 is the most
abundantly expressed subunit in the kidney and can bind 12 different α subunits. The β1 cytoplasmic tail
functions by binding multiple cytoplasmic proteins which regulate integrin-mediated signaling and cytoskeleton
modulation. The IPP complex is a major scaffolding hub that binds the integrin β1 cytoplasmic tail and its key
function is to bundle actin filaments, thereby transmitting mechanical signals between integrins and the actin
cytoskeleton. A normal actin cytoskeleton is required for most cell functions necessary for embryonic
development and recovery of tissue from injury. ILK is the major scaffold protein that brings the IPP complex
together; however, the α and β parvins are the major IPP complex proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton.
We have preliminary evidence that α-parvin is required for normal kidney development and repair after injury.
Deletion of α-parvin in mice at the initiation of the kidney collecting system (E10.5) causes severely dysmorphic
kidneys with excessive basolateral F-actin. We also provide evidence that deleting α-parvin in the fully developed
kidney collecting system (E 18.5) results in excessive tubular injury following a unilateral ureteric obstruction
(UUO) model. Mice carrying a mutant ILK unable to bind to α-parvin (K-to-M mutation in a.a. 220: ILK-K220M
mice) in the developing collecting system develop normally and wild-type mice treated with the small molecule
Csbl-1 (that interferes with the ILK-α-parvin interaction) have decreased renal fibrosis following UUO. These
data strongly suggest that α-parvin performs multiple cellular functions that are independent of its interactions
with ILK and paradoxically disrupting ILK binding to α-parvin improves the response of the kidney to injury.
Finally, we have evidence that α-parvin-null collecting duct (CD) cells have excessive F-actin formation,
increased cell adhesion, spreading and migration as well as a profound increase in activated RhoA and Cdc42.
Based on these data, we hypothesize that α-parvin-mediated regulation of actin dynamics via Rho-GTPase
signaling promotes kidney tubule development, homeostasis, and recovery from injury. This hypothesis
will be tested in the following 2 aims.
Aim 1. Determine the role of α-parvin in kidney tubule development and injury. We will test the hypothesis
that α-parvin-mediated actin filament bundling is required for normal kidney tubule development and
protection from injury.
Aim 2. Determine the mechanisms whereby α-parvin regulates actin-bundling dependent epithelial cell
function. We will test the hypothesis that α-parvin-mediated inhibition of RhoA and Cdc42 activity
promotes cofilin-mediated actin turnover dependent epithelial cell polarity and proliferation that is
required for normal tubule formation and repair."
10862565,"America is aging; baby boomers are now seniors. Staying mentally astute is essential not only for economic
survival but also for quality of life. Yet, the pathophysiology of cognitive aging remains ill-defined, a gap
preventing development of novel diagnostic, therapeutic, or preventive strategies. This laboratory has identified
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the major component of the anterior attention system, as the principal
region showing metabolic decline from young to late adulthood. This decline correlates with declining executive
functions such as fluency. The ACC mediates statistically the relationship between increasing age and
decreasing verbal fluency. Amyloid-free, cognitively intact elders show robust executive but lesser mnemonic
deficits. This project will test the hypothesis that ACC dysfunction in the elderly free of preclinical Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is associated with redox dysfunction related to aging and severe stress, the latter as seen in
PTSD. Oxidative stress will be measured with 7 T MRI/MRS using the NAD+/NADH ratio, a method developed
here recently. Two factors will include: AGE (younger vs. older) and STRESS (healthy vs. chronic active
PTSD). Neuropsychological testing and plasma phospho-tau181 [or 217] will confirm absence of preclinical AD
as well as revisit the unusual observation: absence of aging-related memory impairment (Logical Memory I &
II) —typically viewed as the sine qua non for aging. The anticipated outcomes are 1) the ACC undergoes redox
stress related to aging and possibly emotional stress; 2) increasing ACC redox stress will correlate with
declining ACC metabolism in the absence of preclinical AD; both will correlate more with declining executive
and less with memory dysfunction; 3) ACC metabolism or redox status may serve as a biomarker for cognitive
aging in the absence of neurodegeneration; and 4) scientific premise and infrastructure will poise the field to
test the potential of antioxidant therapies in preventing or delaying cognitive aging. If successful, aging
American would remain mentally sharp for more years. Since the ACC also participates in cognitive reserve,
secondary prevention would delay symptoms even if neurodegeneration occurs."
10766760,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Although community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the most common serious infections in children and
a leading reason that children seek emergency care, no validated tools exist to predict CAP severity in
children. Without objective tools, management decisions are inefficient and potentially inaccurate, resulting in
unnecessary testing, treatment, and hospitalization in low-risk children or delays in critically important therapies
in those at high risk of severe CAP. The long-term goal of this research is to improve risk stratification of
children with CAP. In adults with CAP, the use of risk prediction rules decreases mortality and guides antibiotic
decisions, while minimizing hospitalizations for those at low risk. No validated risk prediction rules exist for
children presenting to the emergency department (ED) with CAP. We previously derived a 7-variable risk
prediction rule in 1128 children 3 months to 18 years old who presented to a single pediatric ED with
suspected CAP. To overcome limitations inherent in a rule derived in a single center, multicenter derivation
and external validation of a pediatric CAP risk prediction rule is necessary to ensure generalizability and inform
subsequent widespread implementation. We also found that biomarkers, including c-reactive protein,
procalcitonin, proadrenomedullin, and viral detection, are associated with severe outcomes in children with
CAP. It is unknown if the addition of these biomarkers to a clinical risk prediction rule will improve rule
performance. Led by a multidisciplinary team of experts in CAP, pediatric emergency and hospital medicine,
infectious diseases, biomarkers, epidemiology and biostatistics, prediction modeling, and machine learning, the
proposed research will address these important knowledge and research gaps through the following specific
aims: (1) To derive a severity risk prediction rule in a multicenter cohort of children presenting to the ED with
CAP; (2) To externally validate the derived prediction rule in children with CAP; and (3) To evaluate the ability
of biomarkers to improve predictive accuracy of a purely clinical risk prediction rule. This study will leverage the
robust infrastructure, experience, and expertise of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network
(PECARN). We will accomplish the study aims by conducting a prospective multicenter observational study in
two phases. First, we will enroll 2000 children with CAP presenting to one of 7 PECARN EDs to derive the rule
over 2 years. We will then enroll 2000 children with CAP in 7 different PECARN EDs over the following 2 years
to externally validate the rule. A risk prediction rule in children with CAP will be significant in (a) advancing our
understanding of risk factors of CAP severity, (b) improving evidence-based management and clinical
outcomes by guiding and standardizing clinical decision making, and (c) facilitating future research. This
proposal is innovative as it will shift the paradigm of ED management of CAP, moving from subjective
decisions toward a novel, objective approach where individualized, evidence-based risk estimates can
augment and improve accuracy of clinical decision making."
10831476,"Substance use disorder (SUD) is a relapsing condition and demands pharmacotherapy for several years. Long-
acting injectables and implants have improved patient adherence to medications used for SUD. For both
naltrexone and buprenorphine, although implants exhibit significantly longer release, compared to injectables,
they require surgical intervention for insertion/removal, are prone to local infection and inflammation, and have
sub-optimal pharmacokinetics (PK). Long-acting injectables of naltrexone and buprenorphine only provide 30
days of drug release, which is sub-optimal, as SUD is a relapsing condition and typically demands therapy for
several years. Additionally, previously developed long-acting injectables for SUD result in significant initial burst
release of the drug, and a steady plasma level is attained only after 30-60 days, which increases the risk for side
effects. Despite the clear unmet need for an ultra-long-acting injectable for SUD treatment, hydrophilicity of
clinically relevant drugs, including naltrexone, buprenorphine, acamprosate, and nalmefene makes it extremely
difficult to formulate their ultra-long-acting injectables. We have recently engineered a solvent-free and injectable
in situ crosslinking depot (ISCD) from an ultra-low molecular weight, liquid polymer which forms a dense mesh-
neatwork and enables ultra-long-lasting delivery of hydrophilic drugs. The solid monolithic depot integrates the
unique advantages of injectability and retrievability. Our overall objectives in this application, are to (i) explore
the feasibility of this platform for ultra-long-acting delivery of naltrexone in vitro and in vivo, and (ii) evaluate
loading and in vitro release of other SUD related therapeutics with varying hydrophilicity. Our central hypothesis
is that the dense mesh network of ISCD will minimize water influx/efflux and this combined with minimal initial
burst due to solvent-free nature of ISCD will achieve long-term sustained drug release. Our long-term goal is to
utilize this ISCD platform for developing ultra-long-acting injectables of promising therapeutic agents for the
treatment of SUD. To achieve our overall objectives, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) maximize
naltrexone loading in ISCD, and tune release kinetics, 2) evaluate biocompatibility of naltrexone-loaded ISCD,
and determine degradation, and 3) evaluate loading and in vitro release of other therapeutics relevant to SUD.
The research proposed in this application is innovative, in our opinion, because it focuses on a new injectable
formulation, wherein an ultra-low molecular weight polymer undergoes chemical transformation to form a dense
mesh, which limits water influx/efflux and hence the drug release. Additionally, liquid state of the polymer obviates
the need for solvent, preventing high burst release due to solvent exchange process, as observed in ISFI.
Utilizing this innovative platform, we will be the first to demonstrate long-acting release of naltrexone and other
SUD related therapeutics for at least 4-6 months from an injectable platform, thereby opening new horizons for
development of ultra-long-acting therapies for SUD patients."
10834089,"ABSTRACT
 Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity is critical for metabolism and cellular energy supply and human
health and longevity. Due to lack of repair mechanism and specified translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerase,
mtDNA contains higher contents of UV lesions. The high-fidelity mitochondrial DNA polymerase (Pol g) will
unavoidably encounter the UV lesions during mtDNA replication. Unlike other high-fidelity DNA polymerases
that lack TLS activity, we found Pol g possesses a metal regulated TLS activity. In the presence of magnesium
ion, Pol g exhibits no TLS activity, however, in the presence of physiological concentrations of manganese ion
alone or Mg/Mn mixture, Pol g can synthesize cross UV lesion cyclobutane dimer with efficiency near that on the
non-damaged DNA. We also discovered that Pol g has an extensive lesion recognition network that can sense
an upstream lesion as far as 10 base pairs in the presence of Mg2+, but completely ignores the lesion with Mn2+.
We hypothesize that Manganese ion can alter the elasticity of Pol g to be able to accommodate bulky lesions for
translesion synthesis. we will test the hypothesis by completing the Specific Aims 1) Mechanism of Pol g
integrated lesion bypassing, extension, and replication activities, 2) Investigation of Pol g long-range lesion
sensing and 3) Biophysical basis for metal-directed Pol g TLS. The proposed studies will illustrate how
mitochondrial replicase utilizing the essential metal ions to maintain genome integrity under UV radiation."
10764291,"The control of platelet function and coagulation is a fine balance between activation and inhibitory
mechanisms. Platelets become rapidly activated by multiple receptors agonists and have a central role in
thrombosis in acute coronary syndromes, and other disease states. Similarly, naturally occurring
anticoagulants are critical in preventing fibrin generation and thrombosis. Fivemembers of theprotein disulfide
isomerase (PDI) family of enzymes, PDI, ERp57, ERp5, ERp72 and ERp46 potentiate activation of IIb3 and
thrombosis.We discovered atransmembrane
member of the PDI family found to inhibit activation of IIb3 and
member of the PDI family in platelets, TMX1, which
thrombosis. TMX1
is the first
acts by a novel
mechanism of oxidizing thiols to disulfide bonds and is the last checkpoint inhibitor of the platelet activation
pathways that lead to conformational changes in IIb3 and fibrinogen binding. The prothrombotic PDIs are
secreted from platelets and endothelial cells and support fibrin generation at the site of vascular injury. We
found that TMX1 is expressed on platelets and endothelial cells but,
negatively
procoagulant
in contras to the other PDIs, TMX1
regulates fibrin generation. One mechanism by which TMX1 inhibits coagulation is by limiting the
effect of endothelial cells and platelets. We propose to study
t
vascular TMX1 as a dual negative
regulator of platelets and coagulation by addressing the following Specific Aims. We will characterize 1. the
role of TMX1 in thrombus formation; 2. the mechanism of inhibition of IIb3 activation by TMX1; 3. the effect
of TMX1 on the other platelet PDIs, and on other platelet surface substrates. A principal technique used will be
the laser-induced injury model of thrombosis. We will study the mechanism by which TMX1 negatively
regulates coagulation. To determine the underlying mechanisms by which TMX1 inhibits platelet function we
will integrate a platelet knockout mouse model with mass spectrometry-based identification of functional
cysteines. This proposal will determine the mechanisms by which TMX1 works, and how TMX1
counterbalances the PDI enzymes that support activation of IIb3. Characterization of the negative regulatory
role of TMX1 will provide novel insight into how the network of PDI enzymes regulate thrombosis. Studies on
how TMX1 maintains the balance between thrombosis and hemostasis will elucidate optimal ways to promote
hemostasis and inhibit thrombosis and provide a basis for studying TMX1 in disease states."
10762960,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An intracranial aneurysm (IA) is a focal dilatation of an arterial blood vessel in the brain. The rupture of IA causes
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which is the most devastating form of stroke. Due to aneurysmal SAH, around
one-third of aneurysm patients will die before reaching the hospital and half of the survivors will never return to
independent living. In the United States, around 30,000 people annually suffer a ruptured IA. Unfortunately, there
are no drugs available to treat IA except for invasive surgical options, which produce much higher health care
costs and are associated with multiple hospitalizations. Therefore, new therapeutic targets are urgently needed
as non-invasive alternatives to prevent aneurysmal rupture. However, such attempts have been greatly impeded
by a lack of knowledge about the pathogenic and cellular mechanisms that contribute to IA disease. High wall
shear stress (HWSS) directly acts on the endothelium of vascular wall as a result of blood flow and is a well-
known clinical risk factor for IA disease. The casual role of HWSS in IA pathogenesis has been validated in
multiple animal models. However, the molecular basis for HWSS-induced IA development is largely unknown.
Interestingly, we observed that HWSS stimulates the assembly of podosomes in the endothelial cells that are
subcellular organelles with the ability to degrade extracellular matrix. Based on our preliminary data, we
hypothesize that podosome formation and function contributes to IA development and growth under HWSS
conditions, and anti-podosome therapy may provide a beneficial effect on IA disease. To test this hypothesis,
we will carry out the following specific aims: 1) dissect the molecular mechanisms of HWSS-induced podosome
formation and maturation; 2) determine the role of HWSS-induced podosome formation and function in
cerebrovascular integrity and IA development and growth. To our knowledge, our proposal is the first to connect
podosomes to cerebrovascular integrity, providing a novel mechanism for IA pathogenesis and highlighting a
unique anti-podosome therapy for IA disease. Importantly, podosome formation and function can be effectively
blocked by SRC kinase inhibitors, which have been intensively developed, including multiple FDA-approved
drugs. This fact also makes our study of translational potential for IA disease, or for many other diseases due to
the loss of vascular integrity."
10771263,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
This application addresses a major challenge that radiologists and other physicians encounter frequently,
namely distinguishing active infection from other processes in the human body. Specifically, the proposed work
is motivated by the difficulty in diagnosing and treating pneumonias in cystic fibrosis patients, especially those
caused by P. aeruginosa. Clinically available imaging tools either (1) are limited by their background
accumulation in the lungs or (2) image the host response to infection rather than the living bacteria themselves.
To address this challenge, we have developed several PET radiotracers that exploit metabolic pathways
specific to bacteria, including D-amino acid derived probes most recently D-[3-11C]alanine.
When D-[3-11C]alanine was applied to several compelling preclinical models of infection, we found that it was
exquisitely sensitive to P. aeruginosa, which is not the case for the vast majority of reported radiotracers. We
further showed that D-[3-11C]alanine is a radiotracer with (1) a simple, high-yield radiosynthesis (2) good in vivo
stability (3) appropriate mimicry of the endogenous substrate (4) high rate of incorporation into both gram-
negative and gram-positive bacteria and (5) low uptake in background tissues. These studies demonstrate the
outstanding potential of D-[3-11C]alanine, with the proposed work necessary to further validate and understand
this tracer. We will first expand our radiochemical methods, synthesizing the D-[1-11C]alanine isotopomer and
structurally related 18F probes (Specific Aim 1). We will then further investigate the lead 11C isotopomer in
vitro, analyzing its performance in clinical P. aeruginosa strains and validated biofilm models (Specific Aim 2).
In Specific Aim 3, we will extend these concepts in vivo employing both acute and chronic models of P.
aeruginosa infection."

This is a renewal application from the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) for a post-doctoral
training grant in Infectious Diseases entitled “Columbia Integrated Training Program in Infectious Disease
Research (TP-IDR)”. Drs. Anne-Catrin Uhlemann and Magdalena Sobieszczyk will serve as principal
investigators (PIs) under the multiple PI NIH model. Both are established investigators with complementary
research interests and longstanding commitments to the training of new investigators. The goal of this proposal
is to train post-doctoral fellows with MD or MD-PhD degrees who are destined for academic infectious disease
careers. The interdisciplinary program is designed to provide the necessary skillset to successfully pursue
translational research whether this research be primarily basic, implementation science or
clinical/epidemiological. The dramatic advances in the fields of microbial genomics and biomedical informatics
and the potential application of these rapidly evolving tools to translational research has necessitated a
reappraisal of our approach to training new investigators. The ongoing recruitment to CUMC of world class
investigators (e.g., Dr. David Ho, Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in Division of Infectious Diseases; Dr.
Megan Sykes, Center for Translational Immunology) combined with pre-existent strengths in Infectious
Diseases, pathogen discovery (Dr. Ian Lipkin, Center for Infection and Immunity), Biomedical Informatics (Dr.
George Hripcsak) and retroviral-host protein interactions (Dr. Stephen Goff, Howard Hughes Medical Institute)
has allowed us to construct a Training Program that can recognize and nurture talented individuals. The TP-IDR,
is not only producing new investigators but is also stimulating new interest in Infectious Disease research more
broadly at CUIMC. Resubmission is being sought to continue the success demonstrated thus far and to secure
its future. Drs. Uhlemann and Sobieszczyk will continue to co-chair the Executive Steering Committee that serves
as the governing body. A Diversity Enhancement and Recruitment and Selection Committees will insure that
our applicant pool is strong and diverse. A dynamic mix of well-established and junior investigators has been
assembled to form a close-knit, dedicated faculty. Trainees selected to the TP-IDR have a choice of laboratory-
based, health disparities/ implementation science, or clinical/epidemiological-based research projects and have
the option of obtaining a Master’s degree in either Epidemiology or Biomedical Informatics. Didactic conferences
and integrated TP-IDR seminars complement the educational experience. Mentorship, training, career
development and feedback are thorough. An Advisory Committee, including members from within and outside
the institution, will assist with oversight of the program. Institutional support is strong and broad-based. The
intersection of microbial genomics, biomedical informatics and pathogenesis with clinical investigation,
translational research, implementation science, epidemiology and global health form the conceptual vision of the
TP-IDR. This program permits us to train the academic Infectious Disease leaders of the future."
10720895,"Traumatic brain injury and other neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer’s Disease (AD),
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig’s disease, ALS), and related conditions, have an especially
significant and increasing prevalence in the Veteran population. Gulf War illness has a high
incidence among Veterans that served in the 1990-1991 Persian Gulf conflict and neurologic
problems are common. It is essential that the underlying mechanisms that contribute to these
conditions are understood so that treatments can be developed to improve the outcomes for Veterans
and others. I have been studying the molecular genetic aspects of neurons and glia in the brain and
spinal cord to determine how we can best modulate regulatory pathways to block and reverse
neurodegenerative signaling that results in behavioral problems. In the course of these
investigations, we examine human CNS samples obtained from brain banks, animal models, and
model neurons in tissue culture. We evaluate gene expression changes and interactions that occur
during the course of neurodegeneration in a variety of brain and spinal cord samples and model
systems to compare alterations that are specific to the various disorders so that we can characterize
factors that can be targeted to obtain neuroprotection and improved functional performance. I have
determined key mechanisms responsible for central nervous system neurodegeneration. Areas of
current discovery include Alzheimer's disease, important to the aging Veteran and general population,
and traumatic brain injury which is becoming increasingly understood in terms of injury exposures in
sports and importantly, is unfortunately the signature affliction of recently deployed military forces. In
this arena I have, for example, identified therapeutic targets by defining neurodegenerative
mechanisms and demonstrating that attacking these targets results in reduced activation of caspase-
3, improved neuroprotective gene expression in the brain, and reduced functional deficits, measured
with behavioral and cognitive tests, by treatment after injury. We have found that several genes
responsible for the loss of neuronal function are influenced significantly by a handful of inflammatory
responsive regulatory factors that control the transcription rates, or gene expression, of the proteins
important to neuronal health. For example, we found that inflammatory responsive regulatory
transcription factors can be modulated to produce neuroprotective levels of intracellular proteins
through selective upregulation and downregulation. By treating models with our intracellular,
regulatory modulators, we have not only positively influenced biochemical pathways, we have
demonstrated improved memory function in neurodegenerative conditions compared to untreated
controls. We are currently extending this research to additional neurological problems that occur
more frequently in Veterans and are seeking to advance beneficial therapeutic strategies."
10836349,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Trachoma programs have been enormously successful, but they fell short of their goal of Global
Elimination of Trachoma by 2020. Nearly one third of endemic districts still had not met the threshold for control.
Why?
 One reason may be that the 2020 goals were set long before sufficient evidence was available. In the
original grant period, we used program surveys to forecast the distribution of active trachoma worldwide. We
also used NEI clinical trial data to better define the relationship between clinical activity and actual chlamydial
infection. New clinical, infection, and serology data will now enable more precise estimates. In carrying out the
aims of this current proposal, we will use these enriched information sources to forecast which districts will
achieve control under current efforts.
 A second factor is that the trachoma intervention guidelines have essentially been “one size fits all”. Here,
we propose to assess the enhanced interventions necessary to achieve control in hotspots where current efforts
are not sufficient for trachoma control.
 Finally, the WHO plan acknowledged that resurgence may happen. In the original grant period, we
demonstrated that surveys of trachoma prevalence sometimes switched from supporting control to questioning
control. In this current proposal we propose to model resurgence so that surveillance of resurgence can be
improved.
 In summary, we propose: (a) real-time open-access forecasts that set realistic interim and elimination
goals to help keep our specific collaborating stakeholder's programs on track; (b) models for better targeting hot
spots with enhanced interventions to accelerate success; (c) models for rational surveillance for resurgence to
maintain control once success has been declared."
10792928,"Abstract
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of prematurity whose incidence is on the
rise associated with the increased survival of extremely preterm infants. The etiology of BPD is multifactorial
resulting from prenatal risk factors such as preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, and perinatal insults including
oxygen exposure, infection, and mechanical ventilation. Inflammation is a key pathway underlying the
pathogenesis of BPD which can result in significant long-term multisystem morbidities, including adverse
neurological outcomes, immune dysregulation with susceptibility to infections, and pulmonary morbidities
including asthma and, in some cases, emphysematous changes that persist into adulthood. Thus, BPD is no
longer considered a lung disease of the neonatal period, but a complex condition with multiorgan involvement
and lifelong consequences. To date, effective treatments are lacking and there is a need to deliver effective
strategies for the prevention and management of BPD. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) are in clinical
trials as potential cellular therapy for BPD. We and others have shown that the main therapeutic modality of
MSCs resides in their secretome represented by `small' extracellular vesicles (sEVs), an EV subset that
includes exosomes. We demonstrated that treatment with purified human MSC-derived sEvs, termed MEx,
ameliorated and even reversed core histological and functional outcomes of BPD in several experimental
models. In the neonatal hyperoxia (HYRX) murine BPD model, MEx protected other organs from injury
including the brain, retina, and the thymus whose architecture was disrupted by HYRX. We demonstrated that
MEx localize in the lung and interact with myeloid cells altering their phenotype from proinflammatory to
immunosuppressive. Importantly, adoptive transfer of in vitro MEx-educated bone marrow derived myeloid
cells, but not naïve cells, restored alveolar architecture, blunted fibrosis and vascular remodeling, and
improved exercise capacity. We hypothesize that MEx regulate the immune landscape of the developing lung
and promote a distinct macrophage phenotype that, through release of anti-inflammatory cytokines and
enhanced efferocytosis of apoptotic cells, resolves tissue inflammation and orchestrates signals to promote
lung growth disrupted by HYRX. In this proposal we plan to (1) Elucidate mechanisms by which MEx promote
the establishment of the alveolar macrophage niche and development of innate immunity that is disrupted by
neonatal HYRX; (2) Explore the functionality of lung myeloid cells instructed by MEx in resolving inflammation
and promoting lung development; and (3) Elucidate the effects of neonatal HYRX and MEx treatment on long
term immune cell function and susceptibility to airway disease."

 A critical gap exists in understanding how nitrative stress, which has been effectively targeted to inhibit
cell death in other models, alters cochlear protein signaling to induce apoptosis in cisplatin-induced ototoxicity.
Continued existence of this gap represents an important problem for the 40%-80% of cisplatin-treated cancer
patients who suffer with significant and in some cases permanent hearing loss as a result of cisplatin use. Until
the underlying nitrative stress mechanism is delineated the promise of this new interventional target for
mitigating a dose-limiting side-effect of cisplatin likely will remain unrealized. The long-term goal is to better
understand the functional as well as mechanistic role of cochlear nitrative stress in acquired hearing loss. The
objective is to delineate signaling pathways by which cisplatin-induced nitrative stress, particularly nitration of
cochlear LMO4, facilitates ototoxicity, because cisplatin treatment nitrates and downregulates LMO4 protein.
LMO4 is a transcriptional regulator that controls pathways regulating cell survival and cell death. The central
hypothesis is that cisplatin-induced nitrative stress downregulates cochlear LMO4 and compromises STAT3-
mediated anti-apoptotic signaling to facilitate ototoxicity. Understanding the mechanisms whereby nitrated
cochlear LMO4 promotes cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is likely to contribute to the development of strategies to
prevent this debilitating adverse effect. Guided by strong preliminary data this study will pursue three specific
aims: (1) establish the causal link between cisplatin-induced LMO4 nitration and ototoxicity; (2) determine the
effects of cisplatin-induced LMO4 nitration on JAK/STAT signaling; and (3) determine the otoprotective efficacy
of pharmacological inhibition of nitration. In Aim 1, cisplatin-induced apoptosis will be analyzed after blocking
nitration of LMO4 by site-directed mutagenesis and inhibiting proteasomal degradation of nitrated-LMO4 by
lactacystin. The link between LMO4 protein levels and cisplatin-induced ototoxicity will be ascertained by
testing cochlear apoptosis/hearing loss in LMO4 knockout and overexpressing mice. In Aim 2, cisplatin-
induced changes in protein-protein interactions of cochlear LMO4 will be analyzed using a mass spectrometry-
based proteomics approach while JAK/STAT related apoptotic and inflammatory signaling will be analyzed
using targeted gene arrays. In Aim 3, the otoprotective efficacy of SRI110, a peroxynitrite decomposition
catalyst, will be assessed using CBA/J mice; potential interference of SRI110 with anti-cancer activity of
cisplatin will be analyzed using SCID mice. This innovative research departs from the status quo by shifting the
focus from oxidative stress to the pivotal role of nitrative stress in cisplatin ototoxicity. Significantly, outcomes
are expected to vertically advance understanding of how nitrative stress regulates cochlear apoptosis in
cisplatin-induced ototoxicity. Findings will have important translational applications in mitigating cisplatin-
induced hearing loss and preventing other otopathologies where nitrative stress plays a crucial role."
10907413,"Environmental carcinogens, such as Agent Orange (AO) and smoke from burn pits, are important exposures to
the military and civilian populations in theaters of conflict and have been related to development of lymphoid
malignancies. AO was an herbicide that was contaminated with the carcinogenic 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-
dioxin (TCDD) as a byproduct during synthesis. AO was used to deforest the jungles of Vietnam and the
demilitarized zone of Korea. Though AO is no longer used, its impact remains relevant because of its long half-
life of almost ten years and its detection in human serum even after 20 years. Preclinical studies show that
activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR, the dioxin receptor) pathway leads to the development of
lymphoid malignancies because of inhibition of apoptosis and/or immune suppression. Secondly, chronic
exposure to TCDD dysregulates epigenetic functions by altering the transcription of pathophysiologically
important proteins involved in oncogenesis. Finally, another interesting connection can be made on the basis of
sex. Lymphoid malignancies are universally more prevalent in men compared to women, but the mechanism is
poorly understood. One reason could be that estrogen may exert protective hormonal effects. Dioxin exposure
and activation of the AHR pathway has been associated with decreased levels of estrogen receptor (ER) due to
binding between AHR and ER, increased degradation of ER, and upregulation of CYP1A1, which mediates
estrogen metabolism. Together, these mechanism(s) may form the pathophysiological basis for the increased
incidence and poorer clinical outcomes of lymphoid malignancies following environmental exposures.
We hypothesize that if chemical carcinogens alter epigenetic regulation in the development and progression of
lymphoid malignancies, then these patients will have mutations in epigenetic genes or exhibit a greater degree
of change in DNA methylation of pathophysiologically relevant genes in the tumor tissue compared to controls.
These findings can be used as biomarkers to identify who may benefit from treatment with targeted therapies in
future studies. Currently there are approved epigenetic treatments for hematologic malignancies with
hypomethylating agents and/or histone deacetylase inhibitors, which could be tailored to patients who will most
likely benefit. We will test our hypothesis via three specific aims. Specific Aim 1 (SA1): Create a predictive model
using the clinical and genetic database from the prospective Million Veterans Program to determine which risk
factors are likely to contribute to the development of lymphoid malignancies. Patients who enroll fill out surveys
about medical history, military exposures, lifestyle, and medications and submit blood for genomic sequencing,
which are relevant to our hypothesis. In addition, data from VA medical records and the National Death Index
are available to fully explore the patient exposome. Specific Aim 2 (SA2): Use existing, left-over pathology
specimens to compare epigenetic and immunohistochemical changes in patients with exposure related lymphoid
malignancies versus those without exposure. These findings will be correlated with clinical outcomes and be
used as biomarkers to predict response to targeted therapies for future studies. Specific Aim 3 (SA3): Confirm
our findings from SA2 in an expansion cohort from regional VA hospitals, leveraging our established research
collaboration. Our studies are likely to identify specific pathophysiological mechanism(s) responsible for dioxin-
induced lymphoid malignancies. We also hope to identify specific and actionable genes/proteins/pathways that
can be targeted therapeutically in future precision oncology clinical trials."

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) account for significant morbidity on both an individual and societal level. UTIs are
especially common in older women and a subset are prone to recurrent UTIs (rUTIs). Current understanding of
the natural progression of patient reported UTIs in older women with rUTI is limited due to low levels of
inclusion in previous randomized controlled trials on initial non-antibiotic strategies. For Aim 1: We seek to
evaluate the feasibility of recruiting eligible participants into a randomized trial of a culture-directed versus
empiric antibiotic strategy for patient-reported UTI symptoms in older women and the adherence to study
procedures. We will explore the safety of a culture-directed UTI treatment strategy and preliminary secondary
outcomes of assigned treatments. For Aim 2: We will investigate previous UTI experiences and acceptability of
trial design/future recruitment efforts via focus groups with women that are recruited for the pilot trial and also
among key community stakeholders. For Aim 3, we will assess facilitators and barriers with trial
implementation and recruitment through semi-structured interviews among both participating and
representative non-participating providers. We plan to recruit older women with rUTI through both our clinical
practice and the University of Pittsburgh’s Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI) Pitt+Me®
Research Registry. When symptomatic for UTI, a total of 70 women will be enrolled and randomized to either a
culture-directed or empiric antibiotic strategy. Those in the empiric arm will be prescribed antibiotics following a
standard protocol and those in the culture-directed arm will have antibiotics prescribed based on urine culture
and sensitivity results that return in ~48-72 hours. At baseline, subjects will complete demographic and
symptom questionnaires. Subjects will be followed when urine culture results are available and then weekly
until they are 28 days from symptom onset (with electronic survey and phone call). Follow-up questions will
investigate symptom resolution, antibiotic side effects, and any treatment for progression of symptoms (either
pyelonephritis or urosepsis). Subjects will have contact information to a member of our team that is available
24/7. A total of 30 women (10 who complete study, 10 who declined participation and 10 community
stakeholders) will be interviewed through focus groups to ensure the patient-voice is taken into consideration
on future trial planning. We will additionally recruit providers (10 of those who participated in recruitment and
10 non-recruiting providers) to complete semi-structured, qualitative interviews on their trial experiences. Our
mixed-methods pilot study will generate the requisite preliminary feasibility, acceptability, efficacy/proof of
concept, and safety data to inform the design of a definitive randomized trial of a culture-directed versus
empiric antibiotic strategy for the treatment of patient reported UTI in older women with rUTI as we seek to
drive change in current prescribing practices in this population."

The massive daily production of 200 billion red blood cells (RBCs) requires a remarkable coordination of
erythroid cell differentiation and maturation, with processes that are implicated in erythroid enucleation.
Alterations in regulatory mechanisms that control the terminal erythroid cell maturation and enucleation are
implicated in erythroid and other disorders. Limited knowledge of these processes have been an impediment
to therapy interventions and large-scale RBC production. Our long-standing focus on the transcription factor
Foxo3 that is a central regulator of terminal erythropoiesis led us to identifying mitochondria as critical and
dynamic regulators in these processes. We recently showed that mitochondria are actively regulating
erythroid cell enucleation. Notably, we found exogenous pyruvate – a product of glycolysis – but not in situ
produced pyruvate via glycolysis fuel mitochondria and sustains erythroid enucleation suggesting an
unanticipated and significant function for exogenous pyruvate in this process. Our ongoing studies extend
these findings and suggest that ATP-independent mitochondrial functions as well as mitochondrial-related
pathways including clearance may be central to terminal erythropoiesis and their alterations implicated in
disease. Our combined studies raise the possibility that mitochondria might integrate and coordinate several
functions necessary for erythroid cell maturation prior and during enucleation. To further address
mitochondrial functions in terminal erythropoiesis, we will accomplish the following: (Aim 1) we will investigate
the contribution of mitochondrial clearance to erythroid cell maturation vs. enucleation; (Aim 2) we will
investigate the contribution of mitochondrial network and morphology to the regulation of erythroid cell
maturation vs. enucleation, and (Aim 3) we will address the specific pyruvate-mediated pathway that fuel
mitochondria during terminal erythropoiesis. These studies are likely to expose a new mechanism of erythroid
cell maturation and enucleation and to generate critical information for developing new means towards novel
therapies and improving RBC production."
10876246,"Economic choice behavior is specifically disrupted in a variety of mental and neurological disorders including
frontotemporal dementia, major depression and drug addiction. Thus to better understand the origins of these
disorders and to pave the way for treatments it is critical to understand the neural underpinnings of this
behavior. Evidence from neurophysiology in non-human primates, functional imaging in humans and lesions in
multiple species establishes a link between economic choice and the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). In particular,
previous research in the PI’s lab examined the activity of single neurons in the OFC of monkeys choosing
between different liquid rewards. This work identified three groups of cells encoding the identity and subjective
values of offered and chosen goods. The variables encoded in OFC capture both the input and the output of
the choice process, suggesting that the cell groups identified in this area constitute the building blocks of a
circuit in which decisions are formed. A series of theoretical and experimental results support this hypothesis,
but many aspects of this circuit are poorly understood. For example, we don’t know whether different cell
groups identified in OFC correspond to different anatomical cell types, whether they populate different cortical
layers, and how they are connected with each other and with other brain regions. To address these and related
questions, we brought our investigation to a genetically tractable species – the mouse. In a first study, we
developed a mouse model of economic choice behavior and we demonstrated that optogenetic inactivation of
the lateral orbital area (LO) disrupts choices (Kuwabara et al, eLife, 2020). In preparation for this proposal, we
developed a protocol for two-photon (2P) calcium (Ca2+) imaging of area LO in mice performing choices. We
thus identified three groups of neurons analogous to those previously found in primates. The overarching goal
of this proposal is to link the functional cell groups identified in LO to anatomically defined cell types. To do so,
we will combine 2P Ca2+ imaging with genetic markers and viral tracing. In a series of experiments, we will
assess (Aim 1) whether different cell groups defined in relation to behavior reside preferentially in different
layers, (Aim 2) whether different cell groups are differentially connected with sensory and/or motor regions,
and (Aim 3) the relation between functional cell groups and inhibitory interneurons. In addition, (Aim 4) we will
use Granger causality analysis to assess the effective connectivity between different cell groups.
This is a collaboration between Dr. Padoa-Schioppa (PI), an expert in economic decisions, and Dr. Holy (co-I),
an expert in mouse olfaction and optical imaging. Our collaboration has been ongoing for several years and we
already published a first report. The experiments proposed here will break new ground and extend previous
work in a new and promising direction. If successful, our research will shed light on a fundamental brain
function. It will also lay the ground to pursue numerous other questions. Preliminary results obtained for each
specific aim demonstrate high likelihood of success.

10754582,"Although the increase in hypertension and cardiovascular disease-risk at menopause is well-recognized, the
mechanisms of menopausal hypertension are still inadequately understood. Irregular cycles and declining levels
of estrogen have been suspected to play a critical role in the emergence of hypertension at the onset of
menopause. However, a clear understanding of estrogen’s role in menopausal hypertension has been limited
by the confounding effects of variables such as aging in the human literature and the use of models primarily
reliant on the use of ovariectomized animals that do not replicate natural menopause in the preclinical literature.
Significantly, a mouse model of accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) induced by 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide
(VCD) can recapitulate early (i.e., peri-AOF) and late (i.e., post-AOF) stages of human peri- and postmenopause,
respectively. The AOF model has proven effective in isolating the role of sex hormones in blood pressure,
particularly with respect to models of neurogenic hypertension involving the hypothalamic paraventricular
nucleus (PVN), a brain area critical for coordinating sympathetic and neurohumoral processes important for the
regulation of blood pressure. In the last grant award, we found that peri-AOF hypertension induced by slow-
pressor angiotensin II (AngII) was associated with a signaling pathway involving estrogen receptor beta (ERb)
and the NMDA-type glutamate receptor in PVN neurons. It is important to recognize that after perimenopause
women transition to postmenopause, however, it is unclear if the mechanisms of hypertension during
postmenopause are mediated by similar mechanisms. In pilot data, we show that hypertension at post-AOF is
associated with altered signaling involving GluA1-expressing AMPA, but not NMDA receptors. We further show
that administration of an agonist of the G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER), but not ERb, inhibits
AngII hypertension in post-AOF mice. In this proposal, we will test the central hypothesis that post-AOF mice
are predisposed to hypertension that is dependent on GluA1 plasticity in the PVN and alleviated by GPER
signaling. Two aims will test this hypothesis. Aim 1 tests the sub-hypothesis that alterations in PVN GluA1
signaling contribute to hypertension in post-AOF mice. Aim 2 tests the sub-hypothesis that post-AOF
hypertension is associated with GPER signaling in the PVN. These studies will be performed using a
combination of approaches including high-resolution anatomical, neurophysiological, in vivo gene targeting, and
single-cell RNA sequencing approaches."
10802327,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Candida auris is an emerging multidrug-resistant fungal pathogen of great clinical concern that is associated with
outbreaks on six continents. A critical barrier to overcoming the high antifungal resistance in C. auris is the
significant lack of understanding of its genetic, genomic, and molecular basis. The long-term goal of this project
is to advance the treatment of C. auris. The overall objective of this proposal is to fully understand the molecular
and genetic basis of antifungal resistance in clinical isolates of this fungal pathogen. The central hypothesis
behind this proposal is that antifungal resistance is mediated both by mechanisms analogous to those previously
identified in other species of Candida, as well as novel mechanisms unique to this organism. Aim 1 is to identify
and delineate the genetic determinants of triazole resistance in clinical isolates of C. auris. Preliminary studies
identified mutations in genes encoding the triazole target sterol demethylase (Erg11) and the novel transcription
factor (TF) Tac1B as contributing to resistance in some but not all isolates. Genome Wide Association Studies
(GWAS) and transcriptional profiling of a growing collection of clinical and experimentally evolved isolates will
be used to identify novel genes and mutations linked to triazole resistance which will be tested using CRISPR-
Cas9 gene editing. The contribution of activating mutations in TF genes such as TAC1B and MRR1A will be
determined using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Aim 2 is to Identify and delineate the genetic determinants of
echinocandin resistance in clinical isolates of C. auris. Mutations in the gene encoding glucan synthase (FKS1)
have been identified among isolates resistant to echinocandins. However, preliminary data indicate that some
resistant isolates lack FKS1 mutations and others exhibit high-level resistance that cannot be explained by such
mutations alone. CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing will be used to assess mutations in FKS1 for their individual
contribution to resistance. Novel candidate resistance genes and mutations will be identified using GWAS and
transcriptional profiling of clinical and experimentally evolved isolates and these genes will be tested by CRISPR-
Cas9 gene editing. Aim 3 is to identify and delineate the genetic determinants of amphotericin B resistance in
clinical isolates of C. auris. In preliminary studies, mutations in the gene encoding sterol methyltransferase (Erg6)
were identified as a cause of resistance to amphotericin B. Novel resistance genes and mutations will be
identified using comprehensive sterol profiling, GWAS, and transcriptional profiling of clinical and experimentally
evolved isolates, and mutations will be tested by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. The relationship between
resistance and fitness will also be determined. Understanding the basis of antifungal resistance is essential for
the development of tools to better predict response to therapy, to aid rational drug design and development, and
to assist in epidemiologic tracking of the spread of resistance. The proposed project will, for the first time,
undertake a comprehensive examination of the genomic, genetic, and molecular basis of antifungal resistance
in the emerging multi-drug resistant fungal pathogen C. auris."

Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T-cell lymphoma (MEITL) is a rare but lethal disease with a median
survival of 1 year. There is no current effective standard-of-care. Previous MEITL sequencing efforts performed
by our group and others have revealed SETD2 as one of the most frequently altered genes in this disease.
SETD2 directs trimethylation of the lysine 36 residue on histone H3 (H3K36me3), which in turn is associated
with active transcription of genes. SETD2 has been implicated in DNA damage repair and mRNA splicing.
However, the molecular role of SETD2 and its interaction with activated oncogenes in MEITL pathogenesis is
largely unknown.
In this proposal, we will utilize a conditional mouse model to determine how SETD2 loss contributes to the
creation of a premalignant pool of intestinal intraepithelial cells (IELs), the cell of origin of MEITL. We will also
investigate how the combination of SETD2 loss and activation of the oncogenes STAT5B or MYC lead to IEL
transformation. Finally, we will determine the extent to which SETD2 deficiency sensitizes T lymphoma cells to
a variety of genotoxic chemotherapeutics. We anticipate that the results of this work will have immediate impact
on the design of effective treatment regimens that target MEITL and other SETD2-deficient lymphomas."

This application proposes to compare an optimized, resource-efficient, adaptive obesity treatment against a
gold-standard fixed treatment package and assessment only control. The obesity pandemic continues
unabated, presaging an onslaught of diabetes. Despite numerous initiatives, gold standard Diabetes
Prevention Program (DPP) intensive multicomponent behavioral treatment for overweight and obesity remains
too expensive, burdensome, and difficult to scale to suggest that it can be provided to the 2/3 of the population
that needs to lose weight. To address this challenge, we strive to optimize less burdensome treatment
approaches that can maximize weight loss in the population that has obesity with reduced resource
expenditure. In the SMART Weight Loss Management trial, we randomly assigned 400 adults with
overweight/obesity to a stepped care weight loss intervention in which first line treatment was either 1) a
smartphone app alone (App) or 2) the app plus coaching (App + C). Participants who did not attain adequate
weight loss (i.e., averaging >0.5 lb/week) were classified as nonresponders, and re-randomized to be stepped
up by a modest or vigorous addition of treatment components. Preliminary Results showed that: 1) More
patients achieved clinically meaningful 6 month weight loss with App + C than App; 2) App + C non-responders
who adhered to the vigorous step-up (text message and meal replacement) lost as much weight as responders
by 12-months. These compelling findings point to a need to test the efficacy of SMARTER stepped-care
intervention in a randomized controlled trial. The SMARTer trial is a three-arm, non-inferiority randomized
controlled trial that compares the optimized, adaptive SMARTer intervention against gold-standard DPP and
Control. The trial will address whether a scalable, stepped-care intervention can stand up to gold-standard
DPP by achieving comparable weight loss at less cost. If so, we will emerge with a scalable, effective
intervention that tailors to patient response using a stepped-care model. Alongside evaluation of clinical non-
inferiority, a comprehensive economic analysis will inform relative affordability and scalability. Hypotheses are
that: 1) SMARTer stepped-care will be non-inferior to gold standard DPP in its effect on 6 month weight loss;
and 2) The SMARTer intervention will be more cost-effective to implement. We will explore whether extending
the SMARTer intervention results in weight loss maintenance at 12 months compared to DPP and Control.
Lastly, we will explore mediators and moderators of SMARTer's effect on weight loss to inform future
intervention optimization. If successful, findings will support dissemination of a cost-effective obesity population
management strategy that facilitates treating obesity with the resources it needs – not more, and not less."

While the emergence of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis raises an urgent need for antimicrobials with new
Modes of Action, their discovery remains a major challenge. Many of the techniques to unravel drug Modes
of Action rely on low-throughput, time-consuming and target-specific approaches that provide low-
dimensional views into the broader functional impact of potential drugs. Together with the Zampieri lab at
ETH Zurich, Switzerland, by leveraging CRISPR technology and non-targeted metabolomics, we
developed a combined computational/experimental strategy that is based on the comparison of genetic
and drug induced metabolic effects and allows to perform high-throughput de novo functional annotations
of large compound libraries. Unraveling the mechanistic basis of drug or gene perturbations of thousands
of metabolites provides rich multidimensional information complementary to classical phenotypic profiling
and can be used to investigate the effect and mode of action of any drug candidate.
The overall goal of the present proposal is to achieve functional annotation of 500 anti-TB compounds with
known potency but unknown MoA, which will pave the way to new unconventional strategies to eradicate
TB. We will build a compendium of metabolic responses of Mtb to essential gene knockdown, transcription
factor overexpression and a unique selection of libraries of Mtb growth inhibitors. We will use our custom-
developed computational tools to categorize drug action and gene knockdowns according to metabolic
profiles, make testable hypothesis about unconventional drug MoA and move prioritized compounds to
genetic and biochemical hit validation. An important collateral benefit of our proposed work will be
functional annotation of genes with yet unknown function in M. tuberculosis, and an information dense
database on gene-drug-metabolic interactions in M. tuberculosis."
10756126,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle) is a fundamental process in eukaryotic
cells, serving as the source for ATP generation and producing reducing equivalents for cell metabolism under
aerobic conditions. In recent years, it has become clear that genes encoding the enzymes in the TCA cycle can
be causative genetic lesions in human cancers, including in inherited tumor syndromes associated with renal
cancer, paragangliomas/pheochromocytomas (PPGL), and Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs) among
others, including epithelial thyroid cancer. They are also well described in sporadic tumors from these same
tissues, as well as in a spectrum of other cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and glioblastoma.
Mutations in Krebs cycle enzymes and their related cofactors are thought to cause tumor formation through the
oncogenic effects of excess metabolite accumulation (oncometabolites). These intermediate metabolites act by
interference with the function of enzymes requiring the metabolic cofactor alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG, also known
as 2- oxoglutarate). There are approximately 70 aKG-dependent enzymes in humans, and they perform a variety
of essential cellular functions, including mediating modification of DNA, RNA, and histone proteins. Enzymes of
this class are also responsible for oxidative hydroxylation of proteins, including the structural protein collagen.
We have previously demonstrated using both in vitro and in vivo models for thyroid neoplasia that loss of the
Succinate Dehydrogenase D subunit (SDHD) causes phenotypic changes indicative of early stages of cancer.
Further, this genetic changes causes cells to gain a stem-like phenotype, as evidenced by expression of the
stem cell associated transcription factors Nanog and Oct4 and production of the stem cell marker Aldehyde
Dehydrogenase (ALDH). Despite the fact that interference with aKG-dependent oxygenases has been proposed
as a neoplastic mechanism, no prior efforts have been made to identify family members which are responsible
for the neoplastic change. To fill this knowledge gap, we propose to use a high throughput CRISPR-based
transcriptional repression screen to identify aKG-dependent enzymes whose inhibition leads to a recapitulation
of the stem-like phenotype. Identified hits will be validated using a combination of cellular models and in silico
analysis of tumor-based omics data. The Aims for this R03 pilot proposal are as follows:
1) To use a CRISPRi screen to identify alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) dependent enzyme(s) whose inhibition
leads to the acquisition of a stem-like phenotype
2) To validate identified enzymes in cell line models and in human tumor datasets
Identification of the enzymes whose functions are affected by accumulation of the oncometabolite succinate will
shed important new light on the molecular mechanism of disease associated with Sdhx and other TCA cycle
mutations, and will provide a stepping stone for future research grants that will allow detailed delineation of
genetic and/or protein targets that drive tumor formation in the thyroid and other tissues (e.g. glioma, leukemia)."

Cocaine use disorder remains a prevalent problem with no FDA-approved treatment and profound societal
consequences. Cocaine-associated memories are strong and resistant to modification but are the basis of
relapse in many individuals. Our long-term goal is to diminish cocaine-associated memories to reduce
drug relapse. The self-administration model in rodents best reproduces strong cocaine-associated memory.
We have found that the removal of perineuronal nets (PNNs) in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
disrupts cocaine self-administration memories by interfering with reconsolidation of these memories. PNNs
form mainly around parvalbumin (PV)-containing, fast spiking interneurons that powerfully regulate mPFC
output, and mPFC output is well known to control drug-seeking behavior in both animals and humans. PV
neurons maintain cortical excitatory:inhibitory balance and contribute to theta and gamma oscillations vital for
communication across brain regions, yet almost nothing is known about how mPFC PV neurons contribute to
cocaine memory reconsolidation. Our Preliminary Data show that PNN removal in the mPFC: (1) decreases
PV neuron firing and increases excitability of pyramidal cells in drug-naïve rats; (2) profoundly disrupts the
reconsolidation of a self-administration cocaine memory, including cue-induced reinstatement and progressive
ratio responding; and (3) disrupts the synchrony of theta and gamma oscillations within the mPFC and
between the mPFC and hippocampus in response to a cocaine cue. These findings are significant because
they are expected to give novel insights into brain oscillatory patterns that may signify disrupted cocaine
memory and how to modify these persistent drug-associated memories. We hypothesize that PNNs allow PV
neurons to stabilize and maintain cocaine memories and that, without PNNs, these memories can be
destabilized and profoundly disrupted. We will use PV-Cre knock-in rats crossed with tdTomato knock-in
rats throughout to determine in Aim 1 how PNN removal alters mPFC PV neuron function and in Aim 2 how
PNN removal alters mPFC circuit function during cocaine memory reconsolidation. In Aim 3, we will assess
two mechanistic pathways by which PNN removal blocks reconsolidation, including Cre-dependent, specific
suppression of PNNs and Cre-dependent inhibition of PV neuron activity with Gi-DREADDs. We will use both
slice and in vivo electrophysiology, transcriptomics, tract tracing, immunohistochemistry, molecular, and
chemogenetic approaches to identify key factors in PV neuron-mediated control of cocaine-seeking behavior
during cocaine memory reconsolidation. Our studies are expected to generate significant advances in
understanding how to diminish powerful memories that drive cocaine-seeking behavior."

Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem worldwide, especially myocardial infarction-induced HF with
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) accounting for 50% of all HF cases. Malignant ventricular arrhythmia
accounts for nearly 50-60% of mortality in HF patients. Cardiac sympathetic overactivation, a major feature of
HF, could trigger malignant ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. My research laboratory is
continually focusing on the regulatory role of the peripheral nervous system in peripheral tissues (such as
myocardium) in pathophysiological conditions including HF. Our recent research project found that cardiac
sympathetic neuronal dysfunction contributes to cardiac sympathetic overactivation and malignant ventricular
arrhythmias in advanced HF. To extend our current work, the overall vision of this R01 application is to test
whether satellite glia-modulated macrophages can drive cardiac sympathetic functional and structural
remodeling and be the therapeutic target for improving cardiac sympathetic function and reducing malignant
ventricular arrhythmogenesis in advanced HF. To accomplish this vision, the proposal will still use myocardial
infarction-induced advanced HF and sham (sham surgery) animals as the primary experimental tool to pioneer
discovery in 3 Specific Aims. We will also use multifaceted approaches in this project, from conscious and
anesthetized animals to cellular-molecular-genetic levels, along with some especially cutting-edge techniques
(e.g., optogenetic satellite glial silencing, 3D reconstruction with tissue-maker software, cardiac slice
electrochemistry recording, and a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel delivery system). Specific Aim 1 will
determine activation of satellite glia and macrophages as well as relations between satellite glia and
macrophages in cardiac sympathetic ganglia in advanced HF, because there is limited information about
relations among satellite glia, macrophages, and sympathetic ganglionic neurons in advanced HF. Specific Aim
2 will determine the involvement of satellite glia and macrophages in cardiac sympathetic remodeling including
structural and functional alterations in cardiac sympathetic neurons located in stellate ganglia and their nerve
terminals in advanced HF, because most published studies (including our work) reported the scattered
information about HF-triggered cardiac sympathetic remodeling. Specific Aim 3 will provide a tight link with
other Specific Aims to establish optogenetic satellite glial silencing and hydrogel-encapsulated (also
macrophage-related) therapeutic approaches against sympathetic overactivation, ventricular
arrhythmogenesis, and cardiac contractile dysfunction in advanced HF. Accomplishing these goals will provide
major conceptual, technical, and translational advances for our understanding of the pathophysiology and
related therapeutic targets of cardiac sympathetic overactivation and malignant ventricular arrhythmogenesis in
advanced HF."

 Cannabis is the most commonly used federally illicit recreational drug in the U.S., and legal recreational and
medicinal use has increased over the last decade. Cannabis contains phytocannabinoids with differing affinities
for the ubiquitously expressed G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors CB1R and CB2R. The kidney produces
endogenous cannabinoids (ECs) that increase urine output with variable effects on Na+ and K+ excretion in
rodents. Few studies in humans suggest that cannabinoids can act as diuretics, promoting not only urinary Na+
but alsoHCO3- losses. We have preliminarily shown in mice that CB1R is expressed in and impairs pHi regulation
in intercalated cells (ICs), cells in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) that are responsible for H+/HCO3- secretion
and Na+ (and K+) transport. We have also shown that cannabinoid receptor agonists acutely increase urinary
water excretion in mice. Therefore, we hypothesize that ICs participate in CB1R mediated diuresis possibly
through cross-talk with principal cells, cells responsible for the reabsorption of Na+ and water.
This VA Career Development Award application aims to define the role of ECs in the CCD. Three Specific
Aims (SA) will be studied to evaluate the presence and physiological significance of CB1R signaling on function
of the mouse CCD. SA1 will define cell-specific expression of components of the EC system in this segment;
SA2 will determine the role of CB1R signaling on cell-specific function in the CCD, utilizing pharmacologic
activators/inhibitors of CB1R; and SA3 will determine whether targeted deletion of CB1R in ICs alters cell-specific
functions. The results promise to provide new insight into the effects of cannabinoids on the kidney and allows
us to identify targets (e.g., CB1R agonists) for development of novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of
disorders such as hypertension, volume overload, metabolic acidosis, and hyponatremia.
 The proposed training plan includes career development activities, courses, and workshops to enhance the
proficiency of the PI (Dr. Joshua Rein, a board-certified nephrologist and certified hypertension specialist) in
single tubule microdissection, isolated tubule in vitro microperfusion, functional fluorescent microscopy, lipid
biochemistry and pharmacology, cell biology, electrophysiology, cell sorting, and animal models including the
development of transgenic mouse models. These skills will be reinforced by a team of mentors, advisors, and
collaborators, all of whom have the requisite expertise, knowledge, and mentorship track-records.
In sum, this VA CDA grant proposal provides a robust career development plan for Dr. Rein to accomplish
his career goals to develop a national reputation as an expert in the renal EC system, aiming to uncover novel
molecular pathways underlying the renal regulation of electrolyte and acid/base balance. His long-term goal is
to translate key observations from preclinical studies into an enhanced understanding of human disease and
therapeutics. The expertise and support of his mentors will be critical to his career development. The James J.
Peters VAMC and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai provide outstanding academic environments for
Dr. Rein’s career development, with leadership committed to his success and 75% protected time conduct his
research."
10764951,"ABSTRACT
Smith-Kingsmore Syndrome (SKS) is a newly discovered genetic disorder caused by mutations in the
mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) gene. MTOR functions to coordinate intracellular energy levels
with cellular homeostasis and growth. MTOR deregulation is implicated in various pathological conditions,
including brain dysfunction. A notable example is tuberous sclerosis, in which MTOR hyperactivation due to
Tsc1/2 mutation causes autism, epilepsy, and benign tumors in the brain. Clinical features of SKS include
macrocephaly, epilepsy, seizure, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and developmental delay.
Our recent studies also revealed new aspects of SKS, including sleep/wake disruption, hyperphagia,
hyperactivity, and self-aggression, all indicative of homeostatic imbalance and hypothalamic dysfunction.
Our research has a central focus on the circadian and sleep systems. Sleep/wake disturbance is prevalent
in SKS patients and represents a top concern of patients and caregivers. Sleep insufficiency reflects
homeostatic imbalance in the brain, exacerbating disease states. Our long-term goal is to advance the
understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of SKS. Our central hypothesis is that chronic
activation of MTOR in SKS disrupts cell physiological homeostatic, leading to disruption of sleep/wake and
other functions. To test this hypothesis, we will generate cellular and mouse SKS models and investigate
how the pathogenic SKS variants affect MTOR activity, circadian rhythms, sleep/wake homeostasis, and
other behavioral and cognitive functions. We hope to provide proof of principle that a better understanding
of causal mechanisms, beyond genotype, enables precision medicine treatment strategies. The MTOR
inhibitor rapamycin impacts both sleep time/phase and quality. Notably, low-dose rapamycin, optimized for
specific alleles to normalize MTOR activity, was able to restore the patient’s sleep/wake pattern, while
improving other clinical features. We will explore rapamycin regimens and test the hypothesis that by
normalizing MTOR activity, allele-specific low-dose rapamycin can improve sleep/wake and other functions.
As rapamycin impacts sleep time and quality and other behavioral and cognitive functions, we hope to
expand the concept that sleep/wake function represents a novel neurophysiological biomarker for
rapamycin dosing, MTOR activity and CNS homeostasis. This research will lay the groundwork for future
mechanistic and therapeutic research. Further, this research has direct and broader implications for other
MTORopathies including TSC."

SARS-CoV-2 has led to unprecedented disruptions to society, killing more than 6 million people worldwide. It is
a respiratory virus whose main mode of transmission is via respiratory droplets and aerosols. Social distancing
and vaccines have greatly decreased the rate of infection and transmission. Despite these efforts, SARS-CoV-
2 transmission has continued. Moreover, different variants of concern, harboring signature mutations in the virus
attachment Spike protein, have emerged. How these changes affect transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in naïve,
infected and immunized individuals is not known. The transmission bottleneck is defined as the number of unique
virus particles that establish an infection in the recipient host. This number is important as it determines the rate
of evolution of the virus and the immune threshold required for protection from infection. This application will use
barcoded or tagged SARS-CoV-2 to quantify how many virus particles establish an infection in the recipient host.
We will use the Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 airborne transmission model to define how the innate and adaptive
immune response in the donor and recipient host effect the number of unique transmission events. Using
genetically modified hamsters that are deficient in their type I or III interferon response will be used to measure
the role of innate immunity on SARS-CoV-2 transmission to the upper respiratory tract (URT) and subsequent
dissemination of the virus to lower respiratory tract (LRT). Transmission and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 will
also be quantified in recipient animals that were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, immunized with mucosal
and systemic COVID-19 vaccines, or received neutralizing IgG and IgA antibodies. Finally, this application will
measure the impact of immune escape on the transmission bottleneck in immune recipients. Fundamental
insights into respiratory virus transmission and dissemination, transmission bottleneck and defining correlates of
protection in the URT and LRT will inform future vaccine efforts against respiratory viruses."

Caregivers are both socially rewarding and a crucial source of learning input, and infants’ ability to prioritize
attention to their caregiver over other competing stimuli is critical for effective early learning. Altered processing
of social reward is common across several atypical developmental contexts, including among infants of
depressed mothers and children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). This reduced sensitivity to
social reward may disrupt infants’ attention to caregivers and contribute to poorer learning outcomes associated
with maternal depression and ASD. To understand how attention mechanisms become disrupted in atypical
development it is necessary to characterize their normative development. Two distinct attention mechanisms,
attention orienting (shifting attention to select information) and attention holding (maintaining attention to process
information), function together to shape early learning. However, past research linking caregiving experiences
(i.e., social-motivational factors) to developing attention has only examined infants’ attention holding biases to
caregivers without also examining orienting. Adults show robust orienting biases to motivationally salient stimuli,
but research investigating early attention orienting has not addressed social-motivational factors and instead
emphasizes mechanisms based on perceptual salience and endogenous control. As a result, the role of social-
motivational factors in the typical development of infants’ attention orienting is unknown. The proposed research
will investigate the development and predictors of infants’ attention biases to caregivers and strangers who
engage in salient caregiving behaviors. Study 1 will use eye tracking to longitudinally characterize within-subject
changes in attention orienting and holding biases to caregiver vs. stranger faces from 4- to 8-months of age (Aim
1). We will use additional measures of focused attention and behavioral coding of infant-caregiver interactions
to determine the extent to which caregiving quality and endogenous attention control predict these changes in
attention biases over time (Aim 2). Study 2 will determine the extent to which caregiving behaviors drive infants’
attention beyond the familiarity of the social partner (Aim 3). Across four experiments, we will assess whether
infants’ preferential orienting generalizes to strangers who engage in caregiver-typical behaviors (i.e., appearing
frequently, using infant-directed speech, responding contingently to their behavior). Research has extensively
documented that early infant-caregiver interactions are critically important for social-emotional development, but
we know far less about how these experiences influence developing cognitive skills. By characterizing the
development of infants’ attention biases to caregivers and identifying predictors of individual variance in these
biases, this work will ultimately promote our understanding of mechanisms that link social reward processing to
infants’ early attention to and learning from caregivers in typical and atypical development."

We propose novel statistical and machine learning methods for processing and analyzing accelerometer data
for studying physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep and their effects on outcomes such as
cardiovascular health. Methods to accurately estimate and characterize physical activity, sedentary
behavior and sleep are crucially needed. Accelerometers have been widely adopted as the standard
objective measure of movement in free-living humans. Recent advances have spawned instruments that
collect enormous amounts of data that has far outpaced the research community’s ability to meaningfully
interpret them. Current studies rely on outdated methods for identifying non-wear and addressing missing data,
potentially yielding biased and inefficient estimates of relationships between behavioral activity
patterns and outcomes. Importantly, methods for distinguishing between non-wear periods and those that
represent sedentary behavior or sleep have not been validated using a gold standard in free-living contexts.
The handling of non-wear periods using a statistically valid approach that exploits the multivariate and time-
series nature of the data has yet to be developed. Thus, new methods are needed to address current gaps.
We propose developing and validating an ensemble classifier to distinguish non-wear time. We will adapt and
validate multiple imputation methods that exploit the multivariate and time-series nature of the data to handle
non-wear time in analyses that make use of entire profiles of physical activity. Specifically, we will evaluate
methods for incorporating multiple imputation for handling missing data from non-wear when applying adaptive
clustering algorithms to identify distinct patterns of sleep and activity in order to relate them to outcomes in a
generalized linear mixed effects model framework. We will create open-source user-friendly software that can
be adopted and enhanced by the research community. Our approach integrates three novel data resources to
develop our methods – two with knowledge of true activity and non-wear, and a third generated from a unique
four-year longitudinal time series for both accelerometry and cardiovascular risk factor measures in a real-
world setting. It offers an opportunity to develop and illustrate methods using data generated from wearable
devices in a natural environment that includes missing data. This is the first study to incorporate missing data
methods into learning algorithms under a generalized linear mixed effects model framework for accelerometer
studies. Such methods will be critical for both observational and clinical trial research in real-world settings,
where wear and non-wear time are not directly observed. The resulting insights and tools will also be highly
applicable to the processing and analysis of other types of intensively sampled serial data, such as those
generated from mobile digital devices."
10763414,"The central objective of this research program is to determine the role of the CNS in hypertension associated
with chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), a model of hypoxemia associated with sleep apnea. Our previous results
indicate that the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) contributes to the sustained hypertension produced by CIH in
rat. These experiments will investigate 3 novel mechanisms that may allow the MnPO to contribute to CIH
hypertension. Our working hypothesis, based on our previous studies, is that CIH triggers FosB transcriptional
activity involving angiotensin II (ANG II) and NO signaling to increase excitation causing BDNF-driven increases
in intracellular chloride. These effects would further increase excitation and reduce or reverse inhibition from
arterial baroreceptors promoting sustained CIH HTN during normoxic periods of the day.
Specific Aim 1: Test the role of angiotensin signaling in increased MnPO excitation in CIH HTN.
Hypothesis: Increased angiotensin signaling increases the activity of PVN-projecting MnPO neurons.
Aim 1 will quantify the contribution of the brain angiotensin system to increased activity in PVN-projecting MnPO
neurons using angiotensin “sniffer cells” 19 combined with optogenetics, patch clamp electrophysiology, in vivo
recording of sympathetic nerve activity, and MnPO single unit activity.
Specific Aim 2: Test the role of NO in increasing MnPO excitation in CIH HTN.
Hypothesis: Increased expression and activity of nos1 in MnPO increases presynaptic excitation to drive
sustained CIH hypertension.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the increase of nos1 expression and activity triggered by CIH increases
presynaptic excitation in PVN projecting MnPO neurons. This mechanism will be tested using in vitro
electrophysiology and paired real-time measurements of NO with carbon fiber electrodes and DAF-2 imaging, in
vivo recording of sympathetic nerve activity, and chronic blood pressure recording with radio telemetry.
Specific Aim 3: Determine the contribution of reduced/reversed GABA inhibition and BDNF to changes in
MnPO excitability, synaptic efficacy, and CIH HTN.
Hypothesis: CIH triggers BDNF neurons that reduces/reverses GABA inhibition in MnPO neurons.
Aim 3 will determine if BDNF reduces/reverses baroreceptor inhibition by GABA in PVN-projecting MnPO
neurons though chloride transports such as sodium potassium chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) and/or
potassium chloride cotransporter2 (KCC2). These experiments will use live cell chloride imaging, brain slice and
in vivo electrophysiology, and channel rhodopsin assisted circuit mapping."

Disruption of normal glomerular filtration is one of the key causes of end-stage renal disease, leading to the need for renal replacement therapy. Myosin 1e (Myo1e) is a cytoskeletal protein that is highly expressed in the glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) and is involved in many processes important for podocyte function, such as actin assembly regulation, endocytosis, and regulation of cell adhesion. Mutations in MYO1E are found in patients with chronic kidney disease, highlighting its role in maintaining glomerular filtration barrier. In this project we will examine the role of Myo1e activity in supporting podocyte cytoskeletal organization and normal kidney function and test the hypothesis that activation of Myo1e can help protect podocytes from injury and preserve normal glomerular filtration. In Aim 1 we will analyze how disease-associated mutations affect Myo1e functions and activity using a combination of cell-based and in vitro (biochemical) methods. In Aim 2 we will determine the mechanism of autoinhibition of Myo1e activity. In Aim 3 we will test how Myo1e activity helps maintain podocyte integrity and whether activation of Myo1e will have a protective effect on kidney function."

Post-stroke cognitive impairment is common, particularly in older individuals. Existing knowledge gaps about
mechanisms underpinning poor outcome, particularly in the aged, have been the most significant barriers to
developing novel therapeutic targets and approaches to prevent cognitive decline and progression to Alzheimer’s
disease and related dementias (ADRD). This is especially relevant to health disparity populations, specifically
women and Black demographics. Previous studies of Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment,
suggest that the morphological changes of the corpus callosum are related to cognitive measures. Existing data
show that classical neuroimaging biomarkers such as acute infarct volume, location, and white matter
hyperintensity burden have modest prognostic predictive utility in models of post-stroke cognitive function. We
have recently used diffusion tensor imaging in acute stroke patients to show that decreased fractional anisotropy
of the ipsi- and contra-lateral hemispheric normal appearing white matter, as well as the corpus callosum, are
associated with higher stroke scale impairment severity. Additionally, we have also used advanced diffusion
imaging to examine white matter microstructure in midlife individuals with significant vascular risk factors, as well
as Black and women demographics at risk for stroke and cognitive impairment. Our preliminary results suggest
that the corpus callosum and other white matter structures involved in cognition manifest specific diffusion
changes that not only relate to vascular risk factor burden exposure, but also to post-stroke outcome. Our
laboratory has pioneered diffusion MRI acquisition and modeling approaches that are sensitive to not only white
matter anisotropy, but also white matter complexity. As such, we are well poised to comprehensively characterize
the diffusion properties of normal appearing white matter across time and age, in acute stroke patients and their
post-stroke cognitive trajectories. Our established expertise in diffusion imaging and modeling that is sensitive
to white matter complexity in relation to the presence of age-related vascular risk profiles, allows us to
longitudinally examine the unique microstructural properties of the corpus callosum, infarcted and non-infarcted
tissue, and more remote structures on the contralateral non-lesioned hemisphere and their relationship to post-
stroke recovery. It is therefore possible that a deeper understanding of white matter microstructure in the acute
stage after ischemic stroke and its change over time, will enhance prediction models of post-stroke cognitive
recovery and identify novel target for therapeutic interventions. This knowledge will also help our clinicians
provide much needed bed-side prognosis to patients and their families. Our central hypothesis is that after
unilateral ischemic stroke, temporal changes in the diffusion properties of normal appearing white matter of the
corpus callosum specifically, and the white matter across both hemispheres in general, are associated with the
differential patterns of post-stroke age-related cognitive trajectories."

ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling in Cancer
Chromatin and epigenetic regulators have emerged as important contributors to human cancer. The subunits
of the mSWI/SNF or BAF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex are mutated in over 20% of human
cancers. In addition, several other ATP-dependent remodelers make important contributions to the
pathogenesis of specific cancers. These complexes often function as genetically dominant tumor suppressors,
however the BAF complex also plays oncogenic roles in synovial sarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma.
Despite their prevalent roles in human cancer their oncogenic mechanism(s) remain unclear and a detailed
molecular understanding, necessary for therapeutic development, has been elusive. One of the most well
documented roles of BAF complexes is their opposition to Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC)
complexes. Indeed, BAF subunits were discovered in flies as suppressors of PRC1 mutations. In addition,
inhibition of PRC is therapeutic in some cancers having loss of function mutations in the BAF complex.
However, the mechanisms underlying the opposition between BAF chromatin remodeling complexes and
Polycomb complexes is still unclear. We will obtain a detailed understanding of the physical interaction
between these complexes and explore their oncogenic roles with the goal of identifying potential sites of
therapeutic intervention. One possible mechanism underlying the BAF-PRC opposition is the potential of BAF
complexes to exchange or evict nucleosomes modified by PRC1 and 2. Measured rates of nucleosome
exchange by several techniques and by several groups show that nucleosomes exchange several times per
cell cycle. This observation seems inconsistent with the widely held concept that histone and/or nucleosome
modifications are the basis of epigenetic and phenotypic stability. Another way of stating this is “why do the 32
SNF2-like ATP-dependent remodelers encoded in the mammalian genome not quickly erase all histone
modifications by nucleosome exchange? This conflict would be resolved if nucleosome exchange by ATP-
dependent remodelers was selective to a specific remodeler and a specific nucleosomal modification. Thus,
we are developing two new techniques that will fill this gap in our knowledge by measuring exchange of
specifically modified nucleosomes and attributing them to specific remodelers, including their post translational
or oncogenic modifications. These techniques should allow the understanding of the paradox that rates of
nucleosome exchange appear to be far faster than the rate of change of histone modifications. We will use
these techniques to assign changes in the epigenetic landscape to specific ATP-dependent chromatin
regulators and to understand the stability of epigenetic histone modifications in normal and malignant cells. At
the conclusion of our studies, we hope to have a deeper and more detailed understanding of both the normal
and oncogenic mechanisms related to mutation or dysfunction of the mSWI/SNF or BAF chromatin remodeling
complex."
10755355,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common monogenic cause of Autism
spectrum disorder (ASD), a group of complex neurodevelopmental disorders
characterized by core diagnostic impairments in social interactions and
communication, restricted repetitive behaviors and interests, and an association
with intellectual disability. FXS results from deficiency in expression of the FMR1
gene encoding Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP). An early overgrowth
of neurons and excessive immature synaptic contacts have been observed in
brains of children with FXS, as well as in the Fmr1 KO mouse model. At a
molecular level, aberrant excessive protein synthesis, with altered production of
key synaptic proteins, is implicated in the atypical neural and synaptic overgrowth.
While FMRP loss can lead to excessive protein synthesis, mechanisms altering
the gene-target selectivity of protein synthesis to produce the distinct phenotypes
of FMRP-deficiency are incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAS) are small
RNAs which can selectively target gene transcripts for repression in the RNA-
induced silencing complex (RISC). FXS has been linked to misregulation of
miRNAs and miRNA-mediated gene repression for over 15 years, but broad
knowledge of alterations in targeted transcripts has been lacking. We propose to
carry out genome-wide quantitative comparisons of RISC-mediated gene targeting
in the wildtype and FMRP-deficient setting using both mice and human neurons.
Directed by preliminary data, we will investigate the candidate let-7 miRNA family
to test the hypothesis that dysregulation of let-7 miRNA biogenesis in the Fmr1 KO
mouse contributes to altered repression of pro-growth mRNAs and downstream
behavioral and neuroanatomical phenotypes. A multipronged approach for
mechanistic investigation and prioritizing gene targets and pathways from
genome-wide assessments will be followed by intervention to assess the functional
consequences for FXS-associated phenotypes with the goal of enhancing our
understanding of FMRP function and providing new molecular targets for
intervention in phenotypes resulting from deficiency of FMRP."

Estimates from twin and inbred animal models suggest that up to 50% of metabolic disease heterogeneity is due to something other than genetics or the environment. We previously discovered that Trim28 is a master regulator of non-genetic, non-environmental phenotypic heterogeneity; demonstrated that Trim28 buffers against a unique (bistable) epigenetic obesity in isogenic Trim28+/D9 mice; and identified a comparable TRIM28-associated mRNA expression signature in human obesity. Individuals at the obese, epigenetically “ON” end of the spectrum are characterized by dysregulation of Trim28-sensitive loci, including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Trim28-normally interacts with KZFPs to keep ERVs in a stable, fully silenced state throughout development. However, a subset of ERVs partially escape this silencing and become variably methylated (VM-ERVs), which translates into variable levels of repression/activation, subsequent variability in neighboring gene expression, and ultimately phenotypic variation. Our preliminary data indicate that VM-ERVs have sequence content allowing them to be bound by Zinc-Finger-CxxC (ZF-CxxC) domain containing proteins, thereby protecting these loci from methylation. We hypothesize that activation vs silencing at VM-ERV loci is controlled by a competition between KZFP/Trim28 and ZF-CxxC binding, and that TRIM28-sensitive VM-ERV expression is a significant driver of unexplained phenotypic variation and metabolic disease heterogeneity. We will test these hypotheses through three independent Aims. In Aim 1, we will define the epigenomic characteristics of ERVs in hepatocytes and adipocytes to identify the epigenomic and genomic features that define VM-ERVs. In Aim 2, we will profile binding of specific ZF-CxxC proteins (CFP1 and TET1) to prove that these proteins gain a competitive binding advantage as Trim28 levels are reduced and demonstrate that ZF-CxxC – KZFP/Trim28 competition triggers epigenetic variability at VM-ERVs. In Aim 3, we will determine if VM-ERV activation is coupled to metabolic disease heterogeneity. We expect this project will identify Trim28/ZF-CxxC competition as a novel mechanism governing the variable silencing at ERVs and provide the research community with a comprehensive list of target proteins and pathways to study and begin understanding how VM-ERV dysregulation triggers and/or influences complex disease etiology."
10789912,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Central nervous system (CNS) injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury (SCI) are major contributors to the
global burden of disability. Attenuating CNS damage represents the core of research and neurorehabilitation
strategies to enhance recovery. Yet, mounting evidence of peripheral nervous system (PNS) alterations after
CNS injury provides an untapped area for therapeutic investigation. The PNS links CNS motor output with
skeletal muscle function, where motor unit recruitment and firing rate modulate control. A motor unit is comprised
of one motoneuron and all myofibers it innervates. For precision of motor control, healthy myofibers receive one
motoneuronal axon via a single neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Studies suggest profound motor unit loss in
paretic muscle after stroke and SCI, though exact mechanisms are undefined. Moreover, the applicant recently
identified striking NMJ remodeling after stroke, including aberrant polyaxonal innervation (PAI), where NMJs
receive more than one axonal input. Pilot data in SCI demonstrate motor unit losses similar to stroke, but impacts
of SCI at the NMJ remain unexplored. Taken together, this project will interrogate maladaptive PNS remodeling
in the context of CNS injury disability. This work will test the therapeutic potential of targeting paretic NMJs with
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a known mediator of motor neuron viability and NMJ plasticity. In
murine models of stroke and SCI, the applicant will longitudinally study motor behavior, motor unit electro-
physiology, and muscle contractility; assess histopathology of motoneuron pools and NMJs; employ molecular
biology techniques to define mechanisms of PAI; and validate a novel gene therapy approach. Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that SCI induces motor unit dysfunction and NMJ remodeling, similar to stroke. Aim 2 will define
pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke-induced motor unit loss; some predict motoneuron degeneration is
responsible, however we hypothesize re-expression of developmental mediators induces motor unit overlap,
with PAI presenting electrophysiologically as spurious motor unit loss. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that post-
stroke reduction in BDNF signaling drives PAI, while normalization of BDNF via adeno-associated viral delivery
restores NMJ form and motor function. Mentored training in translational neuromuscular physiology from the
Sponsor (a neuromuscular specialist with extensive preclinical/clinical experience in neuromuscular health and
disease) is complemented by a gene therapy specialist in CNS/PNS diseases as Co-Sponsor, and supported by
two key Collaborators (an SCI physician-scientist, and a neuroscientist with BDNF signaling expertise). This
mentorship team dovetails with the excellent resources and environment at The Ohio State University to facilitate
growth in new areas of investigation and prepare the applicant for independence. Using clinically-relevant
approaches to interrogate peripheral mechanisms of motor dysfunction after CNS injury, this project will expand
the fundamental understanding of stroke and SCI disability, inform future therapeutics targeting peripheral
alterations, and offer critical training opportunities for career development in academic neurological research."
10754943,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone neoplasms in people, with the majority of cases
affecting adolescents and young adults. Up to 30% of those diagnosed will not survive 5 years with current,
multimodal therapy which includes surgery, chemotherapy and, in some cases, radiation therapy. No meaningful
improvements in survival times have been made in the past 40 years, illustrating the desperate need for novel
forms of therapy.
 The core binding factor beta (CBFβ) protein is one subunit of a heterodimeric transcription factor complex
that binds to Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) to coordinate organized skeletal development. Both
components are overexpressed in OS and their normal activity is dysregulated. With no inherent DNA binding
nor transcriptional activity of its own, very little is known about the activity of cytoplasmic CBFβ. Yet, this protein
is upregulated in OS, demonstrates increased expression in metastatic lesions, and is associated with reduced
disease free and overall survival. CBFβ appears to control RUNX2 expression through post-transcriptional
mechanisms independent of RUNX2 protein stability or proteasomal degredation. Recently, CBFβ has been
implicated in regulating the initiation of protein translation in breast cancer cells. This project aims to identify and
describe a noncanonical, regulatory role of CBFβ in initiating cap-dependent protein translation in OS, a process
to which malignant cells are thought to be addicted. The goals of this project will be accomplished through the
use of a CBFβ knockout cells transfected with either wild-type CBFβ or asite-directed mutant of CBFβ that targets
the binding site with RUNX2. An inhibitory peptide will be used in additional OS cell lines and normal osteoblast
cells. The Specific Aims of this project will 1) determine the mechanism of post-transcriptional control of RUNX2
protein expression by CBFβ and 2) Identify the contribution of CBFβ to cap-dependent protein translation in
osteosarcoma.
 De novo protein synthesis assays, investigation of CBFβ interactions with translational machinery
proteins, and the ability CBFβ to influence RNA-binding and cap-binding protein interactions with RUNX2 mRNA
will be used to uncover potential mechanisms by which CBFβ exerts post-transcriptional control of RUNX2.
Ribosome footprinting, or Ribo-seq, combined with RNA-seq will identify the role of CBFβ on translational
efficiency of RUNX2 and RUNX2-target gene products. Ribo-seq data will also provide a global view of the
influence of CBFβ on protein translation, and subsequent pathway analysis will provide information about
potential novel targets in OS.
 These studies, when combined with those of the current K01 SERCA, will advance research
independence of the applicant and will be used to develop and refine research hypotheses for inclusion in a
future R01 application."
10769845,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rationale: All cells produce incomplete proteins, a consequence of surprisingly common errors in gene
expression. Cells have evolved multiple mechanisms to suppress expression of incomplete proteins, including
the degradation of mRNAs containing premature stop codons (nonsense variants). Such nonsense-mediated
mRNA quality control occurs in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The bacterial process is grounded in
premature termination of transcription by Rho and subsequent RNA degradation, a mechanism reliant on tight
coupling of transcription and translation. The existence and apparent universality of nonsense-mediated quality
control has been taken to suggest that incomplete proteins are highly cytotoxic. However, this proposition has
not been systematically investigated. Furthermore, recent work from the Li lab has revealed that a broad swath
of bacteria – notably B. subtilis and other Firmicutes (Bacillota) – altogether lack nonsense-mediated quality
control and transcription-translation coupling. In other recent work, I developed an approach for massively
parallel measurements of bacterial growth inhibition by complex libraries of protein fragments, derived from
array-synthesized oligonucleotides. This methodological innovation provides the previously missing tool
needed to systematically investigate cytotoxicity of incomplete proteins. In this proposal I bring together these
conceptual and technological breakthroughs, along with computational analyses and other complementary
methods, to address fundamental questions about the physiological impacts of incomplete proteins and the
importance of their suppression. I hypothesize that most incomplete proteoforms are innocuous, but a subset
are cytotoxic, and that B. subtilis protein sequences have evolved to limit truncated variant toxicity. I will also
investigate the contributions of incomplete proteins to bactericidal activity of ribosome-inhibitory antibiotics, and
the evolutionary pathways enabled by a lack of suppression of premature stop codon mutants.
Objective: To address these questions, I will systematically define the cytotoxicity of incomplete proteins by
measuring growth rate effects of incomplete proteins from across the B. subtilis and E. coli proteomes,
determining protein features associated with cytotoxicity, and further investigating physiological effects of
select proteoforms using ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and pull-down mass spectrometry. I will also
determine how incomplete proteins contribute to bactericidal activity of ribosome-inhibiting antibiotics by
combining translatomic and proteomic measurements of drug-induced incomplete protein production with
massively parallel cytotoxicity measurements. In a third approach, I will redefine the functions and evolutionary
roles of pseudogenes in Firmicutes by using a knockout library to demonstrate premature-stop pseudogene
function and employing bioinformatic analyses to determine the prevalence of duplication and truncation as a
path to novel genes. Finally, I will use a high-throughput assay to systematically map the landscape of
potentially beneficial truncation variants."

Language production deficits caused by right hemisphere brain damage (RHD) are an underexplored scientific
domain, despite affecting the vast majority of individuals who suffer a right hemisphere stroke. RHD patients
often exhibit self-centered, inappropriate, and impolite language -- deficits that have a significant impact on their
quality of life from personal relationships to employment status. Despite the devastating impact of these
impairments for RHD patients and their families, very fewstudies have been undertaken to understand the nature
of RHD communication differences, especially in comparison to the more obvious impairments observed after
left hemisphere stroke.
The current project addresses two critical knowledge gaps. First, we need a better understanding of what is
wrong with the language produced by RHD patients, and second, we need to understand which right hemisphere
brain areas are associatedwith which particular types of languagedeficits. These gaps will be addressed through
two aims. The first aim will provide a rigorous and quantitative evaluation of the specific features of language
production that are impaired following RHD, via a battery of linguistic production tasks. The second aim will
involve identification of the brain areas within the right hemisphere that are associated with these deficits.
Furthermore, both the behavioral and neural data will be aggregated in the burgeoning RHDBank database
developed by the PI, fostering future work in this area by the scientific community at large.
As PI, Dr. Minga is an early-stage career investigator with institutional support from Duke University. As a K12
award recipient, she has established a diverse mentoring team with expertise in cognitive neuroscience,
neurology, speech-language pathology, and discourse corpus development. Dr. Minga’s career development
plan serves to capitalize on these collaborations through workshops, seminars, and didactic training. The
proposed research contributes to the growing body of knowledge concerning language production differences in
adults with RHD by examining the specific indices of language production characteristics that distinguish adults
with RHD and potential neuroanatomic correlates while building a corpus of imaging and language use samples
for the widespread study of communication after RHD. Delineation of specific and quantifiable characteristics of
language production after RHD and their relationship to lesion site(s) can foster the development of clinically
relevant diagnostic measures and potential therapies."

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiopulmonary disease that ultimately leads to right
ventricular (RV) failure. Currently there are no approved therapies targeting the RV and most
research is focused on reducing fibrosis, although it is unclear if this will ultimately improve RV
pumping function. However, the orientation of collagen and cardiomyocyte fibers likely have a
major influence on RV function and are largely overlooked in ongoing research and clinical
practice. Furthermore, the role of the left ventricle (LV) in RV function is almost completely
discounted, but previous research from the 90’s has suggested that the LV is more important for
RV function than the contracting RV free wall.
 Our preliminary data shows that LV torsion rate is reduced in children with PH and in
mice after pulmonary arterial banding (PAB), which is correlated with reduced RV ejection
fraction in both species. However, when we induced LV pressure overload in the PAB mice (by
partial aortic constriction), we improved their LV torsion rate and RV systolic function. This was
further validated with in silico studies of the bi-ventricular heart, which showed that targeting LV
torsion rate could improve RV systolic function, but it depends on RV free wall fiber orientation.
Therefore, these results left us with the following questions: (1) What new orientation do the
fibers adopt in response to pressure overload (our preliminary results are not consistent with
others), and does this new orientation improve or worsen RV function? (2) How does RV fiber
re-orientation impact LV-to-RV mechanical assistance during systole? (3) How does the
transient fiber re-orientation and stiffening impact mechanical stress/strain within the tissue, and
how does that impact -or is driven by- gene expression?
 In this study, we will combine the PAB mouse model with in silico simulations to
investigate how changes in RV fiber orientation and stiffening, in the RV free wall, impact RV
pumping function. Then, we will combine PAB with aortic constriction to study how RV
remodeling interferes with LV torsion and if this interrupts LV-to-RV mechanical assistance
during systole. Finally, by collecting a time course dataset of imaging and gene expression, we
will identify genes that are directly impacted by changes in mechanical stress and expose how
they trigger their downstream remodeling pathways.
 The questions being answered in this project will lead to a better understanding of how
RV structural remodeling, in response to pressure overload, impacts RV function and
interventricular coupling, and identify target genes governing this process for future studies."

Environmental pollutants and anti-cancer chemicals induce DNA–protein crosslinks (DPCs,
also known as protein adducts) of topoisomerases and other proteins that obstruct almost every
chromatin transaction and lead to mutations, genome instability and cell death if not removed
quickly. Cells thus possess multiple mechanisms to remove DPCs: homologous recombination,
nucleotide excision repair and proteolytic repair that involves proteolysis of bound proteins and
nucleolytic cleavage of peptide-DNA bonds. Among these, proteolytic DPC repair is poorly
defined and there are many questions about this unique collaboration between protease and
nuclease and their substrate recognition.
Using genetic and biochemical approaches, we have discovered that Apn2, the evolutionarily
conserved back-up AP endonuclease, possesses an enzymatic activity unblocking DNA ends
with various 3’ adducts including 2’,3’-cyclic phosphate, monophosphate and tyrosine DNA
conjugates. We also found that Apn2 removes DNA-topoisomerase I crosslinks, the flagship DPC
at 3' termini. The results might explain several puzzling symptoms in mice deleted for APE2, the
metazoan Apn2 homolog, including dys-lymphopoiesis and growth retardation. The results also
underscore the importance of 3’ blocked termini processing for genome maintenance and reveal
unique challenges in removing these toxic DNA lesions in a tractable model system.
Nevertheless, our results also raise a new set of questions about the regulation of Apn2 and APE2
in 3' adduct repair. For instance, we aim to determine how Apn2 recognizes a wide range of 3’
termini with different structural features and how such activities are regulated under unique
cellular and functional contexts. We also want to elucidate the biological significance of Apn2 and
human APE2-dependent Top1cc repair in cellular physology exposed to chemotherapeutics.
Furthermore, we plan to define the roles of Apn2 and its interacting protease(s) in the removal of
toxic DNA protein complexes (DPCs) that form via environmental pollutants and chemicals. The
current proposal will address these important questions using innovative genetic and biochemical
assays and shed light on the fundamental mechanisms of 3’ DNA adduct repair, mutagenesis and
maintenance of chromosomal integrity.
Emerging evidence suggests that accumulated DPCs cause aging, neurodegeneration and
liver cancers. The human homolog of Apn2 is also essential for the viability of BRCA-deficient
breast and ovarian cancer cells. The functional conservation in Top1cc and DPC repair between
yeast and human further underscores the value of the proposed research in setting the foundation
for analyzing the equivalent processes in human. Information gained from our proposed research
plan will not only solve one of the fundamental questions in biological processes associated with
mutagenesis, DNA repair, and genome maintenance, but will also impinge directly on the
management and treatment of patients suffering from several devastating diseases with no clear
treatment option."

Title: CranioRate™: An image-based, deep-phenotyping analysis toolset, repository, and online
clinician interface for craniosynostosis.
The purpose of this research grant application is to build on the advanced machine learning (ML) tool
developed as part of a pilot study (R21EB026061) that objectively quantiﬁes cranial dysmorphology, or
deep phenotypes, in patients with metopic craniosynostosis (MC). Abnormal cranial suture fusion
(craniosynostosis) occurs in one of every 2500 infants born in the US, resulting in disrupted regional
skull growth and an increased risk of elevated intracranial pressure, neurocognitive impairment and
visual disturbances including blindness. Impaired skull growth along the fused suture and subsequent
growth compensation in other areas of the skull lead to predictable head shape patterns in patients with
craniosynostosis; surgery is recommended early in childhood to restore normal head shape and
prevent neurocognitive sequelae.
In our work to date, our team has developed an ML/statistical shape analysis system utilizing computed
tomography (CT) scans of patients with MC. We have demonstrated that our deep ML algorithm is as
effective as expert clinician ratings in assessing severity and more effective than standard craniometric
tools. We have expanded our processes to include the analysis of 3D photography to increase
accessibility and study post-operative head shape. Thus far, we have demonstrated equivalent severity
ratings between 3D photographs and CT scans when obtained on the same patients. Finally, we have
designed and implemented an online head shape portal (CranioRate™) that automates preprocessing
and analysis such that users can upload their own patient images, where the resulting data contributes
to clinical patient care as well as research endeavors. To date, over 30 clinicians have contributed
almost 400 MC CT scans to our portal, making our metopic craniosynostosis imaging collection the
largest reported.
In the proposed work, we will reﬁne our processing pipeline and shape analysis technologies, while
expanding our capabilities to encompass all forms of craniosynostosis and a wider array of imaging
modalities, and improve the functionality and security of the CranioRate™ portal. To pursue these aims,
we will bring together a robust consortium of collaborators to contribute imaging and clinical data,
empanel a scientiﬁc advisory board to ensure data integrity, and establish an open access human
craniosynostosis image bank to allow further collaborations through FaceBase. Speciﬁc goals for the
current project are to: 1) Further develop a set of robust, general morphological quantiﬁcation
technologies and cloud-based implementations that result in effective scientiﬁc and clinical tools; 2)
Establish a shared-access, well-curated dataset that will leverage our multicenter collaborative network
and partnership with FaceBase; 3) Identify and collect pertinent clinical data to extend the utility of our
shape analysis tool and shared-access database. The results of this study will signiﬁcantly improve the
understanding of the phenotypic variation in patients with craniosynostosis and will pave the way for
more substantial imaging-based research in this understudied population."

The unprecedented speed of COVID-19 vaccine development has demonstrated the value of vaccine platforms.
In particular, mRNA vaccines proved surprisingly successful at eliciting a strong immune response while having
a remarkable safety profile considering the novelty of this system. Just as important are the remarkable speed
and scale of their production. Despite their spectacular success, mRNA vaccines suffer from major limitations.
mRNA is an inherently unstable molecule. One consequence of this property is that mRNA vaccines need to be
stored in freezers and their shelf-life is measured in hours after they have been thawed. These storage
requirements are considered difficult to ensure even in countries with developed healthcare systems and are
extremely problematic in many other parts of the world. The second limitation of mRNA vaccines is that their
production is unlike any other biomanufacturing process. As a result, it is limited by a critical lack of infrastructure
and expertise. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines provided an incentive to imagine the next generation of nucleic
acid vaccines that would be easier to manufacture at scale and distribute to healthcare systems throughout the
world.
This proposal hypothesizes that a DNA-based vaccine could enable the design and deployment of safe and
effective vaccines that would be faster, easier, and cheaper to manufacture at scale. The production of clinical-
grade DNA relies on biomanufacturing processes that are some of the simplest, fastest, and most inexpensive
processes in the industry. However, DNA vaccines have failed to elicit a protective immune response so far
because only a small fraction of the DNA molecules entering a cell are transported to the nucleus where they
can be transcribed.
In this R21, researchers will test the feasibility of developing a new generation of DNA vaccines by applying
methods from synthetic biology to introduce genetic circuits allowing the expression of the antigen to take place
in the cytoplasm. Self-amplifying DNA vaccines will include several genes of viral origins that will transcribe the
antigenic sequences from plasmids located in the cell cytoplasm. In addition, these vectors will include additional
enzymes to modify mRNA molecules to increase their stability and translation efficiency. By introducing several
levels of amplification, the expression of the antigen is expected to be several orders of magnitude higher than
what can be achieved with traditional DNA vaccines. The project will proceed through eight iterations of the
design-build-test-learn cycle to rationally improve vaccine designs using gene expression data in cell culture.
If successful, future studies will test the platform compatibility with a broad range of antigens, optimize the
delivery of DNA-based vaccines, and analyze the safety and efficacy of candidate vaccines in animal studies."
10829338,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a movement disorder characterized by deficits in strength and coordination. The
subsequent gait deficits associated with CP lead to a progressive decline in function due to the secondary effects
of having a movement disorder during development. Interventions seeking to mitigate these effects have only
been partially successful because they have not addressed both muscle recruitment (i.e. strength) and
coordination within one, top-down therapy. Recently, we developed a wearable adaptive resistance therapy that
is able to address both of these aspects with promising results for improving neuromuscular control, metabolic
efficiency, and functional mobility. To maximize the efficacy of this intervention, two important considerations
must be addressed: 1) What is the appropriate level of resistance to prescribe for maximizing neuromuscular
response as children acclimate to the intervention? 2) What is the overall trajectory in training effects from this
therapy and are these effects maintained after the therapy stops? In addition, there is limited understanding of
the underlying mechanisms of observed improvements in neuromuscular control with this novel therapy. The
high levels of co-contraction in children with CP have been attributed to deficits in stretch reflex modulation, but
whether or not improvements in reflex modulation are responsible for the observed decreases in ankle co-
contraction with wearable adaptive resistance has not yet been explored.
The main objective of this research proposal is to further investigate a wearable adaptive resistance intervention
for children with CP. The first specific aim is to assess the acclimation to adaptive resistance by measuring the
neuromuscular response of children with CP, across five visits, as a low, moderate, and high level of resistance
is applied while walking. The second specific aim to quantify the time-course and maintenance of training effects
for the ten participants by measuring changes in neuromuscular control (i.e., co-contraction about the ankle and
the complexity of neural control) and reflex modulation (via H-reflex testing) across five training visits with
wearable adaptive resistance, as well as a two-week post-training follow-up visit. Our primary outcome variable
for Aim 1 ix plantar flexor activation magnitude, relative to baseline, while walking with resistance. Our primary
outcome variables for Aim 2 are ankle co-contraction level, neural control complexity (as determined by a muscle
synergy analysis), and reflex modulation (via H-reflex testing) while walking without resistance.
The completion of this work will improve our understanding of wearable adaptive resistance, including
fundamental knowledge about appropriate training levels and underlying mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of
developing an intervention that can enable physical activity for children with CP, allowing them to engage with
their peers and environment for healthy development and functional independence."

 Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the
world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime
cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only
histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which
is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet
need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF.
Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic
magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure
LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project,
we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a
DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity
distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep
features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by
data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of
liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble”
DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional
multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and
validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI
radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately
detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more
importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter-
radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate
the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques
we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has
revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and
researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments
in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare
costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related
clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver
transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others."

Appalachian women are at high risk for lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death
for women in the US, including the Appalachian region. Although lung cancer rates have declined steadily among
men since the 1990s, such decreases have not been seen among women, including alarming mortality rates in
Central Appalachia. Interventions to reduce lung cancer risk among Appalachian women need to consider social
and environmental contexts. Research: This project, titled Reducing Lung Cancer Risk among Appalachian
Women Using Community-Engaged Intervention Research, relies on community perspectives to guide the
selection, adaptation, and pilot testing of a culturally-targeted intervention to reduce lung cancer risk among
Appalachian women. We will employ the NIH model for creating behavioral intervention trials to inform the
refinement of an intervention through direct community input (Phase 1a; Aim 1; K99) and to pilot test the selected
and adapted intervention protocol using a 2-armed randomized controlled trial (Phase 1b; Aim 2; R00). In the
pilot with Central Appalachian KY women, we will demonstrate the feasibility of the adapted intervention protocol,
including demand, acceptability, and implementation. The selected intervention will seek to increase knowledge,
self-efficacy, and targeted behaviors among Appalachian women thereby reducing their future lung cancer risk
and, ultimately, lung cancer disparities among women in the Appalachian region. Candidate: Dr. Jessica
Thompson is a postdoctoral scholar in an NCI-designated cancer center at the University of Kentucky (UK) with
extensive previous training in community-engaged mixed methods research and chronic disease prevention
among Appalachian women. Three training goals will enhance her trajectory toward becoming an independent
investigator, including developing expertise in: 1) the use of participatory systems science and community-
engaged approaches to select and adapt an intervention; 2) lung cancer prevention and risk reduction
interventions; and 3) intervention development and implementation science. Mentors/Environment: Dr.
Thompson’s career development plan includes substantial mentorship, didactic training, and experiential
learning at the UK Markey Cancer Center (MCC) with additional support from the UK Center for Health Equity
Transformation (CHET) and the UK Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS). She will receive direct
mentorship from MCC Community Impact Office director Dr. Pamela Hull (Primary Mentor) and CHET director
Dr. Nancy Schoenberg (Co-Primary Mentor) with additional mentorship from Dr. Ellen Hahn (Mentor) in lung
cancer prevention and risk reduction, Dr. Teresa Waters (Mentor) in assessments of intervention effectiveness
and health economics, and Dr. Jessica Burke (Mentor; University of Pittsburgh) in systems science and
participatory methods. Overall, the objectives of this K99/R00 application will advance lung cancer intervention
research for Appalachian women by providing evidence for a future R01 submission and support Dr. Thompson’s
training as an independent scientist in implementing interventions to improve the health of Appalachian women."
10753575,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Obesity increases the risk of developing asthma in children and adults, and obesity-associated asthma (OAA) is
often more severe and more difficult to treat than atopic asthma. These poor clinical outcomes may stem from
OAA’s distinct immunopathology that includes differences in how lung immune cells respond to inflammatory
stimuli and a heterogeneous but neutrophil-predominant lung inflammation. Our limited understanding of how
obesity alters lung innate immune cell responses to inflammatory stimuli hinders the development of novel
preventative and therapeutic approaches for OAA. Obesity causes lipid deposition in the lung and lipid
accumulation in lung tissue resident macrophages (TRMs). These processes may contribute to OAA
immunopathology as TRMs are both intimately involved in asthma pathogenesis and sensitive to
immunometabolic reprogramming during obesity. Despite this, we do not know if lung TRMs adopt distinct
immunometabolic and functional programs as a result of obesity, or if obesity-associated lung TRMs contribute
to OAA. To begin to address this knowledge gap, we have performed preliminary studies of lung TRMs in lean
and obese mice. We observe lipid-laden TRMs that express proteins characteristic of immunometabolic
reprogramming and inflammatory activation in the lungs of obese mice. Using minimally biased lipidomics and
in vitro culture techniques, we have identified the fatty acid stearate as a key metabolic signal that may influence
lung TRM inflammatory functions during obesity. Finally, we find that obesity and stearate cause activation of
the TRM inflammasome—an outcome that is observed in non-lung TRMs during obesity and may contribute to
OAA immunopathology. Based on these data, I hypothesize that stearate activates an immunometabolic
functional program in lung TRMs that causes exaggerated inflammasome-mediated inflammation in response to
innate stimuli. The objectives of this grant are to: (1) identify the lipid signals, cellular metabolic pathways, and
inflammatory consequences of obesity-associated lung TRM immunometabolic reprogramming in mice and
humans and (2) test the contribution of the TRM inflammasome to OAA-like innate lung inflammation. To attain
these objectives, we have developed or obtained novel mouse model systems and established unique
collaborations that will allow us to mechanistically interrogate obesity-associated immunometabolic
reprogramming of lung TRMs in mice, and translate our observations to pediatric and adult subjects. Doing so
will identify molecules and pathways that can be targeted by future OAA-specific therapeutics, and inform studies
of other obesity-associated inflammatory lung diseases."
10770459,"Changes in metabolism in the aging eye can affect its epigenome because several metabolic intermediates also
act as donor molecules for deposition of epigenetic marks such as histone and DNA methylation. During aging,
there are changes in the metabolic pathways that produce the donor molecule required for histone and DNA
methylation, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), from the amino acid methionine. Methionine metabolism is strongly
linked to aging across multiple species because restricting methionine intake extends lifespan, and is thought to
be responsible for the lifespan extension caused by caloric restriction. In the aging Drosophila eye, we observe
changes in methionine metabolism including an increase in levels of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), which
inhibits the activity of methyltransferases. This age-associated increase in SAH correlates with decreased levels
of histone methylation marks across the entire genome in photoreceptors. Moreover, we show that loss of the
methyltransferases that deposit one of these marks in photoreceptors leads to premature retinal degeneration.
We propose that the decreased histone methylation in aging photoreceptors contributes to the age-related
changes that we observe in gene expression. Specifically, we have identified changes in rhythmic expression of
more than a third of active genes in aging photoreceptors together with altered transcription factor binding activity
of the circadian master regulators Clock and Cycle. The circadian clock is highly conserved from flies to humans,
and maintains biological rhythms by controlling gene expression programs through a series of transcription-
translation feedback loops. When we disrupt the circadian clock in photoreceptors, we observe substantial retinal
degeneration accompanied by global changes in chromatin accessibility and misregulation of more than a
quarter of active genes. Loss of circadian regulators in the mouse eye causes age-dependent retinal
degeneration, suggesting that the circadian clock has a conserved role in protecting the aging eye. Based on
our preliminary data, we hypothesize that increasing oxidative stress in the aging eye inhibits activity of the sole
enzyme that breaks down SAH on chromatin at actively expressed genes. We further propose that the local
increases in SAH levels at expressed genes inhibit the activity of histone methyltransferases, leading to changes
in the rhythmic expression of genes in the aging eye. Together, these studies provide a framework in which to
understand how the normal changes that occur in the aging eye can disrupt its metabolism, leading to changes
in the epigenome that disrupt normal patterns of gene expression and increase the risk of ocular disease.
Drosophila provides an ideal model for these studies because it shares a similar circadian clock and epigenetic
mechanisms with humans, but ages much more rapidly allowing us to examine mechanisms in the context of
normal aging in specific cell types in the eye."

PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.
 RNA enzymes (ribozymes) are fundamental in biology, and have important applications in chemistry, biotech-
nology and medicine. The scientiﬁc community is still in early stages of discovery, and the full breadth of poten-
tially transformative RNA and related nucleic acid based technology and therapeutics have yet to be realized. A
critical barrier to progress toward this realization is the lack of a predictive understanding of ribozyme mechanisms
that can be used to guide design. This proposal addresses this critical barrier by the creation of new enabling
technology to study RNA enzymes (Aim 1) that will be applied to small self-cleaving (nucleolytic) ribozymes (Aim
2), and artiﬁcially engineered self-alkylating and methyltransferase ribozymes and a naturally occurring group I
intron ribozyme (Aim 3). Predictive insight gained from these studies will unveil general principles crucial for our
understanding of RNA catalysis and the rational design of new ribozyme-based biomedical technology.
 Aim 1 will create advanced tools for computational RNA enzymology, including 1) new fast/accurate quan-
tum+machine learning force ﬁelds for RNA catalysis, 2) integrated software for inclusion of nuclear quantum
effects, and 3) robust methods for determination of reaction paths and free energy surfaces (including corrections
to expensive high-level ab initio surfaces). These methods are signiﬁcant as enabling technology to study mech-
anisms of RNA catalysis. The goal of this aim is develop innovative technology designed to meet the needs of the
driving ribozyme applications in Aims 2 and 3, as well as many applications outside the scope of the proposal.
 Aim 2 will apply our computational enzymology tools to study the catalytic mechanisms of small nucleolytic
ribozymes (Psr, HHr and HDVr) and a related artiﬁcially engineered DNAzyme (8-17dz). These systems are
important as tools for chemical and molecular biology, and as tractable models for RNA/DNA catalysis. The
goal of this aim is to apply and further develop general principles for RNA-cleaving nucleic acid enzyme design,
building on our L-platform/L-scaffold framework for naturally occurring “G+A” and “G+M” ribozyme classes.
 Aim 3 will explore mechanisms of artiﬁcially engineered self-alkylating ribozyme (SAR) and methyl transferase
ribozyme (MTR1), and the naturally occurring Tetrahymena group I intron (THr) ribozyme. These systems have
far-reaching implications for biotechnology and medicine. The goal of this aim is to examine the extent to which
design principles can be extended and transferred to these systems to provide deeper insight into the diverse
array of catalytic strategies available to nucleic acid enzymes.
 Working together, these aims will accomplish the overarching goal to achieve a predictive understanding of
ribozyme mechanisms that can be used to guide the design of new technology and therapeutics."

Electrical synapses, mediated by neuronal gap junctions (GJs), are widespread throughout the auditory pathway.
However, the functional roles and properties of electrical synapses in the auditory system remain poorly
understood. Our proposal aims to contribute to a better understanding of the properties of electrical synaptic
transmission in the auditory system by investigating the molecular mechanisms responsible for plastic changes
of electrical transmission at ‘mixed’, electrical and chemical, synaptic contacts that couple primary auditory
afferents to the Mauthner (M-) cells in fish. Facilitated by their unique experimental accessibility, our previous
investigations revealed that electrical (and chemical) transmission at these mixed synapses undergo activity-
dependent synaptic potentiation. There is a prevailing perception that modifications of electrical transmission
only result from direct modification of the properties of already existing GJ channels. This interpretation results
from the narrow belief that electrical synapses represent simple clusters of intercellular channels. However,
rather than fixed, GJs are quite dynamic structures at which channels turn over to maintain their strength at rates
comparable to those of glutamate receptors in chemical synapses. Accordingly, our progress indicates that
regulated insertion and removal of GJ channels governed by a molecular scaffold critically contributes to regulate
electrical synapses. We found that the function of ZO-1, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein, is required for the
presence of connexins (the channel-forming proteins). This finding represents a paradigm shift in the
understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying electrical transmission by demonstrating the hierarchy
of associated intracellular scaffolding proteins over channel-forming proteins. Furthermore, while electrical
transmission is generally thought to occur from single canonical oval-shaped GJ plaques, our preliminary results
show that an electrical synapse operates with multiple GJs requiring the functional association with additional
structures, such as nearby adherens junctions. By taking advantage of the experimental accessibility provided
by these auditory mixed synapses and the zebrafish (ZF) model, we propose to expand the molecular,
organizational, and functional framework of the electrical synapse, to encompass the complexity required to
support plastic changes of function. Our approach provides a powerful window for the analysis of electrical
transmission at which detailed molecular mechanisms will be investigated by combining in-vivo imaging of
transgenic fish at which GJ proteins are tagged with fluorescent proteins, electrophysiology and detailed
anatomical analysis using expansion microscopy with powerful genetic manipulations. Aim 1, is to determine the
role of ZO-1 in mediating plasticity of electrical transmission. Aim 2, is to investigate the functional contribution
of additional scaffold components to plastic changes of electrical transmission. Aim 3, is to expose the
components and anatomical organization of an electrical synapse. In particular, the aim will explore the
anatomical and functional relationship between GJs and adherens junctions, which evidence suggests promotes
the insertion of new GJ channels, therefore suggesting a potential role in synaptic transmission and its plasticity.
The description of novel molecular mechanisms involved in their regulation will contribute to a better
understanding of the dynamics of circuits relevant to auditory dysfunction and the potential identification of novel
therapeutic targets."

The prognosis for patients with advanced stage and recurrent ovarian cancer has remained dismal for
decades. The poor response rates result in part from resistance to chemotherapy, particularly platinum- and
taxane-based agents. Ovarian cancer often metastasizes via transcoelomic routes along currents of ascitic
fluid in the peritoneal cavity. We have engineered a 3D adherent perfusion model to mimic ovarian nodules
that stud peritoneal surfaces and recapitulate resistant disease, thereby providing a unique platform to develop
targeted therapies. Our studies showed that physiologically relevant fluid shear stress (FSS) induces a pro-
metastatic phenotype and confers resistance to platinum agents. Photoimmunotherapy (PIT) has shown
promise in selectively imaging and treating disseminated tumors, and it can resensitize chemoresistant cancer
cells to platinum agents. However, the high thresholds of intracellular photoimmunoconjugate required for cell
death have hindered the effectiveness of PIT in physiologically relevant models. Therefore, the main goal of
this proposal is to develop a multi-purpose nanoplatform that breaks the selectivity-uptake trade-off of
photoimmunoconjugates and enables multi-tier cancer targeting under peritoneal FSS. We have recently
shown that successful conjugation of photoimmunoconjugates onto nanoparticles can effectively enhance
intratumoral photoimmunoconjugate delivery and improve PIT outcomes in mice. We hypothesize that
nanoscale engineering enables high-payload co-delivery of photoimmunoconjugate and chemotherapy in a
manner that is safe and efficacious in overcoming FSS-induced chemoresistance. This approach will
significantly enhance the therapeutic index of platinum agents for ovarian cancer patients. In Aim 1, a panel of
photoimmunoconjugate-nanoconstructs (PICNC) will be developed to target biomarkers altered by FSS in a 3D
perfusion model of ovarian cancer. In Aim 2, we will assess the effects on chemosensitization, T cell sparing,
and destruction of immune supporting tumor-associated macrophages following PICNC-PIT under FSS in 3D
perfusion models. In Aim 3, to improve the safety and consistency of the treatment, we will develop image-
guided strategies to inform the timing and dosing of PICNC-PIT in mouse models. In Aim 4, the anti-tumor
efficacy of PICNC-PIT will be evaluated in cell line-based syngeneic (immunocompetent) and xenograft mouse
models, as well as PDX models, for ovarian cancer. The PIs envision a simple and feasible modification to the
standard treatment framework, where PICNC will be delivered intraperitoneally after surgical debulking, and
activated by light, triggering PIT and releasing chemotherapy. The knowledge gained could play a
transformative role in the development of improved therapeutic regimens tailored to the molecular profile of
disseminated tumors in individual patients. To accomplish these aims, we will deploy our multi-disciplinary
team of nanoparticle engineering, 3D tumor perfusion model, cancer biology, tumor immunology, biostatistics,
and gynecologic oncology experts to examine the impact of our technology on ovarian cancer treatment."
10979354,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Latinxs are aging faster than other racial/ethnic group in the US. By 2050, they are projected to
be the largest share of the immigrant, older population. As Latinx immigrants age, they
experience the fastest decline in health and emerging health disparities, despite having an initial
health advantage. Limited access to health insurance and delayed healthcare utilization is a
major determinant of health disparities in older age among Latinx immigrants. Research on how
health insurance and access shape health disparities among aging Latinxs is limited by (1)
confounding between insurance and immigration and socioeconomic characteristics that shape
health and (2) simultaneous changes in insurance access and lifecourse aging as Latinxs enter
older adulthood. To address these challenges, the objective of the proposed study is to leverage
a policy intervention in Illinois to study changes in health insurance and healthcare utilization
among Latinx older-adults using quasi-experimental methods. In 2020 and 2022, Illinois
launched the Health Benefits for Immigrant Seniors (HBIA) and Health Benefits for Immigrant
Adults (HBIA) programs which were the first state policies that extended coverage equivalent to
full-scope Medicaid to low-income undocumented immigrants and noncitizens ages 42 and
older. The proposed study will be the first empirical examination of the HBIA and HBIS programs
to study health insurance and healthcare changes among Latinx older adults that have
implications for health and aging. Our study aims are: (1) To study changes in (a) emergency
department (ED) utilization and hospitalizations among Latinx older adults and (b)
uncompensated hospital care, following implementation of HBIA/HBIS.; (2) To study how
patient-level social determinants of health (SDOH) shape changes in ED utilization and
hospitalizations following the implementation of HBIA/HBIS. We will use Illinois hospital
CompData, Medicare Costs data, and zip-code linked American Community Survey to examine
changes in outcomes from 2018-2023 using interrupted time series and difference-in-difference
analysis. This proposed research leverages a novel policy in a major immigrant state to
examine how health insurance shapes healthcare among foreign-born Latinx older adults. The
findings would contribute to scholarship on the drivers of health disparities among the growing
aging immigrant population, and policy policies to expand health insurance to undocumented
and noncitizens excluded from healthcare. Collectively these finds would illuminate processes
and policies that shape the health of immigrant Latinxs, a significant segment of the nation’s
growing older adult population."

Previous work funded by this R35 grant led to the discovery that oncogenic viruses stimulate the production of
a set of lipids that were not previously known to exist: phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol-
3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate. This led to the discovery of the family of
enzymes that generate these lipids, the phosphoinositide 3-kinases (encoded by the PIK3C family of genes).
Subsequently, the PTEN tumor suppressor gene was shown to dephosphorylate the 3 position of these lipids.
It is now clear that activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene and loss of function mutations in the PTEN gene
are among the most common events driving the growth of cancers. Research funded by this grant revealed
that the lipid products of PI3K directly activate a subset of protein Ser/Thr kinases, most notably the AKT
family, and thereby initiate a set of protein kinase cascades, including activation of the mTOR protein kinase
that coordinates a set of anabolic networks necessary for cell growth. Importantly, this research ultimately
revealed that PI3Kalpha mediates the ability of insulin and IGF1, as well as other growth factors and oncogenic
mutations, to stimulate glucose uptake into tissues.
 In order to identify the downstream protein substrates of AKT, mTOR and the host of other protein-Ser/Thr
kinases and protein-Tyr kinases that regulate cell metabolism and cell growth, the funds from this grant were
used to generate a set of oriented synthetic peptide mixtures, 10 residues in length, in which specific amino
acids were locked-in at a specific position and all other positions had a mixture of all 20 amino acids. This
allowed, for each human protein Ser/Thr or Tyr kinase, the identification of the optimal amino acid at each
position, up to 5 residues N-terminal and up to 4 residues C-terminal of the Ser/Thr or Tyr that is
phosphorylated. A manuscript describing the substrate specificity of all the Ser/Thr kinases was published in
Nature this year and a paper describing the substrate specificity of all human Tyr kinases got a favorable
review at Nature and is in revision.
 During the next granting period we will utilize the software described in the two Nature papers to determine
what protein kinases are responsible for directly phosphorylating the hundreds of Ser, Thr and Tyr residues
observed on enzymes that mediate anabolic metabolism. By comparing mass spec phosphoproteomics in
cancers to normal tissues this approach will reveal the protein kinase cascades that drive anabolic metabolism
in cancers and reveal new targets for pharmaceutical intervention to prevent survival of tumor cells."
10829340,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT:
 Nanoparticles (NPs) hold great promise for delivering more effective and safer cancer treatment than the
small molecule drugs that are commonly used. This is based on studies reporting that these agents can
potentially achieve greater exposure in solid tumors. However, these promises are largely hampered by a low
and inefficient tumor uptake in which only 5-10% of NPs in the plasma are actually distributed from plasma to
solid tumors. Certain tumors, such as pancreatic cancer (PaCa), have even greater inherent barriers to the
tumor delivery of NPs. Thus, there is a strong need to discover methods that can significantly and safely enhance
the overall delivery of NPs to tumors. Our overall hypothesis is that induction minibeam radiation therapy (MRT),
a novel radiation treatment, is such a method. Whereas, conventional broad beam radiation (BRT) only
moderately enhances drug delivery to tumors (0.2- to 2-fold). MRT is an experimental radiation therapy with
unique spatial and dosimetric characteristics that are drastically different from conventional BRT. Solid
preclinical studies have demonstrated that MRT is capable of an ultra-high therapeutic ratio. We recently
discovered that MRT, in contrast to BRT, modifies tumor vasculature and increases tumor perfusion. We
hypothesize that we can take advantage of the changes in tumor perfusion induced by MRT to significantly and
safely enhance NP delivery to tumors compared to NPs alone or after BRT. This hypothesis is supported by our
extensive results in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of breast cancer where induction MRT prior
to administration of PEGylated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil®; PLD) enhanced the delivery of PLD to tumors by
an unprecedented magnitude of 6- to 10-fold and the enhancement was sustained safely with weekly treatments.
In addition, MRT produced a 4-fold greater increase in the tumor delivery of PLD to GEMMs of breast cancer,
which was associated with higher levels of overall and PD-L1 expressing macrophages compared to BRT. Our
2nd pilot study in PaCa GEMMs showed that MRT was able to increase the tumor exposure of PEG-liposomal
irinotecan (Onivyde®, FDA approved for PaCa treatment) and its active metabolite SN38 by >4-fold compared to
Onivyde alone. This grant will allow us to translate our ground breaking MRT results to PaCa where the barriers
to NP delivery are extensive, surgical resection is the only curative option but only 15% of patients have
resectable disease and the MRT + NP regimen would be ideal for pre-surgical neoadjuvant treatment of PaCa.
 This work will be performed by a multidisciplinary research team using novel models, technologies and FDA
approved drugs that can be readily translated to clinical trials in 3 aims over 5 yrs: AIM 1. Evaluate induction
MRT-enhanced delivery of NP anticancer drugs in GEMMs of PaCa; AIM 2. Investigate mechanistic effects of
induction MRT-enhanced tumor delivery of NPs in GEMMs of PaCa; AIM 3. Evaluate induction MRT-enhanced
efficacy of NP anticancer drugs in GEMMs of PaCa. This proposal aims to overcome the inherent major barriers
in NP delivery to tumors, especially in PaCa, which has significant barriers to drug tumor delivery."

Striated muscle myosin is highly organized into thick filaments that bear the molecular forces generated by the
myosin heads. While thick filament structure and stability are essential for contractility, the mechanisms that
allow fully developed muscles to replace myosin molecules while maintaining contractile fidelity are unclear.
Critical questions include; what are the temporal dynamics of myosin synthesis and degradation (i.e. turnover)
and how are molecules selected for degradation? Do striated myosin molecules exist in a dynamic equilibrium
with thick filaments to allow for their exchange out of and into thick filaments? If thick filament structure is
dynamic, what are the molecular mechanisms governing this equilibrium? Most importantly, is this mechanism
tunable to modify striated muscle structure and/or function? We will address these questions in an adult mouse
model in three aims. Our overall hypothesis is that myosin turnover is a stochastic process which involves the
exchange of individual myosin molecules between a cytosolic pool of monomers and thick filaments, by a
mechanism governed by the folding of the monomers within the cytosol. Aim 1 will define the turnover rate of
cardiac myosin in our model and determine whether myosin degradation occurs via a stochastic (i.e. random)
mechanism by using a combination of isotope labeling strategies and mass spectrometry. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that the organization of striated muscle myosin is highly dynamic to allow for the rapid exchange of
individual molecules between thick filaments and a cytosolic pool of monomers by virally labeling myosin with a
fluorescent tag in vivo and examining the mobility of the myosin within hearts using multiphoton fluorescence
recovery after photobleaching. Aim 3 will test the hypotheses that the structural conformation (i.e. folded vs.
extended) of individual myosin molecules in the cytosol regulates the exchange of myosin molecules between
pools. Aim 3 will take advantage of a drug that folds myosin and reduces cardiac mass. We will test our overall
hypothesis that tuning myosin folding, affects the effective concentration of myosin with the cytosol, and
regulates its availability for degradation. The proposed studies will be the first to examine myosin turnover and
macromolecular exchange in a striated muscle system in any intact animal model. The results will provide
conceptual innovation that fully developed muscle is designed in such a way to allow for structural
rearrangement of myosin on a minute-to-minute timescale. The mechanistic findings have the potential to add
to the current paradigm regarding thick filament structure and explain how striated muscle is maintained from
the single molecule to whole organ level. The new knowledge gained may allow us to take advantage of this
mechanism for tuning striated muscle structure and/or function in whole animals."
10810836,"ABSTRACT - Heart failure is a multifactorial disease, characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, myocyte death,
fibrosis, and contractile dysfunction. Cyclic nucleotide second messengers, cAMP and cGMP, regulate
numerous physiological functions and pathological processes in the heart, ranging from short-term muscle
contraction/relaxation to long-term structural remodeling. Dysregulated cAMP/cGMP homeostasis has been
implicated in various diseases. cAMP/cGMP are NOT freely diffusible. They exist as multiple spatially discrete
and functionally distinct cyclic nucleotide “pools”, which is believed to associate with different multi-protein
complexes each containing unique cyclases, phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and other signaling molecules. PDEs,
by catalyzing the degradation reaction, are essential for maintaining homeostasis, compartmentalization, and
specificity of cyclic nucleotide-mediated signaling and functions. Increasing evidence has indicated that
alterations in the expression/activation of different PDEs represent causative mechanisms for a number of
diseases. PDE10A gene encoded isozymes are able to hydrolyze both cAMP and cGMP in cell-free systems.
Under the physiological condition, PDE10A expression is enriched in the striatum of the brain. Most studies to
date have focused on neurological diseases, leading to advancing PDE10A inhibitors to clinical trials for
schizophrenia. However, the roles of PDE10A in the peripheral systems are still poorly understood. Recently,
we have first reported the induction of PDE10A expression in human and mouse failing hearts. Using genetic
and pharmacological approaches, we have demonstrated that PDE10A plays a critical role in pressure overload-
induced heart failure in mice. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unclear with respect to
the protective effects of PDE10A deficiency/inhibition in the heart. The identity and source of the cyclic nucleotide
regulated by PDE10A in CMs remain uncharacterized. Our preliminary data support a hypothesis that PDE10A
inhibition uniquely promotes A2AR-D2R heterodimerization and biased activation of D2R/barr2 signaling through
potentiating A2AR/cAMP/PKA-mediated phosphorylation of D2R. D2R/baar2 signaling leads to B56d-PP2A
activation, HDAC5 nuclear import, and ultimate attenuation of CM hypertrophy and death. To test our hypothesis,
we propose two aims: (1) determine the functionsand underlying mechanism of PDE10A in CMs using in vitro
cellular models; (2) determine the role of CM-specific PDE10A and A2AR-D2R signaling in cardiac ischemic injury
and remodeling in vivo. Our findings will provide the novel insights into the unique sources of cyclic nucleotides,
GPCRs, and signaling pathways that are specifically regulated by PDE10A in CMs; as well as advance our
understanding the novel roles of D2R signaling in cardiac tissues. Defining the specific cyclic nucleotide signaling
modulated by PDE10A may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic strategies through targeting PDE10A
in combination with other cyclic nucleotide modulators to achieve additive or synergistic effects with less
deleterious side effects."

There is little doubt that we are in the midst of a worldwide epidemic of obesity, diabetes and fatty liver disease,
and disruptions in energy balance are at the heart of these disorders. The first option for energy storage and
utilization in metabolically active tissues such as liver, fat and muscle is glycogen. We propose that the
regulation of glycogen metabolism is comprised of complex feedback and feedforward pathways, and as such,
glycogen itself plays a major role in the overall control of energy disposition in liver and adipose tissue.
Glycogen represents the first choice for energy storage and utilization in both tissues, but also serves as a
modulator of metabolism in physiological and pathological states, directing the cell to utilize or store energy. In
hepatocytes, glycogen triggers lipogenesis via changes in the AMPK pathway; while in adipocytes glycogen
turnover is crucial for thermogenic responses in response to cold. We will explore these hypotheses with two
aims that focus on these crucial pathways in liver and fat cells, hoping to develop new approaches to therapies
for these devastating diseases."
10757729,"SUMMARY
Arterial stiffness is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. A change in arterial
stiffness is a significant pathology in vascular injury, atherosclerosis, and coronary disease. Stiffening
of the vessel wall promotes anomalous migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells
(VSMCs), leading to neointima formation on the vessel wall. It is not clear, however, how the
extracellular matrix (ECM) influences these pathological processes. This research proposal will address
this by exploring how changes in arterial stiffness elicit VSMC behaviors that contribute to cardiovascular
disease. Specifically, this work draws upon preliminary data revealing that the protein survivin is a key
regulator of stiffness-mediated VSMC proliferation and migration and an effector of arterial stiffening
and remodeling. Using mouse and human VSMCs, we will first explore how vascular ECM stiffness
impacts VSMC migration, proliferation, and chromatin organization at the single-cell level (early stage
of disease progression; Aim 1) and, second, determine how pathological ECM stiffness drives neointima
formation, altering the local mechanical environment of VSMCs in vitro (advanced stage of disease
progression; Aim 2). Lastly, we will confirm survivin’s role in regulating both ECM production and arterial
stiffness (in vivo animal model; Aim 2). These aims will be achieved using 3D cell culture with a novel
in vitro porcine decellularized aorta ECM-based fibrous scaffold system and mouse injury models. Briefly,
VSMCs isolated from mouse and human aortas will be cultured on nanofibrous scaffolds of different
stiffnesses and structures that mimic normal and pathological conditions in the body. The VSMC
responses to pathological ECM stiffness will be analyzed using advanced microscopy to observe
changes in cellular/nuclear structure and biomechanical properties in vitro, and the RNA and protein
expression will be assessed at the single-cell level. Finally, arterial stiffness and VSMC function will be
studied in intact arteries of injured mice; histology and biochemical analyses of dissected tissues will be
conducted after arterial stiffness has been manipulated by arterial injury, drug treatment, or genetic
mutations. This project will, for the first time, study the molecular and biophysical mechanisms by which
survivin (i) mediates stiffness-sensitive VSMC functions and (ii) contributes to neointima formation and
stiffening, revealing a completely new aspect of survivin biology in VSMCs and in the pathology of
arterial stiffness. Overall, this proposal is unique in its ability to identify potential new therapeutic targets
for the treatment of CVDs."
10835905,"Project Summary/Abstract
Today's high school students are required to understand and synthesize information from increasingly
complex, diverse texts. These advanced reading comprehension demands are reflected in current educational
standards, such as the Common Core State Standards, and in the English Language Arts curricula adopted by
high schools. Students are expected to `integrate and interpret' and to `reflect and evaluate' information across
text types, content areas, and presentation media. The problem is that we do not have empirically validated
theoretical models that reflect the text and task complexities encountered by high school students. Further,
extant models do not provide an explanatory framework for the advantage for monolingual over bilingual or
female over male students. This lack of evidenced-based models of the structure of reading comprehension
constitutes a critical gap in reading science that limits our ability to address the well-documented reading
deficits of high school students in the U.S. A second critical gap is the lack of comprehensive predictor
models that go beyond the simple view of reading (SVR) and consider additional cognitive influences on
reading comprehension, such as executive function, as well as psychological and ecological factors, such as
motivation and the school environment, which may become more influential as they consolidate or change
during adolescence. A third critical gap is the lack of longitudinal studies from middle to high school that can
identify unique factors operating over time that may protect adolescents from, or place them at higher risk of,
poor reading comprehension. These may differ in their strength of influence from those affecting reading
comprehension in elementary school students. Our project - Modelling Longitudinal Reading
Comprehension in Adolescence: Protective and Risk Factors - brings together multidisciplinary
researchers to address these knowledge gaps and advance understanding of reading comprehension in high-
school students. Our principal goals are to determine the structure of reading comprehension in 11th grade,
clarify key predictors of reading comprehension within and across adolescence, and to identify protective and
risk factors for good and poor reading comprehension. We build on our research conducted as the Language
and Reading Research Consortium (LARRC) and the Monolingual and Bilingual Reading Comprehension
(MBRC) project. This is a unique opportunity to continue our LARRC longitudinal study of students who
entered preschool as monolingual English speakers or as Spanish-English bilingual speakers. These two
longitudinal groups are now in 9th grade. Additional longitudinal participants from MBRC (monolingual,
bilingual) assessed in 6th grade will continue in 9th and 11th grades. We will assess these four longitudinal
samples in 11th grade, and a new cross-sectional sample of 11th graders."

This K23 proposal details a 5-year training program that will help launch my career as an independent clinical investigator
who develops, tests, adapts, and implements resiliency interventions for families managing stressful reproductive life events.
I propose an innovative and clinically meaningful research and training plan consistent with my career development goals.
Background: With 400,000 U.S. newborns admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICU) annually, up to 50% of their
parents experience emotional distress (depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress) during and after hospitalization. Emotional
distress can negatively impact couple and family adjustment, and in turn, child health and development. Building resiliency
in parents early during the NICU journey is key to improve family and child outcomes. Specific aims and research design:
My goal is to develop, refine, and test the feasibility and acceptability of an innovative, resiliency intervention (“Resilient
Families;” R-FAM) for parental dyads (couples) with babies in the NICU. To achieve this goal, my aims are three-fold: (1)
develop R-FAM using stakeholder input from interviews with parent dyads (N=20) and focus groups with NICU staff (N=4);
(2) optimize R-FAM through an open pilot (N=5 dyads) with pre/post assessments and exit interviews; and (3) test R-FAM
for feasibility and acceptability (N=50 dyads) through a pilot randomized clinical trial of R-FAM compared with a minimally
enhanced usual control (MEUC). Findings will inform a subsequent R01 hybrid efficacy-effectiveness trial (R-FAM versus
MEUC) and future R01 mechanistic, adaptation, and implementation trials. Training and mentoring: My research aims
are supported by three training goals: (1) qualitative methods, including longitudinal, dyadic interviews and focus groups;
(2) intervention design and optimization using mixed methods; and (3) conduct dyadic randomized clinical trials. My
research and training goals are supported by: (1) expert mentors (Vranceanu & Lerou) and advisors (Patterson, Kaimal, &
Parker); (2) a rich and supportive institutional environment; and (3) targeted coursework, scientific meetings, trainings, and
planned publications. Relevance to NICHD. This K23 directly aligns with NICHD’s funding priorities to improve treatment
and wellness of women and families who experience high-risk pregnancy-related morbidities (Strategic Plan 3). Impact:
This K23 award will provide me with the research experience, collaborations, mentorship, and training I need to become an
independent and successful clinical investigator in perinatal-neonatal health. I hope to develop, adapt, test, and implement
resiliency interventions that aim to improve emotional distress and relationships in families during the perinatal-neonatal
period. If successful, this work can help inform future adaptations of R-FAM (R01s) that meet the unique needs of different
families, such as single parents, parents coping with loss, non-romantic dyads, and families from diverse cultural
backgrounds. R-FAM has the potential to set a new standard of NICU psychosocial care—therefore improving the outcomes
and culture of these healthcare units across the globe."
10746859,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Current standard of care for cystic fibrosis (CF) does not include drugs unequivocally effective at curbing
airway inflammation, in contrast to crucial gains made in correcting defects in the CF transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) via highly effective modulator therapy (HEMT) and an array of antimicrobial
drugs. Effectively treating exuberant neutrophil-dominated inflammation in CF, particularly in the earliest stages
of the disease, is a critical goal because doing so would increase patient lifespan and health span. This project
is designed to test the hypothesis that neutrophil hyperexocytosis, which occurs in CF from a very young age,
is a critical event that releases active myeloperoxidase (MPO) from neutrophil granules and enables the
generation of extracellular hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a strong and promiscuous oxidant that can damage cells.
We further hypothesize that the released MPO becomes associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs), providing
MPO with sustained metabolism to fuel its HOCl-generating activity and conferring resistance to inhibitors.
Ultimately, we hypothesize that increased airway HOCl injures airway epithelial cells (AECs) and promotes
maladaptive cellular responses that contribute to bronchiectasis. Research from our group has shown that
MPO is active in CF airways from the earliest stages of disease and is associated with initial manifestations of
bronchiectasis. Furthermore, we have identified molecular products of HOCl exposure, such as methionine
sulfoxide, that can be monitored by LC-MS across a broad range of biological specimens, including basic and
translational models and clinical samples. Using state-of-the-art LC-MS, rigorous cell-, protein-, and EV-
detection methods, highly translational models of neutrophils and EVs, and clinical sample validation, this
project sets out a series of parallel experiments designed to identify the sequence of events leading from
neutrophil transmigration into CF airways, to active MPO release and extracellular HOCl generation, to CF
AEC injury and maladaptation to the potent oxidative insult. These experiments are enumerated in the
following Specific Aims: (1) Determine the impact of hyperexocytosis on extracellular HOCl and innate
defense; (2) Determine mechanisms of granule-releasing, immunomodulatory, and metabolically active (GRIM)
neutrophil EV-based HOCl production; and (3) Determine mechanisms of CF airway epithelial cytotoxicity
mediated by MPO and HOCl. Furthermore, these experiments account for potential impacts of novel HEMT
therapy elexacaftor-tezacaftor-ivacaftor (ETI) in inflammatory pathways by comparing CF sputum samples with
HEMT to the same samples from donors not receiving ETI. The ultimate goal of the proposed studies is to
generate knowledge informing clinical and drug development research and forestall CF lung disease
progression at the earliest stages and before end organ damage. Furthermore, owing to the prevalence of
GRIM neutrophils in a number of lung diseases beyond CF, information pertinent to other lung diseases
including neutrophil inflammation will also be gained by the completion of this project."
10754283,"Endothelium-derived nitric oxide (NO), is a key mediator regulating vascular tone and blood pressure. NO
mediates vascular relaxation through activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in the smooth muscle.
While NO is synthesized by NO synthase in the endothelium, the process of vascular NO degradation and
metabolism in smooth muscle is poorly understood. NO degradation in the vessel wall is mediated by an O2-
dependent NO dioxygenase (NOD) that oxidizes NO to nitrate. Cytoglobin (Cgb) is a recently discovered globin
expressed in smooth muscle (but not in the endothelium) with previously unknown function. Cgb is proposed to
serve as a critical regulator of the rate of O2-dependent NO metabolism in the vessel wall, in turn regulating
vascular tone. Over the prior grant period: 1) we demonstrated that Cgb is the major heme protein that
regulates the rate of O2-dependent NO metabolism in the smooth muscle of both conduit and resistance
vessels and, in turn, profoundly modulates vascular tone; 2) we identified that cytochrome b5 (B5)/ B5
reductase (B5R) constitutes the major Cgb reducing system that supports this NOD function; 3) we discovered
that Cgb has potent superoxide dismutase (SOD) function accounting for its previously unexplained antioxidant
effects; 4) most recently, we identified novel selective inhibitors of Cgb NOD function that do not impair its SOD
function and were shown in vessels to enhance NO mediated sGC activation. However, major questions
remain regarding the overall process of NO decay in the vessel wall, how this varies in disease, and how it can
be modulated to ameliorate disease. In the next stage of this grant program, we seek to determine how the NO
degrading and SOD/antioxidant properties of Cgb in the vessel wall control the processes of NO and redox
metabolism in normal and hypertensive vessels, and how this in turn regulates vessel tone and systemic blood
pressure. The critical effects of Cgb expression levels and the modulation of its NOD activity will be
determined. Studies will be performed first in isolated vessels and then in the in vivo cardiovascular system,
with measurements in our genetically modified mouse lines with Cgb-/-, Cgb-/+ and Cgb overexpression as well
as compounds that selectively inhibit Cgb NOD function. Studies will also be performed in our recently
developed conditional smooth muscle-selective Cgb-/- mouse to definitively characterize the role of Cgb in
smooth muscle. Studies will focus on the physiological regulation that occurs in normal non-hypertensive mice
and then on angiotensin-induced hypertension. All the data obtained will be used to support computational
modeling that will enable us to predict the effects of modulating Cgb expression and its NO metabolizing
function. Accomplishment of this research plan will elucidate how Cgb levels and its NOD and SOD function
regulates O2-dependent NO metabolism and the redox state of the vessel, thus providing important insights
into the regulation of vascular tone in normal physiology and cardiovascular disease. This knowledge will lead
to new therapeutic approaches to treat or reverse hypertension and other cardiovascular disease."

 The bioactive lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) plays a key role in regulating the growth, survival and
migration of mammalian cells. S1P is produced intracellularly and then released extracellularly to engage in its
(patho)physiological roles. The Spinster (Spns) lipid transporters of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) are
critical for transporting S1P across cellular membranes. Of the three Spns proteins in humans, Spns2 functions
as the main S1P transporter, which makes it a potential drug target for modulating S1P export and signaling. An
endothelial cell-specific defect in Spns2 results in impaired egress of lymphocytes and prevents tumor metastasis
in mice, strongly suggesting that Spns2 could be an effective target for reducing metastases by increasing the
efficacy of immunotherapy. Thus, detailed characterization of the Spns2 mechanism is of high significance for
the development of novel therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with S1P signaling and to target Spns2
as a potential immunosuppressant. The overall goal of this proposal is to define the functional mechanism of the
Spns family of sphingolipid transporters. The mechanism of Spns2-mediated S1P transport across cellular
membrane remains poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of structural information (Aims 1 and 2). In
addition, the precise mechanism of Spns2 regulation is still unclear (Aim 3). We recently defined the proton-
dependent conformational dynamics of a bacterial Spns transporter. Our approach capitalizes on a powerful
pulsed EPR technique known as Double Electron Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, an effective
nanometer-scale ruler, in the context of high-resolution structures. It is informed by functional studies and
contextualized through collaborative molecular modeling. Using this integrated approach, we conduct a thorough
mechanistic comparison between human Spns2 and its homologs. The objectives of this proposal are to define
the cation- and substrate-coupled conformational cycle of human Spns2 and its bacterial homologs in lipid
bilayers. To determine the conformational states involved in the alternating access mechanism, we will apply
DEER spectroscopy under conditions expected to stabilize transport intermediates and combine the results with
restraint-assisted molecular dynamics to map ligand-coupled conformational changes. Using a similar integrated
approach to define the transport mechanism of other Spns family members and their prokaryotic homologs, we
will identify the key commonalities and differences in their mechanisms, highlighting the mechanistic flexibility
enabling their diverse function with transformative therapeutic potential."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among US Hispanic or Latino (H/L)
populations. H/Ls are a relatively young population and experience heightened disparities in risk for most CVD
risk factors, including obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia, and hypertension; therefore, their absolute
CVD burden is expected to increase. The major public health and clinical challenge imposed by CVD has
motivated large efforts to understand underlying biologic mechanisms–a critical barrier to treatment, risk
stratification, and ultimately, disease prevention. Thousands of genetic loci for coronary heart disease (CHD)
and CVD risk factors have been mapped influencing risk of CHD via perturbations of lipid metabolism, blood
pressure regulation, inflammation, and platelet function, as well as through mechanisms that remain unknown.
Yet, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for CHD and stroke in H/L populations have been scarce.
Indeed, despite previous work on the genetics of CVD risk factors in H/L (several by our group), no stand-
alone GWAS for CHD and stroke in H/L has been published. Thus, for CHD, stroke, and CVD risk factors, the
knowledge gap between genomics, public health, and medicine could be improved by enriching the genomic
translational pipeline, which includes discovering new loci for CVD related traits and their underlying causal
variants; elucidating the biological and/or pathophysiological mechanisms; and establishing evidence for
clinical utility and/or impact on health outcomes. We propose to leverage extant data on H/L individuals from
large epidemiologic and clinical biobank studies and to generate new eQTL data to discover and characterize
the genetic architecture of CVD risk and events in H/L populations. Our specific aims are to (1) discover and
characterize the genetic architecture of CVD related traits in Hispanic/Latinos through meta-analysis of studies
ascertaining more than 159,622 H/L participants in total; (2) derive the first ever H/L-specific eQTL map to
build H/L-relevant gene expression prediction models and apply these models to our study samples with
genotyping data (discovery sample less the participants with measured RNA: n~146,822) and conduct
transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) analyses in each individual study followed by meta-analysis
for each trait of interest; and (3) perform colocalization and to sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) analyses
to identify causal genes amongst H/L CVD risk loci, and use electronic health record (EHR)-linked biobanks
to characterize the broader clinical impact of loci via phenome wide association studies (PheWAS) for H/L
CVD risk loci. Our study is high impact as the burden of CVD is rapidly growing in Hispanic/Latino populations
and demographic trends suggest that the H/L population will constitute ~35% of the US population by 2050.
Our research will ensure diverse populations are not the last to benefit from the new era of precision medicine
at the same time it develops expedited strategies for translating genomics to function and clinical utility."

Primary Dysautonomia (PD), distinct from the entity called familial dysautonomia, is a multifactorial condition
that runs in families in which the autonomic nervous system (ANS) does not function correctly leading to a
range of disabling disease symptoms. Despite the known fact that PD exhibits Mendelian inheritance patterns,
underlying genetic origins have not been identified. Treatments are solely based on alleviating symptomatology
and there is no rationale for effectuating a cure. To help fill this knowledge gap and start identifying contributing
factors to PD, we closely followed sixty-nine families with a dominant Mendelian inheritance pattern of multiple
shared symptoms including (i) chronic orthostatic intolerance, (ii) chronic fatigue, (iii) primary focal
hyperhidrosis, (iv) chronic itch, and (v) generalized anxiety. We initiated whole-exome sequencing (WES) of
the probands in these families with resulting data suggesting a causal relationship between PD and an
autosomal dominant inheritance pattern of mutations in genes encoding voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels.
This outcome is strengthened by the fact that we have treated family members with NaV channel modulators
which resolved many of their complaints. Based on preliminary results, we hypothesize that what appears to
pathophysiologically link diffuse autonomic symptoms, is a disease model in which NaV channel mutations can
transform the ANS into an oversensitive nervous system that over time develops incapacitating and persistent
disease. To start investigating the involvement of NaV channel mutations in PD, we devised a strategy to help
elucidate the link between our targets and anomalous activation of the sympathetic nervous system in patients.
Our approach will culminate in the creation of a validated animal model with autonomic dysfunction in which
human therapeutics can be tested. Successful completion will provide new insights into genetic causes of PD,
a vital step towards understanding the multifactorial nature of this disorder."
10771990,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Hemophilia is an inherited deficiency of clotting factor VIII or IX, which causes joint bleeding and crippling
arthropathy, along with muscle bleeding. Prophylactic factor medication administered intravenously several
times per week decreases but does not eliminate bleeding. Most efforts to eliminate breakthrough bleeding on
prophylaxis alter medication regimens to increase factor levels; however, this is often not successful and comes
with increased financial burden and/or more frequent injections. The effort to eliminate breakthrough bleeding
is limited by an incomplete understanding of bleeding biomechanics. This knowledge gap also constrains
choices for safe and effective physical activity, which is important in persons with hemophilia (PwH) to prevent
obesity, improve social functioning, and decrease mental health concerns. This study develops methods to
objectively measure forces related to lower extremity joint and muscle bleeding in PwH, in order to fulfill
the long-term goal of decreasing bleeding risk. This long-term goal will be accomplished in a future study that
will collect data to build a time-dependent statistical model of bleeding risk that includes hemostatic, joint fragility,
and biomechanical bleeding risk components. The objectives of the current study are to determine how past
joint bleeding influences asymmetry in lower extremity joint loading, measured in a Motion Lab using motion
capture and force plate technology (aim 1); to determine the influence of motion lab asymmetry on future lower
extremity joint and muscle bleeding (aim 2); and to develop tools to collect motion data outside the Motion Lab
using inertial measurement units (IMUs) (aim 3).
 The immediate goals of the candidate for this K23 award, Dr. Beth Warren, are to add new skills to her
bioengineering and hematology background. These include motion measurement techniques inside and outside
the Motion Lab, including signal processing techniques; hemophilia joint outcome measurement and meaning;
and statistical model planning for future studies. Achieving these goals will support her long-term career goal to
become a leading expert in hemophilia joint outcomes and activity-associated bleeding risk.
 Dr. Warren will accomplish her research and training aims with the support of her mentors, Dr. Marilyn
Manco-Johnson (hemophilia clinical research) and Dr. James Carollo (biomechanics, movement analysis). The
University of Colorado Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center (UC-HTC) will provide world-class infrastructure to
support Dr. Warren’s career development and research objectives, including facilities and research staff with
extensive experience and expertise in hemophilia clinical research. The University of Colorado provides junior
faculty members with numerous opportunities to facilitate the transition to research career independence. By
completing her research and training aims, Dr. Warren will advance the science of objective measurement of
bleeding biomechanics, while also obtaining experience and training necessary to begin her career as an
independent investigator."

Median glioblastoma (GBM) survival is ~15 months and is little changed the past 50 years. Better therapies are
needed. Preclinical work from us and others has shown that a high-fat / low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD)
can slow cancer growth in multiple models including GBM. Like many cancers, GBM depends on glycolysis for
the biosynthetic, bioenergetic, and signaling needs of oncogenesis. By limiting glycolytic flux and altering
metabolism, KD may have anti-cancer effects, including abrogating dysregulated insulin-PI3K signaling,
suppressing the pro-inflammatory tumor environment, and facilitating an anti-tumor immune response. Given the
dismal prognosis, many GBM patients adopt a quasi-KD despite the lack of high-quality data supporting its use.
To fill this gap, we conducted a pilot KD study for brain tumor patients, wherein we saw improvements in fatigue,
mood, cognitive function, and seizure control, as well as radiographic responses. We recently completed a phase
1 KD trial for patients with newly diagnosed GBM. The primary objectives of the phase 1 study - safety and
feasibility – were met. Importantly, we found an impressive median Overall Survival (OS) of 29.1 months, a 99%
improvement vs. historic control from the phase 3 trial that established the current standard of care (SOC). We
are now poised to conduct the first ever well-powered randomized controlled phase 2 study of KD + SOC vs.
SOC for patients with newly diagnosed GBM.
We propose a 170-person multicenter randomized controlled phase 2 study of KD plus SOC vs. SOC for patients
newly diagnosed with GBM. Our primary objective is to test efficacy between KD + SOC vs. SOC as assessed
by improved OS. We will assess quality of life (QoL), cognition, and physical function, as benefits in any of these
would be impactful to patients’ lives. We will take full advantage of tumor, blood, and stool samples that we will
be collecting to understand the effects of KD on tumor and host metabolism and immune response.
Desperate patients are not waiting. We thus have an urgent responsibility to prospectively and comprehensively
evaluate KD and understand its effects, good or bad. If negative, patients can be counseled accordingly, and
spend their precious time and energy on other endeavors, though QoL benefits (if seen) may still persuade some
to go on a KD. If positive, we have the potential to establish a new SOC that can be broadly applied without the
cost or toxicity of most new cancer therapies. We will seize the opportunity to gain a greater mechanistic
understanding of the effects of KD on GBM, which may shape future efforts to identify early markers/predictors
of response and optimize therapeutic combinations. These data can also help manage GBM patients who
choose to go on a KD either for OS or QoL benefits (if seen). Thus, regardless of outcome, this study will shape
clinical practice."

Enhancer formation at precise chromatin loci by transcription factors enables appropriate gene activation
to biological demand. This essential process is challenged by the millions of matches to transcription
factor binding motifs present in the human genome. Chromatin structure is also known to act as a
physical barrier for many transcription factors. How do transcription factors overcome chromatin barriers
and selectively activate appropriate genomic loci while they are competing against chromatin barriers?
The answer to this fundamental question is still largely unknown. Recently, a subset of transcription
factors, so-called pioneer factors, have been identified as essential proteins required to modify chromatin
accessibility during cellular reprogramming. Unlike other transcription factors, pioneer factors are capable
of binding to nucleosomes at closed (inactive) chromatin sites and inducing chromatin opening. Since
nucleosome formation was thought to act as a physical barrier, identification of pioneer factors’ action on
chromatin is fundamental to understanding the cellular reprogramming processes. Misregulation of
pioneer factors is associated with various human diseases including cancer. Therefore, there is a critical
need to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying pioneer factor-induced cellular reprogramming.
Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of transcription factor-induced cellular
reprogramming. We previously demonstrated that GATA3 acts as a pioneer factor that can directly bind
closed chromatin and activate epithelial marker genes during the mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition
(MET) in triple-negative breast cancer cells. Using this cellular reprogramming model system, we further
identified the unique nucleosome positioning enriched at GATA3 target loci. Our Cryo-EM structure
analysis of the GATA3-nucleosome complex revealed that the motif recognition by GATA3 on the
nucleosome differs from histone-free DNAs. Chromatin structural analysis during MET also identified that
chromatin opening and de novo enhancer formation by GATA3 is site-specific and only observed at a
subset of GATA3 binding sites. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that nucleosome positioning and
structure at the pioneer factor GATA3 binding site dictate the readout (chromatin opening and gene
activation) of GATA3 binding and is directly involved in MET. The primary goals of this application are to:
(1) identify specific nucleosome positioning and conformation that are essential for successful GATA3-
induced cellular reprogramming; (2) identify the roles of chromatin remodeling enzymes during GATA3-
induced MET, and; (3) discover minimum chromatin components for GATA3-induced enhancer
formation. We will use several novel approaches including high-resolution mapping methods for
nucleosome positioning and transcription factors’ footprint. These results will provide a basis for
understanding cellular reprogramming processes induced by transcription factors."

While the principal function of tumor suppressor p53 is a nuclear transcription regulator that transcribes a
diverse set of genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, and numerous other processes,
compelling evidences have also unraveled extra-nuclear, transcription-independent activities of p53 in
the cytoplasm, where it induces apoptosis and inhibits autophagy. However, significant gaps exist in the
knowledge of p53 in the cytoplasm. The lack of knowledge is due at least in part to the fact that
approaches investigating cytoplasmic p53 have been primarily in vitro studies in artificial settings.
Dissection of the mechanistic aspects of cytoplasmic p53 in an in vivo system is necessary to clarify the
biological events by which cytoplasmic p53 exerts its extra-nuclear, transcription-independent functions.
Recent genome sequencing analyses of bats discovered many unexpected variances between bats and
other mammals. Among them are the bat-specific alterations in the nuclear localization signal (NLS)
sequences in p53. The alterations are predicted to hamper bat p53 nuclear import, resulting in increased
cytoplasmic accumulation. To explore the significance of cytoplasmic p53, we generated mice
expressing a mutant p53 that has an altered NLS sequence to mimic bat p53 NLS. We identified that p53
interacts with lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), which plays a critical role in lipid metabolism. We also
found that cytoplasmic p53 promotes autophagy through disrupting Beclin 1-Bcl-2/Bcl-xL interaction and
activating Beclin 1. IP-mass spectrometry experiments using cytoplasm-sequestered p53 and identified
CUL9, a cytoplasmic cullin RING E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a major p53 binding partner. Biochemical
experiments revealed that CUL9 catalyzes K63-linked, non-proteolytic polyubiquitination of p53. In this
proposal, we test the hypothesis that cytoplasmic p53 exerts tumor suppression and anti-aging functions
through inhibiting glycolysis, increasing lipogenesis, and promoting autophagy. Such functions of p53 are
regulated by CUL9 catalyzed, K63-linked p53 polyubiquitination."
10815749,"The prefrontal cortex (PFC) mediates control over goal-directed behaviors and dysfunction of the PFC is thought
to underlie compulsive drug-taking and relapse in substance abusers. The PFC has been implicated in
behavioral effects that occur at levels of alcohol associated with social drinking. There are few detailed studies
on the actions of alcohol in PFC, or specifically on the sensitivity of three major subtypes of interneurons (INTs)
that augment and control the activity of pyramidal (PYR) neurons.
We recently reported the stimulatory effects of alcohol on PYR and its inhibitory effect on somatostatin
(SST+)-expressing INTs. We now propose to examine the sensitivity to alcohol of two additional major subtypes
of INTs: parvalbumin (PV+)-, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP+) expressing subtypes. The
overarching hypothesis of the proposal is that one or more specific sub-populations of INTs are sensitive
to alcohol, that modulation of INT activity by alcohol is mediated by ascending dopaminergic inputs from
the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and leads to disinhibition within the PFC.
We will study the effects of alcohol on the activity of PV+ and VIP+ INT using 2-photon imaging techniques to
probe the actions and mechanisms of alcohol in the PFC. We will study the effects of alcohol on activity in PYR
and INT in the PFC in vivo in the mouse pre-limbic area (PL) using the genetically-encoded calcium indicator
GCaMP. We hypothesize that ethanol increases activity in PYR and certain INTs via the activation of a
disinhibitory local circuit, and that these effects on PYR result from decreases in activity in a subgroup of
SST+ INTs, perhaps via activation of VIP+ INTs.
We will also study the effect of alcohol on activity in dopaminergic afferents within the PFC, imaging GCaMP
under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter and measure the effects of activating Gi DREADDs within
the ventral VTA to block the effects of alcohol on PYR and INT activity in the PFC in vivo. We hypothesize that
activity within DA afferents in the PFC releases DA and modulate INTs in PFC, and that this may be
prevented by silencing dopaminergic inputs from the VTA.
We will examine the mechanisms of alcohol sensitivity of PYR and INT subtypes in PFC in vivo using specific
dopamine receptor antagonists, in order to establish the mechanisms by which PYR and INTs are disinhibited
by low dose alcohol and how specific INT sub-classes are modulated by alcohol in vivo and in vitro. We
hypothesize that alcohol disinhibits PYR and that this occurs via indirect effects of alcohol that are
mediated by ascending dopaminergic inputs from the VTA, acting on DA receptors in the PFC."
10808189,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
 Several clinical trials targeting neuronal injury have failed to demonstrate significant benefit in stroke patients.
Recent studies suggest that there is a significant vascular component to poor functional outcomes after stroke, particularly
post-stroke blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Currently no treatments available to treat leaky BBB and rejuvenate
central nervous system (CNS) vessels after stroke. Here we propose two different approaches to reach this goal.
 Aim 1: Gene expression patterns are set, in part, by epigenetic processes that classify the genome into active
and silent to support the development and differentiation. Nearly nothing is known about the epigenetic mechanisms that
govern the development of BBB. This approach is based on the central premise that understanding the epigenetic
mechanisms that regulate the formation of an intact BBB could identify novel targets to modulate BBB. Interestingly, in
our preliminary experiment, we found that during development some important BBB genes are transcriptionally repressed
in adult CNS endothelial cells (ECs-epicenter of BBB). Further, we discovered that the two major epigenetic enzymes
histone deacetylate 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mediate this transcriptional repression. Based
on these novel findings, we propose that, during embryonic brain development, the epigenetic regulators HDAC2 and
PRC2 establish an intact BBB via transcriptional repression of specific BBB genes. Further, we hypothesize that, while this
expression profile is essential for maintaining a functional BBB in adults, it also contributes to impaired BBB repair by CNS
ECs following stroke. This study will identify the epigenetic regulators HDAC2 and PRC2 as new therapeutic targets to
manipulate BBB during disease and therapy and will advance current knowledge regarding BBB development.
 Aim 2: Our second approach is to target a core signaling pathway in cerebral vessels. During early brain
development, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway orchestrates BBB development and CNS angiogenesis. However, the Wnt/β-
catenin pathway diminishes during later vessel development and is almost inactive in adult CNS ECs, making it difficult to
target this pathway for vascular repair in CNS diseases. Our new preliminary data demonstrate the epigenetic mechanism
behind Wnt pathway inactivation in adult CNS ECs and show that the Wnt pathway can be re-activated in adult CNS ECs
by epigenetic manipulation and Wnt ligand stimulation. Consequently, we hypothesize that reactivating the Wnt/β-
catenin pathway in adult CNS ECs will restore the developmental phenotypes including BBB formation and angiogenesis
in adult CNS ECs, thereby promoting BBB repair and vascular regeneration after stroke. The Wnt pathway, for a long time
been said to be undruggable owing to its absence in adult vessels, our evaluations on targeting the Wnt pathway for BBB
repair will shift the mindset, leading to targeting this pathway for CNS and other diseases.
 If successful this proposal will pave the way for the development of novel epigenetic and Wnt-targeting
therapies to repair the BBB and improve outcomes in stroke patients. The overall impact of the project is high as it
proposes a broadly applicable strategy to repair BBB which is central to several CNS disorders."
10815778,"Dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) disproportionately impacts racial/ethnic
minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. Development of effective interventions require mechanistic
understanding of distal fundamental forces, including socioeconomic context (i.e. “neighborhood disadvantage”
or the social determinants of health of a given area), that put people at “risk for [more proximal] risks” such as
individual-level income, education, health behaviors and comorbidity. Prior research supports that contextual
disadvantage is modifiable and interacts with biological processes to produce disease, yet little is known of its
impact on ADRD. Towards this, we created validated quantifications of neighborhood disadvantage for the full
US. This Area Deprivation Index (ADI) incorporates poverty, education, housing and employment indicators;
predicts disparity-related health outcomes; and is freely shared through our public platform (the Neighborhood
Atlas). We have validated survey and public data-based residential history tracing methodologies that establish
dosage and timing of neighborhood disadvantage exposure across a life-course for both living and deceased
persons. We have demonstrated that even after adjustment for individual risk factors, neighborhood
disadvantage is strongly associated with cognitive function, neurodegeneration shown on MRI, and post-mortem
AD plaque neuropathology. However, our current sample is lacking in geographic diversity and is of insufficient
size to conduct a more robust multi-factor phenotypic risk assessment of social-biological interactions and their
mechanisms; a necessary foundation towards developing new therapeutic intervention. This proposal employs
collaboration with 22 Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers (ADRC) and their existing cognitive, neuroimaging
and neuropathology data. We take on the substantial work to create detailed residential histories for each ADRC
subject (N~9,234 living, N~10,469 brain bank) to establish a dosage and timing of neighborhood disadvantage
exposure across each life-course. Hypothesis: Larger and earlier exposures to neighborhood disadvantage will
predict lower cognitive function, faster cognitive decline and greater disease burden including AD neuropathology
among the targeted sample. Aim 1: Determine the impact of the cumulative dose and timing of neighborhood
disadvantage exposure (indexed by ADI), on cognitive function and change over time; Aim 2: on AD-specific
markers indexed by neuroimaging (amyloid and tau PET) and the secondary outcome of volumetric MRI; and
Aim 3: on neuropathologic tissue features and diagnosis. Aim 4: Using existing ADRC data and newly collected
survey data, define the extent to which individual race/ethnicity, age, sex, income, education, comorbidity and
health-behaviors mediate these relationships. The proposed project, if funded, will be the largest study of its kind
on social determinants of health in the context of AD. Successful completion will result in the development of a
novel collaborative infrastructure of contextual exposure for future social-biological phenotypic evaluation,
providing a potential pathway to new therapeutics, and directly responsive to the NIA mission."
10798188,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has yielded durable tumor regression and stabilized disease in 10-30% of
patients for a range of solid and hematological malignancies. While its promising results have revolutionized
cancer care, much work is needed to expand ICBs' benefit to a greater number of cancer patients. Various
studies have highlighted the microbiota's impact on the innate and adaptive immunity and its potential role as a
modifiable target to improve ICB response rates. Dysbiosis and decreased gut microbial diversity have been
linked to poorer outcomes in patients receiving ICB. In two ongoing clinical trials, preliminary results of fecal
microbiota transplantation of an ICB-responsive patient's microbiota into an ICB-non-responsive patient exhibit
restored clinical response. Additionally, enrichment of specific bacteria has been identified in both mice and
human that respond to checkpoint blockade. This unexpected link between the microbiome and cancer holds a
promising opportunity to enhance cancer treatment by modifying the patient's microbiota. While there are a
growing number of studies on microbiota-ICB interactions, mechanisms through which the microbiota
modulates immune responses to cancer and cancer treatment remains unknown. To better understand the
microbiota's contribution to immune activity and ICB treatment, I have established a gnotobiotic model of anti-
PD-L1 treated melanoma. I have demonstrated and standardized methods to evaluate how a defined microbial
community can inhibit B16 melanoma response to anti-PD-L1, and I have begun fractionating non-responder
communities to identify and characterize effector species driving response failure. This grant aims to
understand the robustness of ICB-microbiota interactions across different cancer types and tumor
models, identify and characterize the first bacteria to drive non-response to anti-PD-L1 and explore
potential mechanisms of non-response. Aim 1 – Based on preliminary data, I have selected two mice SPF
microbiotas and two defined human microbiotas that exhibit contrasting tumor growth response rates to anti-
PD-L1 when colonized into germfree, B16 melanoma-bearing mice. I aim to understand the robustness and
generalizability of microbiome-immunotherapy findings across tumor types and ICBs by exploring tumor
growth differences following checkpoint blockade therapy (anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-1, and anti-CTLA-4). Aim 2 –
Based on previous lab findings that at baseline, germ free mice respond to anti-PDL1, we anticipate that
there exists one or more effector species in each non-responder community that drives non-response
to anti-PD-L1. To strategically elucidate the causative bacterial strains, I will fractionate each NR microbiota
into orthogonal sub-communities, colonize germ-free mice, evaluate tumor growth trends, and analyze myeloid
and T-cell populations in tumors and draining lymph nodes. By studying these gnotobiotic animals with
different clinical responses to ICB, we hope to uncover the effector species that attenuate checkpoint blockade
response, elucidate mechanisms, and identify novel avenues to modify the microbiota to improve cancer
outcomes."
10812371,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol and cannabis are the first and second most commonly used substances among adolescents.
Adolescence is a period of considerable development, making the adolescent brain particularly vulnerable to
negative effects of alcohol and cannabis use. Developing and testing interventions that target both alcohol and
cannabis use during adolescence are vital to decreasing costly consequences. Biases in cognitive processing
of drug-related stimuli play an important role in the development and maintenance of problematic substance use.
The Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) is a computerized program, effective in assessing implicit approach biases
for both alcohol and cannabis, in which participants push or pull a joystick in response to an irrelevant feature of
an image presented on a computer screen (e.g., push when in portrait, pull when in landscape). A modified
version of the AAT (mAAT) is also used as a Cognitive Bias Modification (CBM) intervention, to retrain
participants’ implicit biases toward or away from stimuli by presenting the target stimuli predominantly in one
format (e.g., push or pull). Despite research demonstrating the effectiveness of mAAT interventions to reduce
problematic alcohol and cannabis use, there is a dearth of research examining this intervention among
adolescents. The proposed research will test a pilot randomized controlled trial of an integrated mAAT
intervention to target co-occurring alcohol and cannabis use among treatment-seeking adolescents (N=52).
Specific aims include to test the effect of the intervention on approach biases for cannabis/alcohol stimuli (Aim
1) and cannabis/alcohol use at 1- and 3-months post-intervention (Aim 2), and to examine the role of intentions
and cravings as mediators in the relationship between treatment condition and use. The research environment,
facilities, and resources at MUSC are ideally suited for mentored career development in addiction research. K23
training objectives are to: 1) increase knowledge of etiological and treatment mechanisms for cannabis use; 2)
acquire essential knowledge and experience across the stages of clinical trial research among treatment-seeking
adolescents with substance use problems, including incorporating EMA methods; 3) develop expertise in CBM;
4) gain experience incorporating EEG to identify change mechanisms in substance use interventions; and 5)
enhance scientific communication and overall academic productivity. Structured mentorship from Drs. Carla
Kmett Danielson, Lindsay Squeglia, Lisa McTeague, and Robert Miranda Jr. will ensure training goals are met.
The candidate’s long-term career goal Is to direct a research portfolio that: 1) develops and tests innovative
intervention approaches for substance use problems among adolescents and emerging adults; 2) delivers these
innovative interventions in existing real-world settings; and 3) identifies change mechanisms within interventions
using multiple units of analysis. The training proposed herein is designed to develop expertise across these
areas, represents a clear progression from prior training and would not be possible without this K23."

PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Given rising levels of global stress, exacerbated by the pandemic, loneliness and mental health
problems are on the rise, adding to the burden of chronic diseases. Most health-oriented research takes a
harm-reduction approach, identifying and mitigating problems to reduce disease burden. Recent research has
demonstrated that a greater focus on emotional well-being may provide another critical strategy for reducing
disease burden and lead to significant improvements in population health. To advance the science and provide
the strongest evidence base for practice, greater development of research capacity for studying emotional well-
being (EWB) is needed. Core elements of emotional well-being (EWB)--hedonic, evaluative, and eudaimonic--
are associated with better healthspan and are hypothesized to play a causal role. Our overall aim is to create
a cohesive transdisciplinary network of scientists engaged in mechanistic intervention-relevant
research on EWB, with a specific focus on eudaimonia, and pathways by which EWB leads to healthy
longevity, including social connection, positive physiology, and healthy behaviors. We bring together three
leading institutions in EWB science, uniting UCSF (Epel, Mendes), Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and
Happiness at Harvard (Kubzansky) and UC Berkeley (Keltner, Simon-Thomas) and its interdisciplinary Greater
Good Science Center (GGSC), whose digital platforms reach several millions annually (researchers,
educators, health professionals). We will catalyze innovation and progress of mechanistic research on EWB by
fostering a scientific community focused on measurement and intervention.
 Our aims include Aim 1) Facilitating analysis of EWB and healthspan across national cohort studies
in 30 nations that are part of the Health and Retirement Study Family of Studies by harmonizing existing
measures of EWB (e.g., life satisfaction, eudaimonic well-being, positive affect) and supporting causal-
inference analyses; Aim 2) Promoting early stage intervention research by developing sensitive EWB
measures, and interventions that can increase EWB and drive change in relevant biobehavioral mediators
including positive physiology profiles, leveraging existing technology and validated biosensors that measure
autonomic nervous system and sleep; and Aim 3) Creating and disseminating valuable research resources
for studies of EWB and physical health, including a) making the harmonized EWB data across countries
publicly available and providing pilot funding and senior scientist expertise to support investigator time to use
the data; b) creating an expert consensus toolbox of EWB measures and methodology; and c) developing a
library of empirically-validated EWB interventions (building on UCB's repository). After 4 years, the EWB
network will have built strong research capacity and catapulted the field forward with innovative unifying
models, consensus measurement and intervention resources, and mechanistic pilot data. Transdisciplinary
collaborations will continue to generate key findings well beyond the network's input."
10813822,"Type2 diabetes is caused by an inability of insulin-secreting β-cells within the islets of Langerhans to secrete
sufficient insulin to compensate for increased insulin resistance. Many factors within the islet microenvironment
including local and systemic elevations in pro-inflammatory cytokines, increased circulating free-fatty acids, and
elevated glucose can contribute to a subsequent decline in β-cell mass and function. Yet, the mechanisms by
which these factors disrupt β-cell function are poorly understood. β-cells within the islet do not function
autonomously: extensive interactions occur between β-cells and with other endocrine cells that control the
regulation of insulin secretion. Previously, we and others established a critical role for gap-junction mediated
electrical communication between β-cells that coordinates the dynamics of electrical activity, [Ca2+] elevations
and insulin release. The overall goal of this research program is to understand the physiological role and
regulation of gap junction channels in regulating islet function and the contribution of gap junction dysregulation
in diabetes to islet dysfunction and diabetes progression. In the previous funding period, we demonstrated that
gap junction channels and coordinated [Ca2+] were disrupted early in the progression of type2 diabetes in both
animal models and human diabetes, and that PKCδ played a key role in mediating this disruption. We further
demonstrated that elevated gap junction coupling could be protective against β-cell death, suggesting a potential
therapeutic target. However very little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of
gap junction channels within the islet and what signaling mechanisms may underlie the disruption to gap junction
communication in diabetes progression. The overall hypothesis guiding our work to address this open question
is that diabetogenic conditions disrupt transcription and post-translational trafficking of gap junction channel
proteins; and targeting these pathways can retain proper inter-cellular communication, islet function and
ameliorate diabetes progression. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct two specific aims: 1) Determine the
role for excitability dependent Cx36 gap junction formation in healthy conditions and diabetes, and 2) Understand
the mechanisms underlying Cx36 gap junction trafficking and function in healthy conditions and diabetes. By
understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying gap junction regulation within the islet of Langerhans, we
will be able to identify means by which gap junction communication and coordinated [Ca2+] and insulin secretion
can be recovered in type2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. This will be important for ameliorating islet dysfunction
and improving glucose control to prevent the decline in β-cell function and mass in type2 diabetes."
10794385,"Title: Improving genetically engineered T cells for medulloblastoma
PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The intent of this project is to develop antigen-specific T cells as an effective immunotherapy for medulloblastoma
(MB), a most common pediatric brain tumor. While recent advances in MB treatment slightly improved the overall
survival, the patients are left with long-term devastating side effects as a result of a treatment. The body’s natural
immune defenses against cancer often fail because the cancer either does not provoke or actively inhibits
immune responses. However, genetic modification of the patient’s own immune system can be used to endow
T cells with improved ability to recognize and kill cancerous cells that would not otherwise respond to
conventional therapies. Cancer treatments consisting of the infusion of T cells that are engineered to recognize
tumor antigens, molecules present only on cancers cells, have shown dramatic success in clinical studies against
leukemia. We now propose to develop such approach for MB. In our method, we will target two antigens called
IL13Ra2 and B7-H3 which are present on MB cells. Next, we will improve our approach by deleting epigenetic
regulators that are known to suppress T cell effector function. Finally, we will use an immunocompetent MB
mouse model to ask which immune cells within brain tumor microenvironment (TME) control CAR T cell efficacy.
Brain tumors are notorious for having an immunosuppressive TME, yet its effect on engineered immune cells
are poorly understood. Thus, the use of mouse models with functional immune system will allow us to accurately
evaluate the function and safety of engineered T cells as well as understand the brain TME. In summary, we
propose to first establish CAR T cells targeting two antigens in order to improve their specificity (Aim 1). We will
then improve their persistence through ablation of epigenetic programs (Aim 2). We will also perform a detailed
mechanistic study to determine how epigenetic regulators control effector function of engineered CAR T cells.
Finally, we will investigate if elimination of key inhibitory immune cells within the brain TME will enhance anti-
tumor effects of CAR T cells (Aim 3). We expect that our proposed studies using gene engineered bi-specific
CAR T cells and immunocompetent mouse model will provide mechanistic insight and superior understanding
on how engineered T cells function and interact with the brain TME. We believe that such knowledge will lead
not only to the creation of improved immune cell-based approaches but also to potential novel therapeutic
approaches for brain tumors in the future. If our pre-clinical approach is successful, we have the resources to
develop a Phase I clinical trial at our institution."

The apical surface of polarized epithelium constitutes one of the first points of contact between the host and
pathogens such as human adenoviruses (HAdVs) that invade the lumen of the respiratory tract. In recent
years, it has become clear that respiratory epithelial cells not only serve as functional and physical barriers, but
actively contribute to the innate immune system providing initial protection against external pathogens. The
EGF receptor (EGFR), which typically exhibits basolateral polarity, has emerged as a key player in the innate
immunity of respiratory epithelium to a variety of infectious and noninfectious noxious stimuli. In contrast to the
canonical ligand-stimulated EGFR pathway, a number of cellular stresses including HAdV infection (our
studies) trigger an alternative mode of EGFR trafficking associated with sustained EGFR activity in non-
degradative endosomes. However, molecular mechanisms regulating this pathway remain poorly understood.
In addition, despite significant progress in understanding the pathological and therapeutic stresses that activate
it, relatively little is known about EGFR function in the context of cellular stress. We have recently found that
stress-induced EGFR signaling is involved in innate immune responses triggered by HAdV cell entry, as well
as following exposure to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α, in respiratory epithelial cells. Moreover, HAdV
encodes an early gene product that suppresses this pathway by promoting EGFR degradation, and which
could provide new insights to potential targets for future anti-viral therapies. Interestingly, our preliminary
studies have revealed that EGFR stress responses were tightly regulated by epithelial cell polarity, with robust
stress-induced EGFR responses only observed when receptors were mistargeted to apical membranes. In
addition, HAdV co-opted cellular pathways contributing to innate immune signaling by enabling dynamic EGFR
membrane remodeling associated with enhanced stress-induced EGFR signaling from apical membranes.
The newly described EGFR innate immune system is likely to have a central role in protecting the lung from
infection with HAdVs and perhaps other pathogens. Conversely, failure to curb this signaling network may lead
to tissue damage, respiratory compromise, and potentially systemic HAdV infections. Our research plan will
identify novel mechanisms regulating dynamic EGFR membrane remodeling in polarized epithelial cells (Aim
1), and stress-induced EGFR innate immune signaling from endosomes (Aim 2); and analyze EGFR innate
immune signaling pathways that are activated as a consequence of HAdV infection in primary human
respiratory epithelial cells and new physiological cells models with enhanced apical EGFR expression (Aim 3).
Although our studies will be carried out in the context of HAdVs, successful completion of this project will have
a broad impact on a variety of respiratory conditions in need of new therapies."
10769730,"Alternative splicing (AS) of human genes is pervasive and greatly expands the repertoire of protein and RNA
products arising from the human genome. AS is critical for cellular differentiation and identity, and its
dysregulation has been causally linked with a broad and expanding array of human diseases, including muscular
dystrophies, neurodegenerative disorders and cancers. However, we currently have limited insight into the
regulation of AS at both the local (gene) and global (genome-wide) levels, due to a lack of tools that provide
direct, high-resolution, and quantitative views into the splicing process. This deficit has in turn roadblocked
progress in understanding how splicing is regulated to confer cellular identity and to control differentiation
processes. The eight introns per average human gene are processed co-transcriptionally through spliceosomal
subunits and regulatory factors binding to specific sequences in nascent RNA. These cis-elements are typically
within introns and thus act only from when they emerge from RNA polymerase to when they are spliced out.
Consequently, in order to dissect splicing regulation mechanisms, we need to determine how fast splicing occurs
and the order of intron excision across nascent transcripts. We recently developed nanopore analysis of CO-
transcriptional Processing (nano-COP) that measures the kinetics, order and coordination of splicing of
endogenous genes in vivo. Nascent RNA is purified and then directly sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore
platform to obtain long reads. We found that splicing kinetics is influenced by intron length and proximity to
alternatively spliced exons, that splicing order does not follow the order of transcription and that neighboring
introns have the propensity to be spliced coordinately at the same time. The goal of this grant is to determine
how cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors impact human splicing kinetics, splicing order and splicing
coordination. Specific Aim 1: Determine how trans-acting factors impact splicing dynamics. We will study eight
RNA-binding proteins that are connected to splicing regulation by our analysis or other studies. To diminish
secondary effects, we will use an inducible degradation system to degrade target factors within hours. We will
perform subRNA-seq and nano-COP to study splicing dynamics after the loss of each factor. Specific Aim 2:
Determine the role of cis-acting elements in dictating splicing dynamics. We will determine how changes to splice
site sequences and other cis-elements alter splicing kinetics and alternative splicing. We will use CRISPR-Cas9
and leverage natural genetic variants to study perturbations to cis-elements. Specific Aim 3: Determine the
relationship between splicing dynamics and AS during human myogenesis. We hypothesize that key trans-acting
factors control splicing kinetics that in turn affect AS. We will study how splicing dynamics change during
myogenesis using nano-COP. The roles of myogenesis splicing regulators in controlling splicing dynamics will
also be investigated. In sum, changes in splicing kinetics will be associated with AS outcomes to determine
models of how splicing is regulated by splicing dynamics."
10767172,"The human placenta is a semi-allogeneic tissue whose growth and development requires tolerance by the maternal immune system. Placental cells come in close contact with maternal blood and uterine tissues yet are able to evade immune recognition during the course of a normal pregnancy. The maternal immune system faces a challenge during pregnancy: to maintain tolerance toward foreign fetal alloantigens while simultaneously staging a response to potential pathogens at the maternal-fetal interface. The mechanisms through which placental cells evade maternal immune recognition are poorly understood, particularly in the context of human pregnancy. The uterine lining, called decidua, is a particularly understudied and important microenvironment, because it is the interface where placental cells called extravillous trophoblast (EVT) come in close contact with maternal immune cells, of which decidual natural killer (dNK) cells are the most abundant. EVT are highly invasive cells which are required for proper remodeling of the maternal uterine lining, including vascular remodeling which leads to establishment of maternal blood flow to the placenta. Interactions between placental EVT and decidual leukocytes are known to facilitate maternal vascular remodeling by EVT and limit the extent of EVT invasion into the uterine wall. Indeed, problems in preterm birth could result from inappropriate responses by dNK cells. Unfortunately, interactions between dNK and trophoblasts are difficult to study in an ongoing pregnancy, due to lack of access to the decidual compartment, where these important interactions occur. While animal models have offered some insights into these processes, they do not accurately model human placentation and pregnancy. This proposal aims to evaluate the decidual cell population in both term and preterm birth in a systematic, detailed manner, then to combine this knowledge with the latest technologies in regenerative medicine in order to develop in vitro models for the study of dNK-EVT interactions. Over the past few years, our collaborative team of investigators has established optimized methods for differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into both NK cells and EVT. We now propose to generate matched maternal and placental induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), and differentiate these cells into dNK cells and EVT, respectively, in order to model interactions between these two cell types. Successful completion of this proposal will establish a reproducible and manipulatable model system for studying interactions between the placenta and maternal immune system and has the potential to lead to identification of mechanisms through which abnormalities in these interactions increase the risk of idiopathic spontaneous preterm birth."
10793506,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for greater than 50% of
the 6 million HF cases nationwide, and the prevalence relative to heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF) continues to rise at a rate of 1% per year, presenting an imminent need for further research addressing
the pathophysiology of this pervasive disease. The clinical presentation of HFpEF is defined by dyspnea upon
exertion and severe exercise intolerance, symptoms that are likely due, at least in part, to disease-related
changes in the peripheral circulation. While the mechanisms responsible for the loss of peripheral vascular
control in HFpEF have not been established, sympathetic nervous system (SNS) overactivity is likely to play a
key role. In the peripheral circulation, sympathetic vasomotor outflow causes vasoconstriction via activation of
alpha-adrenergic receptors located on the skeletal muscle vasculature, which serves to constrain limb blood
flow, both at rest and during physical activity. In the presence of pathologic elevations in SNS activity,
exaggerated vasoconstriction may therefore result in insufficient delivery of blood to the exercising muscle,
resulting in exercise intolerance and premature neuromuscular fatigue. As the regulation and functional
consequences of excess sympathoexcitation on vascular control have not been examined in patients with
HFpEF, this proposal seeks to address a significant knowledge gap in our understanding of HFpEF
pathophysiology. Specific Aim 1 is designed to evaluate disease-related changes in the arterial baroreflex,
which is a key regulator of SNS activity. It is hypothesized that that both cardiovagal and sympathetic baroreflex
sensitivity will be reduced, at rest and during exercise, in patients with HFpEF compared to healthy controls.
Both cardiopulmonary and carotid baroreflex responses will be assessed to delineate the impact of HFpEF on
overall arterial baroreflex function. Specific Aim 2 focuses on the transduction of sympathetic outflow in the
peripheral circulation, with the hypothesis that changes in arterial blood pressure and vascular conductance in
response to bursts of SNS activity will be exaggerated in patients with HFpEF. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate the
functional consequences of SNS overactivity at the end organ, utilizing pharmacologic inhibition of alpha-
adrenergic receptors via intra-arterial Phentolamine infusion to block expression of SNS activity. For this Aim, it
is hypothesized that regional alpha adrenergic receptor antagonism will normalize resting and exercising muscle
blood flow, and subsequently improve exercise tolerance and neuromuscular fatigue resistance, in patients with
HFpEF. Upon completion, findings from the proposed work hold the promise of offering new mechanistic insight
regarding HFpEF pathophysiology that may provide a pathway to improved clinical care and, ultimately, better
prognosis in this patient group."
10798160,"PROJECT SUMMARY
DNA replication stress is one of the mechanistic underpinnings of many genotoxic chemotherapies which cause
replication fork stalling. Stalled forks frequently reverse to form four-way junction structures, as a natural coping
mechanism, to allow repair of the DNA lesions ahead of the forks and avoid catastrophic fork collapse. However,
fork reversal is a double-edged sword because the nascent DNA in the reversed arm is susceptible to excessive
nuclease resection if not securely protected which can lead to severe genome instability. Many factors play tug-
of-war at stalled forks to strengthen or weaken their stability, and their balance in the cell determines the fate of
replication forks during stress and cellular outcome upon chemotherapy treatments. In this study, we investigate
the molecular mechanisms of a novel replication fork regulator named profilin-1 (Pfn1). As a well-known actin-
binding protein, Pfn1 plays an essential role in actin polymerization and dynamics. Paradoxically, it also has well-
documented but poorly understood anticancer activities including the ability to sensitize cancer cells to
chemotherapy treatments. In recently published work, we demonstrated for the first time that the anticancer
effects of Pfn1 stem, at least partially, from its nuclear functions that are spatially and mechanistically distinct
from its cytoplasmic function in actin regulation. We showed that nuclear Pfn1 directly interacts with ENL in the
Super Elongation Complex (SEC) and inhibits the ability of SEC to drive transcriptional elongation of various
cancer genes including MYC. We also presented clinical evidence that nuclear Pfn1 level is frequently decreased
in cancer due to the upregulation of its nuclear exporter exportin-6 (XPO6), whose deletion increases nuclear
Pfn1 level and decreases tumor growth. These findings establish the notion that Pfn1 has fundamentally
important and cancer-relevant functions in the nucleus, and set the stage for further discovery of its involvement
in additional nuclear processes. In this grant, we present novel evidence that nuclear Pfn1 promotes normal DNA
replication but causes fork destabilization during stress and increases cellular sensitivity to replication stress-
inducing chemotherapies including PARP inhibitors. We hypothesize that nuclear Pfn1 has context-dependent
effects on DNA replication forks. Under normal conditions, it promotes fork progression by increasing chromatin
relaxation through SNF2H. Under stressed conditions, it promotes fork reversal by stimulating SNF2H and
increases fork resection by suppressing BOD1L, leading to fork destabilization. Aim 1: Determine the effect of
nuclear Pfn1 on BOD1L-dependent replication fork protection. Aim 2: Define the role of Pfn1/SNF2H axis in
replication fork remodeling and stability. Aim 3: Understand the chemotherapy-sensitizing ability of nuclear Pfn1.
Work proposed in this grant has the potential to generate important mechanistic insights and proof-of-concept
therapeutic data rationalizing further investigation of nuclear Pfn1 as a synthetic lethal target for genotoxic
chemotherapies."

This proposal describes the 5-year training program for development of a research career in vascular biology,
with focus on thrombosis. The candidate, Dr. Andrea Obi, has the long-term goals of becoming an independently
funded surgeon-scientist, advancing understanding of immunothrombosis and reducing the morbidity from deep
venous thrombosis (DVT). Dr. Obi has a strong foundation with advanced undergraduate education in
Microbiology and Immunology, training in microsurgical venous thrombosis models during a T32 post-doctoral
fellowship, and completion of a clinical fellowship in Vascular Surgery. A talented and experienced mentorship
team provides a detailed plan of skill and scientific knowledge acquisition, and longitudinal professional
development to ensure her success in developing an independent research program at the intersection of innate
immunity and thrombosis.
Dr. Obi's immediate goal is to leverage the K08 protected time and mentorship to develop expertise in advanced
immunologic experimental techniques, solidify her scientific skill set in investigating epigenetic modifications,
and to advance her knowledge in myeloid cellular signaling pathways, that will aid in developing immune based
non-anticoagulant therapies for the treatment of DVT. Clinically, the presence of persistent residual venous
thrombi following an episode of DVT is associated with valvular dysfunction, recurrent thrombosis and post
thrombotic syndrome. Experimentally, innate immune cells, primarily monocytes/macrophages, play a central
role in resolving the thrombus. In a translational mouse model we demonstrate that TLR4 is an essential mediator
of thrombus resolution. Within the enclosed proposal we plan to address a major gap in clinic care, namely a
lack of non-anticoagulant molecular targets for thrombus resolution, by evaluating the central hypothesis that
that myeloid TLR4-mediated thrombus resolution is mechanistically driven by epigenetic changes that occur in
bone marrow derived monocytes in response to acute venous thrombosis and determines the subsequent local
cytokine and fibrinolytic response. This will be accomplished via three specific aims: (1) to examine the ligands,
kinetics and cellular source of TLR4 and requirement for myeloid TLR4 signaling during thrombus resolution; (2)
to examine the role of chromatic modifying enzyme MLL1 on postthrombotic TLR4 expression and molecular
mediators of thrombus resolution; (3) to determine the feasibility of myeloid specific TLR4 agonism as a strategy
to accelerate thrombus resolution and assess impact on vein wall injury."

This K23 application proposes a focused training and research plan to support the applicant’s career growth into an independent physician-scientist. The proposed plan will ensure the applicant develops expertise in patient-tailored adaptive treatment strategies (ATS) that deliver personalized care to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, including Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (UC). CONTEXT: Acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is a life-threatening presentation of UC requiring prompt treatment. Thirty percent of patients with UC will require hospitalization for ASUC during their lifetime. First-line therapy for ASUC, intravenous (IV) corticosteroids, has remained unchanged since the 1950s, despite evidence that up to 30% of patients fail treatment and require emergent colectomy. Cyclosporine and infliximab rescue therapies are effective in treating patients who fail to respond to IV corticosteroids, yet up to 60% of steroid-refractory patients will fail to respond to these rescue therapies as well. A combination of factors, including substantial patient heterogeneity in treatment response and dynamic day-to-day changes in clinical course, have limited our ability to develop effective personalized treatment pathways. There is a critical need to improve the current one-size-fits-all approach to provide more efficacious and safer treatment for ASUC. In this proposal, we hypothesize that ATS, which use prespecified sequential treatment decisions to guide stepwise management changes according to well-defined baseline and longitudinal clinical and laboratory thresholds (tailoring variables) specific to a patient, will reduce the rate of colectomy by guiding clinicians on the type, intensity, and timing of therapy that is most likely to be effective at each stage of treatment. RESEARCH STRATEGY: The objectives of this proposal are to: identify baseline patient characteristics predictive of ASUC treatment response (Aim 1), develop a time-specific risk model to identify pharmacologic treatment failure using tailoring variables to guide treatment decisions (Aim 2), and develop and optimize ATS personalized to patients’ evolving health needs throughout their ASUC hospitalization. We will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of our ATS using a pilot sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) (Aim 3). SMARTs, a trial design that sequentially randomizes participants multiple times to one of several interventions at selected time points, have been used successfully to develop, optimize, and test ATS. TRAINING PLAN: To facilitate achievement of the applicant’s long-term career goal – to become an independent physician-scientist and expert in ATS development and optimization – this award will allow the applicant to develop a deeper understanding of the components, principles for optimization, and trial designs that inform the construction of personalized ATS. This will be aided by a deeper understanding of predictive modeling and longitudinal data analysis using machine learning. These objectives will be accomplished through close mentorship from experts in these areas, selected didactic activities, conference attendance, applied research, and grant proposal preparation."

 Nickel compounds are well-established human carcinogens. Epidemiological studies have reported an
increased incidence of lung and nasal cancer following long-term exposure to nickel compounds due to either
environmental or occupational exposure. Growing evidence indicates that alterations of the epigenetic
landscape, including DNA methylation and histone modification, are important mechanisms in nickel-induced
lung carcinogenesis. However, the impact of nickel exposure on the epitranscriptome and the potential role of
RNA modification in nickel carcinogenesis have never been explored. Our preliminary studies discovered that
human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to nickel compounds exhibited reduced mRNA stability of maternally
expressed gene 3 (MEG3), an imprinted gene that was downregulated in many types of tumors and a strong
driver for nickel-induced malignant transformation. In addition, nickel upregulated m6A demethylase ALKBH5
mRNA and protein expression that coincided with MEG3 RNA destabilization, suggesting ALKBH5 may
contribute to cell transformation via modulating global- or gene-specific m6A abundance. Moreover, knockdown
of ALKBH5 completely abolished MEG3 degradation in nickel-exposed cells, suggesting that RNA methylation
may play a role in protecting MEG3 stability. However, it is not clear how nickel upregulates ALKBH5 as well as
whether increased ALKBH5 mediates nickel-induced cell transformation. Additionally, how m6A abundance
modulates MEG3 RNA stability remains largely unknown. Therefore, in this application, two specific aims were
proposed to address the key events in nickel-induced MEG3 destabilization. The first aim will address whether
increased ALKBH5 is sufficient to induce malignant transformation in vitro. The second aim will target the
potential upstream regulators and downstream effectors that mediate nickel-induced ALKBH5 expression and
MEG3 destabilization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal to tackle the impact of environmental
nickel exposure on the changes of m6A enzymes as well as transcriptome-wide or gene-specific m6A
methylation profiles. Success of this proposal will facilitate our understanding of how nickel targets RNA
modification enzymes or RNA binding proteins to initiate or promote lung tumor formation, and further identify
new aspects of m6A enzymes as a prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets to improve clinical outcomes of
lung cancer patients."
10792873,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Programming of self-antigen specific CD4+ Tregs in the thymus is essential for suppression of aberrant
immune responses and prevention of autoimmunity. Tregs also control inflammation during viral infection and
following pathogen clearance. This is particularly relevant for some types of viral infections such as the 1918
influenza pandemic strain, and more recently, specific strains of coronaviruses, where the immune response
itself can be pathogenic. In addition to viral infections, high levels of type I IFN are a defining feature of some
autoimmune diseases, such as SLE or Sjögren’s syndrome; Tregs reduce the symptoms of such autoimmune
diseases as well. However, we know relatively little about the Tregs involved in either of the above processes.
For example, what types of Tregs are involved in these responses? Do Tregs that dampen anti-viral immune
responses or suppress SLE-like disease develop in the thymus? If so, what is the thymic niche that controls
differentiation of this Treg subset? What APCs/stromal cells are required for differentiation of this Treg subset?
What specific functional roles does this Treg subset play during viral infections or SLE? Our preliminary data
demonstrate that a unique subset of Tregs develops in the thymus characterized by a strong
interferon-stimulated gene-signature (ISG-Tregs). We propose that this ISG-Treg subset plays a key
role in governing antiviral immune responses and suppressing immune responses to autoimmune
diseases characterized by high levels of IFN. We will explore this hypothesis in two specific aims. In aim 1,
we will determine how IFN signaling in the thymus affects thymic selection and the development of ISG-Tregs.
In aim 2, we will determine the functions of ISG-Tregs in response to viral infections and systemic lupus
erythematosis. Successful completion of these aims will allow us to identify the mechanism by which ISG-
Tregs arise in the thymus, and determine the role of ISG-Tregs in immune responses to viruses, and in
autoimmune diseases associated with high levels of IFN, such as SLE or Sjögren’s syndrome."

Cell division is a complex and specifically orchestrated set of events that culminates in the equal segregation of
sister chromatids into two cells. It relies on a multitude of protein complexes, protein-protein interactions, and
regulatory mechanisms driven by the activities of posttranslational modification enzymes. Misregulation of cell
division can lead to unrestricted or defective cell divisions that can promote chromosomal instability and
aneuploidy, which are associated with many types of cancers. Through proteomic and genetic screens we
have uncovered novel proteins that are critical to the fidelity of cell division. We have applied multidisciplinary
approaches that utilize cell biology, molecular biology, computational biology and biochemistry to analyze the
function of these proteins. These approaches have allowed us to define the function of many new proteins with
critical roles in key cell division events including centrosome homeostasis, mitotic microtubule spindle
assembly, spindle assembly checkpoint function and cytokinesis. Furthermore, we have applied chemical
biology approaches to define novel cell division inhibitors and their mechanisms of action, which we have used
as molecular probes for dissecting the mechansims of cell division and for the development of cancer
therapeutics. In this proposal, we propose to advance our understanding of the repertoire of proteins and their
mechanisms that are important to cell division. This will include functional analysis of novel and poorly-
characterized microtubule-associated proteins involved in centrosome homeostasis and mitotic spindle
assembly, and novel components that contribute to the fidelity of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Overall, the
proposed research studies will increase our understanding of the repertoire of cell division enzymes, their
function whithin critical cell division events, how they are regulated, and how they coordinate with each other to
ensure proper cell division. These studies will also advance our understanding of the cell division mechanisms
that are dysregulated in human developmental and proliferative diseases."

Gut microbes are associated with disorders of behavior, including those related to food intake and appetite.
Obesity and hyperphagia can be transferred from donor to germ-free recipient mice, simply by microbial
transplants. However, the correlative effects seen in mice have yet to be translated to the clinic. There is a
critical need to determine how microbial signals alter host behaviors. Specifically, it is unknown how a
microbial stimulus arising in the GI lumen is converted into a neural signal reinforces behavior. This gap in our
knowledge is a significant problem because knowing how microbial ligands and GI sensory function interact
will allow for rational design of gut-based therapies to treat disorders of food intake and promote emotional
well-being.
Our laboratory recently discovered a neural circuit linking the gut lumen with the brain stem in one synapse.
Formed between neuropod cells and vagal neurons, this neural circuit transduces luminal stimuli to the brain in
milliseconds (Kaelberer et al., 2018). Moreover, in the proximal small intestine where nutrients are abundant,
this neural circuit is necessary for an animal to distinguish sugar from sweeteners (Buchanan et al., 2020). On
this basis, our hypothesis is that colonic neuropod cells synapse with vagal neurons to communicate reward
from bacterial stimuli. The objectives for this proposal are to define if colonic neuropod cells sense bacterial
ligands, transduce bacterial signals onto vagal neurons, and modulate reward behavior.
Our rationale is that by elucidating the mechanisms of bacterial sensory transduction from gut to brain, gut
microbial therapeutics could be developed to treat disorders of food intake linked to diet and gut microbes."

The fibers of the ciliary zonule suspend the lens on the optical axis and transmit the forces that flatten it during
disaccommodation. Mutations in genes encoding zonular proteins underlie syndromic and non-syndromic
conditions that affect the eye profoundly. Common ocular phenotypes include ectopia lentis (lens dislocation),
cataract, axial elongation, myopia, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. The molecular composition of the zonule
was recently elucidated, but the mechanism by which mutations in zonular components culminate in structural
failure of the fibers is unknown. In Aim 1, therefore, three zonulopathies (Marfan Syndrome, Weill-Marchesani
Syndrome, and Isolated Ectopia Lentis) will be modeled in mice. Utilizing recently developed imaging and
material testing techniques, we will examine how, in each case, the structure and viscoelastic properties of the
mouse zonule are affected by the presence of the mutant protein (or absence of the wild-type protein). We
hypothesize that the initial pressurization of the eye is a critical step in zonule development. In Aim 2, this
notion will be tested by measuring the rise in intraocular pressure in postnatal mice and determining whether
pressurization of the developing eye in vitro causes precocious deployment of zonular fibers. Preliminary
studies identified the cross-linking enzyme lysyl oxidase-like-1 (LOXL1) as an abundant component of the
zonule proteome. In Aim 3, we propose that LOXL1-derived cross-links have a critical role in strengthening the
zonule. We will test that hypothesis in a knockout mouse model. Finally, microspherophakia (i.e., the presence
of a smaller and more spherical lens) is observed in Weill-Marchesani patients (who harbor mutations in
LTBP2 or FBN1, zonular proteins that contribute to the tensile properties of the fibers). We hypothesize that
forces exerted by the zonular fibers on the lens surface influence lens growth. In Aim 4, we will elucidate the
three dimensional structure of the human zonule and correlate the distribution of proliferating lens epithelial
cells with the strain fields established around zonular attachment points."

Blood hemoglobin (Hgb) testing is a common clinical laboratory test during routine patient care and screening.
In particular, blood Hgb tests are essential for the diagnosis and management of anemia. Globally, over 40% of
pregnant women are anemic, adversely affecting maternal and fetal health outcomes through increased
morbidity and mortality. A range of treatments for anemia are well-established and readily available even in
low- and middle-income countries. In these settings, the main challenge is that anemia is not detected or
detected too late. For pregnant women in resource-limited settings who require several Hgb tests during all
trimesters, conventional invasive blood Hgb tests are not only painful and iatrogenic, but are also expensive
and often inaccessible. Existing noninvasive devices and smartphone-based technologies for measuring blood
Hgb levels often rely on costly specialized equipment and complex smartphone attachments, thus hampering
practical translation from research to clinical practice in resource-limited settings. Based on the preliminary
results generated by our transdisciplinary team, we hypothesize that blood Hgb levels can be accurately and
precisely predicted from a red-green-blue (RGB) image of the inner eyelid (palpebral conjunctiva) acquired
using a smartphone camera with no additional attachments, and that this mobile health (mHealth) application
can be fully integrated with an existing electronic health record (EHR) system in low-resource settings.
Specifically, an informed learning approach will enable us to incorporate a physical or biological understanding
into the learning algorithms to overcome the limitations of purely data-driven machine learning. Our team,
consisting of experts in optical spectroscopy and machine learning, biomedical informatics and implementation
science, and maternal and public health, proposes three aims to achieve the project goals. In Aim 1, we will
develop a robust, simple, frontend data acquisition method for various mHealth and digital health settings. A
tissue-specific color gamut design and true color recovery will provide the first-of-its-kind systematic
methodology to realize color accuracy that will be highly sensitive to blood Hgb. In Aim 2, we will perfect the
core mHealth computational algorithm using clinical data of black African pregnant women. Sub-algorithms of
automated inner eyelid demarcation, advanced spectral learning, and blood Hgb content computation will
enable fully automated, highly accurate, and precise blood Hgb estimations. Tissue optics-informed spectral
learning will capture strong nonlinearity between RGB values and spectral intensity directly in the spectral
domain. In Aim 3, we will integrate mHealth blood Hgb technology with a widely used EHR and evaluate the
backend performance. The proposed connected mHealth technology will demonstrate the possibility of offering
mobility, simplicity, and affordability for rapid and scalable adaptation, maximizing the currently available
resources in resource-limited settings. Our work can also provide reciprocal innovation to offer advanced
mHealth and digital health technologies combined with telemedicine in rural and at-home settings in the US."

 In this proposal, we make use of optogenetic and chemogenetic tools, in vivo calcium
imaging, RNA-seq, viral-based circuit tracing, and genetic targeting techniques to dissect the
neural circuits that control sleep behavior in the mammalian brain. At a fundamental level, the
work presented in this research proposal may provide valuable information for developing
new treatments for various human sleep disorders, such as insomnia.
 Decades of studies have revealed neuromodulatory circuits as key regulators of sleep and
wakefulness. However, most of these studies focus on the arousal system. Sleep-promoting
neurons are theoretically required for the initiation and maintenance of sleep states based on
the flip-flop model of wake-sleep switching, in which sleep-promoting neurons are mutually
inhibitory with wake-promoting neurons. Previous studies have identified several brain
structures that promote non-rapid eye movement (or NREM) sleep, but whether these
structures are involved in the initiation or the maintenance remains largely unknown. In this
research project, we will primarily focus on neural control of sleep initiation, i.e. the transition
from wakefulness to sleep – under physiological conditions, always to NREM sleep. We
aim to decipher the circuit mechanisms underlying the wake-sleep transition.
 In pilot studies, we have identified a novel population of glutamatergic neurons in
the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) that project to the preoptic area (POA), a prominent sleep
center. We present preliminary data showing that these VLM neurons are activated during
wake-sleep transitions and optogenetic activation of these neurons induces long-lasting
NREM sleep in awake mice. These results lead to our working hypothesis: VLM
glutamatergic neurons induce the transition from wakefulness to NREM sleep, which
subsequently activate their downstream targets to maintain NREM sleep. In Aim 1, we will
activate and inactivate VLM glutamatergic neurons and examine the sufficiency and necessity
of their activity in the wake-sleep transition. In Aim2, we will perform microendoscopic calcium
imaging in VLM glutamatergic neurons and examine their activity during sleep. Then, we will
use single-cell RNA-seq to identify genetic markers of sleep-active VLM glutamatergic
neurons for further in vivo experiments. In Aim 3, we will use viral-based circuit tracing to
characterize the inputs and outputs of VLM neurons and examine their function in sleep
regulation. Together, the results obtained from this proposal will expand our understanding of
the neural basis of sleep behavior."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the 9th most common cancer globally. Studies have shown
that tumor-induced suppression of the host immune system is critical to HNSCC progression and metastasis.
Tumor secreted factors directly influence the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which have
emerged as forefront mediators of cancer immune suppression. MDSC not only promote tumor growth by
suppressing T cells within the tumor, but also facilitate metastasis by enhancing angiogenesis and pre-metastatic
niche formation. The presence of expanded MDSC peripherally and within the tumor microenvironment has been
associated with worse prognosis with definitive treatment and less response to anti-PD1 immune checkpoint
therapy in HNSCC. Moreover, RT itself has been shown to increase MDSC level systemically. Therefore,
investigating factors that facilitate MDSC expansion, recruitment and function is integral to developing novel
therapies. We have previously shown that Galectin-1 (Gal-1) is induced by hypoxia and/or RT in HNSCC and its
elevated expression in the tumor stroma correlated with poor prognosis. We have data indicating that Gal-1
expressing tumors harbor high levels of local and systemic MDSC, and that Gal-1 blockade (genetically or with
antibodies) substantially reduced the number of MDSC throughout, independent of its effect on T cells. Moreover,
Gal-1 blockade led to fewer metastases and less MDSC recruitment to metastatic sites. Despite extensive
literature supporting Gal-1’s effect on T cells, very few studies have evaluated its relationship with MDSC. Based
on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that tumor secreted Gal-1 can directly affect MDSC recruitment to the
primary tumor while simultaneously promote metastases through MDSC driven pre-metastatic niche formation.
In addition, RT-induction of Gal-1 secretion may lead to higher systemic MDSC noted in patients receiving RT.
Therefore, Gal-1 blockade can decrease both local and systemic MDSC burden and enhance tumor response
to both RT and immune check point therapy. We will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims: (1) To
determine whether Gal-1 mediates the effect of RT on increasing MDSC level in the tumor and systemwide in
HNSCC; (2) To discern the host versus tumor cell dependent factors mediating Gal-1’s induction of MDSC
expansion systemwide and recruitment to the tumor microenvironment; (3) To determine whether MDSC mediate
Gal-1’s effect on metastases and whether CXCR2 blockade decrease distant metastasis in Gal-1+ HNSCC, and
(4) To determine whether CXCR2 inhibition is as effective as Gal-1 blockade when combined with RT and PD1
antibody in HNSCC and to characterize the immune cells involved in these treatments. While optimal Gal-1
targeting is being developed, clinical grade CXCR2 inhibitors exist and are being tested in trials for both cancer
and non-cancer conditions. Our studies, if successful, will provide rationales for integrating CXCR2 inhibitor with
RT and anti-PD1 therapy in Gal-1 overexpressing HNSCC."

10905985,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human Noroviruses (hNoV), which belong to the Caliciviridae family, are the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis
and food-borne disease worldwide. Each year in the United States alone, hNoV is responsible for greater than
21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis, leading to an estimated 71,000 hospitalizations per year. While most
cases resolve within a week, immunocompromised patients, children, and the elderly have an elevated risk of
long-term and even fatal infections. Currently, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines approved for the prevention
or treatment of chronic hNoV infections. The main goal of this project is to harness the medical benefits that are
offered by the inhibition of viral enzymes, including the hNoV protease. The overall objective of this proposal is
to design and develop a protease inhibitor for the treatment of hNoV infections. The hNoV NS6 protease has
become an attractive drug target due to its essential role in the viral replication cycle. The central hypothesis is
that small-molecule inhibitors targeting the viral protease will limit or eliminate hNoV infections. The rationale for
the proposed research is based on our preliminary data, specifically compound 1 and its analogs. These
compounds are unique, non-toxic, small peptidomimetic molecules that inhibit NoV replication selectively in
culture at 20 nM EC50 by interacting with the hNoV protease. Pharmacological manipulation of the hNoV protease
is expected to result in new and innovative approaches to the prevention and treatment of NoV infections. Guided
by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: Aim 1) To optimize and
discover and develop broad-spectrum oral NoV PIs by multiparameter optimization and molecular modeling
approaches of lead compounds from our proprietary library. Aim 2) To perform mechanism of action (MOA) and
resistance studies of the lead NoV PIs. Aim 3) To evaluate the lead NoV PIs in an immunocompromised mouse
model. Under the first aim, about 25 compounds will be designed, synthesized, and tested per year. Under the
second aim, enzyme kinetic, crystallographic, host protease inhibition, inhibition of NoV protease production,
and drug resistance studies will be performed with the lead compounds. Under the third aim, anti-NoV efficacy
studies will be performed in an immunodeficient mouse model. This approach is innovative because we
developed a research plan taking full advantage of five recent advances: (1) producing hNoV PR recombinant
proteins in milligram amounts; (2) solving the crystal structure of the NoV GII.4 PR - the main drug target; (3) a
cell-based hNoV replicon assay; (4) 3D human intestinal enteroid model, and (5) an immunocompromised mouse
disease model to study human NoV infection. The proposed research is significant because in-depth pre-clinical
studies and characterization of these new peptidomimetics could lead to the approval of the first safe and
effective drugs for the treatment of chronic hNoV infections which cause significant morbidity and mortality in
immunocompromised patients."
10819469,"PROJECT SUMMARY/Abstract
Acute pancreatitis (AP) accounts for over 300,000 admissions in the U.S. with annual costs exceeding $3
billion. Most cases of AP are mild (MAP) with a hospital stay of 3-4 days, but approximately 15% of AP
subjects develop severe disease (SAP), defined by presence of persistent organ failure. Up to a third of SAP
patients expire from multi-system organ failure after weeks in the intensive care unit. To date, no therapeutic
agents have been successful at ameliorating the protracted hospital course of SAP. The National Institute of
Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases workshops identified two critical knowledge gaps as barriers to
developing pharmacologic interventions: 1) the establishment of a highly accurate, early prediction tool to
identify which subjects will develop SAP during hospitalization; 2) a more in-depth knowledge of SAP
mechanistic pathways and immuno-pathogenesis to identify novel therapeutic targets.
We propose the MoSAIC Study (iMmune SIgnAtures and ClIniCal outcomes in AP), a prospective multi-
center, observational cohort that will address both of these knowledge gaps in SAP. We recently discovered
a novel multi-cytokine panel (angiopoetin-2, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-8, resistin, and tumor
necrosis factor-α receptor-1) that accurately predicts SAP early in the disease process with an accuracy of
0.89 and significantly outperforms existing prediction tools. Aim 1 of this project is to validate the multi-cytokine
panel in a large, ethnically diverse AP population across multiple U.S. clinical sites.
In preliminary studies, immunologists at the Benaroya Research Institute (BRI) have identified unique immune
cell changes such as an increase in monocytes and a decrease of T follicular helper and memory B cells in
blood samples of AP patients compared to healthy controls. In Aim 2, the MoSAIC study will extend this work
by defining the circulating immune cells that correspond with cytokine signatures in early AP and identifying the
immune pathways driving the development of SAP. This will generate the first high-dimensional phenotypic
analysis of immune cell types in human AP and provide new insights into its immune mechanisms.
MoSAIC investigators have NIH-funded complementary expertise in pancreatitis and immunology. The
team is led by well-published pancreatologists at the Ohio State University and immunologists at BRI,
supported by a dedicated bioinformatics core at BRI. It also includes three additional academic medical centers
with proven track-records of enrolling ethnically diverse populations into prospective AP research trials.
Successful completion of the MoSAIC study will have the following impact by: 1) establishing an
accurate, early prediction tool for SAP, 2) providing groundbreaking insight into the early immune events of
SAP based on robust human data, 3) identifying therapeutic immune targets for further testing, and 4)
establishing a U.S. multicenter research platform for launching clinical trials to test immunotherapies in AP."
10809766,"How muscle contracts has been a long-standing question. Despite major advances in this area, how
muscle relaxes is still not fully understood. Contraction occurs by the sliding of myosin-containing thick past
actin-containing thin filaments, powered by myosin heads, motors that produce sliding force, fueled by ATP.
Relaxation occurs when thin filaments are switched off so heads cannot bind to produce force, leaving the idling
heads to organize themselves helically in the thick filament. What is currently known about the role of thick
filaments in relaxation? On the structural side, low-resolution models of cardiac (mouse, human) and skeletal
(tarantula) thick filaments have been achieved, but their atomic structure remains unsolved. On the energetics
side, the energy consumption of relaxed skeletal muscle revealed a surprising phenomenon, so-called super-
relaxation (SRX) that greatly reduces ATP consumption. A widely accepted view associates this ubiquitous and
fundamental energy-saving state with the unique way myosin’s two heads fold together in the relaxed tarantula
filament—the so-called interacting-heads motif (IHM), found across the animal kingdom, which structurally
inhibits both heads, switching off their activity. Regardless of its appeal, this SRX=IHM hypothesis has not been
proved, and recent ATP turnover results suggest, instead, association of SRX with a specific myosin head
conformation. Elucidating this puzzle is crucial to understanding how muscle relaxes, how it malfunctions in
disease and how therapeutic drug treatments work. The solution requires determination by cryo-EM of the atomic
structures of the thick filament and myosin molecules from muscle. Here, we propose to determine the structures
of skeletal myosin molecules and filaments, far less studied than cardiac. This will allow us to dissect how key
IHM interactions constrain activity of the two heads, shutting them off, thus conserving ATP in relaxation. We will
use single particle EM and cryo-EM to define the structural basis of the SRX state at near-atomic level in thick
filaments and myosin molecules from rabbit skeletal muscle. By comparing with tarantula, which shows tenfold-
greater energy-saving (hyper-relaxation, HRX), we will gain deeper insight into the mechanism of ATPase
inhibition. And we will use EM and X-ray diffraction to investigate how therapeutic drugs alter the IHM.
Aim 1 will define the structural basis of SRX in skeletal thick filaments by revealing their near-atomic
cryo-EM structures. Aim 2 will define the structural basis of SRX in skeletal myosin heads and heavy meromyosin
molecules by assessing: (A) if SRX results from a specific head conformation, and (B) if the IHM correlates with
the SRX state. Aim 3 will reveal the structural impact of drugs on skeletal thick filaments and myosin molecules.
 Despite the vital role of SRX in skeletal muscle relaxation, its structural basis and relation to the IHM and
to other thick filament proteins (MyBP-C, titin) remains unknown. Our studies will reveal the IHM structure in
skeletal thick filaments and myosin molecules, clarify its association with the SRX state and with MyBP-C and
titin, and provide critical insights into the molecular basis of relaxation and the influence of therapeutic drugs."
10756510,"Summary
Our previous studies have revealed a complex organization of receptive fields (RFs) of neurons in primary
somatosensory cortex of monkeys (area 3b). The neurons have small excitatory centers that create the
somatotopic map of the hand, a suppressive surround that includes all of the rest of the glabrous hand, and a
weaker suppressive surround that includes all of the skin on the other hand (the “extra hand” surround). We
propose to determine if neurons in different layers have similar or different surrounds, what surround features
are relayed from the thalamus to area 3b neurons, and the connections that mediate different parts of the
surround by inactivating cortical areas that directly or indirectly provide feedback to area 3b hand neurons. In
addition, we will determine how a major loss of sensory inputs from the hand, due to selective spinal cord
lesions, alters the center-surround relationships of neurons in the deprived and non-deprived 3b hand cortex,
even after extensive post lesion recovery of 3b reactivation and hand use. The expected results will greatly
expand our understanding of how tactile information from the hands is processed in the somatosensory
system, and how processing is impaired and recovered following sensory loss. These results will have a clear
impact on therapeutic intervention following spinal cord injury."

By the year 2030, the number of U.S. women with an endometrial cancer history is expected to exceed 1
million. The care needs of older endometrial survivors include not only regular follow-up visits for detection of
cancer recurrence, but also the prevention and management of other non-cancer medical conditions.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) may be of especially critical concern, given the role of obesity as a shared risk
factor for both endometrial cancer and CVD. Care for non-cancer conditions, as well as general preventive
care and management of side effects of cancer treatment, is likely to require the involvement of primary care
physicians or other specialists, in addition to the gynecologists and/or gynecologic oncologists who may
perform the recommended follow-up exams for detection of endometrial cancer recurrence, but may not have
the expertise to manage other medical conditions. The resulting complexity of healthcare needs for
endometrial cancer survivors may lead to fragmentation of care, suboptimal care quality, and, ultimately,
poorer health outcomes. Strategies to improve surveillance and management of CVD and other chronic
conditions during survivorship, while also ensuring that women receive the recommended follow-up visits
specific to their cancer history, are needed to support the complex health needs of endometrial cancer
survivors.
Care coordination refers to efforts to organize patient care activities between two or more providers involved in
the patient’s care to facilitate the appropriate delivery of health care services. Measures of care coordination,
which model shared patient networks by connecting physicians with common patients, have been developed
using administrative claims data, and have been validated as a means of accurately representing provider
communication patterns. We propose to utilize the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-
Medicare linked data resource to examine associations between claims-based measures of care coordination
and long-term health outcomes after endometrial cancer. Specifically, we will assess whether higher degrees
of care coordination during years 1-3 after endometrial cancer diagnosis are predictive of greater adherence to
guideline-recommended follow-up for detection of endometrial cancer recurrence, lower risk of CVD
diagnoses, lower risk of hospitalizations and emergency department visits, and higher overall survival. This
research will inform the development of targeted interventions that seek to enhance the delivery of endometrial
cancer survivorship care and improve patient outcomes."
10749046,"Project summary / Abstract
Intraocular cancers are optimally treated with eye plaque brachytherapy (EPB), involving surgical implantation
of a carrier (“plaque”) loaded with radioactive sources (called seeds) on the scleral surface over the tumor base.
While it is critical to ensure the strength and exact positions of the radioactive seeds for accurate treatment,
current quality assurance (QA) practice according to the AAPM Task Group (TG) report 129 only dictates the
plaque assembly be visually inspected due to the lack of an effective and practical technique to measure the
seed radioactivity distribution. Clinically, this often limits treatments to using uniform seed intensity, otherwise
we have to assume the correct loading without verification. This is especially suboptimal for plaques preloaded
by the vendor, as seeds with different activities cannot be distinguished visually. Therefore, unlike the common
practice of employing intensity modulation in external beam radiation therapy, we cannot further optimize
treatment by using differential seed strengths to provide more personalized dosing based on the tumor itself and
the location of normal organs. To overcome this fundamental issue hindering EPB advancement and solve the
problems of previous EPB QA designs, our goal is to develop a fast, accurate, and low-cost QA system to allow
safe integration of differentially loaded EPB. We constructed a proof-of-concept system consisting of a flat
scintillator sheet and a lens/camera system mounted together, aiming to quantitatively measure the discrepancy
in radioactivity/dose distribution of the plaque assembly from the originally planned distribution through the
gamma evaluation commonly used for the QA of intensity modulated radiotherapy. The radioluminescence
signal generated by a loaded plaque near the scintillator will be collected by the camera and processed in real-
time to verify correct loading of the seeds. The measurement and analysis only require a few minutes,
significantly shorter than the time to assay the extra verification seeds the physicist already must perform as
recommended by TG129. Our preliminary data are promising, while we hypothesize that the performance can
be improved by using a hemispherical scintillator conformal the plaque inner surface to enhance the system
sensitivity and identify each individual seed in the plaque. Our initial Monte Carlo (MC) simulation demonstrated
the feasibility. Specific aims: Design and construct a novel, functional prototype QA system with associated
software enabling us to offer seed loading modulation to patients with ocular tumors, and
commission/evaluate/validate the system through extensive phantom experiments and MC simulation. Study
design: Systematic MC simulations will be performed to optimize the design before building the improved device.
Software tools will be developed to analyze the data and document the measurement results. Extensive
phantom measurements will be performed to compare and tune the MC and optical system models. Factors
affecting the QA uncertainties will be studied. Health relatedness: This proposal aims to address the unmet
need of intensity modulated, personalized EPB delivery based on the lesion shape and critical structure sparing."
10721831,"After traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), significant deterioration of bone tissue is seen in most patients. This
continues throughout life and about 50% of chronic SCI patients will sustain a low-impact or spontaneous fracture
at some point, typically occurring around the knee. Traditionally, the pathogenesis of osteoporosis after SCI has
been focused on mechanical unloading and its effect on bone quantity, but advances in the field of skeletal
biology have revealed the involvement of a much broader array of bone physiology—in particular the critical
roles that the structural, physiological, and chemical properties of bone contribute to bone health. Evaluating the
multi-scale changes that occur in bone tissue components such as the organic matrix and water, which together
occupy approximately 60% of bone by volume, can provide critical information on chronic SCI risks including
osteoporotic fracture, as well as the anemia and immune dysfunction associated with the “acquired bone marrow
failure syndrome.” Unfortunately, such crucial information on bone structure, vascularity, and chemical properties
is all but inaccessible using the standard imaging modalities available in clinics today. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), particularly ultrashort echo time (UTE) techniques, continues to gain interest for the investigation
of numerous structural and physiological properties of bone. The development and application of quantitative
UTE MRI techniques to measure multi-scale features of bone, including macro- and micro-scale structure (UTE),
micro-scale vascularity (UTE double echo steady state [UTE-DESS]), and molecular-scale chemical properties
(UTE acido-chemical exchange saturation transfer [UTE-acidoCEST]), would represent a revolutionary step
forward in the care of SCI patients. The goal of this proposal is to establish a panel of non-invasive MRI
biomarkers tailored for bone quality assessment in SCI and test its effectiveness on a novel chronic SCI rat
model. In the first Aim, cadaveric knee samples from SCI and healthy donors will be used to optimize a panel of
novel, quantitative MRI techniques for fast and accurate volumetric evaluation of bone quality and health. The
first hypothesis is that multi-scale bone quality and health measures can be reliably assessed using the new
techniques. The second hypothesis is that the new biomarkers will be highly correlated with reference standards,
including bone structure, composition, biomechanical properties, vascular density, and pH measures. In the
second Aim, a longitudinal rat model with chronic, complete T8 SCI will be used and investigations will focus on
validating the new MRI biomarker panel to assess bone recovery after induction of functional locomotion through
manipulation of activity level in propriospinal neurons (via Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer
Drugs) with and without sympathetic inhibition. The third hypothesis is that the biomarker panel will be highly
correlated with µCT, histology, and behavioral outcomes, and will accurately detect longitudinal changes in bone
quality associated with chronic complete thoracic SCI. The fourth hypothesis is that alterations in local
sympathetic control of hindlimbs make substantial contributions to bone remodeling and dysfunction, which can
be mitigated with sympathetic inhibition. After the successful completion of this grant, we expect to provide an
optimized MRI panel that is tailored for multi-scale evaluation of bone in SCI, use an animal model to provide
insight into the degree of bone recovery that may be expected with neuromodulation, and be the first to explore
the effects of sympathetic nervous system activity in sublesional bone in vivo."
10758587,"Metastasis causes >90% of cancer death. The persistence and lethality of metastasis is driven by cells capable
of self-renewal, slow cell-cycling, tumor re-initiation, and therapy resistance, termed metastasis stem cells
(MetSCs). Development of effective strategies for eliminating metastasis requires a better understanding of the
mechanisms that MetSCs exploit for survival. We recently demonstrated that (1) disseminating colorectal
cancers (CRC) undergo a dynamic phenotypic switch from an LGR5+ tumor-initiating cancer stem cell (CSC)
state to a distinct LGR5lowL1CAM+ state required for metastasis. (2) This phenotypic plasticity of MetSCs is
retained in ex vivo patient derived organoids, which can be used to dissect mechanisms of plasticity. (3) L1CAM+
MetSCs are functionally distinct from intestinal tumor-initiating LGR5+ CSCs: L1CAM is required for organoid
formation, the regeneration of intestinal epithelium after colitis, and tumor formation after metastatic
dissemination. But unlike LGR5, it is dispensable for epithelial homeostasis or intestinal tumor initiation. In
contrast to tumor initiation, where homeostatic stem cells undergo oncogene-driven hyper proliferation in intact
tissues, metastasis subverts a regenerative mechanism to survive and regrow outside an intact epithelial niche.
(4) We have shown that the principal driver of L1CAM expression is loss of epithelial integrity itself, acting via
loss of E-cadherin intercellular adherens junctions to transiently displace the transcriptional silencer REST/NSRF
from chromatin in quiescent MetSCs, in turn derepressing expression of L1CAM and other genes required for
tissue regeneration1. Proliferation, restoration of epithelial structures, and macrometastatic outgrowth, on the
other hand, require high REST levels. Our evidence suggests that MetSCs cells are regenerative stem cells that
emerge directly in response to loss of epithelial integrity to drive repair, a phenotype of physiological wound
healing that is redeployed in MetSCs. In this proposal, we will define the molecular mechanism by which REST
chromatin binding is dynamically regulated in MetSCs, and how this in turn enables cell fate plasticity from
stemness to proliferation. Our preliminary data implicates the mRNA binding protein ZFP36L1/2 in REST-
mediated metastatic plasticity. Project hypothesis: The ZFP36L1/2REST axis is a master regulator of cell fate
plasticity in intestinal epithelial progenitors. Aim 1: Define the function of the ZFP36L1/2-REST axis in normal
and neoplastic intestinal stem cell self-renewal, differentiation, and proliferation. Aim 2: Dissect the molecular
mechanism of ZFP36L1/2-mediated cell fate plasticity. Aim 3: Determine the functional consequences of
ZFP36L1/2-REST dynamic regulation in metastatic seeding and colonization. Results will define mechanisms of
cancer progression and identify putative therapeutic targets to limit regenerative plasticity, with potential to
impact clinical outcomes."
10754278,"PROJECT SUMMARY
More than 1 million drug overdose deaths have occurred in the US since 1999, while progress in reducing
mortality from cardiovascular disease and diabetes has stalled since 2010. This evidence of rising morbidity
and mortality in midlife has drawn attention to health risks among the working-age population. Increasing
geographic variation in premature mortality, most pronounced during early to mid-adulthood, highlights the role
of place. Research is needed that systematically identifies how place-based features contribute to the US
midlife health and mortality crisis. Drawing from socio-ecological perspectives of health, the present study will
test a comprehensive conceptual framework to examine the direct, indirect, and moderating effects within the
place and health relationship. We will use two unique datasets that allow us to address limitations that have
stymied past efforts. First, the Midlife in the United States study (MIDUS) enrolled 7,108 adults in the
contiguous US aged 25 to 74 in 1995-1996 and surveyed them again in 2004-2006 and in 2013-2014, adding
a sample of 592 Black adults in 2004-2006 who were surveyed again in 2016-2017. Second, the Utah
Population Database (UPDB) includes data from a variety of state vital and administrative records for over 12
million individuals over 100 years, linked by family and containing geocoded residential addresses. From the
UPDB, we will create a sample of 1.6 million adults aged 25 to 74 residing in a four-county urban area in 2000,
for whom mortality is tracked until 2020 with 142,330 deaths recorded. Both datasets enable place-based
longitudinal health research.
In examining the health outcomes of substance misuse, mental health, cardiometabolic health, and mortality,
we will: identify the prospective effects of area-level socioeconomic conditions on individual-level health and
mortality outcomes (Aim 1); and document the prospective effects of place-based built, social, and natural
environments on individual-level health and mortality outcomes (Aim 2). Attention will be given to how
environmental features moderate and mediate prospective effects of area-level socioeconomic conditions, and
to the individual-level mediating processes. We will use innovative methods to measure a range of place-based
features and improve estimation using rigorous statistical methods (e.g., multi-level structural equation
modeling, spatial analysis, and advanced survival analysis). Through this comprehensive investigation, we will
document how place-based factors drive midlife health and mortality disparities and provide valuable insights
into the complex and dynamic relationships within systems of people and places. This holistic research effort
will produce novel evidence to support the development of effective place-based interventions."

 The goal of this proposal is to determine the efficacy of BOLSTER, a multi-component primary palliative
care intervention designed to improve quality of life, mitigate symptoms, and reduce burdensome hospital-
based care for one of the most vulnerable of all populations: patients with complex care needs from advanced
gastrointestinal and gynecologic (GI/GYN) cancers. GI/GYN cancers account for over 30% of US cancer
deaths and cause tremendous suffering. These cancers often spread aggressively through the peritoneum and
invade through pelvic organs, causing bowel obstructions, refractory ascites, ureteral and biliary obstructions,
pelvic fistulas and non-healing wounds. Palliating these devastating complications requires interventions such
as venting gastric tubes, ostomies, and peritoneal catheters—leaving patients and family caregivers to cope
with extremely complex care needs, severe symptoms, frequent complications and rehospitalizations.
 In response to this great need, we developed BOLSTER, a multi-component primary palliative care
intervention that combines 1) a longitudinal relationship among a nurse, patient, and family caregiver with
structured telehealth contacts; 2) a mobile health platform with electronic patient-reported outcomes to assess
symptoms and trigger clinical action between office visits; and 3) tailored patient and caregiver symptom
management and skills training. BOLSTER has proven feasible and acceptable in pilot randomized trial, with
most patients reporting it improved symptoms (70%), helped coping (80%), and recommending it highly (95%).
 Here we propose a multi-center randomized controlled trial of BOLSTER versus usual care (UC) among
400 patients with complex care needs from advanced GI/GYN cancer and their family caregivers. In a lead-in
phase we will adapt all study materials into Spanish, given that Latinos are the largest minority population in
the US. Mirroring real-world care settings, the trial will enroll patient-caregiver dyads who receive their primary
cancer care at two major cancer centers, eight affiliated community oncology practices, and a large safety-net
hospital serving richly diverse populations and a high proportion of Latino patients. Our Specific Aims are to 1)
determine the effects of BOLSTER on patient QOL, as mediated by symptoms, self-efficacy for managing
them, and health care utilization; 2) determine the effects of BOLSTER on caregiver burden, distress, and self-
efficacy; and 3) using
understand
the RE-AIM model, c barriers and facilitators to implementation to
the necessary components for optimal scalability and sustainability
haracterize site-specific
. Our project is innovative in
using bilingual nurses to deliver a telehealth intervention that provides critical skills training, self-management
support, and an mHealth platform to proactively manage symptoms. If efficacious, BOLSTER will be a highly
scalable model, primed for a large, multisite implementation trial."
10729859,"Summary
 During development and throughout adulthood, humans display strong neuroplasticity, the capacity of
adaptive changes of neurons and neural circuits in response to social environments. Plasticity in chemosensory
system is essential for learning and memory, social communication and quality of life. Loss of olfactory sensing
(anosmia) leads to social isolation, neurological diseases, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
Parkinson’s disease (PD), and social disorders such as autism. However, the role of neuroplasticity in olfactory-
mediated social behaviors is unclear and understudied. We and other labs have developed genetic tools in ants,
thereby providing a novel model to study olfactory neuroplasticity in social organisms, as (a) ants are highly social
and display complex social behavior; (b) ants display striking neuroplasticity during development and throughout
adulthood; (c) neuronal activity is likely required for proper development of olfactory neurons in ants, which is
reminiscent of activity-dependent neuronal survival in mammals.
 The Drosophila genome contains 60 odorant receptor (Or) genes, while 300-500 Or genes have been
identified in several ant genomes. In the ant Harpegnathos saltator, mutation in the gene odorant receptor co-
receptor (orco), which disrupts the function of all ORs, significantly impacts ant olfaction, and mutant animals
display a wide range of abnormal social behaviors. Surprisingly, and unlike other insects, such as Drosophila, this
loss of OR functionality during development dramatically reduces the number of odorant receptor neurons (ORNs)
and antennal lobe (AL) glomeruli where ORNs project. Further transcriptome analysis suggests that there are two
types of ORNs: activity-dependent and activity-independent ORNs. We will use these features in the orco-/- ants
and perform a series of molecular and cellular experiments to determine (a) the role of neuronal activity and
receptor trafficking in olfactory neuronal survival, and (b) the role of gustatory and ionotropic receptors in neural
development."
10766776,"Multimorbidity, defined as the co-occurrence of two or more medical conditions, impacts two-thirds of older
individuals over 65 – corresponding to 36 million U.S. adults, and is a major driver of healthcare spending,
polypharmacy, and mortality. However, the routine exclusion of older and more multimorbid patients from clinical
trials has resulted in the paucity of data regarding the risks and benefits of medications in this population, or an
understanding of how multimorbidity alters treatment effects. To address this unmet need, this proposal will
evaluate the role of multimorbidity in modulating medication effects and identify the optimal approach that best
quantifies its impact on medication outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that (a) by attenuating drug-related
benefits and amplifying drug-related harms, multimorbidity should be a key consideration when making treatment
decisions, and that (b) approaches that incorporate the cumulative burden of illness – especially the multi-
morbidity weighted index [MWI] – can better characterize these alterations in medication effects (preliminary
analysis). The proposal will use Medicare fee-for-service data from >23 million patients and replicate findings in
two large external databases. We will focus on cardiometabolic therapies as: older adults have the highest
burden of these conditions, and since 2010, more than 20 new cardiometabolic therapies have been approved,
highlighting the immense need to study these medications. We will identify patients with: (a) type 2 diabetes
initiating sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors vs established antidiabetic therapies; (b) atrial fibrillation
initiating direct oral anticoagulants vs warfarin; and (c) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [CVD] initiating
newer antiplatelet drugs (e.g. ticagrelor) vs clopidogrel. Aim 1 will evaluate how clinical (e.g. cognitive
impairment) and non-clinical (e.g. social deprivation) factors interact with multimorbidity to influence medication
prescribing of cardiometabolic therapies in the real world. Aim 2 will elucidate the role of multimorbidity in
modulating the risks and benefits for newer compared to established cardiometabolic medications by estimating
the adjusted rates of disease specific benefits (i.e. reduction in CVD events), harms (e.g. major bleeding) and
universal outcome measures (e.g. home-time, loss of functional independence) by levels of multimorbidity. We
will also validate multimorbidity measures (e.g. MWI, Elixhauser index) and frameworks (e.g. disease dyads)
against medication outcomes. The impact of this proposal is significant as it will establish a rigorous and readily
scalable framework to study the effects of multimorbidity on drug outcomes in older adults. It will also represent
the first effort to systematically evaluate and validate multimorbidity indices and approaches against medication
outcomes, beginning a new and exciting line of research that has potential to expand to other populations (e.g.
middle-aged adults) and clinical areas. Given the paucity of data from clinical trials, study findings will serve as
the primary source of information for patients, caregivers, and clinicians to make individualized evidence-based
decisions."
10755351,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 Lung cancer is a global scourge responsible for ~1.5 million deaths worldwide, and ~130,000 deaths in the
USA in 2022. Despite our understanding of relevant risk factors such as cigarettes, asbestos and radon, lung
cancer kills more US citizens than the next four cancer types combined. Although the clinical situation is
challenging, fundamental cancer research has revealed that lung cancers can be subdivided into genetically-
defined subsets based on driver oncogene mutations that, in turn, serve as predictive biomarkers for the clinical
deployment of FDA-approved pathway-targeted therapies in lung cancer patients. In particular, FDA approval
of oncoprotein-targeted therapies such sotorasib or dabrafenib plus trametinib as treatments for KRASG12C or
BRAFV600E-driven lung cancer respectively are already having an important impact on patients with these subsets
of the disease. However, despite this, and recent advances in the deployment of immunotherapy, only a minority
of lung cancer patients have benefitted from such advances such that treatment options for many patients remain
limited to conventional approaches including surgery, radiation, and/or conventional chemotherapy that are
ineffective against tumor cells and toxic to the patient. Consequently, the overarching, long-term goal of this
research is to provide a rational scientific foundation for the development of new combination therapeutic
strategies to treat patients with KRAS- or BRAF-driven lung cancer that: 1. Increase the overall response rate
and depth of each patient's primary response; 2. Maximize safety and tolerability, while minimizing toxicity and;
3. Forestall the onset of lethal drug resistance. To that end, our short-term aims are to elucidate how various
signaling pathways cooperate with oncogenic KRAS or BRAF in the genesis and maintenance of lung cancer.
To do so we will leverage: 1. State-of-the-art preclinical mouse models (GEM or PDX) of KRAS- or BRAF-driven
lung cancer; 2. Human or mouse lung cancer-derived cell lines whose aberrant behavior is driven by relevant
genetic abnormalities; 3. Pathway-targeted inhibitors, many of which are FDA-approved or in clinical
development and; 4. An outstanding collaborative team of scientists and physicians who will consult on the
design, execution and interpretation of the results of our research. Hence, building on a solid foundation of
published or preliminary data, we will use models of KRAS- or BRAF-driven lung cancer to elucidate the role of:
1. Autocrine activation of ERBB/HER signaling as a mechanism that promotes lung cancer progression and
maintenance; 2. Autophagy as a cytoprotective mechanism that protects lung cancer cells from the cytotoxic
effects of pathway-targeted inhibition and; 3. AKT protein kinases as progression factors or pharmacological
targets in the genesis or maintenance of lung cancer. Consequently, our research is significant and likely to
have lasting and important translational impact in the design and evaluation of new combination pathway-
targeted strategies to treat patients with this ubiquitous, devastating and poorly understood disease."

PI: Robert J. Zawadzki, Ph.D.
SUMMARY
Inherited and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are currently responsible for severe vision impairment
in over 2 million US residents, with prevalence expected to double by 2040 as the population ages.
Degeneration occurs in photoreceptor cells, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and the choroidal
vasculature, a complex of tightly interdependent tissues in the posterior eye. This project will continue our in
vivo investigations of morphology and function of the photoreceptor-RPE-choroid complex in animal models of
retinal degenerations, including the RPE mitochondrial dysfunction model and Doyne Honeycomb Retinal
Dystrophy. These models recapitulate major hallmarks of inherited and age-related macular degeneration:
degeneration of RPE cells and age-related increase in extracellular deposits between the RPE and Bruch’s
membrane, which separates the RPE from the choroidal capillary bed. The project will use innovative, cellular-
level resolution in vivo probing of retinal structure and function combined with additional functional tests to
characterize age-related changes in major components of the photoreceptor-RPE-choroid neurovascular unit
(PRC-NVU). These studies will be performed longitudinally in cohorts of mice with genetic defects and wild-
type controls, fed with a high-fat diet (to accelerate disease progression). The studies will test the hypothesis
that primary defects in RPE-Bruch’s membrane cause secondary deterioration of photoreceptors and
choriocapillaris vasculature. The studies include measures of photoreceptor structure and function (using
Temporal Speckle Averaging - Optical Coherence Tomography (TSA-OCT), OCT-based Optoretinography
(ORG)), and full-field Electroretinography (ffERG)), mapping of RPE mosaic and Bruch’s membrane
morphology with water driven transient changes in BrM scattering, RPE cell autofluorescence intensity and
emission spectrum, the redox status of RPE cells, and choriocapillaris vascular morphology using TSA-OCT
Angiography. We will analyze these multidimensional longitudinal data to discover potential structural and
functional biomarkers of PRC-NVU degeneration and evaluate its predictive value for disease progression. At
the termination of in vivo experiments, the choroid-RPE from one eye of each mouse will be imaged with a
custom high-resolution ex vivo confocal microscope equipped with an Optical Coherence Microscopy (OCM)
unit and a LiveCell stage top incubation system allowing imaging of a “live” RPE cells flat-mounted with the
sclera (to allow validation of in vivo observations and evaluation of Fluorescence Lifetime of RPE organelles);
the retina from the second eye of each mouse will be evaluated by conventional histological and biochemical
measurements performed on light or electron microscopes, to allow validation of morphological in vivo findings.
A novel method for delivering drugs to the RPE via near-infrared light-degradable nanoparticles will be used to
locally target therapeutic agents to ailing RPE cells, and spatially resolved imaging will be used to determine if
the therapeutic agents slow and stop disease progression. By combining longitudinal, in vivo imaging and
optical nanotherapies, these studies will lay a foundation for locally targeted drug delivery in human ocular
disease."
10838488,"Project Summary
Growth factor (GF)-based therapies hold great promise for tissue engineering, cancer treatment, and regenera-
tive medicine but controlling their activity and selectivity can be challenging. GFs act as ligands for membrane-
receptors controlling signaling cascades that drive gene expression and cellular functions, such as proliferation
and differentiation. Tools that can selectively activate or suppress GF-mediated signaling activity in cells are
needed to achieve control over the activity of these molecules and improve their therapeutic properties. Heparan
sulfate (HS) proteoglycans (PGs), while often overlooked, are uniquely suited for this purpose, as they often
serve as coreceptors for GFs at the cell surface. By promoting the formation of complexes between GFs and
their receptors, they balance competing signaling pathways and regulate cellular responses. While the structure
and activity of HS on cells can be controlled, to some extent, through genetic engineering of their biosynthesis,
chemical tools for remodeling cell-sulfate HS to attain GF-binding specificity would be much mor general and
better suited for therapeutic applications. This project establishes such tools, termed neoPG chimeras, that will
be able to selectively activate or inhibit GF signaling activity in cells. This will be achieved by taking advantage
of the GF-binding selectivities of recombinant HS polysaccharides produced through systematic mutation of HS
biosynthetic enzymes in laboratory cell lines. The recombinant HS polysaccharides will be harvested, character-
ized for GF binding specificity and merged with functional elements for targeting to the cells. Membrane targeting
neoPG chimeras will be developed to promote GF association with receptors at the cell surface and promote GF
signaling activity (Aim 1). Lysosome-targeting neoPG chimeras will be used to drive extracellular GFs into the
cells for degradation, thus inhibiting signaling activity (Aim 2). The focus of this study will be on establishing and
validating neoPG chimeras as actuators of signaling by members of the Fibroblast Growth Factor family of pro-
teins in the context of cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, many other classes of GFs require cell
surface HS for function and the new tools are expected to find broad application in many different aspects of
biomedical research and GF-based therapies."
10923786,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this proposal is to identify new ways of preventing anaphylaxis in those with food allergy by defining cellular and molecular mechanisms that transport intact food allergens across the gut epithelium. In its most severe form, food allergy can trigger life-threatening anaphylaxis. One factor that can determine risk of anaphylaxis is the integrity of the gut barrier, but there are no treatments to reduce intestinal permeability to food allergens. A major mode of allergen transport across the gut epithelium occurs transcellularly through secretory and goblet cell-associated antigen passages (GAPs). Using mouse models of peanut and egg allergy, we have made the exciting discovery that susceptibility to oral anaphylaxis was genetically determined and associated with an increased number and function of GAPs. Using a forward genetic screen we identified a single chromosomal region that tracks with this phenotype. Moreover, drug treatments targeting goblet cell biology reduced anaphylaxis in vivo. We hypothesize that the genetic regulation of gut goblet cell quantity and transport capability determines susceptibility to anaphylaxis by controlling intestinal permeability to intact food allergens. In Aim 1, using complementary mouse strains described above, we will perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping with SNP genotyping to identify genetic resistance loci for oral anaphylaxis associated with reduced gut permeability. These data will be integrated with scRNA-Seq analyses of intestinal epithelium from anaphylaxis susceptible vs. resistant littermates to identify cell type-specific regulators of allergen transport. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in mice, we will test the contribution to gut permeability and oral anaphylaxis in vivo of known and novel candidate genes. In Aim 2 we will determine goblet cell-intrinsic vs. goblet cell extrinsic pathways that inhibit allergen transport. Our preliminary data in mice suggests that the number and function of GAPs prominently contribute to susceptibility to oral anaphylaxis. Using bone marrow chimeras and in vitro human or mouse enteroid cultures we will directly test whether transcellular transport of allergens is increased in anaphylaxis susceptible humans or mice and will determine whether these phenotypes are epithelial cell-intrinsic or -extrinsic. In Aim 3 we will perform a targeted screen of FDA approved drugs that could inhibit goblet cell differentiation and/or function for their ability to block fluorescent allergen uptake in vitro and oral anaphylaxis in vivo. Effective compounds will be validated using human gut enteroids from donors with or without food allergy. We have already identified multiple drugs that reduce allergen transport in oral anaphylaxis susceptible mice, highlighting that pharmaceutical blockade of these pathways could potentially prevent anaphylaxis in patients with food allergy. Impact: Identifying genes and cellular pathways regulating food allergen transport by gut epithelia could lead to new ways of preventing anaphylaxis and to diagnostic approaches to more accurately stratify anaphylaxis risk for food-allergic individuals."

Dr. Karyn Goodman plays a critical role in Tisch Cancer Institute’s (TCI) cancer clinical trial program and
in supporting NCI-funded clinical trials. She has demonstrated a long-term commitment to this work
through her previous role as Associate Director (AD) of Clinical Research for 3 years at the University of
Colorado Cancer Center. In the same role in the TCI, Dr. Goodman has been able to further expand on
the work she was doing in Colorado and has focused on five major goals: 1) to expand access to clinical
trials across the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS); 2) to increase the numbers of NCI-sponsored trials
performed across the MSHS; 3) to address the need for more oversight and integration of clinical trial
services provided across the MSHS; 4) to support junior faculty to develop investigator-initiated trials
(IITs) and present concepts to the Experimental Therapeutic Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN) for potential
support; and, 5) to increase minority recruitment to TCI clinical trials. Institutionally, she has been the
local PI of numerous National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) studies at several NCI-designated cancer
centers and is currently the Mount Sinai PI for one ECOG/ACRIN trial and one ETCTN trial and serves as
the PI for the Early Drug Development Opportunity Program (EDDOP) at Mount Sinai. In addition, she is
a national leader in the NCTN both through her involvement in the GI committees of the Alliance for
Clinical Trials in Oncology and the NRG Oncology, as well as her role as the co-chair of the NCI
Gastrointestinal Steering Committee. She has nicely bridged the work she has done nationally with her
institutional AD of Clinical Research position. She brings her expertise in clinical trial development and
oversight which she gained as the National Study Chair of the CALGB/Alliance 80803, a Phase II trial that
evaluated PET-directed therapy for esophageal cancer, and the National Radiation Oncology Principal
Investigator of the RTOG/NRG 0848, a large Phase III trial investigating the role of adjuvant
chemoradiation in resectable pancreas cancer. Her overarching goal as a senior leader in the TCI is to
support the development of both IITs and NCI-funded cooperative group clinical trials that will further
advance the fight against cancer. The R50 funding mechanism will undoubtedly help foster her ability to
expand NCI-funded oncology clinical research at Mount Sinai Hospital and expand access to these trials
across the MSHS. Dr. Goodman is uniquely positioned for this award with both her institutional and

11093863,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Approximately 3% of children suffer from some form of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Recent
large-scale sequencing studies have identified hundreds of genes associated with NDDs including autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). Even when the genetic basis of these diseases is known, the molecular
pathogenesis can remain elusive. Such is the case for TCF20-associated neurodevelopmental disorder
(TAND), a devastating neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in a high-risk autism gene
TCF20. Children with TAND present with symptoms of ASD, as well as intellectual disability, ataxia,
hypotonia, and seizures, yet the disease pathogenesis and reversibility are not known. Tcf20 expression
increases during development and persists into adulthood, suggesting that its function may not be limited
to developmental processes. Furthermore, we recently found that TCF20 regulates the expression of key
neuronal genes, including many activity-dependent genes in mouse neurons. These results motivate
testing the hypothesis that Tcf20 has a postdevelopmental function to regulate activity-dependent
signaling pathways that mediate the TAND-associate phenotypes. This hypothesis will be tested using
cutting-edge neuroscience techniques in combination with novel mouse genetic tools. The objectives of
this proposal are to (1) determine the molecular and neuronal pathways that mediate TAND pathogenesis,
(2) determine the role of TCF20 in activity-dependent signaling pathways in vivo, and (3) determine critical
temporal windows for Tcf20 requirement during and beyond development. Completion of the proposed
study will allow the PI to elucidate the molecular and neuronal signaling deficits underlying TAND
symptoms, and determine the critical treatment window of various neurobehavioral pheno types of TAND.
These results will serve as the foundation for future studies aimed to reverse these deficits. Furthermore,
this study provides an excellent opportunity to address the fundamental question of how activity -
dependent signaling regulates brain development under healthy and disease conditions. The mentored
phase of this award will be mentored by the world renowned neurogeneticist Dr. Huda Zoghbi, together
with a skilled team of experts in systems neuroscience, genetic engineering, electrophysiolo gy, single cell
analysis, and computational analysis at Baylor College of Medicine. A comprehensive mentoring plan was
proposed including additional training in electrophysiological recordings and single cell analysis, as well as
professional development through training in manuscript and grant writing, advising of mentees, and
collaborations within the tremendous biomedical environment at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas
Medical Center. This training will provide the necessary skills for the PI to transition to an independent
faculty position at a top research institution."
10810692,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Significance. Although national and philanthropic efforts have sought to reduce and eliminate breast cancer
(BC) mortality disparities over the past few decades, they have not only persisted—but widened. Additionally,
due to incomplete capture of recurrence data, no previous investigation has identified drivers of disparities in BC
recurrence following a diagnosis of early-stage (I–IIIA) disease. In Georgia, where economic and racial/ethnic
disparities are among the greatest in the United States, the sources of BC outcome disparities are unresolved,
and likely arise from the interplay of causal and contributing factors at multiple levels—from cell to society.
Approximately 40% of all BC survivors will suffer a recurrence during their lifetime, and clinical data suggest a
higher risk of recurrence in minority and low-income women. Given the high lifetime risk of recurrence, posited
race/ethnic disparities in recurrent BC, and documented mortality disparities across demographic domains, now
is the pivotal time to characterize underlying pathways contributing to inequities in BC prognosis. Innovation.
Our proposal is innovative in that it will be the first to estimate risks and rates of BC recurrence by demographic
characteristics, consider intersectionality in BC outcome disparities, and use a multilevel decomposition
approach to identify potential targets for intervention. Approach. Integrating multiple data streams (e.g.,
discharge, administrative claims, hospital, and census data) with cancer registry data from a large, diverse
population, we will identify proximal, intermediate, and distal determinants of race/ethnic, SES, and urban/rural
disparities in both recurrence and BC-specific mortality, as well as examine recurrence and its treatments as
mediators of disparities in mortality rates by race, SES, and urban/rural characteristics. Data will be from
approximately 30,000 women diagnosed with a first primary stage I–IIIA BC in Georgia (2013–2017) and followed
for up to 12 years. Impact. Previous research in this area has had consistent shortcomings including (1)
insufficient ascertainment of recurrence at the population level; (2) examining one or few factors without
accounting for shared contributions across multiple levels; and (3) inadequate power to explore intersections of
identity. Our study, for the first time, will examine multi-level contributors to race/ethnic, SES, and urban/rural
disparities in both BC recurrence and mortality among women with early-stage disease. Our innovative multi-
level decomposition approach will move us beyond merely documenting disparities, to identifying modifiable
targets within the social contexts of affected communities, facilitating prioritization of interventions."

Triple-Negative breast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for 15-20% of all breast cancer, represents an aggressive
clinical history, development of distant metastasis, shorter survival and high mortaility rate compared with other
subtypes of breast cancer. It is imperative to identity new therapeutic targets that are actionale in TNBC. Our lab
has been focusing on studying a family of enzymes that uses oxygen, Fe2+ and 2-oxoglutarate (2-OG) for their
enzymatic reactions. This enzyme family has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of cancers. We
generated the custom siRNA library for all of 2-OG dependent enzymes and developed a stringent screening
strategy by combining the functional readouts from both 2-D cell proliferation and 3-D soft agar growth assay
with TNBC breast cancer cell lines. Our preliminary data show that gamma-butyrobetaine hydroxylase 1
(BBOX1) involved in carnitine biosynthesis pathway is essential for TNBC cell proliferation on 2-D and 3-D.
Mechanistically, we show that BBOX1 binds with the calcium channel inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor
type 3 (IP3R3), therefore promoting calcium release, mitochondrial function and glycolysis in TNBC. We
hypothesize that BBOX1-IP3R3 signaling axis promotes TNBC by inducing calcium release and tumor
metabolism. This is the first study directed at a pro-oncogenic function for BBOX1 in cancer, with our focus in
TNBC. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize the functional significance of BBOX1-IP3R3 signaling in TNBC. In
Specific Aim 2, we will elucidate the molecular mechanism by which BBOX1-IP3R3 signaling promotes
oncogenic phenotypes in TNBC. In Specific Aim 3, we will assess the therapeutic implications of targeting
BBOX1 in TNBC xenografts and patient derived xenografts (PDXs). Successful completion of this proposal would
establish the role of BBOX1 as a new oncogenic driver in TNBC and explore its therapeutic potential in this lethal
disease."
10829891,"Melanoma is the solid tumor that metastasizes most frequently to the central nervous system (CNS). While major
progress has been made in treating metastatic melanoma, advances in treating melanoma brain metastases
(MBM) lag behind. This is due to near-universal exclusion of patients with untreated brain metastases from
clinical trials, and only once a regimen is well established in extra-cerebral disease, is it studied in MBM patients.
Moreover, pre-clinical studies of MBM have been hampered by a paucity of pre-clinical models and limited
access to CNS specimens for analysis, as these patients are typically treated with radiation rather than surgery.
We therefore developed infrastructure and resources which we propose to employ to better understand
molecular, vascular and cellular underpinnings of brain metastasis. We started by studying activity of the PD-1
inhibitor pembrolizumab (pembro) in patients with untreated MBM on a phase II trial. Although the response rate
was modest (26%), the two-year survival was 48%, and the incidence of radiation necrosis and/or neurologic
symptoms related to edema was high. We therefore initiated a sequel trial of pembro plus bevacizumab in MBM;
the response rate in the initial cohort was 55%, exceeding our expectations and warranting further evaluation.
This response rate is similar to that seen with nivolumab and ipilimumab in MBM, but the toxicity profile is far
superior with only minimal added toxicity from the bevacizumab. We propose to further study co-targeting the
PD-1 and VEGF/VEGF-R pathways in MBM, and to determine the mechanism by which these pathways
crosstalk to promote tumor growth within the brain. We will build on our success with anti-VEGF in a new trial
involving pembro and a VEGF-R inhibitor (VEGFRi), lenvatinib. In parallel to our clinical research endeavors we
developed novel immune-competent models of MBM that are modestly responsive to anti-PD-1, and developed
in vitro models of the blood-brain-barrier to study effects of these drugs on vascular leak. These pre-clinical
models will be used to test the hypothesis that the addition of VEGF pathway blockade to anti-PD-1 enhances T
cell migration and function and directly decreases tight junction leakiness. We also hypothesize that anti-VEGF
has different effects to VEGFRis. We will dissect the mechanism by which this occurs using our novel immune
competent murine models and single cell transcriptomic and in situ proteomic strategies (Aim 1) and determine
whether VEGF inhibiting drugs should be replaced with VEGF-Ris to treat MBM. We are expanding our ongoing
clinical trial of pembro and bevacizumab by enrolling a second cohort of melanoma patients to verify our initial
result. We have initiated a new trial of pembro and lenvatinib. We will analyze tumors and blood samples from
patients on these trials in an attempt to validate mechanistic results from the murine experiments and identify
predictors of response or resistance to this regimen (Aim 2). This proposal is responsive to PAR 21-033, which
involves early phase clinical trials and biomarker and mechanistic studies. These studies can have important
implications for other disease as well, such as lung cancer, which similarly metastasizes frequently to the CNS."
10834969,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Intensive care unit (ICU) teams (i.e., nurses, physicians, and respiratory therapists) have some of the highest
rates of burnout in healthcare. Burnout is an occupational phenomenon resulting from chronic workplace stress
and is characterized by exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced professional efficacy. Burnout has been
associated with poorer safety ratings, quality of care, and patient outcomes. Interventions to reduce burnout
have focused on individual clinicians, but this approach neglects the organizational factors contributing to
burnout, and consequently, has been only marginally effective. Organizational resilience is a promising
approach for addressing burnout in ICU teams and improving outcomes in patients with acute respiratory
failure. Organizational resilience is the capacity of a complex adaptive system to anticipate stressors, perform
under stressful conditions, and adapt moving forward. While the relationships among organizational resilience
and employee health and performance outcomes have been described in other settings, organizational
resilience has not been measured in healthcare settings. Our scientific premise is that the key to improving
ICU clinician burnout and preventing adverse outcomes in patients with acute respiratory failure is to
investigate the role of organizational factors in ICU resilience. When ICUs are more organizationally
resilient, clinicians feel better equipped to manage workplace stressors, and thus are more likely to provide
high-quality care for patients with acute respiratory failure. Capitalizing on our team’s expertise in ICU
organization and survey research, our partnership with CommonSpirit Health, the 4th largest U.S. healthcare
system with hospitals in 21 states, and our preliminary data, we propose a novel mixed-methods sequential
explanatory design study that examines resilience as an organizational phenomenon. We will administer
a survey about resilience (Connor-Davidson resilience scale and Lee et al’s measure of organizational
resilience), burnout (two single-item Maslach Burnout Inventory measures), and wellbeing (WHO-5) to 6000
clinicians working in 60 ICUs at two timepoints to examine the dynamics of individual and organizational
resilience over time (Aim 1). We will then test the interdependent contributions of individual and organizational
resilience to patient outcomes (mortality and ventilator-free days) and clinician outcomes (burnout and
wellbeing) (Aim 2). Lastly, we will qualitatively describe the relationships between work environment, ICU
organizational resilience, and interprofessional care and characterize perceived barriers and facilitators of
organizational resilience (Aim 3). Our long-term goal is to develop a multi-pronged intervention that will
enhance ICU resilience. Our objective in this proposal is to empirically test the relationship between resilience
and patient and clinician outcomes so that administrators, policymakers, and researchers can more
appropriately target efforts to support ICU clinicians. This project addresses a major gap in understanding how
to best support a valuable healthcare resource: the clinicians that care for mechanically ventilated adults."

The overarching goal of the Pulmonary Rehabilitation to Reduce Post-Tuberculosis Morbidity (TB PuRe) project
is to measure the effectiveness, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of a pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) program to
prevent post-tuberculosis (TB) respiratory morbidity in India. TB is associated with lung impairment which can
persist despite successful completion of TB treatment. There are an estimated 155 million TB survivors globally,
yet there are no routinely implemented interventions for addressing post-TB respiratory morbidity. PR is a key
component of the management plan for chronic lung diseases and is an effective intervention to improve patient-
centered outcomes. However, the clinical benefit of PR, administered during TB treatment, in preventing post-
TB respiratory morbidity has not been investigated. Furthermore, despite the long natural history of TB disease
and its disproportionate impact in resource limited settings, the feasibility of a home-based PR program for TB
patients is unclear. Therefore, the aims of TB PuRe are: a) to measure the comparative-effectiveness of two
home-based PR programs, administered during TB treatment, for preventing post-TB respiratory morbidity; b) to
describe the intersection between clinic-level service organization, coach intervention delivery fidelity, and client
behavioral action for these two PR programs; c) to compare the costs, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of
the two different PR strategies implemented as a routine program. To achieve these aims, 690 adult drug-
sensitive pulmonary TB patients with functional impairment at TB treatment initiation will be enrolled at three
geographically and epidemiologically diverse study sites in India. Participants will be randomized in 1:1:1 ratio
into one of the following three study arms: a) 2 months of home-based PR during TB treatment (short PR arm);
b) 2 months of home-based PR during TB treatment followed by 4 additional months of home-based PR for
participants with persistent functional impairment despite 2 months of PR (extended PR arm); c) standard TB
treatment without specific PR (standard-of-care arm). The primary outcome will be the 6-minute walk test
distance compared between short and extended PR arms, and the standard-of-care arm at 12 months after
randomization. We will assess the PR interventions' acceptability to inform adoption of the PR strategies in a
programmatic setting by using the Theoretical Framework for Acceptability. Furthermore, we will empirically
assess societal costs of the two PR programs at the patient-level, factoring the resource-use in the process of
development of programmatic infrastructure, implementation, service delivery, and patient costs. Cost-
effectiveness of the two programs will be assessed based on Health-related Quality of Life (HrQOL) outcomes
assessment. Our study, if significant, will generate the strongest evidence to date to support routine
implementation of a systematic PR program to reduce post-TB respiratory morbidity. Our multidisciplinary team
with distinct, yet complementary, expertise and a strong track record of conducting NIH funded TB research in
India will ensure the successful execution of the TB PuRe project."
10864066,"Project Summary/Abstract
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, and the fifth most common cause of death
from cancer overall. As with many other cancers, breast cancer presents in a variety of forms and can be
broadly divided into four molecular subtypes, including luminal A, luminal B, HER2+ and basal. Among them,
basal cancer represents ~20% of primary breast tumors and is one of the most aggressive and deadly
subtypes. While significant efforts have been made, the biological process of how basal cancer progresses to a
malignant, life-threatening disease is not well understood, and the prognostication and treatment of basal
cancer remain major challenges. Specifically, there are currently no prognostic tests available that can assist
clinical management, and nearly all basal cancer patients are classified as having a high risk of recurrence.
Moreover, as the majority of basal tumors lack expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor
(PR) and HER2, there are presently no effective targeted treatment regimens available, and harsh,
indiscriminate chemotherapy is the only treatment option. Consequently, a significant number of basal cancer
patients are under- or over-treated. Built logically on our previous work, we propose a large-scale
interdisciplinary research plan, in which we will use multi-region sequencing and advanced computational
techniques to address some pressing issues and the aforementioned unmet clinical needs of basal breast
cancer. Specifically, we will perform molecular profiling of 300 primary basal tumors and 50 matched
metastatic tumors that we have identified from Mayo Clinic tissue banks. By using the obtained multi-region
sequencing tumor tissue data, we will derive a prognostic evaluation system for basal cancer through multiple
instance learning, and construct and validate a high-resolution progression model of basal cancer. We will also
perform a large-scale analysis on a range of molecular data to systematically search for genetic determinants
of basal cancer progression at both gene and pathway levels, which will provide a wealth of insights into
molecular mechanisms of tumorigenesis and enable us to identify potential therapeutic targets for basal
cancer. If successfully implemented, this work will significantly advance the basal cancer research, and pave
the way for applying similar strategies to study other deadly cancers."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia in the elderly population and 6th leading cause
of death in the US. Despite extensive research, there are currently no treatments that slow or stop the
development of AD. With the number of AD cases expected to triple in the next 30 years, there is a pressing
need to diagnose AD early in the preclinical stage. While several peptide and protein biomarkers in cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) have been used for AD diagnosis, an unequivocal diagnosis in the early phases of AD is still lacking.
Perhaps more importantly, the discovery and establishment of reliable biomarkers capable of monitoring
progression and degree of cognitive impairment as well as potential efficacy of therapy remains a major
challenge. Furthermore, compared to CSF, serum sample provides an appealing source for biomarker discovery
and screening due to less invasiveness and easier access. However, the correlation between CSF and blood
protein/peptide biomarkers as well as changes in the brain structure/function and cognition in AD is not well
established. In order to address these challenges and fill in existing knowledge gaps, we propose to employ a
multi-faceted approach combining a suite of mass spectrometry-based technologies enabled by innovative
multiplexed tagging strategies, improved sampling and separation strategies and clinically-available measures
to discover, identify and evaluate candidate biomarkers of AD in CSF/serum obtained from asymptomatic
cognitively-healthy middle-aged adults, older cognitively-normal adults, and patients with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and AD. We propose the following specific aims: Specific Aim 1 – To develop novel
enrichment strategies and complementary separation modalities for enhanced coverage of glycoproteome and
posttranslational modification crosstalk analysis in paired CSF and serum samples from subjects in control,
preclinical, MCI, AD groups, respectively. Specific Aim 2 – To enhance quantitative glycoproteomic analysis of
low-abundance species in CSF and serum samples via innovative dimethylated leucine (DiLeu) boosting and
BoxCar data-independent acquisition (DIA) strategies along with machine learning classification algorithms for
improved diagnosis of AD. Specific Aim 3 – To validate candidate AD biomarkers, in CSF and serum samples
collected from individuals with MCI and dementia, using targeted quantitative proteomics approaches enabled
by isotopic DiLeu tags and affinity-bead assisted MS immunoassay along with association with AD-related
clinical, cognitive and neuroimaging measures. This project uniquely integrates advances in MS-based
multiplexed quantitative glycoproteomics and bioinformatics tools with neuroimaging and clinical measures to
enable more comprehensive discovery and validation of CSF and serum biomarkers in AD. These biomarkers
would be invaluable in improving our understanding of AD pathogenesis, designing therapeutics for patient care
and more efficient clinical trials of disease modifying therapies. The advances in technology and new insights
will have broad impact on translational medicine."

This is a renewal application of an established program to investigate the regulation of the development and
homeostasis of the spine. During the first funding period, our studies demonstrated that the gene Adgrg6,
implicated in a common human spine disorder called adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, has an essential role in
maintaining spine alignment in mice. We showed that the G-protein coupled rector Adgrg6 regulates gene
expression and biomechanical properties of the intervertebral discs and dense connective tissue of the spine.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that Adgrg6 stimulates cAMP signaling regulate factors essential for
homeostasis of fibrocartilaginous tissue of the spine. Our findings suggest a new hypothesis that stimulation
of cAMP signaling can decrease the onset and severity of scoliosis caused by the loss of Adgrg6
signaling. In addition, human genetics analysis of scoliosis identified a novel variant located in the
transcriptional activation domain of the transcription factor SOX9. Significantly, targeted disruption of this
domain of Sox9 in mice caused scoliosis and dysregulation of gene expression in fibrocartilaginous tissues of
the spine. Here, we will test the hypothesis that Adgrg6 and Sox9 are functionally linked for regulation
homeostasis and alignment of the spine.
 To add breadth to our program goals, we continued a forward genetic screen to isolate a collection of
spine disorder mutant zebrafish. We recently identified two zebrafish mutants that fail to complement a novel
thoracic scoliosis phenotype, suggesting a new pathway controlling spine morphogenesis. The characterization
of this unique thoracic scoliosis phenotype will expand our knowledge into the cellular and molecular
heterogeneity of spine disorders. Here, we will test the hypothesis that thoracic scoliosis in zebrafish is
caused by a disruption of purinergic signaling leading to defects in notochord biogenesis.
 We will test these hypotheses via studies divided into three Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will deepen
our mechanistic understanding of effectors of Adgrg6 signaling in the spine and test whether stimulation of
cAMP can restore homeostasis to fibrocartilaginous tissues of the spine and halt the onset and progression of
scoliosis. Specific Aim 2 will characterize the cellular and molecular causes of scoliosis in a novel Sox9 mutant
mouse and use this model to test whether genetic interactions between Adgrg6 and Sox9 variants increase the
susceptibility to scoliosis. Specific Aim 3 will characterize novel thoracic scoliosis mutant zebrafish and test a
model that purinergic signaling is essential for notochord biogenesis and spine morphogenesis in zebrafish.
Our results will provide new insights into the molecular genetics and biological processes necessary for the
development and homeostasis of the spine. These studies may provide fundamental insights into the biological
processes and pathways associated with human skeletal dysplasia and scoliosis."

The superficial white matter (SWM) lies directly beneath the cortex and contains the short association fibers, or
U-fibers, connecting neighboring gyri. The SWM contains around twice as many fiber connections as the deep
white matter (DWM) and plays a crucial role in brain development, aging, and various brain disorders. Existing
connectome imaging research based on diffusion MRI (dMRI), however, mostly focuses on the connections of
long fiber bundles in the DWM even though tremendous advances have been made in human connectome
imaging with much improved spatial and angular resolution. In this proposed renewal of our R01 project (NIBIB
R01EB022744), we will conduct systematic development of novel computational tools to fill major technical gaps
in current SWM research. Our project will provide fundamentally novel solutions to many of the current
challenges in SWM connectome research by developing surface-based tools for fiber tracking, atlas construction,
and personalized analysis. We will also develop novel personalized dMRI harmonization methods with a
particular focus on accounting for the variable cortical anatomy. These developments will for the first time provide
dedicated tools for modeling SWM connectome with greatly improved robustness and accuracy. There are three
specific aims in our project: 1. Development of novel surface-based fiber tracking and filtering algorithms for the
modeling of superficial white matter connectivity. 2. Development of surface-based U-fiber atlases and
personalized SWM connectivity analysis. 3. Development of personalized diffusion MRI harmonization tools with
improved consistency in cortical anatomy. Rigorous validations of our novel surface-based U-fiber tracking and
modeling methods will be performed on high-resolution MRI of post-mortem brains, in vivo intracranial neural
recordings from surgically implanted electrodes in patients with epilepsy, and their application in multiple large-
scale connectome imaging datasets (n>5000). All software tools and atlases developed in this project will be
publicly shared, which will allow brain imaging researchers to augment their current connectome models with U-
fibers in SWM and more completely map human brain connectomes for the detection of their alterations in
various brain disorders."

 Addiction, and opioid use disorder (OUD) in particular, is a scourge on American life. Though we know much
from animal models about how opioid drugs act on the brain, we have yet to develop new OUD treatments based
on this knowledge. Why is this? Our lab, like others in recent years, have argued that in part it is due to a lack of
translationally-relevant rodent models that capture the key behavioral features of addiction, such as the
maladaptive, compulsive, and relapsing use that develops in a subset of individuals.
 In humans, OUD is characterized by continued use of opioids despite negative consequences, preoccupation
with using these drugs, and relapse to drug use after quitting, and for long-lasting opioids like heroin, also
escalation of use, tolerance, and withdrawal. Each of these translationally-relevant behavioral phenomena can
now be modelled in rodents, but the neural networks underlying each of them are yet poorly understood.
 The ventral pallidum (VP), and especially its dense projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), have
drawn increasing attention for their potent roles in motivation and addiction. We recently showed VP neurons
are essential for translationally-relevant cocaine relapse-like behavior, and that GABAergic VP neurons (VPGABA)
and their projections to VTA are specifically responsible for a range of strongly motivated behaviors—presumably
via interactions with wider neural networks of motivation. We hope that by understanding how these neural
networks function during behaviors that capture key aspects of OUD, we can leverage this information to develop
new neuroscience-based treatment strategies.
 Here, we systematically dissect the involvement of VPGABA neurons, and the wider reward and aversion
networks they modulate, in OUD-relevant behaviors. In well-validated GAD1:Cre transgenic rats, we use Cre
and Flp-dependent chemogenetic manipulations to show how VPGABA neurons 1) modulate wider networks
underlying opioid relapse, 2) participate via their functionally-segregated outputs in appetitive aspects of OUD,
and 3) how these pathways mediate aversive aspects of OUD. We hypothesize that VPGABA neurons modulate
wider neural networks to generate OUD behaviors, and that inhibiting this key pathway will reduce compulsive
drug seeking."

In this grant application we propose to develop and validate an optimal 18F-labeled sigma-1 (σ1) receptor
radioligand for translational research in Alzheimer's disease (AD) to further elucidate the role of σ1 receptor in
AD pathogenesis and progression, to probe longitudinal changes in σ1 receptor in AD animal models, along
with the synapse biomarker synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), and AD pathologic biomarkers b-amyloid (Ab)
and tau, and to explore the potential of σ1 receptor imaging for early diagnosis of AD.
AD is a progressive degenerative disorder that afflicts 6 million people in the USA. From a diagnostic
perspective, AD is increasingly viewed along a continuum from preclinical AD, to mild cognitive impairment
(MCI), and to AD-dementia. The clinical dementia of AD is coupled to a distinct pathology, with plaques
composed of b-amyloid (Ab), neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and synaptic loss.
However, the molecular mechanism(s) of AD pathogenesis is complex and remains elusive. Several
hypotheses have been put forward, including the b-amyloid hypothesis, the misfolded tau protein hypothesis,
the cholinergic hypothesis, and the involvement of oxidative stress and calcium dyshomeostasis. Before the
accumulation of plaques and tangles, the biochemical and morphological changes, such as altered calcium,
cholesterol, and lipid metabolism, altered mitochondrial dynamics, and reduced bioenergetic interaction, are all
closely associated with functions localized to the mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
membranes (MAMs). The σ1 receptor is situated at the MAM. The most recent research has located the
earliest Ab generation in AD to neurons in the MAM, and its critical regulation by the σ1 receptor, thereby
confirming the central role of σ1 receptor in AD pathogenesis. As such the σ1 receptor is considered an
important target for AD therapeutic development. As a surrogate marker for mitochondria function and
regulator of Ab production on the MAM, it also holds great promise as a biomarker for diagnosis of AD at its
earliest stage.
 The research proposed in this application will bridge an important gap in the understanding of the σ1 receptor
in AD pathogenesis and progression by leveraging the unique expertise and experience at Yale in novel PET
radioligand development, AD mechanism study, and therapeutic target identification. Investigation of the σ1
receptor in AD animal models longitudinally in relation to biomarkers for synaptic density, Ab, and tau, is a
natural extension of our ongoing research. When carried to completion, this project will provide further insights
into the etiology of AD, and help identify a most sensitive and effective biomarker for early AD diagnosis, and
for monitoring of disease progression and the efficacy of emerging AD therapies."

The generation of novel genetically modified rat models has greatly accelerated with the availability of rat
embryonic stem cells and the advent of nuclease-based genome-editing technologies such as ZFNs, TALENs,
and CRISPR/Cas9. There is a need for reliable and cost-effective methods of cryopreservation to archive these
models and ensure their future availability. Sperm cryopreservation, which is straightforward and inexpensive
to perform, is ideal for preserving genetically modified rat models; yet, the limited methods for successful
cryorecovery using frozen rat sperm employ methods, such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) that are
beyond the means of most research laboratories or transgenic cores and are challenging even for experienced
facilities like the RRRC. The ability to perform in vitro fertilization (IVF), which is a common and highly successful
method of cryorecovery in the mouse, would be ideal for cryorecovery in the rat. Unfortunately, the limited
published protocols for rat IVF have not been reliably repeatable by others, including the RRRC. Based on
preliminary data suggesting amino acid supplementation has a beneficial impact on sperm motility, we propose
to test the addition of various amino acid combinations to media to measure the outcome of this supplementation
on sperm motility, capacitation and in vitro fertilization. The ability of amino acid supplementation to improve
post-thaw sperm motility and increase in vitro fertilization success rates when frozen/thawed sperm is used will
also be evaluated. These studies will be performed with spermatozoa from both outbred stocks and inbred
strains. The data generated will guide optimization of rat sperm cryopreservation and rat IVF, thus enhancing
the RRRC’s ability to archive and reanimate rat models in a cost-effective and efficient manner."
10798327,"Brain Injury and Dysmaturation in Newborns with Congenital Heart Disease Born Preterm.
Abstract:
Preterm birth and congenital heart disease (CHD) are two of the most common sources of perinatal morbidity
in high resource countries. Both conditions are associated with acquired brain injury and adverse
neurodevelopmental outcomes. Very little is known about the combined risk for newborns with congenital
heart disease that are born preterm and how this risk is affected by variable approaches to palliative or
definitive surgical strategies to repair heart defects. In addition to brain injury, an increasing number of genetic
anomalies have been identified in CHD that may contribute to ND outcomes. Our extensive experience
imaging term babies with CHD and preterm babies without CHD, combined with high and increasing volume of
this vulnerable population at our two centers uniquely positions us to describe the risk and magnitude of
acquired brain injury as well as comparative brain development in CHD newborns born preterm with respect to
intervention strategies. Our long-term goal is to optimize neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this proposal, we
will leverage cross-center practice variability in timing and choice of surgical interventions, palliative versus
definitive, to determine the association of surgical intervention strategy with brain development and risk of brain
injury. We will also perform a comprehensive genetic evaluation to determine how genetic anomalies alter
susceptibility to brain injury and ND outcome."
10929938,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alcohol use and destructive couple conflict, including intimate partner violence (IPV), represent dual public
health threats for sexual and gender minorities (SGM), who experience higher rates of these problems than
their cisgender, heterosexual counterparts. Although a broader literature links alcohol use to increased rates of
destructive couple conflict, very little work has examined these associations in SGM couples. Here, we draw on
alcohol myopia theory and propose that increased daily alcohol use will be associated with higher same-day
levels of destructive conflict among SGM couples. Further, we predict that greater drinking to cope motives and
higher levels of internalized minority stress (i.e., fear of rejection, worry about concealment, internalized
homophobia/transphobia) assessed at baseline will exacerbate the effects of daily minority stress (exposure to
discrimination, harassment, and stigmatization) on alcohol use and subsequent destructive conflict.
Importantly, these processes will be examined in a sample of SGM couples residing in the rural Midwest—a
population that is critical to study because of the increased types and frequency of stigma encountered by
SGM individuals living in rural areas as compared to more urban locations. Finally, we test the hypothesis that
the detrimental impact of minority stress on alcohol use and destructive couple conflict will be mitigated by
greater (a) social support from interpersonal relationships, (b) psychological sense of connection with the
LGBTQ+ community, and (c) psychological sense of community with one's rural Midwestern neighborhood.
Participants will be 200 SGM couples (i.e., both individuals identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
and/or queer, and are in a committed intimate relationship). Couples will be recruited from the Midwestern
LGBTQ+ Research Registry, established by the MPIs. Our proposed models will be tested using intensive
daily diary methods employed over 60 days to track daily experiences of minority stress, alcohol use, and
destructive conflict. Findings from this project will provide novel data about the conditions under which daily
minority stress contribute to elevated levels of destructive couple conflict via increased alcohol use by rural
SGM couples. Our examination of support and community-based resiliency factors will highlight potential
points of intervention that can be targeted to interrupt the harmful effects of minority stress on alcohol use and
subsequent intimate partner conflict and violence."
10753558,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and refractory malignancy,
whose five-year survival rate remains only 9%. Less than 20% of the patients visiting clinics are
candidates for surgery because most PDAC patients have advanced diseases at the time of
diagnosis. The majority of PDAC patients therefore require systemic therapies. While there is
promising advance in cancer therapeutics, their median survival is < 6 months. These PDAC
patients need development of new approaches for systemic treatment.
 Oncolytic viruses are promising anti-cancer agents under development. Among them,
oncolytic adenovirus (OAd) is one of the strong candidates. Despite needs of systemic treatments
for PDAC, the vast majority of OAds are designed for local administration due to several
obstacles, such as sequestration to normal organs, difficulty for selective delivery to the tumor,
neutralizing antibodies, and hemagglutination.
 Aiming at development of an OAd enabling treatment of advanced PDAC patients by systemic
injection, we will tackle these obstacles in this project. Adenoviruses have more than 50
serologically defined types, and this is a unique feature enabling escape from neutralizing Abs.
However, simple switching the backbone has not realized cancer specificity because tropisms of
adenoviruses are not cancer specific. We previously identified mesothelin (MSLN)-targeted OAd
for PDAC treatment and reported the feasibility of knob switch. We will generate a new series of
OAds based on a variety of Ad species other than Ad5, where the fiber-knob regions are replaced
by the knob with pancreatic cancer-specific binding motif in the original binding domain (AB-loop).
We hypothesize that these viruses will allow selective delivery to the tumor by systemic injection
while avoiding the effect of nAbs and hemagglutination.
 This project is expected to overcome the current and potential issues of systemic therapy of
PDAC with oncolytic virus by exploiting the advantages of the adenoviral vector system and our
unique advantages in adenovirus targeting strategies. The potential impact of systemically
injectable OAd for PDAC is significant."

Despite significant progress in understanding cognitive change associated with cancer and cancer treatments,
little is known regarding longer-term cognitive outcomes over developmentally meaningful intervals in older age
(5-20 years post-treatment) and potential association with frailty. Previous work from our lab and others, focusing
on the direct effects of cancer and cancer treatment, has moved the field forward for a better understanding of
these direct effects but is limited with regard to tracking long-term cognitive trajectories due to 1) focus on
cognition before and after treatment and short intervals following treatment completion; 2) longitudinal designs
that introduce practice effects and selective attrition that distort true cognitive trajectories; and 3) short intervals
that also limit the ability to assess accumulation of deficits, i.e., frailty, to potentially associate with cognitive
declines. We will assess cognition in 210 cancer survivors diagnosed between 55 and 60 years of age and 210
non-cancer controls at three cross-sectional age bands: 65-69; 70-74; 75-80. Cognitive assessment will consist
of online, remote administration of a validated platform of cognitive-experimental measures for use in cancer
survivorship and standard neuropsychological measures, together with collection of cancer and treatment
variables. Frailty as indexed by accumulation of deficits, i.e., medical comorbidities, polypharmacy, social
detriments of disease (e.g., smoking, obesity), psychological disturbance, and functional limitations / declines in
activities of daily living, will be collected in parallel. Aim 1: Examine cognitive differences and trajectories
between breast cancer survivors and age and education matched controls controlling for cognitive
reserve and APOE. Aim 2: Examine the association of deficit accumulation with cognition and
interaction with group status. Aim 3: Explore potential associations between APOE status and deficit
accumulation and combined effects on cognition. This research is significant because cancer and cancer
treatments have been identified as disease drivers of aging and deficit accumulation and has significant clinical
implications in that interventions that reduce deficit accumulation may be effective in maintaining cognitive
function. This research is innovative because it utilizes a cross-sectional design that avoids practice effects and
cognitive neuroscience measures that allow for assessment of cognitive trajectories and their association with
deficit accumulation at developmentally relevant timespans."
10758537,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This proposal aims to elucidate how the bacterial metalloenzyme nitrogenase catalyzes the
chemically difficult transformation of atmospheric dinitrogen into a bioavailable form, ammonia,
and why/how it utilizes ATP hydrolysis to drive this reaction. Being the only enzyme responsible
for reductive nitrogen fixation, nitrogenase sustains the agricultural/nutritional needs of ~40% of
the human population. Aside from its global importance, nitrogenase is a unique model system
with broad relevance to biological redox catalysis as well as ATP/GTP-dependent energy
transduction processes, which are both central to proper cellular functioning and thus directly
relevant to human health.
 Despite nearly five decades of extensive biochemical, biophysical, and structural
characterization, the two most important questions about nitrogenase mechanism have not
been answered in detail: a) Why and how ATP hydrolysis is ultimately utilized for the reduction
of N2 or alternative substrates? b) What is the intimate mechanism of dinitrogen reduction on the
nitrogenase active site metal cluster, FeMoco? The major experimental challenge in the
investigations of nitrogenase arises from the fact that the catalytic activity of nitrogenase
depends on continuous ATP turnover, which leads to a heterogeneous mixture of redox and
nucleotide-bound states of nitrogenase that are difficult to distinguish from one another. To
circumvent this challenge, we have initiated a research program in single-particle cryogenic
electron microscopy (cryoEM) to structurally characterize dynamic states of nitrogenase at
atomic resolution under enzymatic turnover conditions. Preliminary experiments have not only
established the feasibility of this approach but also revealed unexpected structural features of
nitrogenase which have fueled new mechanistic hypotheses. In the proposed project, we aim to
build upon on these preliminary findings by a) mapping the ATP-driven conformational
landscape of nitrogenase in unprecedented detail under catalytic turnover conditions and b)
elucidating FeMoco structural dynamics and FeMoco-small molecule interactions in atomic
resolution, while also c) contributing to the development of cutting-edge cryoEM methodologies
for the structural interrogation of highly complex/dynamic protein assemblies and
metallocofactors."

 My career goal is to become a leading researcher in the field of sex differences in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), with a specific focus on metabolic mediators and mitochondrial function. To this end, my specific training
goals in this K01 proposal include: 1) Increasing expertise and knowledge around sex differences in the brain,
2) Expanding my knowledge in metabolic and mitochondrial function in relation to AD and obtain training in
biomarker research, and 3) Developing proficiency in translational research and biostatistics for data analysis.
The NIA K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will support my training and provide me with
the knowledge base and skills needed to become an independent investigator. These training goals will be
achieved in conjunction with the testing of my specific aims, which are built on promising preliminary data
showing that metabolic health impacts memory circuitry function over the menopausal transition, potentially
through mechanisms of oxidative stress.
 Two-thirds of patients with AD are women. Beyond life expectancy rates, there are sex-specific and
sex-dependent genetic and physiologic factors that contribute to the higher frequency of AD in women. Midlife
metabolic dysfunction, which significantly differs by sex, has long been recognized as a risk factor for AD.
Despite this, the pathophysiology underlying this relationship remains largely unknown. I will test that
hypothesis that mitochondrial function plays a critical role in understanding sex differences in memory circuitry
function and the early emergence of AD-related pathology. Data will be leveraged from the unique New
England Family Study (NEFS) prenatal cohort (N=212; 106M:106F), born between 1959-1966 and followed for
>60 years. Detailed medical/reproductive histories, metabolic assessments, memory assessments, and stored
blood samples were collected from offspring at ages 45-55 (T1 in R01MH090291). These same individuals are
currently being assessed in an 8-year follow up, at ages 52-65 (T2 in R01AG067019), using the same T1
measures with additional brain imaging modalities. I have a unique window of opportunity to examine how
mitochondrial function affects memory circuitry and AD-related pathology in a sex-dependent manner. Further,
from T1 to T2, some women transitioned to menopause and thus I will be able to prospectively explore the
longitudinal impact of reproductive aging, metabolic health, and mitochondrial function on memory decline and
the accumulation of AD-related pathology. This proposal will examine mitochondrial function as a
pathophysiological mechanism for sex differences in memory circuitry and risk for AD. Findings will have
significant long-term implications for the co-occurrence of brain and metabolic disorders and highlight potential
mechanistic targets for therapeutic strategies."

The influence of broader community contexts on children’s neurocognitive development and risk for
downstream drug misuse is significant. The focus of this proposal is on low-income children who reside in rural
Georgia. Being poor in the rural South is particularly challenging for families. Emerging research suggests that
rural vs. urban poverty is characterized by distinct risk and protective factors that have unique effects on
children’s neural and socioemotional development. These differences underscore the unique contextual risk
and protective factors that affect the development of drug use vulnerability among rural youth. Informed by an
ecological developmental neuroscience perspective, we purport that neural markers of vulnerability cannot be
understood in isolation from children’s experience of their ecological contexts. The proposed study is among
the first to integrate neural assessments with multidimensional assessments of environmental stressors and
protective processes in rural communities and begins following children at age 7 during a sensitive
developmental period for life-course-persistent effects on drug use vulnerability.
 Our core premise posits that the efficiency of cognitive control systems (cognitive control networks [CCN])
in modulating socioemotional systems (emotion, reward, and salience networks [ERSN]) is a mechanism
linking rural children’s exposure to adversity to their drug use vulnerabilities. We consider the multidimensional
nature of adversity and specify environmental experiences associated with threat, deprivation, and
unpredictability. However, considerable individual differences exist in the pathway linking adversity to drug use
vulnerability, a product of children’s exposure to family, peer, school, and community protective processes.
We propose to recruit 265 low-income, rural children (age 7) and their primary caregivers into a prospective
cohort study (following children from ages 7 to 10). Children will participate in fMRI scans to assess CCN
modulation of the ERSN. To assess exposure to adversity and social-ecological protective factors, we will
obtain rich multi-level information that can be used to test the following aims: 1) the influence of childhood
adversity on neural risk mechanisms, 2) the indirect influence of adversity on drug use vulnerability via neural
risk mechanisms, and 3) the moderating influence of family, peer, school, and community protective factors on
the links between childhood adversity neural risk as well as between neural risk and drug use vulnerabilities.
Multi-level research that effectively connects rural contexts, neuroimaging, and behavioral data is critical for
advancing the precision and specificity of developmental models of drug use resilience for this population."

African Americans (AAs) with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) have worse glycemic control and a 50% higher mortality
rate of diabetes compared to non-Hispanic Whites (NHWs). AAs with T2D have 3.2 times more hospital
admissions for uncontrolled diabetes compared to NHWs. Multiple, intertwined factors at the individual,
interpersonal, community, societal, and healthcare system levels contribute to lower adherence to diabetes self-
management, greater difficulty achieving glycemic control, and higher rates of microvascular and macrovascular
complications. The NIH Science of Behavior Change identifies interpersonal and social processes as one of the
three key mechanisms for behavior change, providing greater support for this strategy. Family is a critical social
context in which interdependence, collectivism, and extended family network is central to their way of life among
AAs. Indeed, focusing on the individual-level demonstrated only limited improvements in glycemic control for
AAs with T2D. Thus, effective multi-level interventions that promote adherence to diabetes self-management in
this vulnerable population are sorely needed. Our proposed phase I/II randomized controlled trial will not only
improve glycemic control for participants with T2D, but also engage family members in physical activity and
healthy eating strategies. The specific aims are: 1. to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a family-dyad-
focused diabetes intervention in AA adults with T2D and their designated family members; 2. to examine the
preliminary efficacy of the family-dyad-focused diabetes self-management intervention compared to a waitlist
control arm on: (1) glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) (primary
outcomes); and (2) blood pressure control (secondary outcome) in participants with T2D; and 3. to explore the
dyadic relationship (quality and support) and its association with a) changes in dyadic stress, physical activity
and dietary intake, and b) health outcomes (glycemic control, HRQOL and blood pressure control) over time in
participants with T2D. We will conduct a two-arm RCT. We will enroll 104 AAs with T2D and one family member
of each patient (104 dyads), randomized 1:1 to intervention or wait list control arm (n=52/arm). All participants
will undergo the standard usual care held at the pharmacy clinic. Patient-family-member dyads in the intervention
arm will receive 1) 14 session over 20 weeks of family dyad-focused, in-person group sessions on diabetes self-
management and family support; 2) family dyad-focused support component in each group session; and 3)
individual family feedback telephone sessions. All participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention
and six months after intervention. Our goals of the intervention are to encourage participants to (1) daily self-
manage diabetes and stress; (2) establish a healthy eating pattern reducing overall calorie and carbohydrate
intake; (3) engage in brisk walking of 150 or more minutes a week; and (4) use solution-focused problem-solving
strategy and supportive family communication skills. Our approach will add to the scientific knowledge and
identify interpersonal and social mechanisms in adherence to diabetes self-management among AAs."

In the kidney, the thick ascending limb (TAL) of the loop of Henle is critical for NaCl homeostasis and blood
pressure regulation. In humans and animal models of salt-sensitive hypertension, NaCl absorption is abnormally
increased in the TAL, where NaCl absorption depends on the renal transporter NKCC2, an apical Na+/K+/2Cl-
co-transporter. We showed that the presence of NKCC2 at the TAL apical membrane controls NaCl absorption
in this epithelium. The molecular mechanisms that control apical membrane NKCC2 levels involve endocytosis,
recycling and exocytic insertion. Inhibition of endocytic retrieval causes NKCC2 accumulation at the membrane
and increased NaCl absorption. Any gene or protein affecting NKCC2 endocytosis could potentially influence
NKCC2 activity and renal salt transport but only few proteins are known to bind NKCC2. Using a targeted
proteomics screen, we identified ALMS1 (Alström Syndrome 1) and ACTN4 (alpha-actinin 4) as interacting
partners of NKCC2. We also found that ALMS1 and ACTN4 interact with each other, raising the possibility that
these proteins form a complex. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in ALMS1 and ACTN4 are associated with
hypertension and decreased kidney function. We found that ALMS1 knockout rats have higher surface NKCC2
and high blood pressure. We found that ACTN4, a protein involved in podocyte biology, is also expressed
throughout the nephron, including the TAL. The roles of ALMS1 and ACTN4 in renal NaCl handling by the TAL
and their role in blood pressure regulation are unknown. We hypothesize that ALMS1 controls surface NKCC2
levels and NKCC2-mediated NaCl absorption by binding the carboxyl-terminus of NKCC2 and ACTN4 to mediate
NKCC2 endocytosis from the apical membrane. A decrease in ALMS1 or ACTN4 expression in the TAL
increases surface NKCC2, NKCC2-mediated NaCl reabsorption, tubulo-glomerular feedback (TGF) sensitivity
and leads to salt-sensitive hypertension. Our long-term goal is to increase our understanding of the role of
ALMS1 and ACTN4 in kidney NaCl transport."

Understanding the causes and mechanisms underlying circadian rhythm disruptions that are associated with
fatigue during cancer treatment remains unclear. This current deficiency means that successful cancer treat-
ment falls short of its potential and prior quality-of-life remains elusive for patients. Our long-term goal is to im-
prove debilitating behavioral sequelae in cancer patients, thus improving quality-of-life, other comorbidities,
and mortality. Thus, the overall objective here is to establish the potential role of circadian disruption as a fun-
damental pathway by which chemotherapy promotes cancer-associated fatigue. Indeed, robust circadian rhyth-
micity of virtually all physiology is extremely well-conserved; desynchrony of these rhythms leads to negative
health and behavioral consequences. The central hypothesis is that chemotherapy-induced inflammation inhib-
its SCN function leading to fatigue. The rationale for this work is that circadian circuitry disruption is an under-
studied, relevant pathway in psycho-oncology research that could elucidate mechanisms and new, rhythm-fo-
cused interventions. Three specific aims are proposed to test the central hypothesis using our novel breast
cancer “survivor” mouse model. Aim 1 will determine the ability of the master clock to entrain after chemother-
apy. Behavioral SCN rhythm adaptations to environmental challenges will be assessed. Aim 2 will identify the
role of central inflammation in master clock disruptions after chemotherapy. The role of chemotherapy-induced
neuroinflammation on SCN molecular and behavioral rhythms will be quantified. The potential resolution of fa-
tigue will also be assessed. Aim 3 will determine the role of circadian disruption in chemotherapy-induced fa-
tigue. Genetic and pharmacological SCN timing manipulations will precede a battery of behavioral assess-
ments of the physical, motivation, and cognitive components of fatigue. In vivo and ex vivo circadian timing ap-
proaches combined with systems-, cellular-, and molecular-level analyses will pinpoint the effects of two regi-
mens of chemotherapy on master oscillator circadian circuitry relevant to cancer-related behavioral comorbidi-
ties. The proposed research is conceptually innovative because using circadian approaches is new to psycho-
oncology. It is also technically innovative by way of the superior translational model and the circadian genetic
and pharmacological techniques planned. This research will result in essential new knowledge about how com-
mon cancer treatments affect the pacemaker, which is crucial to extensive downstream physiology and behav-
ior (i.e., beyond fatigue). Results will provide much needed evidence to make circadian-based approaches
standard in clinical practice, as well as inform the design of novel circadian-directed pharmacological and non-
pharmacological interventions. This research is applicable to other cancers and in non-oncological populations
treated with chemotherapy (e.g., stem cell transplant, lupus)."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell malignancy characterized by
poor clinical outcomes. Malignant transformation triggers expression of surface proteins that serve as “danger

cellular stress pathways. Natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize MICA/B with the NKG2D
receptor, which in turn induces cytotoxic functions against leukemia cells. However, they often escape
recognition by shedding MICA/B via an intriguing post-translational modification called proteolytic cleavage. In
previous and revolutionary study, we developed a series of MICA/B-targeted monoclonal antibodies that inhibit
the shedding of MICA/B by blocking the extracellular domain that undergoes an unfolding by disulfide isomerase,
which enables subsequent cleavage by metalloproteases. One of them was further characterized, and it
promotes NK cell-mediated immunity against solid tumors by dual signaling of NKG2D and Fc receptors.
Recently, we discovered that the antibody also promotes macrophage-driven immunity in AML models, by
enabling antibody-dependent phagocytosis of leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. In this setting,
MICA/B serve as “leukemia antigens” for Fc receptor-driven immunity, although contributions by NKG2D, NK
cells, and T cells were also detected. Now we developed a new version of this antibody, with three point
mutations in the Fc domain to increase the binding affinity to all three Fc activating receptors while maintaining
low affinity to the Fc inhibitory receptor. This new version is humanized and induces potent NK cell effector
functions against human AML cells, compared to the humanized wild type version. We also established mouse
models of human Fc receptor biology and both murine and human AML models, to establish the anti-leukemia
activity of our now enhanced molecule in vivo. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism-driven drug combination
regimen, whereby a histone deacetylase inhibitor (romidepsin) induces human leukemia cells to express MICA/B
mRNAs that are then translated to MICA/B proteins, which are followed by stabilization on cellular surface by
our antibody that inhibits the shedding. We propose that immunotherapy for AML can be achieved via this drug
combination, which increases the innate immunogenicity of leukemia cells. For these reasons, our studies will
generate important information about how to induce protective immunity against AML. Antibody-mediated
inhibition of MICA/B shedding is a new immunotherapeutic opportunity pioneered by us and now validated
independently by multiple pharmaceutical companies, one of which has recently began phase-I clinical trial
testing an antibody analog to ours, but the wild type version, in patients with advanced solid tumors. Therefore,
our studies will generate compelling rationale to test MICA/B-targeted antibodies in AML trials, by pharmaceutical
companies, ourselves in academia, or both by working in collaboration."

 RNA metabolism from synthesis, processing, translation to degradation is an integrated part of gene
regulation that ultimately determines the overall cardiac transcriptome complexity and reprogramming during
heart failure. RNA binding proteins are central to every process of RNA metabolism and therefore establishing
their roles in the onset and progression of heart failure should lead to novel disease mechanisms and potential
therapeutic targets. Earlier reports by the PI (Dr. Chen Gao) have revealed that global RNA splicing changes
are important part of cardiac transcriptome reprogramming in failing heart. Furthermore, this fetal-like RNA-
splicing reprogramming is regulated by RBFox1, a muscle enriched RNA splicing factor. However, in new study,
PI found cardiac RBFox1 gene also encoded a cytosolic isoform (RBFox1c) due to its own alternative mRNA
splicing. While the nuclear RBFox1n contributes to cardiac hypertrophic response through global alternative
splicing regulation as demonstrated by the PI, the functional role of the cytosolic RBFox1c in cardiac pathology
is yet to be explored. In preliminary studies both in vitro and in vivo, PI found the cytosolic RBFox1c played a
critical role in cardiac remodeling associated with reduced pro-inflammatory gene expression in stressed heart
muscle cells. This proposal aims at characterizing the non-canonical function of RBFox1c in cardiac disease
progression and exploring the RBFox1c mediated post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism in heart. It also
outlines an extensive career development plan for Dr. Chen Gao to complete postdoctoral training under the
supervision of Dr. Yi Xing and to transition into an independent investigator well equipped with a unique
combination of research skills, scientific insights and highly promising research pipeline.
 During the K99 phase of this proposal, the PI will characterize the functional impact of RBFox1c in cardiac
fibrotic response using both genetic mouse model and in vitro cultured cardiomyocytes. The second aim of the
K99 phase is to determine the molecular mechanism of RBFox1c mediated inflammatory gene repression.
During the R00 phase, the PI will characterize isoform specific impact of RBFox1 in cardiac physiology and
pathological remodeling using isoform specific manipulated mouse models. The PI will also explore the post-
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by RBFox1c in heart through BRIC-Seq, TRAP ribo-seq and
microRNA competition analysis. The proposed experiments will create exciting new opportunities of fundamental
discovery in an important yet vastly under-explored area in cardiac biology, and new insight will also fill an
important gap in the current understanding to the pathogenesis of cardiac remodeling induced by pathological
stress."
10812507,"Project Summary
AAA+ proteases remove toxic proteins and regulate many other important cellular processes
that promote health and prevent disease. At the same time, protein degradation must be
carefully regulated. AAA+ proteases assemble into multi-subunit structures with an internal
proteolytic chamber, accessible through narrow channels that exclude natively folded proteins.
This mechanism protects most proteins from unintended degradation and requires specific
substrates to be recognized, unfolded, and then translocated into the degradation chamber. In
the AAA+ ClpXP protease, for example, a ring hexamer of ClpX uses the energy of ATP
hydrolysis to unfold specific target proteins and translocate them into ClpP for degradation.
ClpXP is one of the best-characterized AAA+ proteases and is a paradigm for other ATP-
dependent proteases and AAA+ remodeling machines. These ATP-fueled enzymes perform a
wide variety of mechanical remodeling, transport, and regulatory tasks in the cell. In mammals,
loss of mitochondrial ClpP results in infertility, hearing loss, and growth defects, whereas
mitochondrial ClpX plays an important role in heme biosynthesis. Bacterial ClpXP can promote
pathogenesis and is a validated antibiotic target in M. tuberculosis. Substantial progress has
been made in understanding the general biochemical and structural features of E. coli ClpXP
and other AAA+ enzymes but important and fundamental questions concerning the molecular
mechanisms of these machines remain. For example, it is not known how ClpX identifies many
classes of N-terminal and C-terminal degrons, whether ClpX rotates with respect to ClpP
during normal function, whether proofreading helps ensure degradation specificity, how
multiple substrate chains can be simultaneously translocated through the ClpX channel, what
the detailed and interacts with polypeptide substrates during mechanical unfolding, whether
ATP hydrolysis can occur at multiple positions in the spiral ClpX ring or only at one or a few
special positions, and how the detailed ATPase cycle is coupled to mechanical work. The
experiments described in this proposal will address these questions and provide a conceptual
framework applicable to studies of the entire superfamily of AAA+ machines."
10805426,"ABSTRACT
 It has long been known that pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is an essential component of gene
expression in eukaryotic organisms, yet the past decade has seen a dramatic increase in our appreciation for its
role in regulating gene expression1. Most higher eukaryotes, including humans, regulate alternative splicing as
a tool for proteome expansion, and an ever-increasing number of human diseases are associated with mutations
in this pathway2,3. The mechanisms by which the spliceosome, which catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing, enacts this
regulation is a complex problem whose solution remains poorly understood yet will be critical to understanding
the etiology of many diseases. Proper regulation requires the spliceosome to faithfully assemble upon and
activate ‘cognate’ splice site sequences in the background of scores of aberrant, ‘near-cognate’ splice sites, yet
the spliceosome must balance this high fidelity splice site selection with the need for rapid, efficient splicing. At
the simplest level, improved knowledge of how the spliceosome achieves this balance will require understanding
both: (1) the landscape of cis-regulatory elements at splice sites that enable them to be distinguished as either
‘cognate’ or ‘non-cognate’; and (2) the mechanisms by which the spliceosome discriminates between such sites.
 In the work described here, we seek to better understand basic mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing regulation
by leveraging a powerful methodology recently developed in my lab called Multiplexed Primer Extension
sequencing, or MPE-seq. Our approach is unique in that it allows for the genome-wide detection of pre-mRNA
splicing intermediates. By combining this technique with rapid metabolic RNA labeling techniques developed by
others, my group has now determined the in vivo rates of both chemical steps of pre-mRNA splicing across the
complement of spliced transcripts in budding yeast. Remarkably, these data reveal a wide variation among the
rates, both between the two steps for individual transcripts and between different transcripts. The goals of the
work described here are to leverage the information derived from these experiments to push our understanding
of the principles that underlie this regulation."
10745329,"Loneliness—a subjective emotional state characterized by the perception of social isolation—is a
psychosocial stressor that is associated with increased mortality and chronic pain. Individuals who have
chronic pain and report loneliness experience greater pain-related interference in activities, depression, and
suicidal ideation. Importantly, there are potentially effective interventions that can be used to decrease
loneliness; however, there are no studies that have directly intervened on loneness among Veterans with
chronic pain. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Loneliness (CBT-L) intervenes on loneliness by addressing
negative beliefs that perpetuate loneliness, increase negative affect, and reduce one’s ability to engage in
social activities. For a Veteran with chronic pain, this is critical as addressing negative affect, and having a
sense that one has social support and engages social support are key aspects of increasing functioning. While
CBT for Chronic Pain (CBT-CP) comprises skills to promote social functioning, more robust efforts may be
needed to better address lonely while also addressing functional impairment.
 The proposed two-year study uses a novel application of a brief, phone-delivered, evidence-based
intervention, CBT-L, to decrease loneliness by modifying socially-relevant maladaptive thinking patterns,
increasing engagement in enjoyable and social activities, and improving problem solving skills. Participants will
be recruited nationally using online advertising. The objectives of the current proposal are to adapt CBT-L to
optimize its impact on Veterans with chronic pain, examine if the recruitment, retention, and treatment delivery
is feasible and if CBT-L is acceptable to participants, and assess parameters of key outcomes among
participants randomized to receive CBT-L versus CBT-CP to inform a subsequent larger clinical trial.
 To achieve these objectives, we will adapt a manual through an evidence-based, iterative process then
conduct one-arm trial of CBT-L (n=8) in Veterans with chronic pain reporting loneliness. After refining the
manual and procedures following the one-arm trial, we will randomize a total of 40 participants to receive either
CBT-L or CBT-CP. We will assess loneliness, the quality and quantity of social interactions, and pain outcomes
such as pain-related interference, and pain catastrophizing at baseline and after the treatment period. We will
also track participant flow, therapist adherence to the manual, participant homework completion and participant
satisfaction with the treatment."
10586208,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for veterans, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
represents the majority with a meager 5-year survival rate of ~23%. New therapeutic strategies are needed,
and elucidation of novel mechanisms controlling the tumorigenicity of NSCLC cells will provide the foundation
upon which to build. In this regard, the KRAS gene is mutated at a high percentage in NSCLC (~35%)
producing an oncogene, and our overarching hypothesis for this collaborative grant is that NSCLC tumors
with oncogenic KRAS require specific perturbations in sphingolipid metabolism to maintain cellular
homeostasis allowing for the genesis of cancer progeniture cells and the development of NSCLC. The
collaborative proposal is entitled, “The role of sphingolipids in the induction & maintenance of non-small cell
lung cancer by oncogenic KRAS”. The overall objectives of our three projects are: 1) Determine how &
when specific perturbations of sphingolipid biosynthesis occur during the formation of lineage cells required for
KRAS-induced tumorigenesis; 2) Determine the translation to human NSCLC; 3) Use OMIC-driven processes
to determine global perturbations in sphingolipid biosynthesis that are KRAS-dependent versus cooperative; 4)
Determine the link between sphingolipid biosynthesis and signaling pathways required for NSCLC formation
induce by the KRAS oncogene; and 5) Determine whether modulation of sphingolipid pathways is a plausible
therapeutic modality for treatment of this oncogenotype. The three projects are highly interactive, share overall
goals, collaborate on specific subaims, & leverage the strengths of each laboratory to achieve these objectives.
 This is Project#1, and we found that ceramide kinase (CERK), and its sphingolipid product, ceramide-1-
phosphate (C1P), were significantly enhanced in human NSCLC tumors and cells with mtKRAS. Genetic
ablation/inhibition of CERK dramatically reduced cell survival in mtKRAS versus wild-type KRAS NSCLC cells.
CERK inhibition synergistically reduced survival in mtKRAS NSCLC cells with standard of care therapeutics,
and CERK genetic ablation blocked tumor formation in the KRAS mouse model of lung cancer. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that mtKRAS NSCLC tumors are addicted to higher levels of CERK-derived C1P, which
are required for lung tumorigenesis and can be targeted to enhance therapeutic outcome (e.g., tailored
therapeutics).
 Mechanistically, mtKRAS NSCLC cells showed high levels of mitochondrial C1P (mitoC1P), and CERK is
also localized to the mitochondria. CERK inhibition induced the novel death mechanism, ferroptosis, in only
mtKRAS NSCLC cells, which was linked to loss of the VDAC1:tubulin interaction and AKT translocation to the
mitochondria. C1P activated AKT to induce a novel direct phosphorylation of VDAC1, and AKT signaling is
linked to VDAC1 phosphorylation (ser57 & thr65) in large mass spectrometric studies. Thus, we hypothesize
that CERK-derived mitoC1P is required for AKT translocation to this organelle for the phosphorlation of VDAC1
on ser57 and thr65, stabilization of the VDAC:tubulin interaction, and inhibition of ferroptosis. To validate our
hypotheses, we propose three specific aims (SAs): SA1: To determine the role of CERK-derived C1P in the
tumorigenic and therapeutic potential of mutKRAS NSCLC; SA2: Determine the role and topology of CERK-
derived C1P in suppressing ferroptosis in mtKRAS NSCLC; and SA3: Determine the mechanism of mitoC1P in
the induction VDAC1 phosphorylation by mitoAKT. These studies, via validation of our hypotheses, will
delineate a new signaling paradigm in mtKRAS NSCLC with implications in precision cancer therapeutics
targeting this oncogenotype."
10828800,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease with a median survival
from diagnosis of approximately six years despite modern treatments. Up to 1 in 20,000 people are affected,
and no available therapies cure or prevent this disease. PAH is characterized by pulmonary arterial endothelial
cell (PAEC) and smooth muscle cell (PASMC) dysfunction leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance
and death from right heart failure. Abnormal hemodynamic forces are the primary cause of PAH in some
patients, and in all cases may contribute to progression. The small pulmonary arteries in PAH are exposed to
both increases in shear stress and pressure forces. Increased shear stress has previously been shown to
cause EC changes mimicking those seen in PAH. Dr. Rayner has obtained preliminary data showing that
PAECs from subjects with PAH have divergent transcriptomic responses to pathologically high shear stress
when compared with controls. This suggests that patient abnormalities in shear-sensitive pathways may be a
potential unifying mechanism in PAH that could provide targets for future therapeutics.
Dr. Rayner’s overall goal is to define how shear and pressure forces combine with underlying patient factors to
drive vascular dysfunction and promote PAH. Dr. Rayner has a research program focused on applying novel
bioengineering techniques to the study of PAH. His research proposal will use a resistor-coupled microfluidic
device to allow pressure and shear forces to be evaluated both individually and in combination. Dr. Rayner has
also developed a novel pulmonary arteriole-on-a-chip (AOC) model that will be employed in this proposal to
evaluate EC-SMC signaling and coordinated vascular behavior. Dr. Rayner’s research goal will be
accomplished through three aims: 1) Evaluate the effects of shear and pressure on control and PAH PAECs in
a resistor-coupled microfluidic platform; 2) Determine how pressure and patient factors influence cell
phenotypes in PASMC-only AOCs; 3) Identify the effect of hemodynamic and patient factors on cell
phenotypes and PAEC to PASMC signaling within patient-specific multicellular AOC models.
These specific aims are well-aligned to the main training aims of Dr. Rayner’s Career Development Plan, which
are to gain essential additional training in pulmonary vascular cell biology, bioinformatics, and vascular
engineering. Dr. Rayner will gain these skills through a combination of formal didactics, experiential training,
and close mentorship by a world-class team of scientists with relevant expertise. These new skills will augment
his background in bioengineering and translational PAH research and facilitate his overall goal of developing
into an independent physician-scientist doing basic and translational research on PAH. With his own unique
engineered vascular platforms and the data generated through this research, Dr. Rayner will be well-positioned
to submit a competitive R01 proposal near the end of his proposed K08 research period."

Fibrosis underlies a vast number of cardiac pathological conditions, ranging from genetic cardiomyopathies to
ischemic heart failure. Although substantial progress has been made in identifying molecular signals that trigger
the characteristic activation of quiescent cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) and their transdifferentiation into
myofibroblasts (MyoFBs), far less is known about the mechanisms that govern their long-term fate and
persistence, which presents major obstacles to the development of effective anti-fibrotic therapies.
 This K99/R00 application describes a five-year research training plan that proposes to leverage (i) human
induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac fibroblasts (iPSC-CFs), (ii) engineered biomaterials with tunable
mechanical properties, and (ii) single-cell multiomics platforms to investigate molecular mechanisms that govern
MyoFB fate and plasticity. Given the well-established sensitivity of CFs and MyoFBs to extracellular matrix (ECM)
stiffness, the applicant Dr. Sangkyun Cho will test the hypothesis that modulation of ECM-mediated mechanical
signaling potentiates the de-differentiation of MyoFBs, by synergizing with soluble factors known to regulate
major pathways in fibrogenesis. In Aim 1 (K99), Dr. Cho will use reporter iPSC lines (with fluorescently tagged
canonical MyoFB ‘marker’ genes, e.g., CFP-TAGLN) and a novel dynamically softening hydrogel system to
characterize in real-time the effects of mechanical unloading on MyoFB fate. In Aim 2 (K99), Dr. Cho will
investigate the synergy between ECM softening and the TGF-beta pathway in regulating MyoFB states, (i) by
examining stiffness-dependent protein interactions among mechanosensitive transcription factors (e.g., yes-
associated protein 1 (YAP)), and (ii) by identifying epigenetic regulators downstream of ECM stiffness with single-
cell assay for transposase transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq). In Aim 3 (R00), Dr. Cho will identify
potential druggable targets along the cell’s mechanosensory apparatus, and test candidate compounds in
engineered heart tissues and a mouse model of pressure-overload induced hypertrophy and heart failure.
 The proposed studies build upon PI Dr. Sangkyun Cho’s well-suited prior training in biomaterials, proteomics,
and ECM mechanobiology, while providing new training opportunities in (i) reporter iPSC-CFs, (ii) single-cell
multiomics platforms, and (iii) animal models. Mentor Dr. Joseph Wu is a pioneer in iPSCs and cardiovascular
biology, and co-mentor Dr. Sarah Heilshorn is a leading expert in biomaterials and regenerative medicine,
whose mentorship complements that of Dr. Wu. Advisory Committee members Drs. Jeffery Molkentin (cardiac
fibrosis), Joseph Hill (heart failure models), and Michal Snyder (single-cell genomics) provide additional expertise
and guidance. In Summary, the well-tailored research training plan, exceptional mentoring team, and an
outstanding Environment at Stanford University are anticipated to help propel Dr. Cho toward his long-term goal
of establishing an independent research program at the intersection of bioengineering and cardiovascular
stromal biology."

Many pathologic or disease conditions can now be ascribed to disrupted osteocyte functions. However, a limited
number of osteocyte-enriched genes have been studied in bone disease. Our previous work focused on the
transcription factor SP7 and its role in regulating osteocyte dendrite formation. One major goal of this proposal
is to further elucidate the osteocytic function of SP7 and decode how SP7 regulates osteocytogenesis. To
address this fundamental question, I have developed a comprehensive approach based on in vivo and in vitro
methods to define the effect of an osteogenesis imperfecta-causing SP7 R316C mutation in osteocytes. Results
from these approaches, in combination with single-cell transcriptomics and complementary bioinformatic
analysis, will illuminate the nature of the human R316C mutation in osteocyte development; this includes
determining whether this mutation selectively affects the osteocytic function of SP7, identifying direct target
genes that are selectively affected by this mutation, and how R316C influences osteocytogenesis by capturing
the osteocyte subpopulations that are blocked by this mutation from maturation. To perform transcriptomic
profiling of developing osteocytes, I will develop novel laser-assisted microdissection methods to isolate viable
matrix embedded cells for single cell RNA-sequencing. Like neurons in the brain, osteocytes in bone
communicate with one another through an extensive network of dendritic connections. I will perform bioinformatic
analyses to identify genes with restricted expression in neurons and osteocytes, and the functional skeletal roles
of candidate shared genes will be tested in vitro and in vivo. Overall, the aims described in this proposal have
strong potential to define the role of osteocyte-specific genes (e.g., SP7) in bone, as well as uncover the
contribution of osteocyte-specific genes in human skeletal disease. Moreover, this work may lead to identification
of new pathways that can be targeted by therapeutics to ensure the osteoblast-to-osteocyte transition.
My long-term career goal is to obtain a tenure-track faculty position and successfully establish a lab that is at the
forefront of bridging the gap between osteocyte development and bone health. I expect the K99 phase of this
proposal, which includes completing the characterization of R316C mutation in mice and the identification of
direct targets and novel pathways affected by the R316C mutation, to take 1-2 years and result in at least one
high quality publication. The training and mentorship provided during the K99 phase will prepare me with strong
background and starting point for my continuing studies and grant applications as an independent investigator.
The following R00 phase of the award will then permit me to further explore the regulation of SP7 during
osteocytogenesis, as well as to examine the skeletal impact of neuron-osteocyte shared genes in vivo. Together,
these data will be used to justify future studies proposed in an R01 grant application that I expect to submit at
the beginning of the third year of the independent phase."

Pathogen recognition receptors and their associated adaptors are essential for the prompt detection of
pathogens and the subsequent initiation of effective host responses and restoration of homeostasis. Over the
last decade, Nod-like receptors (NLRs) have been on the forefront of innate immune research, and several
groundbreaking studies have been published, to which my research has contributed. Leishmania spp. are
parasites with global health importance, yet the role of NLRs and their adaptors during Leishmania spp.
infection has been an understudied area.
Receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) is an essential adaptor downstream of cytoplasmic sensors
NLRC1 and NLRC2, and play an important role in a wide variety of clinical settings including bacterial, viral and
fungal infections, as well as non-infectious inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory
bowel disease and metabolic diseases. However, the role of RIPK2 during cutaneous leishmaniasis remain
unknown. In this grant, we propose to investigate the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms involving
RIPK2 during Leishmania major (L. major)-induced cutaneous disease. Our preliminary work has already
elucidated several exciting features of the role of RIPK2 during L. major infection. We found that RIPK2-
deficient mice are highly susceptible to L. major infection. Unexpectedly, mice deficient in NLRC2 or both
NLRC1/NLRC2 are dispensable in L. major infection suggesting a novel sensor that function upstream of
RIPK2. Moreover, RIPK2 interacted with CARD9 to provide protection against L. major. Based on these
preliminary data, we propose that a novel Dectin-1/RIPK2/CARD9 signaling axis modulates anti-leishmanial
immunity.
Successful completion of this project will yield a better understanding of RIPK2 biology in general, unveil a
novel pathway involving RIPK2 in signal transduction, and potentially identify therapeutic targets to ameliorate
Leishmania spp.-associated pathology.

10766248,"Chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer recurs in ~85% of patients and contributes to high rates of cancer-related
mortality. The reprograming of cellular metabolism towards anaerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) is an
important mechanism of chemotherapy resistance. Precision medicine targeting the unique metabolic state of
cancer holds great promise to improve the efficacy of ovarian cancer treatment and reduce chemotherapy
resistance. From a comprehensive analysis of metabolic pathways in our patient-derived ovarian tumors and
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, we discovered that a key mitochondrial enzyme, succinate
dehydrogenase (SDHA), is significantly upregulated in 19% of ovarian cancer patients, and is associated with
significantly improved patient survival. Our preliminary studies indicate that elevated SDHA increases
mitochondrial pyruvate carrier 1 (MPC1) protein expression, which increases pyruvate import to mitochondrial
leading to reversal of the Warburg effect and suppression of cell proliferation. In addition, our preliminary data
shows that elevated SDHA contributes to imbalance of redox systems, which may sensitize ovarian cancer cells
to chemotherapy and/or agents that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). The overall goal of this study
is to determine the mechanism by which elevated SDHA alters ovarian tumor biology to take full advantage of
druggable metabolic vulnerabilities such as increased sensitivity to chemotherapy and/or ROS-generating
agents to improve patient survival. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanism by which elevated SDHA
reprograms cellular metabolism to regulate ovarian cancer cell proliferation. We will overexpress or knockdown
SDHA in ovarian cancer cell lines followed by metabolic and functional characterization of the cells including an
evaluation of glycolysis, oxygen consumption and pyruvate transport into mitochondria by Seahorse XF
Technology, mass spectrometry and metabolic tracer analyses. We will explore the independent roles of
elevated SDHA, SDHA substrates (succinate, fumarate), or MPC1 in reprograming of cellular metabolism and
cell proliferation. In Aim 2, we will determine if elevated SDHA, by impairing cellular redox regulation, increases
ovarian tumor sensitivity to chemotherapy (cisplatin/paclitaxel) and/or a ROS-generating agent (elesclomol). We
will test the effect of SDHA on increasing mitochondrial-dependent respiration and ROS generation by
performing respirometry analyses. Finally, we will test in vivo if SDHA-amplified ovarian tumors show better
responses to chemotherapy and/or elesclomol using selected patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). The
immediate contribution of this project is to explore the novel role of SDHA in changing mitochondrial energy
metabolism to improve ovarian cancer patient survival by suppressing of tumor growth and/or increasing the
effectiveness of chemotherapy to kill tumor cells. This study is a critical step toward our long-term goal, to
develop innovative ways to precisely modulate ovarian cancer-specific metabolism to improve patients’ response
to therapy and survival."

The precise establishment of neuronal connectivity during development is critical for normal nervous system
function. This research examines how growth cones, which are the pathfinding structures of the developing
neuron, connect with their appropriate targets. External cues regulate neuronal connectivity formation by
resulting in the activation of intracellular signaling pathways and ultimately, reorganization of the cytoskeleton
and adhesions. This proposal focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms linking extracellular
signaling with intra-axonal local translation in the developing nervous system. Local translation in axonal
growth cones is necessary for axon growth and guidance, however our understanding of how local translation
functionally directs axon guidance is limited. We recently demonstrated that point contacts, adhesion sites
within growth cones, are a strategic location for targeted local translation. Point contact adhesions directly
regulate axon guidance by linking the extracellular matrix to the intracellular actin cytoskeleton and providing
the force for growth cone movement. Thus, this finding is important because it suggests that local translation of
certain mRNAs at adhesions are situated to have a maximal impact on axon guidance. Point contacts are likely
a fundamental puzzle piece that has been missing from our understanding of how local translation functionally
directs axon guidance. Accordingly, our hypothesis is that local translation of β-actin mRNA is necessary
for point contact dynamics, and point contacts are localized organizing nodes for translational
regulation. We will test this hypothesis by determining if locally translated β-actin is integrated into point
contacts to direct axon guidance (Aim 1) and elucidating the signaling pathway through which extracellular
matrix-induced signaling stimulates intra-axonal mRNA translation (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will resolve the
suite of mRNAs that are locally translated in response to extracellular matrix proteins, and their relationship to
point contacts (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed aims will break new ground by discovering the interactions
between the extracellular matrix, point contacts and local translation in the regulation of axon guidance. This
research will enable a broad, mechanistic understanding as to how mRNA trafficking and local translation
contributes to the establishment of neuronal connectivity, and increase our knowledge about the complex
nature of brain development."

This research has the potential to discover phosphonate natural products with useful bioactivities and interesting

duce useful molecules and their derivatives."
10878729,"Abstract. The human intestine harbors an estimated 100 trillion microbes that are increasingly recognized to
promote health through tonic immune stimulation. These include innocuous commensal microbes along with
pathobionts - those capable of causing gut dysbiosis or invasive infection. Most of what we currently understand
about host-microbe commensalism has been evaluated through the lens of bacteria. However, microbes from
other taxonomic domains, including eukaryotes, also ubiquitously colonize mucosal tissues and yet our
understanding of how these microbes establish commensalism and drive immunological changes remains
rudimentary. This gap in knowledge is especially significant for the most common fungal pathobiont Candida
albicans, which can translocate out of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and cause life-threatening systemic infection,
particularly in immunocompromised individuals. To address these fundamental gaps in knowledge, an instructive
model of C. albicans intestinal colonization in mice was developed. Recombinant C. albicans cells were
engineered to express defined model antigens and used to establish colonization so that T cells with surrogate
C. albicans specificity could be identified. Using this model, we show that C. albicans cells colonizing the GI tract
result in action at a distance - they drive the systemic accumulation of fungal-specific Th17 CD4+ T cells. These
T cells work together with IL-17 and activated neutrophils to provide protection against a systemic infection by
C. albicans as well as by extracellular bacterial pathogens. These results highlight the protective benefits of
commensal C. albicans cells residing in the GI tract, and suggest that co-evolution with this species has led to a
mutually beneficial relationship. However, important questions remain as to how C. albicans cells in the gut prime
systemic immune responses, and how Th17 signals can be triggered without excessive inflammation. This line
of investigation builds upon exciting preliminary data generated together by the laboratories of Dr. Way and Dr.
Bennett, two investigators with complementary expertise in clinical infectious disease/cellular immunology and
mycology/fungal pathogenesis, respectively. This proposal will address the molecular and cellular mechanisms
by which C. albicans cells interact with mucosal host tissues to drive gut local and systemic immunity through
the following specific aims: (1) Define how C. albicans morphological changes drive systemic Th17 immunity, (2)
Establish the fungal ligand and host pattern recognition receptor(s) that prime systemic Th17 immunity, and (3)
Investigate the role of reactive oxygen species and Duox2 (Dual Oxidase 2) for local and Th17 immunity primed
by C. albicans cells. Each of these specific aims is supported by extensive published and unpublished preliminary

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of retinal dystrophy and can be caused by mutations in any
one of dozens of rod-enriched genes. The genetic heterogeneity of RP represents a major challenge for the
development of effective therapies. For this reason, gene-independent treatments for RP have become a long-
sought goal in vision research. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that knockout of the rod-specific
transcription factor Nr2e3 prevents photoreceptor degeneration in multiple mouse disease models. In Specific
Aim 1, we will characterize the neuroprotective effects of developmental Nr2e3 knockout in multiple models of
photoreceptor degeneration, including a light-damage model and four mechanistically diverse models of RP
(Pde6brd10/rd10, RhoP23H/+, Rho-/- and Cngb1-/-). We will use a combination of molecular, cellular, physiological, and
behavioral assays to evaluate the efficacy and versatility of this therapeutic approach. In Specific Aim 2, we will
evaluate the therapeutic potential of acute, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivered, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated
Nr2e3 knockout in the same four mouse RP models used in Aim 1. For each model, we will evaluate the ability
of acute Nr2e3 knockout to protect photoreceptors at multiple stages of degeneration. We will also compare the
effects of acute Nr2e3 knockout to those of Nr2e3 overexpression, which has also been suggested to prevent
degeneration. Together, these studies will test the effectiveness of Nr2e3-based reprogramming as a gene-
independent therapy for RP. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will determine the effects of acute Nr2e3 knockout in
wild-type mouse rods and identify neuroprotective factors downstream of Nr2e3. We will first compare the effects
of acute Nr2e3 knockout to those of developmental Nr2e3 knockout. We will then perform RNA-seq on Nr2e3-
knockout rods to generate a list of Nr2e3-downstream candidate effector genes. We will knockout or overexpress
selected candidate genes, singly and in combination, in four mouse models of RP to identity those that confer a
neuroprotective effect. If successful, these studies will establish Nr2e3 knockout as a novel gene-independent
therapy for RP, paving the way for future studies in large-animal models of photoreceptor degeneration and for
clinical studies in human patients."

 The goal of this proposal is to understand nature’s well-controlled chemistry that occurs in
metalloenzymes, by developing the necessary tools and applying them to follow the structural dynamics of the
protein and chemical dynamics of the metal-catalyst. For this purpose, we will use X-ray crystallography and
X-ray spectroscopy techniques at X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs).
 Although the structure of enzymes and the chemistry at the catalytic sites have been studied
intensively, an understanding of the atomic-scale chemistry requires a new approach beyond the conventional
steady state X-ray crystallography and X-ray spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures. Following the dynamic
changes in the geometric and electronic structure of metalloenzymes at ambient temperature, while
overcoming the severe X-ray damage to the redox active catalytic center, is key for deriving the reaction
mechanism. The intense and ultra-short femtosecond (fs) X-ray pulses from XFELs provide an opportunity to
overcome the current limitations of room temperature data collection for biological samples at synchrotron X-
ray sources. The fs X-ray pulses with shot-by-shot sample replacement make it possible to acquire the signal
before damage occurs and the sample is destroyed.
 We will design and apply a suite of time-resolved X-ray diffraction and X-ray absorption/emission
spectroscopy methods, that make use of the unique properties of the XFEL beam. This will provide an
unprecedented combination of correlated data between the protein and the co-factors, all of which are
necessary to understand the interplay between the geometric structure of the protein and electronic structure
of the metal complex, and the functional consequences. Spectroscopy, both emission and absorption
spectroscopy, will provide the time-evolution of the electronic structure, while simultaneous room temperature
X-ray crystallography will help us visualize the changes in the geometric structure of the overall protein.
 We will use these methodologies to study some of the most important metalloenzymes in biology to
gain insights into the catalytic mechanisms, including mono, and dinuclear systems both with homo- and
hetero-metallic centers. A representative example of these systems are Fe enzymes for oxygen and C-H bond
activation where the involvement of high-valent Fe are proposed, such as the heme containing Cyt P450
systems, non-heme enzymes ribonucleotide reductase (Mn/Fe and Fe/Fe), and methane mono oxygenase
(Fe/Fe). We will also focus on Ni and Ni/Fe enzymes relevant to H2 generation and methane metabolism, and
functional analogs of the important class of heme-copper oxidase systems engineered into simpler proteins."

Although older adults in public housing face serious threats to their heat-related health, current assessment
and mitigation frameworks neglect physiological conditions and place-based infrastructural and social
inequalities. Our long-term goal is to develop quantifiable measures and dose-response relationships between
the density and characteristics of urban green infrastructure (GI) and heat-related health outcomes for older
adults, which can inform community planning and resilience policies that support aging in place during current
and future climate conditions. Our objectives are to: 1) assess heat-related health risks for older adults in
public housing neighborhoods; 2) determine the effects of green infrastructure on micrometeorological
conditions and heat stress; and 3) evaluate the extent to which neighborhood GI mitigates heat-related health
risks via emotional, cognitive, and social pathways. Our central hypothesis is that neighborhood GI
characteristics are associated with a reduced risk of heat-related illness for older adults in public housing. To
achieve Aim 1, we will perform heat-related health risk assessments using the population vulnerability
framework, which integrates exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Biometeorological exposure will be
evaluated based on a novel human heat stress model that accounts for the physiology of older adults;
sensitivity and adaptivity will be assessed using social and infrastructural stressors. To achieve Aim 2, we will
develop 3-dimensional measures of GI characteristics using remote sensing data and street-level imagery and
video classifications and identify inter- and intra-neighborhood GI attributes that relate to micrometeorological
parameters and heat stress in older adults. To achieve Aim 3, we will conduct a 2-wave panel survey with
multi-stage sampling of older adults in public housing neighborhoods in Houston and Chicago. By comparing
baseline measures collected in the spring wave with those during heat conditions in the summer wave, we will
assess the sociopsychological pathways through which neighborhood GI is associated with heat-related
health/behavioral outcomes and subjective well-being. The research proposed in this application is innovative
because it develops heat-related health risk assessments that integrate a novel age-specific human heat-
stress model. It also focuses on GI as a modifiable risk factor and adopts a socioecological perspective to
elucidate the extent to which individuals’ interaction with their neighborhood’s green infrastructure can
moderate heat-related health risks via emotional, cognitive, and social pathways. The proposed research is
significant because it is expected to provide strong scientific justification for heat assessment and mitigation
frameworks that clarifies the complex transactions between the community-level socioenvironmental
infrastructure and an individual’s health. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to offer new public health
and environmental planning policies that enhance community resilience and promote climate equity."
10808977,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 To reduce the unmet health care needs among children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), one
state-level policy response has been legislations that require private health insurers to provide coverage for
ASD-related services, known as state autism insurance mandates. By 2019, insurance mandates were
enacted in all states and the District of Columbia. Several studies have documented substantial variations in
state autism insurance mandates. However, there is a paucity of evidence about whether children with ASD in
the states with more generous mandates have fared better than those living in the states with more limited
mandates. Identifying this evidence is of critical importance given the fact that children with ASD have complex
health conditions and require affordable, comprehensive insurance coverage to meet their health care needs
either under normal circumstances or during unusual times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also
unknown which specific mandate policy features matter most for reducing unmet needs among this group of
children and maintaining or increasing their health care utilization during the pandemic.
 This proposed project aims to fill the evidence gaps by examining each of these issues. Our goal is to
contribute to the knowledge base that can inform decision-making on health care financing for children with
ASD. Specifically, we will carry out the following Aims: (1) Use national survey data to assess the extent to
which more generous state autism mandates improve health care access and reduce unmet needs for children
with ASD before the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) Use nation-wide insurance claims data to assess the extent to
which more generous state mandates increase service utilization and spending for children with ASD, by
setting (outpatient, ED, inpatient, home) and care type (medical, behavioral, pharmacy), before the pandemic,
and (3) Use both national survey and claims data to assess whether and to what extent more generous state
mandates help maintain or increase access, utilization, and spending for children with ASD from before to
during the pandemic.
 To examine the Aims, we will adopt difference-in-differences and triple-differences approaches, both of
which are rigorous quasi-experimental designs. The proposed study is unique in examining how health care for
children with ASD is affected by the generosity of state mandates in general and by type of mandate policy
feature in specific. The proposed study is timely since its findings have the potential to inform policy-making on
expanding insurance benefits and closing coverage gaps for children with ASD as the nation fights the
pandemic and potentially embarks on new rounds of health system reform. Our study results will also be
relevant to broader debates around optimal design of essential health benefits, a topic of great interest to
policy-makers and researchers, especially in the past decade."

At least 400 older adults a day are discharged from US emergency departments (EDs) and within 72 hours
experience a return ED visit resulting in hospital admission (RVA). Geriatric RVA have dramatically higher
morbidity and mortality than patients admitted to hospital on their initial ED visit. These outcomes, combined with
the clinical complexity of geriatric presentations, demonstrate a critical need for clinical decision support (CDS)
for ED discharge decisions and improved post-ED care management in older adults. National guidelines
recommend that all older adults receive formal risk screening in the ED. Existing geriatric ED risk assessment
tools lack predictive validity and are not designed to identify the multifactorial risk of an RVA event within 72
hours after ED discharge. Our long-term goal is to improve the outcomes of older adults using machine learning
models for clinical decision support (CDS) in emergency medicine. The goal of this study is to develop and
validate a machine learning model that predicts geriatric emergency medicine 72-hour RVA (GEMRA), and can
be used as a feasible ED CDS tool. In order to maximize the impact and generalizability of GEMRA across a
wide range of US ED environments and populations, the model input variables used will be clinical data collected
in the course of normal clinical care, and thus widely available in emergency health records (EHRs). GEMRA
will be developed and validated with data from five diverse hospitals across two health systems that span a wide
range of demographic, socioeconomic, and ethnic backgrounds. The study will be conducted by a closely
collaborating interdisciplinary team that includes emergency medicine, machine learning, and CDS experts, with
extensive experience in geriatric emergency medicine research as well as developing and evaluating
technological driven interventions to improve post-ED outcomes. Our preliminary work demonstrates that an
early machine learning model using 478 clinical data input variables can accurately identify ED patients at high
risk of RVA, outperforming an existing, unvalidated traditional RVA risk score that used six clinically derived risk
factors. Our specific aims include: (1) Optimize GEMRA through model refinement, validation with retrospective
data from unseen populations, as well as explanation of model performance variation across different clinical
subgroups; (2) Assess GEMRA's clinical value through prospective validation at three different hospitals,
comparing model performance to existing ED geriatric and RVA risk tools, as well as real-time clinician judgment;
(3) Engage multidisciplinary stakeholders in the design of both a GEMRA CDS prototype and a complementary
multidisciplinary clinical RVA risk assessment workflow; and subsequently evaluate the feasibility of these
products in ED clinical practice during a short-term pilot implementation study. Completion of these aims could
transform older adult post-ED risk screening, leveraging the computational power and scalability of machine
learning to identify patients at risk of early post-ED adverse outcomes. Subsequent implementation of GEMRA
CDS would inform risk-mitigating interventions, potentially impacting outcomes in this vulnerable population."

One of the barriers to therapeutic neural regeneration in humans is the absence of neural stem cells in most
regions of the adult brain. Nonetheless, it would be advantageous to induce regeneration from resident cells. In
addition, progress in the field would be accelerated if neural regeneration from resident cells could be
investigated using a genetic model organism. Toward this end, we have developed a novel adult neurogenesis
model in the Drosophila melanogaster central brain. We find that despite the absence of known neural
progenitors, cells in the adult Drosophila central brain proliferate following injury, giving rise to both new
neurons and new glial cells. Further, the new neurons project both axons and dendrites to specific target
regions. We also observe functional recovery of behavioral deficits, suggesting that the new neurons integrate
appropriately into neural circuits. Our results are paradigm-shifting because they suggest that resident brain
cells can mediate neural regeneration. Here, we propose to utilize the model to investigate the signaling
pathways and cellular mechanisms that regulate adult neurogenesis. Based on compelling preliminary data,
our central hypothesis is that adult-born neurons are responsible for functional recovery from brain injury and
that these neurons arise separately from adult-born glia. This hypothesis is supported by multiple lines of
evidence from our ongoing work. We have identified, and are now investigating, genes uniquely upregulated
during neural regeneration. The work proposed here will provide critical data about the molecular mechanisms
that underlie that adult neurogenesis. Our work is innovative and has translational relevance because it shifts
the focus of neural regeneration away from stem cell transplants and toward resident cell populations and it
may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets for the stimulation of brain regeneration in humans."
10810840,"Immunomodulation of Galectin-3 to Prevent Radiation-Induced Myocardial Fibrogenesis
 This application addresses the scientific goals of FOA-PA-19-112. More than half of life-threatening
thoracic cancers are treated with repeated doses of ionizing radiation. Unfortunately, the pro-inflammatory and
pro-fibrotic properties of ionizing radiation increase the cumulative risk of cardiac damage. Galectin-3 (gal3) is a
unique carbohydrate and peptide-binding molecule widely implicated in myocardial inflammation and fibrosis.
Increased myocardial gal3 expression is reported in models of cardiac irradiation, but it is unclear whether gal3
directly contributes to radiation-induced cardiac fibrosis. We aim to determine the function of gal3 in mediating
the inflammatory and fibrotic effects of radiation. We propose to test the hypothesis that gal3 mediates
radiation-induced myocardial inflammation and fibrosis, and that genetic or immunological modulation
of gal3 expression or function neutralizes these effects and is thus cardioprotective. The unique features
of this hypothesis are the concept that radiation exposure activates cardiomyocytes and macrophages to release
gal3, which then binds to high-affinity mast cell surface receptors inducing the release of inflammatory and fibrotic
mediators. Moreover, we have designed a new gal3 immunomodulatory vaccine that neutralizes gal3 after
single-dose intramuscular administration in a mouse model. To test the general hypothesis, we propose three
specific aims.
 In Aim I, we will determine the effects of gal3 modulation on inflammation, fibrosis, and cardiac function
after repeated exposure to thoracic radiation. We will use genetically engineered cardiomyocyte-selective gal3
gain-of-function mice to study gal3-myocyte-fibroblast pathways, and bone marrow transplanted mice to study
gal3-macrophage-fibroblast pathways. In Aim II, we will determine the contribution of gal3 released by
cardiomyocytes and macrophages to activate mast cells after in vitro irradiation, as well as the downstream
effects on cardiac fibroblast growth and collagen synthesis using a state-of-the art microchamber system. In Aim
III, we will compare the preventive and therapeutic effects of a new gal3-immunomodulatory vaccine on radiation-
induced cardiac fibrogenesis and dysfunction. The feasibility of this project is confirmed by the a) availability of
gal3 knockout mice for gal3 loss-of-function studies, b) cardio-selective and global gal3 overexpression mice
for cardiac and systemic gain-of-function studies, and c) Myeloablated mice engrafted with gal3-null or gal3-
overexpressing progenitor cells for macrophage-targeted gal3 loss-and gain-of-function studies. A safe and
highly potent gal3 inhibitor vaccine has been designed in our laboratory to study the therapeutic potential of gal3
inhibition. Expected project outcomes include the evidence that gal3 mediates cardiac fibrosis and dysfunction
after cumulative radiation exposure, and pre-clinical data on the protective effects of early gal3
immunomodulation. These studies have important therapeutic implications for timely and targeted interventions
in cancer patients susceptible to radiotherapy-induced myocardial fibrogenesis and loss of cardiac function."
10766785,"The incidence of diabetes in the US population has been rapidly increasing over the past several
decades. Type 1 diabetes is a result of β-cell death, or apoptosis of the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. While there are a variety of known triggers for β-cell apoptosis, most feed into pathways that lead to increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the β-cell. Unchecked accumulation of β-cell ROS can disrupt cellular homeostasis, cause oxidative damage, and lead to apoptosis. A typical adaptive response to increased ROS includes activation of the transcription factor NRF2, which stimulates the cell-protective antioxidant response and restores homeostasis. We recently found that tandem activation of interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor signaling and NRF2 in the β-cell couples autophagy to the antioxidant response, reduces β-cell ROS, and
protects against oxidative damage to increase β-cell survival in vivo. Importantly, we discovered that non-canonical actions of NRF2 in the mitochondria were associated with the stimulation of mitophagy, the selective degradation of mitochondria by autophagy. Collectively, these data lead to our hypothesis that autophagy and antioxidant response are coupled in the β-cell and that orchestration of these processes is essential for maintenance of β-cell homeostasis and diabetes prevention. The proposed work will incorporate both in vitro experiments using cultured islets/ β-cells and in vivo analyses in mice. We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) To identify the mechanism controlling NRF2 mitochondrial translocation and determine its role in β-cell
autophagy/antioxidant response coupling; and 2) To determine the in vivo contributions of autophagy/antioxidant response coupling to β-cell homeostasis. Overall, these experiments will define the role of autophagy/antioxidant response coupling in the adaptive response to stress and allow us to identify therapeutic targets guiding the signaling events within the islet under conditions known to lead to β-cell failure. My background in β-cell biology and resources within the Indiana Center for Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases makes me uniquely suited to accomplish the aims of this project."

 Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-1 infection suppresses viral replication, preserves and improves the
CD4+ T cell count and prevents disease progression. However, treatment with ART is not curative, and
interruption of therapy consistently unleashes viral relapse. The persistence of a viral reservoir following ART
is the major obstacle to an HIV cure. Proposed “shock and kill” strategies to activate and eliminate the HIV
reservoir are currently not informed by a knowledge of the T cell states or lineages that support latency. One
of the greatest challenges in latency research is to distinguish latent cells from non-latent cells, which is
inherently difficult to do without perturbing the latent state of the cells. With current approaches, cellular
activation is required to enumerate latent cells, which disrupts the very state that we would like to study. To
overcome this major roadblock to latency studies, we have developed an HIV-induced lineage tracing model
(HILT) in humanized mouse that irreversibly genetically marks infected cells. When combined with single cell
RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) approaches in HIV-infected, ART-treated animals, the result is an emerging
genomic resolution view of transcriptional states associated with HIV infection and latency. Preliminary studies
presented here begin to provide an unprecedented, single cell genomic classification of HIV-infected CD4 T
cell lineages and states during acute infection and during early antiretroviral treatment. In this proposal, we
explore single cell multi-omics of persistently infected human CD4 T cells in humanized mice and examine how
it responds to oligoclonal TCR activation versus homeostatic proliferation. The systems biology of T cells will
be used to dissect latent reservoirs in novel small animal models for HIV to understand how a reservoir is
generated and maintained in distinct cell states. Genomic analysis may be used to identify drugs or biologic
interventions that can push cells towards active HIV expression and are independent of cellular activation
state. These could be used to develop cure strategies aimed at enhancing expression and the progressive
decay of the latent reservoir. We hypothesize that a single cell multi-omics approach will elucidate
developmentally diverse T cell lineages and transcriptional states that harbor HIV reservoirs, and that each
cluster may display unique gene programs associated with HIV persistence. Reversing the expression of
factors associated with HIV persistence may reactivate the reservoir. Single cell multi-omics may unveil new
targeted strategies to purge HIV from different T cell states. The proposed study leverages a team with
expertise in HIV immunopathogenesis, humanized mice, single cell genomics, to deeply phenotype human T
cell reservoirs in novel small animal models."

The multitude of candidate cancer biomarkers being discovered across various laboratories hold great
potential to enhance the practice of precision medicine. However, it is a long and challenging process –
often culminating in failure – to rigorously develop and validate these biomarkers before they can be used
in clinical practice. In particular, phase III, IV, and V biomarker validation studies are expensive and time-
consuming to conduct; it is essential to carefully design and analyze these studies and to make the most
efﬁcient use of the specimens collected. Motivated by our collaborative work on biomarker development
for cancer early detection, this proposal seeks to develop cutting-edge statistical tools for analyzing phase
III and IV biomarker studies in order to accelerate the biomarker development process. The methods
proposed in Aim 1 target the selection of primary endpoints and inference procedures to accommodate
potential overdiagnosis when assessing screening efﬁcacy in phase IV trials. The methods proposed in Aim
2 enable the combination of phase IV samples with phase III samples in phase III biomarker development.
The methods proposed in Aim 3 integrate information from heterogeneous study cohorts (which differ in
screening modalities and eligibility criteria) when estimating design parameters for biomarker clinical utility
trials.
 Our statistical methods will have immediate applications to analysis of data from two cancer applica-
tions: i) the New Onset Diabetes (NOD) Cohort study and the Early Detection Initiative (EDI) study for
pancreatic cancer early detection, and ii) ﬁve low-dose CT (LDCT) screening cohorts and the Prostate,
Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening (PLCO) trial for lung cancer screening. Moreover, the
developed methodology will have broader application in other phase III and IV cancer biomarker studies
and will be valuable for advancing the NCI Early Detection Research Network (EDRN)'s current priority in
designing biomarker clinical utility trials. All statistical programs and algorithms developed in this proposal
will be made freely available to the public."
10892023,"The proposal challenges Hering’s theories of unitary conjugate and vergence commands that guide research
on the neural architecture of oculomotor systems and buttress strabismus intervention. In most oculomotor
research one eye is recorded, assuming that both eyes are “yoked”, rotating together. Yet most eye
movements acquire objects divorced from frontoparallel or midline trajectories, and their control is poorly
understood. While some evidence suggests the eyes are controlled independently, the assumptions of yoked
control nevertheless dominate oculomotor research. Consequently, neural oculomotor structures are
characterized as issuing cyclopean eye rotation commands. Recent monocular pursuit data from our lab argue
against yoked control of vergence movements, which continues to form the basis of almost all oculomotor
control models. We propose a new alternative model architecture with two synergistic components. One is
cognitive and cortical and it moves each eye slowly and separately. The other is reflexive and in the brainstem,
and it moves the eyes rapidly and conjugately as a pair. Our project has the potential to initiate revision of
strabismus assessment by questioning the validity of the critical AC/A ratio diagnostic, and potentially guide
clinicians’ decisions regarding intervention. Aims assess:
Aim 1. Does monocular viewing reveal hidden architecture of binocular eye movement coordination?
Our preliminary data show that during midline pursuit an occluded eye rotates inappropriately for the target’s
motion, often with conjugacy. This might be because the target is misperceived as displaced off the midline, or
eye rotation drifts in a random direction due to misperception of target depth. Alternatively, retinal motion in the
viewing eye triggers brainstem conjugate circuitry that adds conjugacy to the covered eye’s behavior as our
model postulates. We test if conjugacy arises because of misperceptions or of conjugate circuitry activation.
Aim 2. Do asymmetric eye movements reveal contributions of conjugate and independent systems? In
our model, the output of the rapid conjugate system is combined with that of a system that rotates each eye
slowly and independently. We will test predictions of the model concerning how inappropriate ocular intrusions
with Müller alignment and curiously slow midline saccades occur, as well as how asymmetric eye movements
acquire targets in 3D space.
Aim 3. Is the independent system influenced by cognition while the conjugate system is not?
In our data, monocular viewing of an object moving in depth often succeeds in driving vergence pursuit in the
covered eye but fails completely to drive vergence saccades. Furthermore, in the dark, smooth vergence
follows self-generated limb motion, but inappropriate, apparently reflexive conjugate saccades occur when
looking between thumbs “aligned” at different depths. We will test if only the slow system or rapid one is
influenced by cognition, and if they use endogenous signals to track targets."

As the cost of genome-scale sequencing continues to decrease and new technologies for genome editing
become widely adopted, the laboratory mouse is more important than ever as a model system for
understanding the biological significance of human genetic variation and for advancing the emergence of
genomic medicine. The Mouse Genome Database (MGD) has a unique and strategic role as a community
resource for facilitating the use of the laboratory mouse for understanding genomics underlying human biology
and disease. MGD serves three major user communities: (i) biomedical researchers who use mouse
experimentation to investigate genetic and molecular principles of biology and disease processes, (ii)
translational scientists who use the laboratory mouse to model human disease, and (iii) bioinformaticians/
computational biologists who use the rich integrated data MGD provides to develop algorithms and
bioinformatics tools for data analysis and interpretation.
During the project period, we will continue to curate and integrate new genetic, genomic, variant, functional,
phenotypic, and human disease model data essential to researchers using the laboratory mouse in biomedical
research. We will make these data freely available through a variety of web-based and programmatic user
interfaces. Our core aims include: (i) maintaining the canonical catalog of mouse genome features, (ii) serving
as the authoritative data for mouse functional annotations, and (iii) maintaining a comprehensive catalog of
mouse mutations and strains and their phenotype and disease model associations.
To support our aims, we will maintain cost-effective software, database, and hardware using industry best
practices. We will maintain MGD's secure infrastructure through regular maintenance, upgrades, and planned
evolution. We will leverage existing software components from the Alliance of Genome Resources and other
resources where possible and focus our software development activities on unique infrastructure needed to
support our core aims.
To ensure the greatest impact of MGD in the broader scientific community, we will provide robust user support
and outreach through online user documentation, tutorials, training workshops, and one-on-one assistance
using a variety of communication modalities and major social media tools. We will actively solicit community
input, data submissions, and collaborations."
10766842,"Glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are a family of large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides produced in mammals and
other organisms. GAGs play diverse roles in tissue development/growth, inflammation, blood coagulation, viral
infection, and amyloid plaque formation. As a result, GAGs have been used as biomarkers for many diseases.
They are also the most widely used anticoagulant in medicine. Because of their biological activities, interest in
structure-activity relationships of GAGs has always been high. However, due to their size, complexity and het-
erogeneity, analysis of GAG structures using conventional ensemble techniques has always been challenging.
There is currently no method to sequence these important polysaccharides. We have been exploring single-
molecule techniques for determining GAG structures for several years. In this proposal, we want to explore the
possibility of using fluctuations in the electrical conductance of GAG lyases to elucidate the structures of GAGs.
This idea originates from our work on single protein conductance measurements that showed many non-redox
active proteins can conduct electricity. In addition, the conductance of proteins is often sensitive to conformation
dynamics triggered by substrate binding or catalytic activity, allowing them to act as single-molecule sensors for
substrates. We have applied such measurements to DNA polymerases and showed current fluctuations in the
polymerase correlated with enzyme conformation changes during DNA replication. The generalization of this
idea potentially allows any biopolymer to be sequenced as long as a processive metabolizing enzyme can be
found for the polymer. Such enzymes were usually scarce for GAGs. However, a new class of processive exolytic
bacterial GAG lyases that degrade GAGs from their reducing end has just been identified. In this proposal, we
want to apply this technique to this class of enzymes to determine whether fluctuations in the conductance of
these lyases are reflective of the structures of the substrates being processed. Because such a method requires
no homogeneous samples, can sequence longer GAG polymers, and can provide high-resolution information,
we think its realization will be a dramatic improvement over all existing techniques. In particular, we want to
complete the following two aims: 1) Leveraging the technologies we developed to connect DNA polymerases to
electrodes, we will design and produce lyases that can be attached to electrodes specifically and optimize the
anchoring points to maximize conductance and sensitivity to substrate binding while retaining the enzyme activity.
2) We will prepare a library of structurally defined GAG ligands and probe the enzymes with the ligands to de-
termine if the substrate-induced fluctuations in the enzymes’ conductance contain information that can be used
to identify the structures of the substrates. Completion of these aims will provide the crucial foundation for real-
izing the goal of developing a general method for sequencing GAGs."
10757739,"SUMMARY
Hypertension is a primary modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal disease, and is
the largest individual contributing factor to disease and mortality in the world. Salt-sensitive hypertensive
individuals, who comprise 30-50% of the hypertensive population, have greater mortality than subjects with salt-
resistant hypertension and exhibit renal end-organ damage. Immunity and inflammation are implicated in
hypertension and renal damage in humans and experimental animal, but the mechanisms triggering immunity in
hypertension are not understood. Dietary components other than salt can also play an important role in the
development of cardiovascular disease and hypertension. Interestingly, an inverse relationship has been
demonstrated between plant protein intake and blood pressure, ultimately associating health benefits with
greater plant protein consumption. We recently discovered a novel link between dietary protein intake, immune-
activation, and hypertension in the Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rat, a rodent model of human disease.
The experiments in this proposal will test the overarching hypothesis that free radical production from
phagocytic NOX2 in infiltrating CD4+ T cells in the kidney of Dahl SS leads to an inappropriate elevation of renal
vascular resistance (RVR), a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the retention of sodium, and the further
development of hypertension following high salt feeding. As a corollary to this hypothesis, we propose that the
microbial metabolite carnitine, released by consumption of animal-based diets, upregulates NOX2 in T cells and
amplifies salt-sensitive hypertension. In contrast, the metabolite propionate, released from consumption of grain-
based diets, downregulates NOX2 and diminishes the full amplitude of salt-sensitive hypertension. The
hypothesis will be addressed in two specific aims. Aim 1 will address the mechanisms whereby alterations in
dietary protein source affect the release of metabolites from the gut microbiota and determine the influence of
these metabolites on NOX2 in T cells and in the development of salt-sensitive hypertension. Aim 2 will address
the role of phagocytic NOX2 in CD4+ T cells as a mediator of inappropriately increased renal vascular resistance
and the development of salt-sensitive hypertension in Dahl SS by adoptive transfer of either wild type or NOX2-
deficient CD4+ T cells into SS rats lacking T cells. This work will transform the understanding of salt-sensitive
hypertension by utilizing novel animal models and approaches to demonstrate the mechanisms whereby dietary
protein intake modifies immune mechanisms which serve to amplify disease severity. These studies should
reveal new paradigms and provide insight with the potential to transform clinical/therapeutic approaches for the
treatment of salt-sensitive hypertension."
10930953,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Two-thirds of lysosomal storage disorders (LSD) affect the brain, yet most LSD treatments do not improve
central nervous system (CNS) symptoms. Several trials of brain-directed gene therapy have failed to show
clinical benefit despite restoring protein expression in the CNS. Outcomes are especially poor in subjects who
have developed neurologic deficits, suggesting rescue of expression alone may be insufficient to correct
function once diseased neuronal circuits are established.
In CLN3 Disease, a representative LSD and the most common cause of pediatric dementia, patients develop
blindness, seizures, and dementia. Several CLN3 disease mouse models have been developed. While all
recapitulate the storage accumulation seen in patients, behavioral phenotypes are subtle and variable. To
overcome this limitation, we identified robust, reproducible phenotypes on network-level electrophysiology
studies in two CLN3 models, a knockout and a human mutation model. Unlike histopathology, physiologic
measures directly reflect function and, therefore, may be a better readout for therapy development.
Our work suggests CLN3 disease, traditionally considered a degenerative disorder, disrupts early
neurodevelopment, especially in the hippocampus, a vulnerable region in CLN3 disease. On in vitro voltage
sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) and in vivo electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, Cln3-/- mice have decreased
excitability of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), faster EEG background activity, and loss of hippocampal
sharp wave ripples, oscillations that encode new memories. Also, DG neurogenesis is upregulated, perhaps as
a compensatory mechanism, early (2mo) but not later (6mo) in disease. Similar network changes arise in other
models of neurodegeneration including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Deep brain stimulation of the entorhinal
cortex has been shown to improve outcomes in mouse models of AD.
Previously, we found that very early Cln3 gene replacement at p0 corrects network dynamics in a Cln3
knockout mouse. Our central hypothesis is that abnormal neuronal circuit development will limit the
window of time, i.e. ‘therapeutic window’, when gene replacement will improve network physiology in
CLN3 disease. Furthermore, we predict that altering activity in a key circuit could modify the therapeutic
window and efficacy of gene therapy. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) define abnormal dentate gyrus development
in CLN3 disease mice, 2) determine the therapeutic window for correction of hippocampal circuit dynamics by
gene replacement, and 3) test if modifying entorhinal cortex activity alters circuit defects and response to gene
therapy. In this way we will use CLN3 Disease as a representative LSD, to explore the relationship between
network activity and response to gene therapy. Our long-term goal is to develop network-directed therapies
that, when combined with gene replacement, improve outcomes in LSDs."

 The capacity of the placenta to supply oxygen and nutrients from the maternal circulation, and eliminate
waste products from the fetal circulation, is critical for fetal development and is dependent on adequate
maternal- and fetal-placental perfusion. The clinical benefits of developing noninvasive tools for the in vivo
assessment of placental function are tremendous. They include the proper diagnosis of placental insufficiency
as a cause of fetal growth restriction, and detection of decreased fetal oxygen availability, allowing delivery to
be expedited to prevent neurological damage. This proposal combines the strengths of two investigative teams
with complementary methodologies, and builds upon our prior placental Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
achievements. Specifically, our team’s use of the pregnant nonhuman primate (NHP) has allowed development
of spatial modelling methods of placental function integrating dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI for
validation of T2* relaxation mapping. Our team have also developed novel MR imaging and data modeling
methods with simultaneous diffusion-encoded (IVIM-DWI) and multiecho spin-echo acquisitions. Initial clinical
application of these methods showed the potential to separately interrogate the materno-placental and feto-
placental circulations – this is a critical marker for identifying fetal hypoxia. The overall objective of this
proposal is to develop multi-modal MRI and modelling approaches, validated in a clinically relevant NHP
model, to provide robust quantitative methods for assessing placental health.
 The significance of our work derives from combining data generated from multiple contrast techniques that
provide estimates of placental perfusion and oxygen saturation, with gold-standard measurement of oxygen
level in the fetus and post-delivery measurement of the placental vascular structure in our translational NHP
model. By leveraging established and new computational modeling of placental blood flow and function, our
unique combination of advanced methods and rich data will let us measure the properties of oxygen transfer to
the fetal vasculature (Aim 1). The physiological interpretation of these quantitative parameters will be further
validated in studies subject to controlled changes in maternal oxygenation accompanied by measurement of
fetal oxygenation (Aim 2). The combination of these methodologies will allow us to quantify and validate the
variables that are of most interest to human placenta oxygen perfusion and transport over a range of relevant
fetal oxygen levels. The validation of our modeling methods will significantly improve the discriminatory power
of MRI in stratifying pregnancies where placental insufficiency and fetal hypoxia is suspected. Importantly, we
have acquired preliminary data in our NHP model that demonstrates the feasibility of the approach we are
proposing. Successful completion of the intended work will yield a set of novel non-contrast functional and
structural MRI placental summary statistics, validated in an appropriate animal model, which can be translated
to human studies for early identification of pregnancies at-risk for complications."

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis, affecting more than 9 million American adults, with a disease
burden rising worldwide. Despite substantial clinical consequences, gout care is inconsistent, with considerable
gaps in the evidence base. The primary contributor to heterogeneous gout care is a lack of agreement about
the value of achieving a target serum urate (SU), due to a lack of high-level evidence. Rheumatology
guidelines emphasize a treat to target serum urate (TTT-SU) approach (e.g., SU <6 mg/dL, a urate sub-
saturation point); however, citing the absence of evidence, SU is not even measured during urate-lowering
therapy in the vast majority of gout patients in primary care practice, where >90% of gout care occurs. We
aim to generate high-level evidence to resolve the guideline conflict by mobilizing rheumatologists and primary
care providers (PCPs). Furthermore, gout is a metabolic condition complicated by a high risk of myocardial
infarction, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and premature death, although it remains unknown whether gout
causally leads to these outcomes. Removing monosodium urate crystal deposition by lowering SU can reduce
gouty inflammation, likely by blunting the inflammasome pathway. However, it is unknown whether lowering SU
results in less kidney damage, better glycemic control, or reduced cardiovascular risk.
NIH funding allowed us to convene a conference in 2018 (R13AR073116) with PCPs and rheumatologists to
examine the existing data, define the controversies, and elicit input on the necessary information to fill the
critical evidence gap. Informed by this conference, we received funding in 2020 (AR076077) to plan a
randomized controlled trial (RCT). During the past 1.5 years, we carried out key activities to gain insights from
all relevant stakeholders. A modified Delphi Panel, including gout patients, nurses and physician assistants,
PCPs, and rheumatologists, came to consensus regarding key protocol decisions. Mock recruitment activities
allowed us to test and refine feasible procedures which will lead to successful pre-screening, screening, and
patient recruitment during the proposed multi-site RCT with the following two aims.
Aim 1) To conduct a RCT comparing TTASx with TTT-SU among patients with gout and hyperuricemia (HU).
We have developed a trial protocol acceptable for all relevant stakeholders that will effectively answer the
primary hypothesis that a TTT-SU strategy results in significantly fewer gout flares (primary outcome) over a
two-year follow-up than TTASx. To ensure equipoise and generalizability, we will recruit patients from PCP
practices. Aim 2) To test the effects of lowering SU on kidney function, glycemic status, and blood pressure
among patients with gout enrolled in the RCT. The corresponding hypotheses are that lowering SU to a greater
extent in the TTT-SU arm compared with TTASx will result in: a) slower decline in estimated glomerular
filtration rate; b) lower HbA1c; and c) improved blood pressure in gout patients."

 The enclosed application presents an approach for effective dendritic cell (DC) genetic antigen delivery to
trigger cancer-specific immune reactivity, predicated upon the use of a “hybrid” biomaterial-biological delivery
vector featuring a bacterial core within a polymeric coating. Support for the impact of the proposed study
includes emerging research demonstrating advances in DC vaccination to prompt sustained immune response
outcomes (≥10 years) with improved patient survival in Phase II clinical trials and current open Phase III trials.
However, there remain challenges to broad efficacy in that most metastatic patients still do not respond to
treatment, thus, presenting an unmet need to improve these immune-based strategies. Compounding this
limitation are the standard methods currently utilized for antigen delivery to DCs, with poor immunotherapy
outcomes hypothesized to be the result of ineffectual means of antigen delivery that do not consider the
cellular-level challenges to DC activation and antigen transport. Systematically dealing with every aspect of DC
interaction and antigen delivery, in our view, will have transformative impact on the field of cancer
immunotherapy. In response, we propose the application of a biological-biomaterial hybrid vector specifically
designed for DC interfacial recognition and antigen delivery. In so doing, we put forth the hypothesis that this
technology will address current limitations with DC-based antigen delivery and subsequent immunotherapy
effectiveness. The research strategy presents a plan to systematically test this hypothesis through a series of
specific aims designed to better assess hybrid vector interaction with and activation of DC (Aim 1); evaluate
DC intracellular trafficking of the hybrid vector and final gene delivery effectiveness as a function of vector
design (Aim 2); and examine the impact of hybrid vector delivery on DC-mediated T cell activation in vivo (Aim
3). The enclosed project is supported by a well-qualified and complementary team of biological engineers and
cancer immunologists capable of positioning the results for translational impact."

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) often has complex profiles of co-occurring medical conditions and is
associated with high risk of self-harm, including suicidality, which is a leading cause of death, particularly
among Veterans. There is a critical lack of advancement in PTSD pharmacotherapy, as illustrated by increased
use of off-label medications and polypharmacy (multiple drugs used simultaneously) with limited evidence on
their relative risks and benefits. Moreover, PTSD and suicidal and nonsuicidal self-harm often remain
undocumented in electronic health records (EHR). There is also poor predictability of disease outcomes since
there are frequent changes in pharmacological treatment and multiple modifying co-occurring conditions
including depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance use disorders, traumatic brain injury, and
sleep disorders. Our long-term goal is to improve diagnostics, secondary/tertiary prevention, and treatment
outcomes of PTSD and its co-occurring conditions via enhanced EHR utilization. To achieve our objectives, we
will analyze EHR and administrative claims data from Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and non-VHA
databases, collectively covering >1.8M patients with PTSD. Specifically, we aim to: (1) Identify undetected and
uncoded co-occurring mental health phenotypes that impact PTSD outcomes using machine learning and
characterize disparities in their documentation; (2) Create robust models, accounting for biases and
co-occurring conditions, to identify clinical trajectories of PTSD decompensation/recovery in response to
time-varying treatments; and (3) Compare risk of self-harm and hospitalization among PTSD treatments using
coded and imputed phenotypes through an international network study. We will compare the effectiveness of
PTSD psychotropic monotherapies, polypharmacy, and psychotherapy to guide the choice of treatment for
improved patient outcomes. By enhancing and validating a positive-unlabeled machine learning approach
developed by our team, we will impute unrecorded/undetected mental health conditions co-occurring with
PTSD in both VHA and non-VHA databases, and characterize factors associated with documentation
disparities. We will model disease trajectories with enhanced latent class / latent trajectory analysis, focusing
on self-harm, substance use disorders, and psychiatric hospitalization in PTSD. Finally, we will perform the
largest comparative effectiveness studies to date of PTSD treatments on >100 monotherapy and
polypharmacy regimens, in addition to psychotherapy interventions, using causal models and methods for
addressing biases. These studies will provide high-quality evidence on the risk of hospitalizations and suicidal
acts/self-harm. Successful completion of these investigations will improve the quality of clinical psychiatric
decision-making, and guide improved service delivery to the Veteran and non-Veteran populations with
PTSD/TBI, and/or high risk of self-harm/suicidality."

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in men, and the second most common cause
of cancer death for men. It is a high-incidence, high-fatality, high-morbidity and high-cost cancer that is growing
increasingly frequent in our aging population. Clinically, the majority of prostate cancers present as indolent, and
are unlikely to significantly influence a man’s health over his lifetime. Nevertheless, a significant number of
prostate tumors are diagnosed while localized but have substantial metastatic potential. Once these colonize
distant sites, they become almost uniformly lethal. Current standard of care for clinical risk-stratification involves
serum abundance of prostate specific antigen (PSA), a digital rectal exam and biopsy. While these are beneficial,
~30-40% of men are over- or under-treated. Therefore, a central problem in prostate cancer remains
understanding this dramatic variability in the aggressiveness of localized prostate cancers. We hypothesize
that the clinical and molecular evolution of localized prostate cancers are shaped by germline genomic
features. Strong preliminary data support this idea. Prostate cancer is the most heritable solid cancer. It shows
strong variability across ancestries, and specific genetic features predict both risk of incidence and disease
aggression. We will test our hypothesis with three complementary aims. Aim #1 quantifies germline-somatic
interactions using transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and pathway-somatic interaction analysis.
Aim #2 then identifies ancestry-based germline-somatic interactions. Finally Aim #3 will assess the
generalizability of germline-somatic interactions for clinical risk prediction by developing a targeted DNA-
sequencing panel and evaluating biomarker potential in large patient cohorts. To achieve these aims, we will
leverage publicly available datasets as well as biobanking repositories at UCLA, linked to both established and
novel bioinformatics methods. Together, these aims provide three complementary strategies to quantify how the
specific clinical and molecular evolutionary features of localized prostate cancer are influenced by specific
germline polymorphisms."

This proposal to investigate the impact of the bioenergetically-regulated, metabolic environment on the
sensitivity and signaling of retinal ganglion cells blends two converging lines of inquiry. The first arises from
evidence that neuronal metabolic stress is accommodated within diverse and complex solutions. The second
stems from our extensive knowledge of ganglion cell signaling functions, some of which we now interpret as
adaptions to the consequences of fluctuating energy requirements. The focus of this proposal is on identified
ganglion cell responses to light and how changes to specific response features are modulated by intrinsic
metabolic activity. There is a gap in our understanding of how the different response-forming functions of
cellular excitability may be changed during metabolic stress as well as the degree of the consequences of these
changes to ganglion cell sensitivity and visual function overall, especially during the pathological conditions
that lead to ganglion cell loss.
Our investigations will test hypotheses that intersect at the bioenergetic state of the retina and its effects on the
signaling of ganglion cells. In Specific Aim 1, we will define how the normal environmental conditions of the
outer retina contribute to the response features of ganglion cells. We will test the hypothesis that intrinsic
metabolic activity has a key influence on ganglion cell light responses by comparing controlled oxidant
modulation of the cells' response waveforms. In Specific Aim 2, we will characterize the oxidant sensitivity of
the cells' excitability mechanisms responsible for ganglion cell action potential generation. We will test the
hypothesis that the metabolic activity of each ganglion cell and its neighbors influences these signaling
mechanisms via oxidant production. In Specific Aim 3, we will examine the net influence of metabolic
modulation caused by light intensity changes (contrast adaptation) on ganglion cell output. We will test how
the actions of oxidants on specific features of the ganglion cell responses reflect the cell's metabolic state, and
how they adjust retinal output in normal and pathophysiological conditions.
These proposed studies will further our understanding of the cellular mechanisms that underlie ganglion cell
responses and retinal output. Our objectives are consistent with the health-related goals of the National Eye
Institute for understanding neuroprotective mechanisms in retinal neurons to prevent neurodegeneration,
including that induced by excessive levels of metabolic byproducts, as well as understanding the origin of
dysfunctional retinal signals that are detected with clinical tools essential for diagnosing and assessing the
progression of retinal disease."

The cell bodies of vestibular ganglion neurons express a diverse range of ion channels
and neurotransmitter receptors. This diversity provides a rich biophysical substrate for
shaping the intrinsic excitability of individual neurons and expands the populations’
repertoire for sensory signaling. In the vestibular nerve, the temporal precision needed
to code rapid head movements is determined by neurons firing at irregular intervals,
whereas the ability to detect slow head movements sensitively is determined by neurons
firing at regular intervals. Here we test whether the ion channels resident in the
membranes of vestibular neurons produce this important diversity or whether other
specializations of dendritic and synaptic morphology are also needed. The resolution of
this question requires joint characterizations of ion channel composition and dendritic
morphology in individual neurons. To provide this, we will perform patch-clamp
recordings combined with single-cell labeling in semi-intact neuro-epithelium preparations
in which neurons are still connected to their hair cells. Definitive relationships between
ion channel composition and neuronal function cannot be established without considering
the impact of efferent modulation on individual ion channels. Using pharmacology, we
will define the impact of cholinergic efferent signals on two ion channels identified as
being prominent for controlling the firing patterns and excitability of vestibular ganglion
neurons. We will test if some neurons are more receptive to this modulation than others.
Identifying such differences may also reveal opportunities for selectively targeting
therapeutics to specific neuron groups. We will combine the unique joint
characterizations of ion channels and dendritic morphology from our experiments to
create computational models to examine the relative importance of ion channel
composition and dendritic integration on vestibular afferent responses. Overall, our work
integrates powerful computational and experimental approaches to advance our
understanding of a fundamental aspect of vestibular function."

Worldwide, more than 1 in 10 babies are born premature. Prematurity is not only the leading cause of death in
children under 5 years of age, but also has serious long-term consequences for those preterm infants who
survive. As such, there is a growing population of infants at risk for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), visual
impairment and neurodevelopmental impairment. Understanding how the eye is altered due to preterm birth,
while accounting for postnatal factors such as oxygen use and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-
VEGF) treatment, is key to determining those infants at highest risk for visual and neurodevelopmental
impairment. Historically, this vulnerable population has been difficult to study, as invasive testing is both difficult
to perform as well as potentially harmful. Our study will utilize non-invasive eye imaging, using ocular coherence
tomography and angiography (OCT/OCTA), in preterm and term infants requiring intensive care. These images
will be analyzed using established measures, to identify how eye development differs in newborn infants exposed
to various systemic and local treatments such as oxygen and anti-VEGF intravitreal injections. Moreover, we will
identify retinal biomarkers from OCT/OCTA imaging that predict a number of key visual and development
outcomes, including treatment-requiring ROP shortly after birth and visual and neurodevelopmental impairment
at 2-3 years of age. Results from these studies will broaden and deepen our understanding of retinal blood vessel
development in preterm infants, the eye’s response to oxygen and anti-VEGF. In addition, developing non-
invasive retinal biomarkers as predictors for visual and neurodevelopmental impairment will augment
identification of at-risk infants early in the postnatal period will help to initiate individualized therapies during a
period of critical neurodevelopment which will optimize their long-term outcomes."

Long-lived and directly transmitted parasitic animals are among the most potent agents of natural selection
known from human populations. Yet, there is a fundamental gap in our knowledge of the co-evolutionary
mechanisms producing these patterns. This is, in part, because host-parasite interactions are notoriously difficult
to study. Until remedied, progress toward understanding an elusive process that has profoundly shaped our
biology is impeded. New model host-parasite systems are therefore critical for advancing the field. The long-
term goal of our research is to develop and leverage new model host-parasite models for mechanistic studies of
co-evolution. Over the past nearly four years of ESI MIRA support, we have made considerable progress toward
dissecting the genomic basis of the evolution of parasitism and host specialization, and in determining the extent
to which co-evolutionary interactions maintain genome-wide variation in host and parasite populations. The
rationale is that parasitism evolved repeatedly in the lineage that includes the genetic model animal Drosophila
melanogaster. Conveniently, these parasitic flies complete development in the genetic model plant Arabidopsis
thaliana, facilitating in-depth mechanistic study. In addition to addressing our core objectives, the MIRA’s
transformative flexibility allowed pursuit of risky new leads, resulting in a number of fundamental discoveries of
broad interest to biologists. This included characterization of the first odorant receptors specific to volatile
mustard oil toxins (isothiocyanates or ITCs) known in animals, the first use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing
technology to fully retrace an adaptive walk in an animal (the mutations sufficient for resistance to cardiac
glycoside toxins in monarch butterflies) using an in vivo knock-in approach, and identification of the first genes
from animals known to encode cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) subunit B proteins, which is our model for the
evolution of toxins used by human immune cells. These discoveries now form the basis of our proposed transition
to EI MIRA support over the next five years. Our specific goal in the next phase of research is to identify the
evolution and mechanistic bases of interactions between hosts and parasites that are mediated by three toxin
classes: ITCs, cardiac glycosides, and CDTs. Three projects already underway that will address this goal are:
(1) the evolution and mechanistic basis of toxin detection by parasites (ITCs), (2) the evolution and mechanistic
basis of toxin resistance by parasites (ITCs and cardiac glycosides), and (3) the evolution and mechanistic basis
of toxin co-option by the immune system (CTDs). This research is expected to inform our understanding of how

 Chronic pain is one of the most common health problems in adult and has profound impact on physical as
well as mental wellbeing. According to CDC data brief in 2020, 20.4% of adults in the U.S. have chronic pain.
The prevalence is even higher in veterans. Among Veterans receiving primary care in VA healthcare facilities,
as many as 50% of male veterans and as many as 75% of female veterans report the presence of pain. In a
sample of OEF and OIF veterans, approximately 47% reported at least a mild level of pain and 28% reported
moderate to severe pain intensity. Chronic pain is often associated with limitation in mobility and daily activities
and frequently comorbid with opioids dependency, anxiety and depression. Current available treatments
medications such as NSAIDs, antiepileptic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, corticosteroids, opioids, and
cannabinoids are associated with a range of negative side effects. Invasive and surgical procedures such as
peripheral nerve blockers, epidural steroid injections and neural stimulations are also used to provide effective
pain relief. The long-term use of these medications often increases the potential for adverse or side effects.
Thus, there is urgent needs to develop novel, efficacious and safe interventions for treating neuropathic pain.
 It is well established that chronic pain, such as inflammation pain, neuropathic pain, and cancer pain, is an
expression of neural plasticity both in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and in the central nervous system
(CNS). A large body of evidence indicates that proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines make important
contributions to the initiation and persistence of pain. Preliminary studies in our lab using a spared nerve injury
(SNI) mouse model of neuropathic pain showed increased expression of CCL5 in the blood and pain
phenotypes are significantly correlated with peripheral levels of CCL5. Moreover, analysis of CNS showed
increased expression of CCL5 and CCR5 in the brain in the SNI mice, suggesting that CCL5/CCR5 axis may
contribute to nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. In humans, CCL5 was reported to be upregulated in
patients with various pain conditions including atypical facial pain and trigeminal neuralgia, discogenic back
pain and small fiber neuropathy, indicating its clinical significance in pain development. Based on these
observations, we hypothesize that injury-induced increase of CCL5 and its interaction with CCR5 in the
periphery and the CNS may dysregulate neural plasticity and promotes the development and persistency of
pain. We propose to pharmacologically target CCL5/CCR5 using FDA approved CCR5 antagonist maraviroc in
the SNI mouse mode, and use a battery of neurobehavioral tests, immunological and molecular techniques to
test its efficacy and to investigate underlying mechanisms.
 We believe our approach will greatly enhance our understanding of the contribution of CCL5/CCR5 in
chronic pain and the potential benefits of targeting CCL5/CCR5 axis as novel therapeutic intervention."

Preterm birth affects 1 in 10 infants born in the United States, resulting in significant morbidity and economic
cost. Children who are born very preterm (VPT; gestational age<32 weeks) have increased risk for impaired
neurodevelopment. VPT infants experience increased physiologic stress while their caregivers experience
increased psychological distress—both are associated with impaired neurodevelopment. Epigenetic
modifications are proposed as a possible mechanism linking physiologic stress and neurodevelopment in VPT
infants. The main objective of the proposed research is to identify the mechanisms by which neonatal physiologic
stress induces epigenetic modifications that contribute to impaired neurodevelopment, as well as how caregiver
distress moderates the relationship between longitudinal neonatal physiologic stress and neurodevelopmental
outcomes. Specifically, the proposed research aims to (1) create and validate novel indices of neonatal
physiologic stress in VPT infants; (2) identify the effects of neonatal physiologic stress on epigenetic
modifications and later neurodevelopment in VPT infants; and (3) determine the effects of caregiver distress on
neurodevelopment in VPT infants. This aligns with the NICHD Strategic Plan 2020 scientific priority—to reduce
the incidence of neurodevelopmental disorders by improving the understanding of their origins in the
developmental process and identifying potential targets and optimal timing for intervention. The training plan
includes several components necessary to reach the PI’s goal of becoming an independent clinical scientist,
studying early life risk factors and etiological mechanisms in neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, the
proposed training aims to enhance the PI’s molecular genetic expertise by adding training in epigenetic analyses
via intensive workshops and laboratory experiences with an expert mentor and to expand the PI’s quantitative
expertise to include complex longitudinal analyses. The new education and training on neonatal physiological
stress will provide the PI with unique expertise that will lead to new avenues of investigation. Finally, the PI will
develop professional development skills that will be critical for success as a tenure track assistant professor and
independent clinical scientist. The academic environment at the University of Iowa is well-suited for the proposed
research and training. Faculty members with expertise in advanced quantitative methods, epigenetics, and
neonatal physiology are willing to provide expert mentorship to the PI. The Division of Neonatology conducts
numerous research studies on preterm birth each year and has the infrastructure, including an outstanding team
of clinical research nurses and a high-risk infant follow-up clinic, to support the proposed research. The Iowa
Institute of Human Genetics provides researchers with a state-of-the-art, high-throughput genetic analysis facility
and supports research focused on human genetics. Numerous institutional organizations provide a variety of
opportunities to develop the skills necessary for success as an independent clinical scientist."

This proposal focuses on elucidation of the processes regulating human natural killer (NK) cell development
in the healthy state and in the setting of uterine endometrial carcinoma (EC). NK cells are cytotoxic “group 1”
innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that play myriad roles in immunity and are vital to controlling malignant
transformation. NK cells undergo terminal differentiation and maturation in various tissues throughout the
body, leading to a broad spectrum of NK cell phenotypes and functions. So-called conventional NK cells (cNK)
that arise in secondary lymphoid tissues and predominate in the blood have established roles in
complementing T cell-mediated immune surveillance. In contrast, specialized tissue-resident NK cells (trNK)
and their close cousins, ILC1s, develop in various tissues and are retained there to carry out distinct functions.
In the uterus, trNK cells and ILC1s are physiologically designed to support and promote pregnancy by
promoting placental tissue invasion, immune suppression, and angiogenesis. We hypothesize that in the
setting of EC the normal processes of uterine trNK cell and ILC1 development and function are co-opted by
the tumor cells to promote their growth and invasion. Our goals in this proposal are to gain a comprehensive
understanding of the cellular and molecular components that regulate human NK cell development in healthy
tissues and to determine how these processes are impacted in the setting of EC. Our two specific aims are: 1)
To define NK cell and ILC1 developmental pathways in human tissues; and 2) To determine how NK cell
development and function are shaped by human EC. In particular, in Aim 1 we will test the hypothesis that all
NK cells and ILC1s stem from a common group 1 ILC precursor cell, which we have recently identified in
human lymphoid tissues. We propose a series of experiments to test our hypothesis and to determine the
molecular regulation of the NK cell versus ILC1 developmental axis stemming from the novel precursor cell.
Further, we will elucidate the developmental pathways of NK cells and ILC1s in the healthy human uterus,
testing the hypothesis that uterine NK cells and ILC1s also stem from a similar group 1 ILC precursor cell but
ultimately terminally differentiate through pathways distinct from those in lymphoid tissues. In Aim 2 we will
test the hypothesis that NK cell development from the common group 1 ILC precursor is skewed towards the
production of ILC1s and poorly cytotoxic uterine trNK cells that are permissive if not promoting of tumor
growth. Through our proposed studies we will determine how NK cell development, functional diversity, and
plasticity are shaped by EC. The clinical importance of these studies lies in the fact that EC is the most
common gynecologic malignancy in the United States and is the sixth leading cause of cancer death in
women. Further, we predict that the knowledge gained from our studies will improve our fundamental
understand of human NK cell developmental biology and ultimately the design of future immune-based cancer
therapies for EC and potentially other forms of cancer in which innate immunity is impacted."

The German cockroach, Blattella germanica, is the most common pestiferous cockroach species in human
environments. B. germanica contributes to the transmission of bacteria that cause enteric (diarrheal) disease,
including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, but the mechanisms of transmission are not well
understood. Enteric bacterial pathogen transmission by cockroaches has previously been described as
mechanical in nature. Mechanical transmission is a passive, non-replicative transfer of bacteria from one location
or host to another. This mechanism is limited in impact relative to active biological transmission. However, recent
data from our laboratory indicate that transmission of S. Typhimurium by German cockroaches is markedly more
complex than simple mechanical transmission and instead resembles biological transmission by other insects
that intake bacteria from infected hosts and are subsequently colonized, enabling active and prolonged shedding
and transmission. In particular, we have observed that following ingestion, S. Typhimurium undergoes a lifestyle
change and multiple replication events in the digestive tract of the German cockroach. Furthermore, we have
identified several S. Typhimurium genes that are necessary for bacterial colonization and shedding from the gut
of B. germanica, evidencing an active role of the bacteria. The central objective of the proposed research project
is to gain a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of biological vector-borne transmission of S. Typhimurium
by the German cockroach. Three independent specific aims are proposed. First, we will elucidate the fine
spatiotemporal details of wild-type S. Typhimurium colonization and shedding in nymph and adult cockroaches.
Second, leveraging an unparalleled array of mutant S. Typhimurium strains, we will identify specific bacterial
genes and functions that are necessary for colonization of cockroaches and subsequent transmission. Third, we
will determine the effects of two key host factors, namely antimicrobial effectors and the gut microbiota, on S.
Typhimurium colonization and shedding. Together, the proposed studies will establish a picture of how bacterial
and host factors interact to shape biological transmission of S. Typhimurium by the German cockroach, providing
fundamental insight into the dynamics of a unique, poorly studied vector-pathogen system with a global
distribution and public health impact."

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable and fatal disease. Reagents such as the proteasome inhibitor,
bortezomib, have significantly extended overall survival but resistance can rapidly arise. To generate therapies
that can provide durable responses, especially in the context of refractory disease, a deeper understanding of
the genetics driving the disease and the evolution of therapy resistance is required. To this end, our team has
performed RNASeq analysis of CD138+ MM cells derived from patients across the disease spectrum (n=815)
and identified that Unc-51 Like Kinase-3 (ULK3) is highly expressed in newly diagnosed and refractory MM. Our
emerging studies demonstrate a novel role for ULK3 in regulating autophagy in MM, a key program that sustains
cell survival under times of stress and has been implicated as a major mechanism of proteasome inhibitor
resistance. Of note, MM is known to be highly dependent on autophagy. Currently, specific ULK3 inhibitors are
lacking. As a strategy to overcome resistance to single agents, our team has focused on the development of
novel inhibitors such as SG3, that target multiple kinases including ULK3 (EC50 90nM) as well bromodomain
protein 4 (BRD4)(3). BRD4 is a known driver of MYC and analysis of our patient RNASeq data again reveals
increased BRD4 expression in refractory MM. The BRD4 inhibitor, JQ1, effectively impairs the tumorigenic
potential of MM but resistance has also been noted with this reagent. Our agent SG3 inhibits BRD4 activity in
the nM range (27 nM) similar to that of JQ1 (20 nM), and consistent with our ULK3 studies, SG3 treatment rapidly
inhibits autophagy in MM cells. In vivo, we found SG3 significantly inhibits MM progression and induced bone
disease. Excitingly, our team has already developed a 2nd generation SG3 derivative coined MA9 that is just as
effective as SG3 in vitro and in vivo but has superior stability. We also show that MA9 can resensitize proteosome
inhibitor resistant MM cells to bortezomib. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that ULK3 is a key regulator
of autophagy in MM and represents a novel target for treatment of refractory disease and it will be tested
with three Aims. Aim 1 will take a genetic approach and delete ULK3 to its role in regulating autophagy in MM
as well in the progression of the disease in vivo using clinically relevant animal models. Aim 2 will interrogate
the impact of our dual ULK3/BRD4 compound, MA9, in MM progression and overall survival in vivo compared to
JQ1 and the autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ). Aim 3 will examine the efficacy of MA9 for the treatment of
CD138+ MM isolated from naïve and refractory patients using a novel ex vivo high throughput platform developed
at Moffitt. Here, we will also define the contribution of ULK3 in mediating proteasome inhibitor resistance using
bortezomib resistant MM cell lines. Importantly, in each Aim, we will also determine the role of ULK3 in MM
induced bone destruction - a clinically significant aspect of this disease. We expect our anticipated results will
provide strong rationale for the translation of our novel dual ULK3/BRD4 inhibitors to the clinic."

 Hearing impairment (HI) is the most common sensory deficit in the world. Congenital HI occurs in 1-2 per
1000 newborns. Understanding the mechanism of hearing will greatly aid in the development of treatment
strategies for HI. Additionally, identification of new HI genes and pathogenic variants is highly beneficial for
genetic screening so that HI can be diagnosed early, and intervention can occur to maximize the child’s
cognitive, social-emotional, speech and language development. The first step is to identify genes involved in
the etiology of nonsyndromic (NS) HI. Although 73 genes have been identified for autosomal recessive (AR)
NSHI, the vast majority of NSHI genes have yet to be uncovered. The extreme genetic heterogeneity of NSHI
is due to the complex inner ear architecture. Identification of genes involved in HI is the first step in improving
knowledge of the auditory process, which in turn will aid in the development of diagnostic modalities and
therapeutic interventions. Annually we will ascertain ~110 ARNSHI families with at least two members
affected with severe to profound bilateral sensorineural ARNSHI from Hungary (Magyar and Romani), Nigeria,
and Pakistan. DNA samples from hearing-impaired family members will be screened for genes/variants that
are common causes of ARNSHI within their respective population. There will be ~92 families to identify new
ARNSHI genes through next-generation sequencing and data analysis that uses information on variant
frequency, deleterious status, and conservation. Information clinical etiology, animal models, and inner ear
expression will also be used. Candidate variants will be validated and tested for segregation with ARNSHI
status within the pedigrees. Once a putative causal variant is identified we will screen our in-house collection
of ARNSHI exome data, use GeneMatcher, and contact our long-term collaborators to find additional ARNSHI
families that segregate potentially causal variants within the same gene. For ~20 newly identified ARNSHI
genes, expression and functional studies will also be performed using zebrafish and mice models to ensure
gene pathogenicity as well as to elucidate a better understanding of the role the genes play in the etiology of
HI. Due to the trans-Atlantic slave trade the majority of African Americans have west African ancestry;
therefore, the study of Nigerian families will impact our understanding of the etiology of HI and improve
diagnostics and treatment in this minority population. Families from Pakistan and Hungary (Magyar and
Romani) should yield new ARNSHI gene that also have public health importance in other populations."

Mass spectrometry (MS) based footprinting is emerging as a powerful means to answer biological questions
about membrane proteins (MPs), which participate in almost all physiological processes and represent more
than 60% of drug targets. This approach affords sufficient structural information for the dynamic, native
conformations and interactions of MPs in cells, which are beyond the reach of traditional structural methods (e.g.,
cryo-EM and crystallography). This bottom-up MS footprinting is complementary to but potentially more
informative than top-down native MS, which does not provide spatial resolution for MPs and is conducted in the
nonnative gas phase. Here we propose to continue development of novel MS footprinting methods in live cells
and native membranes. Our objective is to design, prepare, test, and improve chemical probes that provide high
footprinting coverage. We will then apply them to reveal drug interactions and cellular trafficking regulation of a
glucose transporter, GLUT1, a prominent anticancer drug target and a model MP representing ~ 25% of known
transport proteins. MS footprinting of MPs, however, poses three major challenges. 1) MPs, which are
hydrophobic and buried in lipid bilayers, are resistant to traditional probes (e.g., HDX, •OH radicals) that
penetrate poorly and give insufficient labeling. 2) Aliphatic side chains of transmembrane regions contain C–H
and C-C bonds that are unreactive with most chemical probes. 3) The footprinting needs to be conducted in cells
or membranes to maintain native conformation and interaction of MPs. Our hypotheses are: (1) Complementary
modifications of C-H and X–H bonds by free radicals produced photochemically and by nucleophilic reagents
maximize footprinting coverage. (2) Tuning the hydrophobicity of the reagents or their precursors allows access
to membrane-embedded MPs. (3) Novel membrane fusion techniques introduce inert footprinters into live cells
and native membranes for subsequent photoactivated footprinting. Our hypotheses are built on extensive
preliminary data. Three years of funding supported publication of 18 papers in high-profile journals. A significant
example describes laser activation of TiO2 nanoparticles attached to liposomes to generate high local
concentrations of radicals. Simultaneous membrane poration permits radical entry to footprint with sufficient
structural resolution that reports the ligand-binding sites and rocker-switch motions of GLUT1. Building on these
successes, we will pursue two specific aims: (1) develop new chemical probes for MS footprinting of MPs; and
(2) conduct comprehensive footprinting in native membranes and live cells to reveal anticancer drug interactions
and trafficking regulations of GLUT1. Our innovative footprinting coupled with bottom-up MS proteomics analysis
will establish bio-orthogonal footprinters that afford comprehensive coverage of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic
regions of MPs and reveal drug interactions and structural regulation of human MPs under inarguable native
settings. The impact of the proposed approach should readily expand because MS-based footprinting can be
broadly applied in structural proteomics to expedite drug discovery and structural studies of cellular processes."

 Natural products continue to be one of the most important sources of new lead compounds for the discovery
of medicinal agents. They occupy vast regions of chemical space, providing much greater diversity in their
structures as well as their biological properties compared to those of classical drug molecules. Potent
compounds from nature have provided paramount architectural inspiration for developing new chemical
therapies, with more than 80% of all drugs and over 65% of anticancer drugs being, derived from, or inspired by
natural products; however, their structural complexity and limited availability are often the sole obstacles
preventing their further study and clinical development. As synthetic organic chemists situated at the interface of
chemistry and biology, our research program is devoted to providing solutions to this supply problem in the form
of sustainable and practical syntheses of complex biologically active natural products, and to performing
fundamental studies of their chemical biology. By developing new synthetic strategies, as well as target-specific
methodologies, we intend to provide efficient access to complex bioactive natural products and bring them within
the realm of medicinal chemistry. Specifically, in this proposal we describe synthetic approaches to several
diverse terpenoid natural product classes: isomalabaricane triterpenoids, nimbolide, and a vast range of
perhydrobenz[e]indene-based terpenoids. We already established stereodivergent access to all four challenging
stereoisomers of the rare 6/6/5 tricyclic terpenoid core structure that occurs in nature. Moreover, we recently
completed several isomalabaricanes, using synthetic blueprint that permits rapid diversification. We are
beginning to engage in biological investigations, and our ongoing collaboration with chemical biology experts will
provide an excellent opportunity to test these compounds and their analogues for therapeutic activities, as well
as to elucidate their mechanisms of action, molecular targets, and metabolites. It is expected that these studies
will provide anticancer and anti-infective agents with unprecedented molecular topologies and functions, as well
as advance our basic knowledge of their mechanistic specificity for certain cancers and pathogenic diseases."
10775802,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a proliferative retinal vascular disease that affects preterm infants and a
major cause of childhood blindness. ROP is diagnosed and staged under indirect ophthalmoscopy at the junction
between the vascularized and avascular retina (i.e., periphery) using features such as retinal detachment (RD)
and increased vascular dilatation and tortuosity. While surgical and pharmacologic therapies exist, poor
structural and visual outcomes (<20/200 vision or blindness) occur in >50% of severe cases because RD, schisis,
and vascular abnormalities are often missed on clinical examination. Conventional ophthalmoscopic examination
in infants is performed using fundoscopy. However, retinal microvasculature is poorly visualized even when
combined with exogenous fluorescein contrast. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is currently the gold-
standard for ophthalmic diagnostic imaging in adults and developments in OCT angiography (OCT-A) have
enabled in vivo imaging of retinal vasculature without the need for exogenous contrast. While several research
groups have developed handheld OCT/OCTA imaging systems and demonstrated imaging in ROP patients,
longitudinal quantitative imaging of retinal vasculature to track ROP progression remains limited by several key
challenges: 1) infants cannot fixate, making repeated imaging of regions-of-interest (ROIs) impossible; 2)
handheld imaging coupled with infant motion results in significant artifacts and poor OCTA contrast; 3)
OCT/OCTA quality is severely degraded by vitreous/anterior chamber haze, which is common in ROP; 4)
peripheral retinal vascular changes are important for ROP staging but aiming of OCT/OCTA at these ROIs is
difficult; 5) vascular volumes provide clinically relevant features such as dilatation and tortuosity, but OCTA is
conventionally assessed using only en face projections. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a
combination of hardware and image-processing technologies for handheld OCT/OCTA built around a multimodal
spectrally encoded coherence tomography and reflectometry (SECTR) ophthalmic imaging platform. SECTR
simultaneously acquires orthogonal en face reflectance and cross-sectional OCT images that uniquely benefits
volumetric registration for motion-correction and multi-volumetric mosaicking. We hypothesize that the
translation of these technologies into a point-of-care ophthalmic imaging system will allow for robust,
reproducible, and quantitative longitudinal tracking of retinal vascular changes, which will improve the diagnostic
and staging accuracy of ROP in preterm infants. We aim to develop custom hardware (AIM 1) and image analysis
pipelines (AIM 2) optimized for handheld SECTR imaging in infant eyes. These technologies will be validated in
longitudinal imaging of structural and functional changes in ROP (AIM 3) and provide quantitative insight on the
viability of SECTR imaging to benefit treatment decisions. The proposed device and quantitative analysis pipeline
are not limited to ROP cases and can be broadly applied in any area of ophthalmology where a robust point-of-
care OCT/OCTA may improve current clinical standard-of-care."

NOVEL ROLE OF NEPHRON EPITHELIALIZATION IN NUCLEAR SIGNALING

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) are the most common cause of pediatric end- stage renal disease resulting in the need for kidney transplant. They occur in almost 2% of births, making up nearly one-fourth of all birth defects. However, only 14% of cases have a known genetic cause. Many CAKUT cases result from defects in the formation of nephrons, which are composed of epithelial tubules that are required for the proper function of the kidney. Prior studies indicate that disruption of either the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway or exocyst vesicle complex result in malformation of the nephric tubules, indicating that these components are required for proper tubule formation. In our previous studies, we evaluated how tubulogenesis is facilitated through the PCP and exocyst complexes independently. We investigated distinct models by which Daam1, a formin protein that assembles actin filaments as part of the Wnt/planar cell polarity pathway, and Dnmbp/Tuba, which regulates exocytic vesicle targeting, facilitate tubulogenesis by promoting the generation of cell-cell contacts between nephron progenitor cells. We discovered a novel mechanism that utilizes the Wnt/PCP formin protein Daam1 to drive cell junction formation between nephron progenitor cells to generate tubules by polymerizing actin to stabilize cadherin at adherens junctions. Additionally, our results indicate that the exocyst-associated component Dnmbp facilitates the targeting of junctional components to initiate formation of these cell contacts between nephron progenitors. Despite this progress, we do not understand how the formation of cell-cell contacts influences the developmental processes of tubule epithelialization and morphogenesis in developing nephrons. To address this significant question, we will build upon on our important discoveries to evaluate how cell junction formation impacts the development of the nephric tubules by: 1) Identifying how the interaction between Daam1 and Dnmbp regulates cell-cell contact formation between nephron progenitors and 2) Determining whether Daam1’s role in junction formation regulates beta-catenin’s junctional versus Wnt signaling roles during nephrogenesis. Overall, the experiments proposed in this application will facilitate a new understanding of how cells interact and communicate to carry out tubulogenesis that has relevance in multiple organ systems. The quantitative evaluation of cell biological mechanisms involved in nephric development is a new area of study that will contribute valuable insights into epithelialization and morphogenesis mechanisms underlying tubulogenic processes."

 Microglial inflammation has been implicated the pathology of a host of neurological conditions, including
neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and Down Syndrome; neurogenerative disorders such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington’s disease;
and neuropathic pain. Gene therapy utilizing adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors has emerged as a highly
promising strategy for treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders, and an immunosuppressive gene
therapy to inhibit immune signaling pathways in microglia would thus be highly promising for treating this broad
range of chronic conditions. However, this signaling pathway serves protective roles in other CNS cells including
neurons, such that therapeutic delivery would need to be not only efficient but targeted to microglia.
 By leveraging our expertise in viral engineering, single cell analysis, machine learning, and human and
non-human primate models, we propose to develop a technology platform for genetically accessing specific cell
types in the adult primate brain, in particular microglia. We will integrate directed evolution of AAV with molecular
barcoding, single cell next generation sequencing (NGS), machine learning, and human tissue and non-human
primate (NHP) brain models to develop AAVs for selective delivery to primate microglia. Additionally, to further
enhance the specificity of these technologies, we will apply analogous library selection, NGS, and machine
learning approaches to engineer short, synthetic promoters and to identify endogenous enhancers for selective
microglial gene expression. Finally, these capabilities will be applied to deliver potential therapeutic gene cargoes
to microglia in vitro and in vivo.
 In sum, we propose a high-risk, innovative research program that will, if successful, advance our capacity
to selectively modulate immune signaling in microglia, work that if successful will have implications for treating a
broad range of neurological conditions. Furthermore, this work will establish a broadly impactful technology
platform that integrates vector engineering, next generation sequencing, and machine learning to engineer tools
for cell specific genetic manipulation, which can in principle be applied to in principle any cell or tissue in the
central nervous system or body. We thus anticipate that our experienced, multidisciplinary team can offer strong
contributions to technology development, neuroscience, and fundamental and translational biology in other
systems."
10796834,"Autosomal dominant Retinitis pigmentosa (adRP) is a blinding eye disease that results in loss of rods and
eventually cone photoreceptors. A large fraction of adRP is caused by mutations in the rhodopsin (Rho) gene,
and the most common mutation in North America causes a P23H mutation in rhodopsin. Patients typically
present with mid- to late-stage disease when many rod photoreceptors already have degenerated.
We will evaluate genome editing using a meganuclease genome editing tool (Rho1-2) that is specific for the
sequence causing the P23H mutation in several preclinical animal models of P23H adRP. We will deliver AAV5-
GRK1-Rho1-2 via subretinal injection to infect photoreceptors. We will measure efficacy, the ability of Rho1-2 to
alter rod degeneration and functional decline. We will quantitatively determine Rho1-2 efficiency, the proportion
of P23H alleles with insertions/delections (indels), specificity the proportion of P23H to WT alleles with indels,
and its safety, the absence of indels in other genes throughout the human genome (off target editing).
In Pig P23H adRP models we will evaluate Rho1-2 editing efficacy because of the similarities between pigs and
humans in eye size and retinal structure and because the pig has a cone rich visual streak. We will use the same
non-invasive tools used in the clinic to measure retinal function (full field electroretinograms) and structure,
(spectral domain OCT). We will use two existing transgenic pig lines that harbor the entire P23H hRHO gene,
but differ in their time course, resulting in a fast or slow loss of rods and rod function. We will match treatment
time with the natural history of rod structural and functional decline, compare Rho1-2 editing efficacy in early-,
mid- and late-stage P23H adRP and define its temporal treatment window. In Humanized adRP mouse models
we will evaluate Rho1-2 editing efficiency and specificity because they contain WT and P23H human alleles in
the appropriate genomic context. In human retinal organoids we will evaluate Rho1-2 editing safety (off-target
cutting throughout the genome) because they contain human photoreceptors as well as the rest of the human
genome in a relevant context..
Taken together the results of our experiments will determine if Rho1-2 should move forward for eventual use in
human clinical trials and will define endpoints for those trials."
10608002,"Background: Mental health providers (MHPs), who are ""mission critical"" for the VHA, report the second
highest level of burnout after primary care physicians. MHP burnout may be associated with negative system-
level factors (organizational climate, workgroup perceptions, and supervisory behaviors), provider experiences
(engagement, satisfaction, and turnover) and patient outcomes (access to, continuity of, experience of care).
VHA has yet to conduct a systematic facility-level study identifying predictors and consequences of MHP
burnout. This study will address HSR&D priorities focused on health care systems change, the impact of
organizational and provider factors associated with quality of care for Veterans, and improving employee
engagement. Objectives: This pre-implementation study aims to characterize variation in MHP burnout by
facility over time, identifying workplace characteristics and practices of high performing facilities that can be
translated for potential implementation at facilities with room for improvement. Aim 1: to examine facility-
level predictors and consequences of VHA MHP burnout; Aim 2: to understand VHA MHP leadership and
front-line provider perspectives regarding factors that protect against or exacerbate burnout in facilities with
differing levels of burnout; and Aim 3: to identify context-sensitive strategies for facilities to successfully
reduce VHA MHP burnout. Methods: Using a sequential explanatory mixed methods study, a two-phase
design with quantitative data collection and analysis followed by qualitative data collection and analysis, and
subsequent integration, we will evaluate factors that influence MHP burnout and their effects on patient
outcomes. We will compile annual survey data on workplace conditions and annual staffing and productivity
data between FY2014 and FY2018 to assess same and subsequent year provider and patient outcomes
reflecting provider and patient experiences. The All Employee Survey (AES) is an annual organizational census
of workplace perceptions and satisfaction. The Mental Health Provider Survey (MHPS) is an annual survey to
assess MHP perceptions about access to and quality of mental health care, and job satisfaction. The Mental
Health Outpatient Clinical method tracks MHP inpatient and outpatient clinical hours and productivity. We
will examine MHP job satisfaction and patient experience metrics using the Strategic Analytics for
Improvement and Learning (SAIL) Mental Health domain, the VHA's quality monitoring system. Facility
complexity level is measured using a five level indicator based on patient risk, number of specialists, volume,
and level of teaching and research, including mental health program characteristics. By linking these data
sources, we will quantify predictors of burnout and the impact of burnout on patient outcomes. We will
conduct interviews with mental health facility leadership and front-line MHPs, intentionally sampled using
facility-level MHP burnout. We will create a joint display to interpret quantitative and qualitative findings on
predictors and patient outcomes associated with burnout in light of facility context and any strategies used to
address burnout. We will present our findings to an expert panel of operational partners, VA clinicians,
administrators, policy leaders, and experts. The panel will select context-sensitive best practices to share with
facilities to address MHP burnout and recommend potential interventions. Finally, we will reengage facilities
that participated in Aim 2 and conduct focus groups and share results presented in feedback reports. We will
broadly disseminate findings, which will support the development of actionable policies and approaches to
addressing MHP burnout. Anticipated impacts on Veterans' health and next steps: This study will
assist in future developing and testing interventions with VHA partners to improve MHP burnout and
employee engagement. Decreased MHP burnout could improve quality of care, wait times, and lost revenues
due to staff attrition. Our findings could be of clinical and financial value to VHA, its providers, and patients.
Our work will contribute to broad VHA care improvements, and will generate new insights for care delivery."

Cognitive impairment is a core feature of many neuropsychiatric disorders that directly correlates with
functional outcome for patients. Current treatment options are inadequate and there is a need for novel
therapeutic strategies. The dopamine D1-like receptor family (D1 and D5 receptors) has been proposed as a
potential target for improving cognitive function. Clinical studies with D1/D5 full agonists have shown promising
efficacy, but these compounds suffer from significant drawbacks related to adverse effect profiles. The lack of
selective ligands as well as considerable spatial overlap between the D1 and D5 receptors have made it
difficult to determine which receptor is responsible for specific efficacy and adverse effect features of the
nonselective agonists. There have been efforts to develop selective tools for D1 receptors but, to our
knowledge, there have been no formal efforts to identify D5-selective compounds. Recent research from our
group and others has shown that the D5 receptor plays a critical role in cognitive function, particularly in
cognitive domains significantly disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, multiple D5-selective
signaling pathways relevant for neural function have been identified. Unfortunately, further experimentation to
determine the role of the D5 receptor in neurobiology has been hindered by the lack of selective ligands. In this
application, we propose to design and synthesize D5-selective chemical probes. Due to the high degree of
homology between the D5 and D1 orthosteric binding sites, we will focus on allosteric modulators. Once
selectivity for D5 receptors over D1 receptors has been established using cAMP induction assays, potency on
cell-based assays of D5-specific signaling cascades will be determined. Compounds shown to be potent and
selective will then undergo in vitro screening for metabolic stability and counterscreening against a broad panel
of receptors and ion channels. Compounds that are found to be metabolically stable with minimal off-target
binding, will be tested in vivo to determine if they have sufficient plasma and brain exposure to engage the D5
receptor and advance to pharmacodynamic assays. Finally, compounds will be tested to determine their ability
to induce BDNF expression in the prefrontal cortex, a known effect of signaling through the D5 receptor. Once
optimized and characterized, these D5-selective probes will allow us to further characterize the role of the D5
receptor in neural function and determine if it is a viable therapeutic target."
10769832,"The cortex must filter out the bulk of sensory inputs. Not enough or too much filtering may underlie a
variety of disorders like autism and schizophrenia. Mounting evidence suggests that this depends on
alpha/beta (~8-30 Hz) oscillations vs gamma (>35 Hz) with associated spiking. They are ubiquitous in
cortex and anti-correlated. Gamma/spiking is high during sensory inputs while alpha/beta is high (and
spiking is low) during conditions requiring top-down control. The central idea is alpha/beta (~8-30 Hz)
rhythms in deep cortical layers inhibit the superficial layer activity (spiking and gamma, >35 Hz) that feed
forward sensory inputs. Our testbed will be a model of Predictive Coding in which alpha/beta carries the
top-down predictions from higher cortex that inhibit the feeding forward of bottom-up sensory inputs of
predicted stimuli. We will test this hypothesis via direct cause-and-effect experiments, by manipulating
the alpha/beta prediction rhythms in monkeys.
We made this possible by developing a new ultra-fast latency (<10 ms) closed-loop system that can read
the brain’s endogenous rhythms and phase-match electrical stimulation to them. We will also employ
high-density “laminar” electrodes to record from all cortical layers and target stimulation to superficial
vs deep layers. Laminar electrodes with injection ports will also allow selective pharmacological
manipulation of deep vs superficial cortical layers. Monkeys will perform a local and global (patterned)
oddball detection task. Our model makes specific predictions on how attenuating vs amplifying
alpha/beta prediction signals will affect local physiological as well as feedforward vs feedback signaling
of predictions and oddballs to higher vs lower cortex. Understanding neurophysiological properties,
functions and interactions between cortical layers and their different dynamics can provide key insight
into the control of cortical processing and the disorders that come from its dysfunction."

Down Syndrome (DS) affects over 200,000 individuals in the United States and is the most common genetic
cause of intellectual and developmental disabilities in children and young adults. Down Syndrome arises from
an extra third copy of chromosome 21, encompassing over 200 genes, which leads to genome wide
transcriptional disruption. The brain cell-type specific contribution to DS neurodevelopmental deficits and the
interaction between cognitive and immune dysfunction in DS are poorly understood. DS has been difficult to
model due to limitations in murine orthologs and inadequacies of in vitro systems in modeling complex cellular
interactions. Microglial pathology has been identified in individuals with DS, but the extent to which microglial
dystrophy contributes to neurodevelopmental deficits is unknown. There is increasing evidence for the impact of
microglia on brain development and microglia have been suggested as a novel therapeutic target in DS. This
proposal is built around the central hypothesis that trisomy 21 causes microglial dysfunction and thereby
contributes to the pathogenesis of intellectual and developmental disability in DS. Motivated by our strong
preliminary data that in vitro microglia exhibit altered gene expression and functional phenotypes in
neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, we developed novel organoid microglia cocultures and
a chimeric human microglia mouse model, whereby 80% of microglia are human in origin. Here we apply
innovative in vitro and in vivo methods to ascertain the contribution of human DS microglia in neurodevelopment,
neuronal function, and cognition. The project goal is to test the hypothesis that isolated trisomy 21 in human
microglia and microglia-cerebral organoid cocultures in vitro (Aim 1) and in a xenotransplantation model of
human microglia in vivo (Aim 2) results in microglial pathology, neuropathological defects, and behavioral
deficits. Delineating genome wide transcriptional disruption and genome wide reorganization will uncover DS
associated transcriptional dysregulation and expand our knowledge of DS associated genes. The long-term
goal is to generate and validate in vitro and in vivo DS microglial models that can be employed for drug screening
and to generate preclinical data. A deeper understanding of the contribution and molecular regulation of microglia
in DS will lay the groundwork to ultimately identify novel potential therapeutic targets to improve the outcomes
for individuals with DS."

Eukaryotic genomic DNA is extensively associated with proteins and RNAs to form chromatin. Through its control
of gene expression, changes in chromatin biochemistry and structure underlie nearly all cellular processes.
Post-translational modifications of histone proteins that bind genomic DNA play an especially critical role in
regulating chromatin structure and function. Modifications of certain histone residues influence the binding of
histone proteins to DNA as well as the interactions of other proteins that specifically recognize these
modifications. The specific pattern of histone modifications acts as a “histone code” to determine the set of
proteins that interact with histones and histone-bound DNA, and consequently participate in diverse cellular
processes. Therefore, identification of specific histone modifications, quantitative assessment of the interactions
they mediate, and characterization of enzymes that modify histones is essential for understanding chromatin
regulation of complex cellular behavior. However, unraveling the histone code is a daunting challenge due to its
complexity – over eighty different amino acid residues on five histone proteins undergo over twenty distinct
known post-translational modifications. Despite significant advances in research on some histone modifications
such as acetylation and methylation, the vast majority of histone modifications remains understudied. Further, a
vast majority of enzymes that write even extensively researched modifications like acetylation remain
understudied. We propose to address the critical gap in essential biochemical tools and accessible experimental
platforms that has hindered research on understudied histone modifications and modifiers. Specifically, we will
harness next generation yeast surface display systems as scalable platforms for high throughput studies on
understudied histone modifications and modifiers, as well as platforms for engineering biochemical reagents for
chromatin research. In addition to understudied histone acetyltransferases, we will focus on three classes of
histone modifications: (i) citrullination of arginine (ii) acyl modification of lysine by non-acetyl groups
(propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation), and (iii) monoamine modification of glutamine by serotonin and
dopamine. In Aim 1, we will develop a platform for efficient generation of affinity reagents with high specificity
that can serve as genetically encoded biosensors for live cell imaging, as well as in conventional analyses like
ChIP-seq and CUT&Tag. In Aim 2, we will develop a platform for high throughput identification and quantification
of binding interactions mediated by histone modifications. In Aim 3, we will develop a platform for high throughput
interrogation of residue preferences of writers. Our work will develop “open source” platforms that are scalable,
cost-efficient, and easily adopted by other investigators in chromatin biology. Such platforms will serve as strong
complements to traditional biochemical assays by enabling research on both common and understudied histone
modifications, and unlocking new high throughput measurements and research questions in chromatin biology."

Skeletal muscle wasting and catabolic weight loss are highly prevalent among patients with heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and are independently associated with increased mortality. As many as half
of patients with advanced HFrEF have dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) evidence of significant muscle mass
loss. It currently unknown whether protein supplementation can reverse muscle loss and improve physical
function or survival for affected patients. The deranged systemic metabolism thought to accompany skeletal
muscle wasting in patients with HFrEF may also be a source of potential therapeutic intervention to improve
both muscle mass and survival. We have observed significant gains in skeletal muscle mass in the first 3-6
months after implantation of a left ventricular assist device, which treats the advanced HFrEF syndrome and
helps to normalize the deranged systemic metabolism. In the proposed project, we will perform a randomized
controlled trial of oral protein supplementation to determine its effectiveness in achieving clinically meaningful
increases in muscle mass muscle. We also plan to expand knowledge specific to HFrEF of two of the main
catabolic pathways thought to drive muscle wasting downstream from growth-differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15)
and the activin type IIA/IIB receptor (ActRII). Successful completion of the proposed Aims will facilitate our
long-term goal to develop nutritional and pharmacological interventions that prevent or reverse skeletal muscle
wasting and consequently improve physical functioning and survival for patients with HFrEF. Based on our
preliminary and published data, we propose to test the innovative hypothesis that skeletal muscle wasting in
HFrEF is promoted by neurohumoral activation of catabolic metabolism, including GDF-15 and ActRII
pathways, and can be at least partially reversed by enhanced dietary protein intake. We will test this
hypothesis by enrolling 140 adults with HFrEF for a cross-sectional assessment of GDF-15 and ActRII
pathways (Aim 1) and skeletal mass response to protein supplementation in a mechanistic clinical trial (Aim 2).
Aim 1 will determine whether GDF-15 of ActRII inhibition may be future therapies for patients with severe
muscle wasting that cannot be overcome by nutritional strategies. Aim 2 will define whether 30 gram/day
supplemental dietary protein for 6 months can increase dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) appendicular lean
maa (ALM). Successful completion of these aims will establish if dietary protein supplementation is indicated
in the clinical care of patients with HFrEF and catabolic weight loss and provide a platform for future studies of
adjunctive therapies of GDF-15 neutralization or activin A inhibition. Developing innovative interventions to
promote skeletal muscle mass and physical function for patients with HFrEF aligns well with the NHLBI’s
objective to develop novel therapeutic approaches for treating heart diseases and improving patient outcomes."

surface mucins are highly overexpressed in cancer and serve as primary structural elements of the glycocalyx.
In this proposal, our aims are to (1) determine how specific molecular properties of mucins govern the glycocalyx
structure and thereby mediate cellular resistance to NK-cell attack; (2) identify the specific mechanisms through
which mucins physically disrupt NK and CAR-NK attack; and (3) develop NK cellular engineering strategies to
overcome the mucin barrier.
To complete our aims, we will employ state-of-the-art imaging approaches that our lab has developed for
characterizing the nanoscale material structure of the glycocalyx. We also will take advantage of our lab’s
expertise and validated tools for engineering the physical structure of the glycocalyx. Combining these imaging
and cellular engineering strategies with established techniques in immune cell biology will enable new specific
hypotheses regarding the physical functioning of the glycocalyx in protection against immune cell attack to be
tested. They will also support the design and testing of engineered NK cells with structure-optimized CARs and
glycocalyx-editing enzymes for improved elimination of mucin-bearing cancer cells.
Adoptive cell therapy has tremendous promise for treating otherwise recalcitrant cancers. In part due to the
technical challenges of manipulating and characterizing the physical structure of the glycocalyx, our physical
understanding of the cancer-cell glycocalyx in resistance to adoptive cell therapy is poor. Our project will address
this knowledge gap and test new strategies for NK engineering that, if successful, can be further developed for
clinical applications."

Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are devastating brain tumors of childhood with no curative treatments. We and
others have observed up to 15% of all DMGs to harbor activating mutations in PPM1D which encodes the WIP1
protein phosphatase. Similar mutations are also observed in other cancers, including leukemias and endometrial
cancers. PPM1D has been well-documented to regulate pathways important in DNA-damage responses,
including TP53. We have found PPM1D mutations to be sufficient to enhance glioma formation and for PPM1D
to be necessary for ongoing proliferation, nominating PPM1D as a potential therapeutic target for children with
PPM1D-mutant DMGs. The experiments outlined in this proposal will dissect the mechanisms through which
PPM1D mutations induce tumor formation and will identify vulnerabilities associated with these processes that
can be therapeutically targeted. The results of these experiments will be relevant to children with PPM1D-mutant
DMGs, in addition to a larger population of patients who harbor PPM1D-mutant cancers."
10810866,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
 microRNAs (miRNAs) are an abundant class of small regulatory RNAs that
typically derive from stepwise cleavages of hairpin transcripts by the Drosha and Dicer
RNase III enzymes. The resulting mature miRNAs mediate extensive networks of post-
transcriptional regulation, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including cancer.
 This proposal extends our long-standing commitment to understanding atypical
strategies for microRNA biogenesis, and their implications during normal and
dysfunctional settings. For example, our past efforts uncovered diverse non-canonical
substrates that bypass Drosha and/or Dicer to yield active microRNAs. In current efforts,
we report unexpected insights into selective processing by Drosha and Dicer. First, we
gain insights from a non-canonical miRNA to propose a new general model for nuclear
microRNA biogenesis by Drosha and its cofactor DGCR8 at operons, which involves
novel cofactors. Second, we build on the observation that catalytic inactivation of Dicer is
selected in cancer to uncover selective biogenesis effects and unexpected molecular
and phenotypic consequences.
 We will dissect the models of underlying biogenesis mechanisms, and evaluate
the broader impacts of these regulatory strategies using genomic strategies. Overall, by
better understanding how microRNAs are generated, we will improve our capacity to
harness them experimentally, as well as help interpret recurrent diseases linked to
mutation of core microRNA biogenesis factors."
10754964,"TITLE: Development of a Mouse model to test targeted therapy to prevent CNS Invasion by Pediatric T-
ALL
Abstract
Leukemia is the most frequent pediatric cancer with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) being the most common
leukemia type in children. In 15-20% of pediatric T-cell ALL (T-ALL) patients, the cancer invades the Central Nervous
System (CNS), a site which is protected from systemic chemotherapies by the blood brain barrier. The invading leukemic
cells are reservoirs, which can emerge and re-enter the circulation following treatment and cause T-ALL relapse. To
prevent relapse, pediatric patients are treated with cranial irradiation and toxic chemotherapies, which are injected
directly into the CNS. It is not surprising that these treatments can lead to morbid life-long side effects such as reduced
intelligence, stunted growth, and secondary cancers in the CNS. Generally, the T-ALL has entered the CNS prior to
diagnosis, and it is unclear if blocking the entry of T-ALL into the CNS at that point, after they have already entered,
provides any therapeutic benefit. The overarching three goals of this proposal are: 1) to develop a mouse model of T-
ALL that recapitulates human T-ALL, in which we can see the cells in living animals 2) to determine if blocking T-ALL
cells from entering the CNS, prevents further T-ALL CNS invasion and 3) to determine if the T-ALL that has invaded the
CNS will eventually clear the CNS and return to the circulation. Our long-term goal is to reduce or eliminate the need
for damaging intrathecal or cranial treatments in patients with T-ALL. Our studies are based on a human xenograft
mouse model of T-ALL, which revealed that during leukemogenesis, expression of NOTCH1, a transcription factor which
is expressed in more than 80% of pediatric T-ALLs, induces expression of CC chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7). The study
revealed that activation of CCR7 in T-ALL by one of its ligands, CCL19 promotes chemotactic migration of T-ALL into the
CNS. Our proposal is based on a mouse model obtained from Dr. Monica Justice which uses an inducible CCR7(+)ROSA26
floxed-stop-PRDM14 (R26PR) locus. When crossed to an MX1-Cre these R26PR mice develop leukemia in response to
overexpression of NOTCH1, which invades the CNS. Subsequent breeding of these mice with ROSA26 floxed-stop
luciferase mice will result in Cre-recombinase induced expression of bioluminescent luciferase in T-ALL cells. To confirm
a role for CCR7 in the invasion of the CNS, these R26PR mice will be crossed with our own CCR7 conditional knockout
mice (CCR7floxed/floxed (CCR7f/f)) to produce R26PRDM14/CCR7f/f/MX1-CRE mice. Generation of this mouse is aim 1.
Determining which immune cells co-localize with T-ALL cells upon entry into the CNS is aim2 and determining if blocking
CCR7 using the CCL19 antagonist, CCL198-83 prevents or significantly reduces T-ALL CNS invasion, clears the CNS of T-ALL
and increases mouse survival is aim 3. Ultimately, if successful, this mouse model will provide a tool for developing novel
peptide therapies that can block T-ALL CNS invasion, without causing long-term CNS damage in patients and to study
mechanisms of CNS invasion."
10791783,"Beyond its primary function of repelling microbial challenges, the immune system plays important roles
in safeguarding tissue homeostasis. Macrophages have long been recognized to exercise such secondary
functions and, over the past several years, there has been growing interest in the implication of Foxp3+CD4+
regulatory T cells (or Tregs) in homeostatic processes. For example, unique Treg compartments in a number
of parenchymal tissues promote local repair/regeneration after acute or chronic injury – even in zebrafish!
 Skeletal-muscle Tregs serve as a paradigmatic pro-regenerative regulatory T cell population. First
reported by our lab in 2012, muscle Tregs increase rapidly after acute injury, differing from lymphoid-organ
Tregs in their elevated representation, tissue-adapted transcriptome, distinct – clonally expanded – T cell
receptor repertoire, and growth/survival factor dependencies. One intriguing axis, discovered during the last
funding-cycle, entails nociceptive neuron production of the peptide, CGRP; which elicits IL-33 production from
stromal cells; which, in turn, promotes local Treg accumulation. Muscle Tregs exert multiple influences along
the course of tissue repair – on both lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells during both the early, pro-inflammatory,
and late, pro-regenerative, phases. This broad range of activities highlights the need to go beyond the current
static image of muscle-Treg phenotype and function to obtain a dynamic view spanning the entire process.
 Temporal single-cell RNAseq data on the muscle-Treg compartment from 1-14 days post-injury
(generated during the last funding-cycle) revealed five distinct subtypes that waxed and waned over time:
circulating, recently activated, RORγ+, T-bet+ and GATA3+ (or reparative). Our long-term goal is to
understand how the five muscle-Treg subtypes integrate with each other and with neighboring
lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells to promote muscle regeneration. Our overall hypothesis is that
individual subtypes emerge and/or expand to deal with particular biological issues that arise during
the repair/regeneration process. In particular, this proposed project aims to:
1. Identify the provenance of RORγ+ skeletal-muscle Tregs.
2. Determine what critical role(s) RORγ+ Tregs play in effective muscle repair/regeneration.
3. Determine whether endogenous CGRP orchestrates increased IL-33 production by muscle MSCs and
consequent expansion of the reparative (GATA3+) muscle-Treg subtype.
 Completion of these studies will provide us with a more accurate and nuanced picture of Treg activities
during muscle regeneration. Potential therapeutic applications are many: catastrophic wound healing, exercise-
induced damage, age-related sarcopenias, muscular dystrophies, autoimmune myositides and chronic muscle
infections."

 The broad long-term goal is to optimize critical artemisinin and quinoline malaria drug combinations for maximum
killing of the P. falciparum parasite by defeating resistance. In the setting of ongoing drug resistance to currently
deployed drugs, this work will quantify a novel quinoline-like mechanism of action for the heme-artemisinin adducts,
define reversible or irreversible heme crystal inhibition correlated to level of drug resistance, and explore optimum
heme crystal inhibition related to parasite killing with quinoline-artemisinin combinations. Preliminary data validate
an additional mechanism of action for the artemisinins based on formation of abundant heme-artemisinin adduct,
which inhibits heme crystallization with irreversible action. Exogenous heme-artemisinin adducts inhibit artemisinin
ring-resistant mutant Kelch13 P. falciparum parasites with low nM IC50s. The experimental approach employs the
synergy between experimental investigations with P. falciparum drug-sensitive and resistant parasites in vitro and
physicochemical insights obtained by time-resolved in situ observations of crystal growth by atomic force microscopy
in the presence of different drug combinations.
 The hypothesis is that the inhibition of heme crystal formation by the heme adduct of dihydroartemisinin (DHA,
the product of most artemisinin-class drugs in vivo) renders trophozoites of any Plasmodium isolate sensitive, which
defeats the artemisinin ring-stage resistance. We also hypothesize that certain combinations of quinolines and
heme-dihydroartemisinin adduct (H-DHA) are superior in killing of parasites correlated to heme crystal inhibition as
well as separately to the degree of reversible/irreversible heme crystal inhibition. Towards these objectives, we will
pursue three specific aims: Aim 1. Establish the inhibition concentrations and mechanism of action of exogenous as
well as bio-activated H-DHA in drug sensitive and resistant Plasmodium. Aim 2. Establish reversibility or irreversibility
of H-DHA heme crystal inhibition in vivo and in vitro. Aim 3. Establish if double combinations of antimalarial quinolines
and H-DHA adducts enhance, weaken, or are indifferent to their partner’s action on parasite killing and the rate of
hematin crystallization.
 This proposed research will quantify the amount of parasite killing by artemisinin adduct metabolites which
renders trophozoite stages sensitive to the artemisinin drug class. The work will also inform fundamental knowledge
regarding mechanisms to defeat artemisinin resistance, degree of reversibility of hematin crystal growth, and
optimum combinations of malaria drugs based upon interaction effects."

 Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cell in the CNS and play vital roles in all
facets of brain physiology. Recent studies from our lab identified five molecularly and
functionally distinct astrocyte subpopulations in the brain. One of these subpopulations is
specifically labeled by the cell surface maker CD51 and is endowed with enhanced
synaptogenic function, leading us to hypothesize that CD51+ astrocytes play an important role
in functioning brain circuits. To determine how CD51+ astrocytes contribute to circuit function,
we created a CD51-FLP mouse line that allows us selectively label and manipulate this
population of astrocytes in the brain. To decipher the mechanisms that regulate CD51+
astrocytes, we found that the transcription factor Sox9 is enriched in this subpopulation.
Preliminary studies in a newly generated mouse line that specifically eliminates Sox9 in
astrocytes revealed that this transcription factor selectively regulates astrocyte morphology and
circuit function in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb in an aging-dependent manner. Together,
these new mouse lines will enable us to uncover how CD51+ astrocytes regulate brain circuits
and reveal novel roles for Sox9 in controlling astrocyte diversity and function during aging.
 Based on the strength of these preliminary observations, we propose the following
specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will define the anatomical, morphological and physiological
properties of CD51+ and CD51- astrocytes in the aging brain and decipher how they contribute
to circuit function in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. In specific aim 2, we will use our
astrocyte-specific Sox9 knockout mouse to decipher how it regulates astrocyte function in the
aging brain and how these changes in astrocytes impact circuit function in the hippocampus and
olfactory bulb. In specific aim 3 we will determine how Sox9 regulates astrocyte diversity during
aging and integrate our findings with Sox9 ChIP-Seq to decipher Sox9 target gene networks."

Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor, cognitive, and
psychiatric manifestations resulting from abnormal protein deposition and neurotransmitter deficits. The
variability in clinical presentation and progression in PD likely reflects underlying variability in brain pathology.
Although current treatments provide dramatic motor benefit in PD, they fail to fully alleviate gait impairment and
non-motor symptoms and may exacerbate cognitive and psychiatric features. These more complex symptoms
are linked to the function of large-scale brain networks, which can be measured with resting-state functional
connectivity MRI (RSFC). In our past work, we demonstrated that PD participants, as a group, show differences
in RSFC relative to healthy controls. However, development of clinical applications requires reliable individual-
level biomarkers that capture the widespread neuropathology and respects the clinical heterogeneity of PD,
opening the avenue to “personalized medicine” in PD. Recently developed precision-mapping RSFC approaches
now permit identification of individual-level differences in brain network organization with high reliability and may
provide a non-invasive biomarker for PD. Therefore, we propose to identify individual-level RSFC markers of
PD, examine the relationship of these precision RSFC markers with the clinical manifestations and
neuropathology of PD, and determine if precision RSFC markers predict cognitive decline and dementia in PD."
10744789,"Abstract
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death and its incidence is on the rise in young
people. Colorectal tumors are often detected at late stages where therapy often fails. Immunotherapy is
revolutionizing the treatment of many types of cancer but is only effective for a very small subset of CRC patients.
Thus, there is a critical need for improved therapies for CRC. Colorectal tumors grow from the intestinal
epithelium and interact with the colonic microbiota. CRC has been associated with shifts in the composition of
the microbiota that promote inflammation and tumor growth. The microbiota can also shape colonic T and B cell
immune responses and is a critical modulator of the efficacy of tumor immunotherapy. Using a mouse model of
CRC (AOM/DSS) we show that colonization with a single bacterial taxon: Helicobacter hepaticus, after tumors
have already developed, leads to a reduction in tumor burden and size. H. hepaticus also increased the number,
size and organization of Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) next to colorectal tumors. The presence of TLS is
associated with positive outcomes in CRC patients, but how they act to increase anti-tumor immunity is not
known. H. hepaticus-dependent tumor reduction depended upon CD4 T cells and B cells but not CD8 T cells.
Most H. hepaticus-specific CD4+ T cells differentiated into T Follicular Helper (TFH) cells and localized in TLS.
Importantly, CD4cre Bcl6flox mice, that cannot form TFH cells, also failed to either form TLS or control CRC growth,
but transfer of H. hepaticus-specific CD4+ T cells completely restored the anti-tumor response. Our hypothesis
is that the distinct mucus colonization properties of Hhep leads to activation of anti-Hhep TFH that interact with B
cells to induce peri-tumoral TLS formation. Colonic TLS then act as platforms for the activation of anti-tumor
CD4+ T cells, NK cells and B cells which invade the tumor to support effective anti-tumor immunity. We will test
this hypothesis in two aims. First, we will identify the genes and behavior, (such as mucus/epithelial colonization)
associated with Helicobacter-associated control over CRC. Next we will correlate the presence of TLS, TFH and
B cells in human CRC patients with specific mucus and tumor resident bacteria. Finally, we will use our mouse
models to identify whether TLS serve as platforms for more effective activation of anti-tumor T and B cells.
Together, our proposal has the potential to identify the key bacterial components that should be targeted to
augment anti-tumor immunity and colonic TLS. Further we may identify mechanisms by which TLS support anti-
tumor immune responses which could be used to formulate therapeutic anti-CRC approaches. If successful we
could identify mechanisms to rationally modify the microbiome to increase anti-tumor immunity."
10766238,"Heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States and causes more deaths than all cancers
combined. Coronary heart disease (or ischemic heart disease, IHD), the most common type of heart disease, is
accompanied by a major decline of local pH in myocardium. However, the mechanisms of pH regulation and the
homeostasis of H+ neutralizing buffers, such as HCO3- and Cl- in cardiomyocytes remain incompletely
understood, making it difficult to design therapeutic strategies targeting pH regulation. Recently, we have
identified and cloned different isoforms of a solute carrier, Slc26a6, from cardiac myocytes. Slc26a6 is the
predominant Cl-/HCO3- exchanger in the heart. We demonstrated that Slc26a6 mediates electrogenic Cl-/HCO3-
exchange activities in both atrial and ventricular myocytes. Our findings raise the possibility that Slc26a6 may
represent the predominant Cl-/HCO3- regulatory mechanism in the heart. We have obtained exciting data to
support the critical roles of Slc26a6 in cardiac excitability and contractility. We documented that null deletion of
Slc26a6 in mice results in shortened action potentials (APs), sinus bradycardia, fragmented QRS complexes
and impaired cardiac function compared to wild type littermates. We have identified and characterized two
isoforms of human SLC26A6 in human heart, which are also electrogenic, akin to mouse cardiac Slc26a6. In
addition, we recently identified and reported a dynamic beat-to-beat intracellular pH (pHi) regulation system,
termed “pHi transients”, which dovetails with the prevailing three known dynamic systems, namely electrical,
Ca2+, and mechanical systems. However, critical questions remain unanswered. How do Slc26a6 activities affect
not only pHi, but also cardiac AP and contractility? The goal of study is to determine the mechanistic links
between the Slc26a6 activities and cardiac AP and contractility. Contributions of Slc26a6-mediated Cl-/HCO3-
towards the pHi transients will also be tested. Taken together, we hypothesize that the activities of Slc26a6 on
pHi will directly contribute towards intracellular Na+ homeostasis, through Na+/HCO3- cotransporter (NBCe) and
Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), and subsequently regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentration through sarcolemmal Na+-
Ca2+ exchanger (NCX). Therefore, ablation of Slc26a6 will result in a reduction in intracellular Na+ and Ca2+
through the actions of NHE/NBCe and NCX, respectively. We further hypothesize that Slc26a6 plays important
roles in the dynamic pHi regulation in the heart regulating cardiac pacemaking activities and contractility. We will
test our hypothesis using multidisciplinary approaches including functional electrophysiological recordings,
imaging, biochemical, molecular and genetic approaches as well as ex vivo and in vivo functional studies. Wild
type and cardiac-specific Slc26a6 knockout mouse model as well as human cardiomyocytes will be tested. Three
specific aims are: 1. To determine the regulatory mechanisms of Slc26a6 on cardiac pHi and function. We will
test how Slc26a6 regulates dynamic cardiac pHi, Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis, hence, excitability and contractility.
The relationship between pHi and cardiac function will be directly tested to gain mechanistic insights into the
functional roles of Slc26a6 in the heart. We will use novel techniques including multimodal second harmonic
generation (SHG) microscopy and our recently established dynamic pH recording techniques. 2. To determine
the mechanistic roles of Slc26a6 in cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). We will test the contributions of Slc26a6
to cardiac function in the I/R mouse model. Mechanistic roles of Slc26a6 in cardiac I/R injury will be tested using
ex vivo confocal imaging of pHi, intracellular Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations. I/R injury will be employed in control
and Slc26a6-/- mice. 3. To determine the functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of Slc26a6 in cardiac
pacemaking activities. We will test the mechanistic roles of Slc26a6 in the regulation of AP firing frequency,
pacemaker currents, Ca2+ signaling, and pHi in SAN cells. Additionally, ECG telemetry will be used to test the
roles of Slc26a6 in conscious control and SAN-specific Slc26a6-/- mice. Our studies will unravel a missing
molecular link between pHi regulation and Na+, and Ca2+ homeostasis in the heart. The anticipated results will
provide novel insights into the roles of Slc26a6 in cardiac pHi regulation, cardiac excitability, and function under
physiological and pathological conditions. At the translational level, Slc26a6 may represent a novel therapeutic
target for cardioprotection in cardiac ischemia and arrhythmia."
10761772,"ABSTRACT
Studies in humans and laboratory animals have shown that ancestral exposure to chemicals in the environment
results in increased risk to a variety of diseases, including breast cancer, obesity, and autism, that can be
transmitted from the exposed to subsequent generations. Therefore, identifying the mechanisms underlying
the transgenerational transmission of environmentally induced epiphenotypes is critical for human health and
for basic biology, since explaining how epigenetic alterations can resist reprograming and be restored in
subsequent generations in the absence of the original stimulus challenges our current understanding of
epigenetics. Work in our lab indicates that exposure of F0 pregnant female mice to BPA during reprograming
of the F1 embryo germline results in obesity in the F2-F6 generations. Transgenerational transmission of
obesity correlates with activation of proximal and distal cis-regulatory elements (CREs) in the Fto locus of the
gametes by recruitment of CTCF, FOXA1, estrogen receptor (ESR1) and androgen receptor (AR). These
CREs interact with each other and with the promoters of the Fto, Irx3, and Irx5 genes in sperm of BPA but not
control mice. Irx3 and Irx5 negatively regulate the differentiation of appetite controlling POMC and AgRP/NPY
neurons in the hypothalamus. Their over-expression in mice ancestrally exposed to BPA leads to an increase
of AgRP neurons, leptin resistance, increased food intake, and obesity. Simultaneous deletion of the FOXA1
and CTCF sites in the Fto proximal CRE reverses all these effects after BPA exposure, suggesting that BPA-
induced occupancy of the CTCF/FOXA1 sites plays a causal role in transgenerational inheritance of obesity
epiphenotypes. Here we propose to gain a detailed understanding of the molecular processes affected by BPA
exposure in the germline and early embryo. We will study the interplay between transcription factor (TF)
occupancy, deposition of histone modifications and histone variants, DNA methylation, and gene expression
immediately after exposure to BPA of the primordial germ cells (PGCs) at day E13.5. We will then follow BPA-
induced epigenetic alterations in the F1 male and female germlines during their development, including
meiosis, up to the formation of the mature gametes in the adult organism. We will analyze changes in TF
occupancy in the F2 zygote after fertilization, during pre-implantation development, and in tissues of the
epiblast containing recently committed PGCs to understand the mechanisms by which changes induced in F1
PGCs are maintained or re-established in F2 PGCs. Mouse strains in which binding sites for specific TFs and
eRNAs have been deleted will be analyzed to determine the causal relationships in their recruitment and their
role in the establishment of enhancer feedback loops resulting in transgenerational inheritance. These results
will fill an important gap in our knowledge of the fundamental principles by which widely used endocrine
disrupting chemicals affect the epigenetic content of the germline in the exposed developing embryo and in
subsequent generations to cause adverse health effects."
10795876,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
An estimated 650,000 patients with cancer receive systemic therapy or radiation therapy (RT) annually in the
United States. Many of these patients undergoing outpatient cancer therapy will require acute care with an
emergency department visit or hospital admission due to symptoms from treatment, disease, or comorbidities.
This can impact cancer outcomes, patient treatment decisions, and costs to patients and the healthcare
system. While there has been much enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) to improve
healthcare delivery, high quality prospective data are lacking, especially across diverse clinical practice
settings.
We previously completed one of the first randomized controlled studies in healthcare ML, demonstrating that
ML based on EHR data can accurately generate personalized predictions and guide supportive interventions to
decrease acute care requirements and costs in patients undergoing RT and chemoradiotherapy (CRT)
(NCT04277650). We have also developed a ML model for predicting hospitalizations based on prospective
clinical trials of daily step counts collected in patients undergoing CRT. The research objective of this
application is to leverage a geographically, racially, socioeconomically, and technically diverse network of
healthcare settings and patients to assess and maximize how accurately and equitably these approaches
generalize. Our team includes the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Duke University, Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center, Essentia Health in Duluth, MN and Ashland, WI, Washington Hospital in Fremont,
CA, Duke Regional Hospital in Durham, NC, and Duke Raleigh Hospital in Raleigh, NC. Specifically, we seek
to: (1) prospectively evaluate the validity of an EHR-based acute care prediction ML algorithm across our
network and establish a framework for equity, generalizability, and portability and (2) validate our existing
patient-generated health data (PGHD; step count) models that predict hospitalization during CRT at a second
institution and integrate with our EHR-based ML algorithm to enhance prediction of acute care needs. We
hypothesize that our approaches will be accurate across institutions though require adjustments for both
generalizability and fairness, and that EHR- and PGHD-based approaches will offer complementary predictive
performance.
The long-term goal is to develop informatics-based tools that can be broadly and equitably deployed to
improve the delivery of cancer care and subsequent treatment outcomes. This research will generate data
regarding the generalizability and fairness of EHR- and PGHD-based approaches and a platform for a future
multi-institutional randomized controlled trial."

Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn, the pneumococcus) are Gram-positive bacteria and the leading cause of
community-acquired pneumonia worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates >1.6 million deaths are
the result of Spn infection each year, with children and the elderly being the most susceptible populations. Major
problems of pneumococcal disease include the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance and the global spread of
resistant clones. In addition, these problems are magnified by the major disadvantages of the current capsular
polysaccharide-based vaccines, such as serotype specificity and the resulting incomplete coverage. An
emerging way to address the growing antimicrobial resistance problem is the use of bacteriophage endolysins.
These enzymes are capable of degrading the bacterial peptidoglycan, killing and dispersing biofilm bacteria and
its matrix. In preliminary studies, we have developed a chimeric derivative of the well characterized Cpl-1
endolysin that displays >100-fold increase in antimicrobial activity, termed ClyX-1. We also show the ability of
this new endolysin to lyse planktonic Spn, and importantly we also observed that ClyX-1 was able to kill biofilm
Spn, as well as disperse the biofilm matrix. In addition, we have shown that upon Spn nasopharyngeal
colonization, activation of programmed necrosis, i.e. necroptosis, leads to development of antigen-specific
antibodies. Of note, treatment of colonized mice with ClyX-1 further promoted necroptosis activation, suggesting
endolysin treatment may enhance development of protective immunity against Spn. Herein, we aim to address
three overall hypotheses: a) that endolysins are efficient pneumococcal anti-biofilm agents, b) that endolysins
can be an effective way to prevent Spn colonization in a serotype-independent manner, and c) that intranasal
treatment with endolysins promotes protective immunity, to prevent re-colonization and severe disease. We will
use a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies with static and dynamic biofilms, mice, biochemistry (characterize
and benchmark pneumococcal endolysins), transgenic mice (to define the role of programmed cell death in
protective immunity), molecular and immunological techniques and next generation technologies (proteomics,
single cell transcriptomics) to establish better understanding of the effects of endolysin treatments against
pneumococcal disease in vivo and test their effectiveness in development of long-term serotype-independent
protective immunity."
10843052,"Project Summary/Abstract
Population scale genome sequencing projects such as The 1000 Genomes, TOPMed, and All of US Program
will generate genotype data for millions of individuals. This number increases substantially if the recreational
usage of genetic data from genealogy companies, such as 23andme, is accounted for. Sharing and analyzing
this data create monumental challenges for the privacy of participants. Recently the hackers began targeting
genealogy databases such as the hacking of GEDmatch in 2020. Due to the large scale and high dimensions of
genomic data, analysis workflows require large computational resources. This incentivizes companies, hospitals,
and research labs to use outsourcing services from third parties to analyze and interpret genomic data such that
the genomic data is stored on untrusted 3rd party servers.
In this proposal, we focus on the secure outsourcing of genotype imputation, which is a computationally intensive
and central task in large-scale genotype analysis. Genotype imputation is the prediction of missing or low-quality
variant genotypes using a small set of variant genotypes that are measured using, for example, genotyping
arrays, low-coverage, or targeted sequencing. It is a vital step for analyzing raw genomic data for quality control,
predicting missing genotypes, variant phasing, and fine mapping of associations to identify causal variants. When
combined with sparse arrays, imputation can greatly reduce the cost of population-scale and family-based
genotyping. For example, the All of Us Project will rely on a custom genotyping array, Infinium Global Diversity
Panel, to decrease the cost of genotyping millions of individuals. Imputation methods will be of vital importance
for this task. To perform these enormous tasks, the imputation methods require large computational resources
and are often outsourced to 3rd party “imputation servers”. These servers will soon process thousands, If not
millions, of genomes and store sensitive genomic data. Unfortunately, these services are not strictly secure
neither from unauthorized hackers nor from curious users who have authorized access to the servers. There is
an urgent need for privacy-aware imputation methods that can be deployed on even untrusted 3rd party services
such as high-performance cloud platforms so that outsourcing can be safely performed at population scale.
Our proposed methods use state-of-the-art homomorphic encryption that provides perfect genomic data security
while in transit, at rest, and even while imputation is being performed. We design new and efficient “encryption-
amenable” methods and frameworks for protecting the study participants and their families, and for protecting
the population panels, i.e., underrepresented populations. Our benchmarks show that secure methods achieve
high imputation accuracy even on commodity hardware with comparable time as the state-of-the-art non-secure
methods. Proposed methods can provide practical population-scale genomic privacy and security for imputation
and association studies."
10819217,"Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in tumor prevention. p53 is frequently mutated in human cancer,
including colorectal cancer (CRC). Many mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins not only lose tumor suppressive
function of wild-type p53, but also gain new oncogenic activities to promote tumorigenesis, which is defined as
mutp53 gain-of-function (GOF). Maintaining metabolic homeostasis is a novel and critical mechanism of p53 in
tumor suppression. Cancer cells often display lipid metabolic reprogramming, which contributes greatly to
cancer progression. Currently, the role and mechanism of mutp53 in cancer metabolic reprogramming are
poorly defined. Our preliminary studies suggest that mutp53 drives lipid metabolic reprogramming as a critical
GOF in CRC cells, and targeting lipid metabolic reprogramming compromises mutp53 GOF in colorectal
tumorigenesis. Based on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that GOF mutp53 drives lipid metabolic
reprogramming as a critical mechanism to promote colorectal tumorigenesis, which can be targeted for therapy
in CRC carrying mutp53. In this proposed study, we will determine the role (Aim 1) and mechanism (Aim 2) of
GOF mutp53 in driving lipid metabolic reprogramming in CRC. We will further assess targeting mutp53-driven
lipid metabolic reprogramming as a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC carrying mutp53 (Aim 3). The goal
of this study is to determine the mechanism of GOF mutp53 in CRC to provide effective targets and strategies
for CRC therapy. Metabolic reprogramming and p53 mutations are common events in cancer, and have
become extremely attractive targets for cancer therapy. We expect that the results from this proposed study
will deepen our understanding of the role and mechanism of mutp53 in metabolic reprogramming and
tumorigenesis, and provide the rationale and base for the development of new therapeutic targets and
strategies for cancers carrying mutp53."

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health problem causing 10 million new cases and 1.2 million
deaths just last year according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The single greatest impediment to TB
control is its ability to form persisters, the subpopulation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) cells that are
phenotypically resistant to killing by bactericidal drugs or immune effectors. We have discovered that arginine
starvation, induced by inoculating mutants of Mtb cells into arginine-free media or mice, mediates rapid
sterilization that kills both actively growing Mtb cells and Mtb persister cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover,
we have successfully determined the structure of the Mtb ArgB enzyme and used Fragment-Based Drug
Discovery (FBDD) to discover two scaffold compounds that bind and inhibit the enzymatic activity of ArgB. The
absence of the de novo arginine biosynthesis pathway enzymes Arg A, B, C, D, and J in humans and our
demonstration that Mtb cannot bypass argB or argF deletions make Arginine Biosynthetic Enzymes attractive
drug targets for TB drug development. Transcriptomic, metabolomics and flow-cytometric analyses on the
arginine starving cells have provided new insights into the sterilization process. By comparing arginine
starvation to three other sterilizing regimens, we identified a set of six genes that provide a sterilization
signature. We plan to exploit these genes for improved drug discovery, by identifying novel drugs to inhibit the
activity of Mtb ArgB using fragment-based drug design, confirm genetically any additional targets of the
arginine biosynthetic pathway to expand the drug target space, and determining the correlative or causative
role the common sterilizing signature genes play in Mtb sterilization. Together these studies will make available
a new way to rapidly sterilize cultures of Mtb and provide new drug possibilities and new insights to shorten TB
chemotherapy and treat drug-resistant TB."

 The natural history of human dermal leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania Viannia species
provides unequivocal evidence of long-term persistence of parasites in asymptomatically as well as
symptomatically infected individuals. Persistent infection can remain asymptomatic, or can be
clinically manifested through the development of mucosal or cutaneous leishmaniasis (ML and CL)
following either asymptomatic infections, or as recurrent disease long after resolution of primary
lesions. Molecular evidence of persistent parasites in the conjunctiva, nasal and oropharyngeal
mucosal tissues, skin and blood monocytes has been documented in as many as 40% of infected
individuals in endemic areas of L. Viannia transmission, however, the role of the host immune
response and parasite subpopulations in promoting and sustaining Leishmania persistence in
humans remains unknown. It is also well established that immune tolerance is an underlying factor
of latent infection and tissue protection in infections by other protozoa such as Plasmodium and
Toxoplasma. Similar host mechanisms of immune tolerance likely contribute to Leishmania
persistence in the absence of signs and symptoms, since disruption of the immune homeostasis by
immunosuppression or local trauma have been identified as contributing factors in recurrent CL. We
hypothesize that Leishmania-host interactions eliciting strong, yet regulated innate immune
responses drive the establishment of local environments of immune tolerance (metabolic and
immunological), that favor Leishmania persistence in humans.
 In this project we will characterize the transcriptomes, metabolomes and immunophenotypes
of host tissues and cells associated with persistent infection. We will genotype the corresponding
Leishmania populations, and will assess the participation of immunological tolerance in human
tissues where Leishmania persistence has been detected: nasal mucosa, skin and monocytes.
More specifically, we will 1) Identify the molecular signature of Leishmania persistence in a cohort
of patients with prior history of CL, 2) Characterize the genotype and phenotype of persister
Leishmania sub-populations as they modulate human host cells, and 3) Expand an ex vivo 3D cell
culture system to model the metabolic and immunological microenvironment of Leishmania
persistence. This project will provide critical knowledge on the metabolic and immunological
microenvironments of human tissues permissive for Leishmania persistence, define the signatures
and biomarkers of persistence, and advance ex vivo models of persistent Leishmania infection."

 Everyday navigation behaviors that may seem mundane to healthy young adults are, at their core, quite
complex. Seemingly rote navigation such as driving to the office require coordination of multiple streams of
sensory information as well as memory for the global structure and layout of the environment (i.e., a “cognitive
map”). Representations of space are often classified into two distinct frames of reference: egocentric –
viewpoint-dependent relationships – and allocentric – observer-independent landmark relationships. The
inability to reconcile egocentric and allocentric representations leads to disorientation, even in familiar spaces,
and is associated with damage to spatial processing networks and regions of the brain including retrosplenial
cortex (RSC). This type of disorientation also serves as a marker for preclinical stages of dementia. However,
current spatial models of RSC function remain poorly connected with parallel lines of research from episodic
memory. This narrow theoretical focus is problematic given the wide range of cognitive processes ascribed to
RSC. The most prominent spatial model of RSC function, referred to as the BBB model, posits that RSC
primarily supports the flexible use of egocentric and allocentric reference frames by translating between
egocentric and allocentric spatial reference frames. Such spatial translator models of RSC are computationally
plausible and generally compatible with findings in the navigation and spatial cognition literature, but there has
been no direct test of this model in humans. Moreover, few functional neuroimaging studies are designed a
priori to directly study RSC function. An alternative model posits that RSC is part of a predictive coding
hierarchy. In this comparator model, a general function of RSC is to make predictions about the world based
on learned experiences and evaluate the accuracy of these predictions against actual sensory information to
resolve any discrepancies and update future predictions (i.e., Bayesian inference). Assumptions for each
model will be evaluated during memory for previously learned spatial experiences (slow, Aim 1) as well as for
the spatial demands of the previous trial (fast, Aim 2). To accomplish this, state-of-the-art immersive virtual
reality techniques will be combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Receiver operating
characteristic approaches as well as advanced univariate and multivariate fMRI analyses will be used to
analyze data from novel behavioral paradigms comprising episodic and spatial memory elements. Functional
MRI will allow for accurate and non-invasive imaging of RSC during behavior, and novel task manipulations will
pit the predictions of RSC comparator and translator models against one another. These experiments will
challenge long-standing spatial theories that have not undergone a rigorous test in humans. The findings will
close a gap between poorly connected theories of RSC function in spatial cognition and episodic memory."

Ciliopathies comprise an expanding group of human disorders associated with genetic mutations causing cilia
dysfunction. Cilia can be divided into motile and non-motile (primary) forms. The primary cilium is a microtubule
(MT)-based organelle that protrudes from the apical surface of nearly every mammalian cell and plays a critical
role in chemical sensation, signal transduction, and control of various cellular functions. To date, there are still
major gaps in our knowledge about the dynamic structure and function of the primary cilium, and the
underlying molecular basis of ciliopathies. Our research proposal is focused on elucidating the molecular
mechanism by which pathogenic mutations in the human CILK1 (ciliogenesis associated kinase 1) gene cause
ciliopathies. CILK1 encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase that negatively regulates cilia length and
ciliogenesis. Three significant questions about CILK1 remain to be addressed. First, what is the identify of
CILK1 substrates that relate to its ciliopathy phenotype? Our data challenged the current view that MT-
associated motor KIF3A is the CILK1 substrate responsible for the ciliopathy phenotype by showing that
disrupting CILK1 phosphorylation of KIF3A in vivo did not reproduce CILK1 mutant phenotype. In this
continuation project, we hypothesize that CILK1 suppresses ciliogenesis by phosphorylating a novel MT-
associated ciliary protein and promoting MT disassembly. Second, how is CILK1 activity regulated in the
primary cilium? CILK1 requires phosphorylation of its MAPK-like TDY motif for full activation, but growth factors
have little stimulatory effect on its activity. Our new preliminary data shows that reducing intracellular cAMP
stimulates CILK1. We hypothesize that CILK1 activity is negatively regulated by ciliary cAMP-dependent
phosphorylation. Third, how CILK1 human disease variants impact cilia function and signaling and tissue
development? We observed human disease variants in the non-catalytic C-terminal domain (CTD) of CILK1
that retain CILK1 catalytic activity but produce a loss-of-function effect on suppression of ciliogenesis. We
hypothesize that CILK1 variants in the CTD perturb CILK1 localization and substrate recognition, thereby
compromising its ability to suppress ciliogenesis. We propose three specific aims to test these hypotheses.
Aim 1 will determine how CILK1 signals through a novel signaling pathway to control cilia length and
ciliogenesis. Aim 2 will determine how cAMP inhibits CILK1 to elongate cilia and promote ciliogenesis. Aim 3
will determine the impact of CILK1 pathogenic variants on substrate phosphorylation, cilia function, Hedgehog
signaling, and tissue development. The significance of this project derives from human ciliopathies that have
an expanding disease spectrum with devastating clinical outcomes. Our studies are innovative in using novel
genetically engineered animal and cell models to elucidate new mechanisms that control cilia function and
signaling. Our research will exert strong impact on basic knowledge about the primary cilium and significantly
advance our understanding of the disease mechanisms underlying human ciliopathies."

FOXP3+ CD4+ cells are expanded within the inflamed mucosa of Crohn’s disease (CD) patients; yet the
persistence of intestinal inflammation suggests these CD associated CD4+FOXP3+ cells lack typical regulatory
T cell (TREG) suppressive function. The functional and therapeutic implications of senescence in FOXP3+ TREG
cells is unknown. The long-term goal of this application is to dissect the epigenetic mechanisms driving the
differentiation and function of CD4+FOXP3+ cells in the setting of intestinal inflammation. Consequently, the
overall objective of this proposal is to identify the mechanisms leading to senescent FOXP3+ cells in the setting
of GI inflammation and test therapeutic opportunities to restore regulatory function. The central hypothesis is that
CD associated FOXP3+ cells represent a senescent state and contribute to intestinal inflammation. Furthermore,
this new cellular phenotype (senescent FOXP3+ cell, snFOXP3) represents a potential therapeutic target. This
hypothesis was formulated through single cell transcriptomic analysis of CD4+FOXP3+ cells from the lamina
propria of CD patients, produced by this applicant’s laboratory. The rationale is that defining the mechanisms
critical to the development and function of snFOXP3 cells in the setting of inflammation will uncover targets for
TREG-directed therapies, including the advanced engineering of human TREGS for adoptive cell therapy trials.
Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Why do
FOXP3+ cells become senescent in the absence of BMI1?; 2) Why are FOXP3+ cells senescent in Crohn’s
disease?; and 3) Why are snFOXP3 cells proinflammatory? Under the first aim, the applicant will utilize
epigenetic assays, which have been established as feasible in the applicant’s hands, to establish BMI1
repression on an ETS1-regulated senescence program in FOXP3+ cells. Antibodies and assay reagents that
are already on hand will be used. Under the second aim, the applicant will utilize a biochemistry approach with
treatment of cultured TREGS to determine a TNFα-induced disruption of BMI1-mediated repression of
senescence. Finally, under the third aim, the applicant will use a novel in vitro co-culture system to establish the
proinflammatory capacity of snFOXP3 cells and establish therapeutic targets. The approach is innovative
because it departs from the status quo of functional characterization of CD4+FOXP3+ cells utilizing single cell
approaches, and a mechanistic approach to define the epigenetic events that lead to a pathogenic snFOXP3
cell. Upon conclusion, the applicant will understand the epigenetic mechanisms leading to the development of
snFOXP3 cells in the setting of intestinal inflammation. This contribution is significant as the snFOXP3 is
expanded in the Crohn’s lesion, is proinflammatory, and represents an important epigenetic drug target. This
project is the first to articulate both signature and precise epigenetic events that regulate activation of senescence
in TREGS in intestinal inflammation, therefore advancing the field of therapeutics in engineered cell therapies in
the setting of autoimmune diseases."
10766253,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease resulting from an interactive web of genetic and
environmental factors. SLE is associated with elevated levels of type I interferons (IFN I) and viral infections.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the innate immune signaling pathway have been linked to an
increased risk for SLE by genome wide association studies. One common SNP that is strongly associated with
SLE is located in the viral dsRNA sensor, IFIH1 (rs1990760), which results in an amino acid change (A946T).
The precise roles of the IFIHI T946 variant in SLE pathogenesis remain unclear. Recently, we showed that a knock-
in mouse model expressing the IFIH1 variant (IFIH1T946; Ifih1R) displays heightened basal IFN I expression and
a signature of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in immune cells. This low grade interferonopathy correlates
with increased persistence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies in an induced SLE model. Therefore, the Ifih1R model
provides a unique opportunity to determine how the IFIH1T946 variant primes immune cells for elevated responses
that promote autoimmunity. Herein, we will focus on two aims: 1) elucidating the role of pDCs in the elevated
IFN signature in Ifih1R mice, and 2) determining how IFIH1R alters CD4+ T cell effector function and associated
cellular metabolic remodeling that lead to SLE pathogenesis. Successful completion of these aims will elucidate
transcriptional and metabolic mechanisms by which IFIH1R primes pDCs and CD4+ T cells to promote SLE
pathogenesis. The information gained will help guide therapeutic approaches based on alterations in metabolic
pathways in SLE and other autoimmune diseases."

Normal vision depends on the balanced generation and homeostatic regulation of major retinal cell types, and
the disruption of these processes may result in congenital retinal disorders and retinal degeneration, affecting
millions of people around the world each year. Regenerative medicine depends on our understanding of retinal
development for informing retinal cell reprogramming and manufacturing. While there have been significant
advances in unravelling the roles of transcription factors, a major gap exists in our knowledge of how these
tightly regulated gene networks are governed by epigenetic mechanisms. Polycomb-group complexes are
evolutionarily conserved epigenetic machineries that remodel chromatin through histone modifications for
silencing targeted genes and have been recently shown to affect retinal neurogenesis and lineage decisions.
BCOR is a component of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 variant that ubiquitinates lysine 119 on histone
H2A (H2AK119Ub). Dysregulation of BCOR is clearly associated with eye and retinal disorders, including Lenz
microphthalmia, Oculofaciocardiodental Syndrome, and retinoblastoma, but its role in retinal neurogenesis is
still not well understood. In preliminary studies, I performed coimmunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry and
validated BCOR’s interaction with other PcG proteins in retinal cells. I then performed BCOR chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) and identified strong peaks at retinal progenitor genes LHX2,
PAX6, SIX3, and SIX6, all of which are significant in optic vesicle development and later play distinct roles in
retinal cell fate decisions. Thus, I propose to investigate the role of BCOR in retinal neurogenesis. I
hypothesize that BCOR mediates the switch from retinal progenitors to differentiated cell types by recruiting
PcG proteins to regulate H2AK119Ub on the chromatin to repress multipotency genes. I will test this
hypothesis with the following aims: (1) Identify the epigenetic mechanism of BCOR for regulating retinal
progenitor genes, and (2) Determine how BCOR affects the generation of major retinal cell types in vivo. My
overall objective is to characterize BCOR-ncPRC1.1’s role in retinal development as an avenue to discovering
new epigenetic targets for regenerative strategies in the retina."

To understand normal development and differentiation, it is necessary to determine the mechanisms by which
cells initiate new programs of gene expression and promote the formation of specific cell lineages. Typically,
this involves activation of genes that are transcriptionally silent and that are likely incorporated into repressive
chromatin structure. Evidence supports the idea that differentiation-specific transcriptional regulators and
enzymes that remodel or alter chromatin structure cooperate to render genomic DNA more accessible to the
transcriptional machinery. The mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) enzyme family members remodel
nucleosome structure in an ATP dependent manner and facilitate transcription factor function in vitro and in
vivo. Components of these enzymes are essential for embryonic development and some can act as tumor
suppressors or tumor promoters. Additionally, SWI/SNF enzymes are implicated in cell cycle control. Thus
these enzymes are broadly required for normal cell function and for differentiation and development, and their
misregulation is implicated in tumor formation.
Skeletal muscle differentiation has long been a model for studying fundamental principles of tissue-specific
gene expression and differentiation. The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling enzymes play essential roles in
these processes. This project will focus on the mechanisms by which different kinases and phosphatases
involved in signaling pathways regulate the phosphorylation and function of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
enzyme subunits in proliferating and differentiating myoblasts. We will employ methods to manipulate the
expression of specific kinases, phosphatases and remodeling enzyme subunits and will manipulate function
through use of inhibitors and mutagenensis. We will analyaze the effects of such approaches on gene
expression, chromatin binding and remodeling, transcription factor function, local higher-order gene structure,
and overall genome organization. The work will provide new paradigms for understanding how signaling
molecules converge on chromatin to regulate tissue differentiation and development."

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, cardiovascular disease,
amputations, reduced quality of life, and premature death in the United States, and it is expected that one in
three Americans will have T2D by 2050. To stem the tide of this health crisis, new strategies are needed to
prevent the progression to T2D from prediabetes—elevated glucose levels that are not yet in the diabetes
range. A growing body of research suggests that insomnia is a major modifiable risk factor for progression to
diabetes. The proposed study would build off a promising feasibility study to test whether providing cognitive
behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) to patients with prediabetes results in a reduction in glucose levels
compared to a patient education control program. If so, this insomnia treatment could be an effective tool to
prevent diabetes.
Individuals with prediabetes and insomnia will be randomized to receive six sessions of a deployment-ready
digital CBT-I program, providing standard-of-care treatment for insomnia (intervention arm, n = 150), or a
patient education website providing nontailored educational material about insomnia (control arm, n = 150).
We will complete assessments at baseline, at 10 weeks (after the conclusion of the intervention and control
programs), and at 32 weeks post-baseline, measuring hyperglycemia, objective and subjective measures of
sleep, and potential mediating variables including diet, exercise, and mood. We will also collect and store
blood samples to allow for assessment of metabolic mechanisms in future research.
We will assess (1) whether individuals randomized to the intervention arm have lower rates of
hyperglycemia, as measured by oral glucose tolerance testing and various secondary measures, than
individuals randomized to the control arm at 10 weeks and 32 weeks after baseline; (2) whether
improvements in sleep after baseline are associated with decreases in hyperglycemia, regardless of study
arm; and (3) whether any effects of the intervention on hyperglycemia are mediated by improvements in
sleep, diet, exercise, and/or mood.
This research will serve as a critical step in identifying a potentially dramatic tool for improving health
outcomes for Americans at risk of T2D. Sleep interventions can lead to sustained improvements that are
intrinsically rewarding to patients. If effective, digital CBT-I could provide a powerful pathway to preventing
diabetes for millions of patients with prediabetes."
10794276,"Neuronal activation leads to increases in blood flow to the region. Since its discovery in the 19th century, this
phenomenon – termed functional hyperemia – has been thought to provide increased energy nutrients to
sustain the increased neural activity. Impaired functional hyperemia is seen in many neurodegenerative
diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, these diseases also manifest reduced baseline flow
levels, making it difficult to determine the importance of functional hyperemia per se in sustaining healthy
neuronal function. Functional hyperemia also forms the basis of many imaging techniques (such as fMRI), that
take advantage of the spatially localized blood flow increase to infer the location of neural activity from
vascular/metabolic measures. Despite the widespread importance of understanding functional hyperemia for
neuroscience, the impacts of eliminating only the activity-induced increase in blood flow – without altering
baseline flow levels or the activity of neurons and other cortical cells – are still unknown. This proposal will
determine how neuronal activity and neuro-metabolism are affected in health and in Alzheimer's
disease when functional hyperemia is blocked. We recently developed a model system to block functional
hyperemia using optogenetics. To our surprise, we found that sensory-evoked neuronal responses were not
diminished when functional hyperemia was blocked. In Aim 1 we will build on this preliminary data by studying
what aspects of neural responses to sensory stimuli are altered by the loss of functional hyperemia. Two-
photon calcium imaging will be used in mouse primary visual cortex to quantify how the response amplitude
and selectivity to stimulus attributes (orientation selectivity) of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are affected.
Using electrophysiology, we will determine if temporally precise aspects of neuronal activity, such as spike
timing and network synchrony (i.e. gamma oscillations) are altered. Our working hypothesis is that blocking
functional hyperemia impairs the cellular machinery involved in generating action potentials (such as restoring
ion gradients). However, these consequences may not initially appear as reduced response levels, but rather
as alterations in spike timing, excitatory/inhibitory balance, network synchrony, and information encoding. We
will also determine if healthy young brains have the capacity to buffer the loss of functional hyperemia in ways
that a diseased brain cannot by blocking functional hyperemia in a mouse model of AD. This will also shed light
on the relative importance of reduced functional hyperemia versus baseline flow levels in AD pathology.
In Aim 2 we will study how neuronal metabolism is affected by blocking functional hyperemia. We will record
the concentrations of oxygen, glucose, lactate and ATP in the tissue to determine how blocking functional
hyperemia affects the levels of these metabolites and if it leads to altered metabolic processing in neurons. We
will also quantify how the vasculature reacts to temporary reductions in blood flow. This proposal will define the
role functional hyperemia plays in maintaining the moment-to-moment metabolic needs of neurons."

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women and the most common cause of female cancer deaths.
While breast conserving surgery (lumpectomy) with neo/adjuvant therapy is the best desirable treatment option,
about 25% of cases require secondary surgery when tumors are incompletely removed, with possible additional
complications, patient anxiety, and conversion to mastectomy. Re-excision rates are especially high among
patients with more aggressive tumors, which are characterized by acidic tumor microenvironment (TME). We
propose to develop and implement a holistic approach for tumor acidity imaging with pre-operative multi-
parametric MRI (mpMRI) and novel pHLIP® ICG near infrared fluorescent (NIRF) intra-operative imaging. pHLIP-
ICG is an ICG, FDA-approved NIRF indocyanine green dye, conjugated to a pH-sensitive pH-Low Insertion
Peptide (pHLIP) for targeting tumor cell surface acidity and for marking the invasive acidic tumor-stroma
interface, thereby allowing pHLIP-ICG to target cancer lesions and to delineate positive tumor margins. Our
clinical study consists of a prospective first-in-human phase I trial and a feasibility phase IIa trial. Aim 1 (phase
I and IIa): To prospectively develop, implement, and optimize novel mpMRI sequences in consecutive BC
patients undergoing lumpectomy for clinical non-contrast non-invasive assessment of the TME and tissue acidity
including intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, lactate MR
spectroscopy, and chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging. Aim 2 (phase I): To evaluate the safety and
tolerability of intravenous pHLIP-ICG administration in 4 dose levels in patients with primary BC undergoing
lumpectomy, and to establish the “optimal” dose which will be used in the phase IIa trial. This optimal dose is
defined as the lowest dose that is safe and that allows the best intra-operative visualization of BC with pHLIP-
ICG NIRF imaging. Aim 3 (phase IIa): To establish the feasibility of pHLIP-ICG targeting and intra-operative
imaging of primary BC and margin delineation at the selected optimal dose of pHLIP-ICG using histopathology
as the reference standard. Aim 4 (phase IIa): To correlate TME acidity imaging (non-contrast non-invasive pre-
operative mpMRI, and intra-operative and ex vivo pHLIP-ICG NIRF imaging) with standard histopathology and
investigational immunohistochemistry for concordance and accuracy of BC visualization, margin status, and
properties of the TME including different levels of acidity, lesion extent, and TME structure. The overarching
long-term goal is to improve the standard of care: i) pre-operative non-invasive, non-contrast TME acidity
imaging with mpMRI will allow the identification of more aggressive tumor phenotypes that require intensified
treatment, improve planning of surgical and treatment strategies, and enable monitoring spatial-longitudinal of
tumor biology with treatment; and ii) intra-operative pHLIP-ICG NIRF imaging will allow an improved up-front
resection of primary breast cancer, which could allow a shift from more extensive surgeries to highly accurate
tissue-sparing lumpectomies – therefore improving the quality of patients’ lives."

 Malignant gliomas represent 81% of primary brain malignancy and cause significant morbidity and
mortality. Despite the extensive characterization of malignant glioma at the molecular level, the knowledge has
yet to significantly improve patient outcome. Molecular features, most notably IDH1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase
1) hotspot mutations at Arg132, are now an integral part of the WHO classification of gliomas because patients
with IDH1 mutation show significantly better outcome than those without. IDH1 mutations are extremely
prevalent in lower-grade glioma. Although IDH1 mutations have been identified in various types of cancer, our
analysis of >45,000 human pan-cancer samples revealed that IDH1 mutations are rare events despite the
prevalence of IDH1 mutations in glioma. Furthermore, co-occurrence of IDH1 mutation and TP53 alteration is
virtually exclusive in glioma. The requirement of TP53 alteration for IDH1-mutant glioma genesis has been
demonstrated in mouse models, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Recent studies discovered
that p53-mediated ferroptosis—a newly recognized form of cell death resulting from lipid peroxidation—is
critical for tumor suppression. Given the sensitivity of IDH1-mutant glioma to redox and ferroptosis, we
hypothesize that TP53 alteration is crucial to IDH1-mutant glioma by inhibiting ferroptosis whereas p53
reactivation specifically sensitizes IDH1-mutant glioma to ferroptosis. Our long-term goal is to provide a
mechanistic understanding of the role of TP53 mutation in IDH1-mutant gliomagenesis and to identify novel
targets in preclinical models to improve glioma treatment. In this project, we will investigate the tissue-specific
role of TP53 mutation in IDH1-mutant gliomagenesis and repurpose FDA-approved drug for precision
reactivation of p53 mutants in glioma. The proposed studies will fill the knowledge gap in the understanding of
tissue-specific role of TP53 mutations in IDH1-mutant gliomagenesis through the investigation of p53-mediated
ferroptosis and provide novel insight into the unique vulnerability of IDH1-mutant glioma to be explored for
precision treatment. Our generated reagents will provide a valuable resource for the wider scientific community
to pursue further research."
10904665,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), one of the most common endocrinopathies in women, presents with
anovulation in adolescence and reproductive dysfunction is worsened by excess weight. Females with PCOS
also have lowered insulin sensitivity (IS), which integrates obesity and reproductive abnormalities. Obesity as
well as excess testosterone and insulin are risk factors for endometrial carcinoma, secondary to the lack of
ovulatory cycles with excess hormonal stimulation of the endometrium. Despite the high prevalence and
gravity of comorbidities associated with PCOS, widely effective therapeutic options are lacking. Glucagon-like
peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) increase post-prandial insulin secretion and modulate gut and
hypothalamic hormone responses to suppress appetite and cause weight loss. GLP-1 RA are approved to treat
diabetes, and in higher doses, obesity. Limited data on older and less potent GLP-1 RA, such as exenatide or
liraglutide, in women with PCOS are promising with improved menstrual frequency and lowered serum
testosterone. Our initial results following 4 months of treatment with a more potent and oral formulation GLP-
1 RA, semaglutide, in adolescents with PCOS and obesity demonstrated lower post-prandial glucose, a shifted
insulin curve to a more normal pattern with a resultant improved oral disposition index. The trial is too short
of duration to assess reproductive dysfunction, although there is a trend for decreased serum testosterone and
nearly half had improved menses frequency compared to the 4 months prior to the trial. Adolescents have
lower IS than adults, and youth with diabetes or obesity respond less to GLP-1 RA than adults. Work is needed
on the role of longer-term, more potent GLP-1 RA treatment in women with PCOS + obesity, especially across
the reproductive lifespan. Further, there is a gap in understanding the underlying features predictive of GLP-1
RA response, limiting the ability to include GLP-1 RA in a personalized therapy plan for PCOS.
 Our overarching hypothesis is that weight loss and metabolic improvements are required to improve
reproductive health in individuals with PCOS. The aims of this application will be performed in the context of a
year-long clinical trial. After a 4-month observation period of either no medication or metformin treatment, we
will treat females aged 12-35 years with obesity and PCOS for 10 months with semaglutide to induce weight
loss and improve ovulation and lower testosterone. We aim to: SA1) Quantitate ovulation frequency before
and after semaglutide in females with PCOS. SA2) Quantitate ovulation frequency following combination
treatment with semaglutide + metformin. SA3) The ovulation response to semaglutide will relate to baseline
characteristics and metabolic response to therapy. This study will define the reproductive impact of currently
available medications on this common, high-risk disease, with the potential to immediately change health
outcomes. We will also identify predictors of treatment response, as a step towards developing high-quality
personalized treatment plans for those with PCOS + obesity."
10768733,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The mechanisms that underlie the emergence of an obesity-associated increased risk in breast cancer
after menopause are not fully understood. Increased adipose-derived estrogens certainly contribute to
obesity-associated postmenopausal breast cancer, but additional mechanisms are also involved. Most
women gain weight during menopause, and this is seen primarily as an increase in visceral adipose
tissue (VAT) in the abdominal region. This in turn increases inflammation locally, systemically, and at
distant sites such as subcutaneous adipose (SAT) in the breast, suggesting that changes in body
composition during menopause could drive increased cancer risk. The long-term goal is to identify the
mechanisms underlying obesity-associated tumor risk during menopause, and to use a precision-
medicine approach to develop interventions to effectively minimize this risk in women with obesity. The
overall objective of this grant is to determine the functional role that menopausal VAT deposition plays
in obesity-related breast cancers. The central hypothesis is that increased VAT deposition during
menopause mediates breast tumor development and growth through increased production of
adipokines, cytokines, and growth factors that signal systemically to metabolically activate a subset of
tumor-promoting macrophages in the mammary adipose/breast. Using a well-characterized preclinical
rat model of obesity and postmenopausal breast cancer combined with a syngeneic orthotopic
transplant model and in vitro assays, the central hypothesis will be tested with the following specific
aims: 1) Determine the functional contribution of menopause-induced visceral adipose accumulation on
mammary tumor development; 2) Interrogate how modifying insulin resistance, VAT, and adipose-
derived signals alters macrophage activation, and the resulting impact on tumor development and
growth after OVX. Preclinical findings will be confirmed in relevant clinical samples. The research
proposed in this application is highly innovative as it will directly assess the biological role of visceral
fat, inflammation, insulin resistance, and associated metabolic activation of macrophages in the tumor
promotion process. Further, it will define a specific macrophage subtype that could be targeted to
decrease obesity-associated cancers after menopause. This is significant as it will identify new targets
for future pharmacological therapies and will provide the foundational platform for a precision medicine
approach, using a clearly measurable target (decreased VAT), during a critical life stage (peri-
menopause/ menopause), to decrease cancer risk in women with obesity."
11031075,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Obstacles on mRNAs cause eukaryotic ribosomes to stall. Severely stalled ribosomes collide with
the upstream, translating ribosomes and form a complex of two ribosomes, referred to as “disome”,
which is detected and removed by the Ribosome Quality Control (RQC) pathway. By establishing
Disome-seq technique, which reveals genome-wide distribution of ribosome collisions across the
transcriptome, we showed that RQC-targeted disomes frequently form on yeast mRNAs. We also found
that collisions in yeast trigger the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which reduces translation while
inducing the expression of survival genes. Similarly, disomes activate ISR in humans to promote survival,
but its hyperactivation leads to cell death. This indicates that cellular health is determined by disome
homeostasis, which collectively refers to the disome distribution across transcripts, the overall disome
abundance and the downstream response evoked by RQC/ISR. The mechanisms by which RQC and
ISR detect disomes and affect collision dynamics, however, are poorly understood. The mutations of
RQC and ISR components as well as dysregulated ribosome stalling have been linked to
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the contribution of disome homeostasis
to neuronal differentiation and function is unclear.
 The objective of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms of disome homeostasis, to
examine the role of disome regulation in neurons and to understand how its dysregulation leads to
diseases. I hypothesize that regulation of disome homeostasis is important for neurodevelopment and
neuronal health, and its dysregulation causes neuronal pathologies. In Aim 1, I will determine the
mechanism of disome recognition by RQC and ISR in healthy and stressed cells by using selective
Disome-seq and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. In Aim 2, I will determine the distribution and
abundance of disomes, and the role of RQC/ISR factors during the differentiation of induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) into mature neurons by using fluorescence reporters, Disome-seq and neuronal
assays. In Aim 3, I will delineate the link between dysregulation of disome homeostasis and neuronal
diseases that were proposed to affect ribosome stalling by using Disome-seq, RNA-seq, RQC/ISR
reporters and phenotypic experiments in the cells with disease mutations. I will further test the translation
inhibitors as potential therapeutics to ameliorate the disease phenotypes. Overall, proposed work will
illuminate crucial insights into the regulation of ribosome collisions and their role in neuronal homeostasis."

This project aims to improve our ability to support the resilience of family caregivers of adults with autism and
developmental disorders as the caregivers move into later life. Based on a 30 year longitudinal study that
prospectively followed families from when their children were referred for possible autism or developmental
delays, we will use a social convoy model to investigate trajectories of social connectedness and isolation over
the next five years as they affect caregivers’ mental health and well-being. This model describes changes in
social connectedness over time that may increase vulnerability or reduce the effects of caregiver burden. We
examine additional interacting factors specifically related to family caregiver well-being and mental health in
families with adult children with developmental disabilities. We will use questionnaires, app-based diaries, face
to face interviews and exploratory measures of biological and cognitive aging over the course of 5 years during
which our sample is in their 60’s, linked to rich behavioral data from the past 20-30 years. Our objective is to
identify life milestones, such as retirement and the adult child’s moving out, as well as caregiver coping
strategies that allow us to support well-being and mental health in family caregivers as they age."

 The candidate requests support for a five-year program for training and research to better understand
how indices of retinal function, structure, and vasculature can inform our understanding of pathophysiological
mechanisms in early course schizophrenia (ECS).
 In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in cell biology,
neuroscience and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center. His training includes: 1) vision science, 2) neuropsychiatric assessment of ECS, and 3) the responsible
conduct of research.
 Visual perceptual abnormalities, which affect >60% of patients with schizophrenia, have reliably
correlated with worse core clinical outcomes. These alterations are consistent with retinal structural (optical
coherence tomography) and functional (electroretinography) changes in schizophrenia. Previous studies have
not attempted to understand the retinal structure-to-function relationships, the course of retinal to central
nervous system pathology, and the role of retinal phenotypes in ECS. Also, whether these changes precede
and lead to cortical changes, or vice versa, or whether both occur at the same time due to a general
neurodegenerative process has not been previously explored in schizophrenia.
 This candidate’s research plan seeks to: 1) propose retinal phenotypes of ECS captured in cost-
effective, practical, and clinically relevant manner using novel retinal imaging tools such as electroretinography,
optical coherence tomography and angiography to characterize dimensionally integrated and translational
predictors of psychopathology and central nervous system pathology; 2) understand the structure-function
relationships between retinal parameters, and 3) suggest whether retrograde trans-synaptic degeneration is a
potential pathophysiologic mechanism occurring in schizophrenia.
 This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing retinal imaging-based phenotyping methods
cross-sectionally, primarily through structural and functional imaging, to capture data on retinal cell function,
retinal cytoarchitecture and retinal microvascular morphology that can inform clinical, cognitive and functional
relationships. The study will be performed cross-sectionally across 4 years in subject with ECS.
 The broader aim of this research is to develop, evaluate, and implement retinal imaging technology
tools for advancing diagnostic nosology, biomarkers, and treatments for psychotic illnesses with a focus on
ECS. An understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia through the eye may allow the development of
retinal biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of
personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia."
10863814,"Current guidelines for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD),
including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and cerebrovascular disease, focus
on the uniform application of risk factor modification irrespective of CVD subtype, despite rising evidence that
each of these diseases has specific underlying pathobiology. Large scale genetic studies have identified new
biology, clarified the role of modifiable risk factors, improved risk prediction, and identified therapeutic targets for
CHD and PAD. This work has demonstrated vascular territory specific effects of risk factors and therapies,
motivating disease specific approaches to prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
Unfortunately, genetic studies of cerebrovascular disease have lagged. Extant studies have tended to focus on
either early-stage subclinical atherosclerosis (carotid intima to media thickness [cIMT]) or late-stage outcomes
(ischemic stroke). Studies of actual atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, in the form of carotid stenosis, have
been limited by small sample size.
The VA Million Veteran Program (MVP) was initiated in 2011 to study how genes, lifestyle, and military exposure
affect health and disease and offers a unique opportunity to advance the genetics of atherosclerotic
cerebrovascular disease through the study of carotid stenosis. To do this we have developed a validated natural
language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract quantitative measures of carotid stenosis severity from imaging
reports in the VA electronic health record (EHR), facilitating the study of both disease susceptibility and
progression. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that the development of carotid plaque, progression
of stenosis, and resulting ischemic stroke represent distinct pathobiological states, each offering a separate
opportunity for therapeutic intervention. To address this hypothesis, we will conduct genome-wide association
studies of both disease susceptibility and progression. The results from these analyses will be then used for
genetic causal inference experiments to: 1. Quantify the causal impact of traditional risk factors on the
susceptibility to carotid stenosis; 2. Determine the causal risk factors for the progression of carotid stenosis; and
3. Identify the shared genetic architecture of carotid stenosis and ischemic stroke using genomic structural
equation modeling.
Successfully completion of this project will clarify the role of traditional risk factors with carotid stenosis, identify
novel opportunities for prevention and treatment, and establish the basis for tailored, precision medicine
approaches to the treatment of carotid stenosis and stroke prevention for Veterans."
10886502,"Project Summary
 Adolescents demonstrate a high need for emotion regulation [2-4], but often struggle to employ gold-
standard regulatory strategies such as cognitive reappraisal due to underdeveloped lateral prefrontal
neuroarchitecture (i.e. lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC)), which plays a crucial role in cognitive control [5-8]. At
the same time, adolescents are exquisitely sensitive to their peers [11,13-16]. Notably, neural regions linked to
peer influence in adolescence, including ventral striatum (VS) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC),
mature prior to LPFC. Thus, adolescents are uniquely poised to benefit from a social intervention designed to
appropriate peer influence mechanisms towards enhancing emotion regulation efficacy. The goal of this R21
is to work with the developing brain, not against it, to utilize adolescent-emergent reward-related
circuitry (VS, VMPFC) instead of LPFC to regulate emotion in adolescents. We will administer a novel
paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine whether adolescents (N = 50) and
adults (N = 50) are more effective at down-regulating negative affect when a friend provides them with
reinterpretations of negative stimuli (i.e. social reappraisal), as compared to when they reinterpret stimuli alone
(i.e., cognitive reappraisal) [12]. Specifically, we will investigate whether social reappraisal is more effective
and longer-lasting than cognitive reappraisal in down-regulating negative affect in adolescents and adults (Aim
1). We hypothesize that social reappraisal will be more effective and enduring than cognitive reappraisal in
both groups, but that this effect will be larger in adolescents given their heightened sensitivity to peers.
Furthermore, we will identify the neural mechanisms supporting social versus cognitive reappraisal and
characterize age-related differences in these mechanisms (Aim 2). We will focus on examining activation in
the amygdala, LPFC, VS, and VMPFC, as well as functional connectivity between these regions. We
hypothesize that LPFC-amygdala connectivity will support cognitive reappraisal, which will be stronger in
adults versus adolescents, whereas VS-amygdala and VMPFC-amygdala connectivity will support social
reappraisal. While VS-amygdala connectivity is likely to be stronger in adolescents than adults, VMPFC-
amygdala connectivity might not be given that this pathway is still developing during adolescence [21,76]. We
expect that social reappraisal will have a more transformative and thus longer-lasting effect on amygdala-
based representations of negative stimuli, particularly in adolescents, and will use representation similarity
analysis to test this hypothesis. Examining the efficacy and neural underpinnings of social reappraisal in
adolescents versus adults is an important step in advancing our understanding of how social contexts shape
emotion regulation neurodevelopment, with the aim of improving adolescent health and laying the groundwork
for positive emotional wellbeing into adulthood."

The immune system has evolved mechanisms to recognize cell injury and in response stimulate sterile
inflammation. This response contributes in important ways to both heath and disease. In this process, dying cells
release Damage Associated Cell Patterns (DAMPs) that are detected by receptors on immune cells, which then
trigger sterile inflammation. Histones are DAMPs that are major drivers of sterile inflammation and there is a
recent growing literature implicating the release of and response to histones in the morbidity and mortality from
tissue injury. Given the role of these DAMPs in the pathogenesis of disease, it is important to understand the
receptors that engage these ligands and mediate their effects. Before our work, such receptors were unknown.
We discovered the first cellular receptor for histones, which was the C-type lectin receptor (CLR/Clec) Clec2d.
We showed that Clec2d plays an important role in innate immune responses to histones and the pathogenesis
of disease in vivo. Our studies also revealed that Clec2d is not the whole story and that there must be another
histone receptor(s) in mice that contributes to responses and disease. Moreover, human innate immune cells
are similarly stimulated by histones, however when we went to translate our findings to humans, we found that
the human homolog of Clec2d does not recognize histones. Therefore, there are as yet to be identified human
histone receptors. Importantly, we have now discovered such novel Clec-histone receptors (CHRs) in both mice
and humans and these discoveries form the basis for this grant application. We have two Aims: Aim 1 will
elucidate the role of CHRs in innate immune responses to histones in vivo. We will define what innate immune
cells use CHRs to sense histones in vivo, the nature of the subsequent responses, and their role in the sterile
inflammatory response and pathogenic sequelae of tissue injury in vivo. The importance of this aim is that it will
provide insight into disease pathogenesis and potentially identify new molecular targets for treating these
conditions; and, Aim 2 will define the specificity, consequences and underlying mechanisms of histone
stimulation of novel CHRs. The importance of this aim is that it will define the underlying mechanisms by which
histones and their receptors trigger and regulate responses, which ultimately drive host defense and
pathobiology."

The gut microbiome exerts a tremendous influence on the function of the immune system at
homeostasis and during inflammatory insults. Most research has focused on how individual
bacteria or particular bacterial configurations interact with the immune system, but the
microbiota contains other forms of microbial life, including protists. Several species of
common and non-pathogenic protists in mice, from the genus Tritrichomonas, induce a type
2 immune response in the small intestine without causing overt pathology. In addition, other
species of Tritrichomonads were later discovered that promote Th1 and Th17 cells in the
colon. However, it is unclear if these differences in mucosal immunity are related to species-
specific effects or other factors. The phylogenetic relationship between intestinal
Tritrichmonas species is poorly understood as their genomes remain unsequenced.
Furthermore, the immune landscape and microbiota composition varies greatly between the
small intestine and colon, which further complicates comparisons between these
Tritrichomonas species and their immune effects. To overcome these obstacles, we isolated
two species of Tritrichomonads that elicit either a Th1 or Th2 immune response in the small
intestine. In Aim 1, we will generate high-quality genomes for each protist and measure their
output of key immunomodulatory metabolites. In Aim 2, we will characterize the effects of
these two protists on the adaptive immune system. We will determine immune mechanisms
that respond to each species of Tritrichomonas. Finally, in Aim 3, we will determine how
these two Tritrichomonads impact Crohn’s Disease in a mouse model. These studies will
establish key genomic tools and insights into Tritrichomonas species and mechanisms that
influence on intestinal immunity. Furthermore, this project will evaluate the possible benefits
of these symbiotic protists on Crohns’s disease, leading to novel therapeutic approaches to
treat IBD."

 Monoallelic expression is an unusual form of gene regulation that is often associated with
genes that determine cell-type identity. The olfactory system exhibits an intriguing form of
random monoallelic expression. Each sensory neuron in the mouse nose expresses only one
out of over 2000 odorant receptor (OR) alleles. The current model for OR gene selection
involves the interchromosomal aggregation of distributed enhancers into a single active super-
enhancer, driven by the co-binding of transcription factors Lhx2 and Ebf. This super-enhancer
complex attracts all OR promoters. How this assembly selects a single OR gene promoter for
transcription is unknown. Understanding this process requires a better understanding of how
OR gene promoters function in the context of this super-enhancer complex.
 Like OR enhancers, the promoters contain homeodomain (HD) binding sites for Lhx2 and
Olf1/Ebf (O/E) binding sites for Ebf transcription factors. How these sites act in OR promoters
to engage the choice mechanism is not clear. We propose a set of genetic experiments to
define the role of HD and O/E sites in OR promoter function. To do this we will study targeted
OR transgenes that lie outside of OR clusters, providing a unique tool to study what genetic and
epigenetic features are required for OR expression. Moreover, we propose a combined genetic
and biochemical approach to identify the molecular components of the OR choice mechanism in
the nucleus. Taken together, these approaches seek to elucidate for the first time the molecular
basis for OR monoallelic expression. Our findings will shed light on fundamental mechanisms
that govern gene expression in mammals."
10775773,"Abstract
Aberrant redox homeostasis has been proposed to contribute to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes
(T2D). However, the mechanisms are poorly understood. Redox systems are regulated by pro-oxidants,
such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants such as glutathione. Patients with T2D have
elevated levels of ROS and lower levels of glutathione. Attempts to reverse this redox imbalance in T2D
using redox-modulating drugs or infusion of antioxidants has shown promise in reversing insulin resistance
in preliminary studies, but ultimately have failed in clinical trials due to their short half-lives and delivery
challenges. New methods and a better understanding of redox mechanisms in T2D are needed to address
an underlying pathophysiology of T2D that is not currently effectively addressed by current modalities. ROS
possess an unpaired electron, making them paramagnetic and capable of interacting with externally applied
electromagnetic fields (EMFs). We recently identified a unique set of EMF parameters that rapidly modulate
ROS and redox homeostasis. When applied to mouse models of T2D and human cells, EMFs were found to
exert remarkable effects on glycemia and insulin sensitivity, reversing glucose intolerance and insulin
resistance in three days, without adverse effects. We also found that application of EMFs altered the
metabolic flux of glucose, increasing glucose incorporation into glycogen and reducing fatty acid levels.
Scavenging paramagnetic ROS or preventing redox adaptations by infusing oxidizing redox solutions
(GSSG) abolished these striking therapeutic effects. These findings lead us to hypothesize that EMFs target
ROS to induce an NRF2-mediated redox response that is insulin sensitizing in part by altering the fate of
glucose. Therefore, the goal of this project is to elucidate the redox and metabolic mechanisms underlying
the insulin sensitizing effects of EMFs. We will test our hypotheses in two specific aims: 1) Determine the
redox mechanisms that mediate the insulin-sensitizing effects of EMF-therapy; and 2) Determine the
mechanisms by which EMF-therapy or redox modulation redirects the metabolic fate of glucose to improve
insulin sensitivity. The use of EMFs as a redox- and glycemia-modulating modality provides an
unprecedented opportunity to study the role of redox in T2D pathophysiology and to advance the
understanding of a novel, insulin sensitizing phenomenon. We will identify specific metabolic changes that
occur in response to EMF exposure and determine mechanisms by which the redox state regulates hepatic
metabolic flux and insulin sensitivity. This work will identify a novel mechanistic link between two previously
disconnected fields of inquiry, static EMFs and glycemic regulation and will bridge redox biology with
glucose metabolism. Successful completion of this work will lay the foundation for the future clinical
development of a wearable device that emits EMFs to target redox systems for the noninvasive
management of T2D."

preprocessing of `omics' data using a suite of cutting-edge workflows; 2) exhaustive annotation services critical
to the first-level interpretation of variants; 3) interpretation services (or tertiary analysis) involving pathway
analysis; and 4) data-access services that provide centrally managed avenues to external data sources
resources such as TCGA, GEO, and GTEX and to internal datasets (Mayo Clinic Biobank, Mayo Genomic
Consortium), and genomics data-management solutions for large genomics projects. The BIC has made
significant investments in developing the infrastructure to preprocess and interpret genomics data. With the
help of Research IT, the bioinformatics technical team has implemented a comprehensive suite of workflows
designed by and for faculty. This infrastructure is kept up to date by reviewing and integrating “best of breed”
open-source applications. When a workflow solution is not readily implementable from open-source
applications, the BIC engage faculty in the design of novel methods. In addition to preprocessing workflows,
applications have been developed to prioritize and filter variants and to visualize variants in the context of
biological pathways, complementing a set of licensed commercial applications.
Most importantly, the BIC has positioned itself as a bioinformatics research collaborator with MCCC members.
BIC has representation at all 3 MCCC sites: Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN (MCR); Mayo Clinic in Arizona
(MCA); and Mayo Clinic in Florida (MCF). Over the last 5 years, BIC has supported more than 1240 projects
for 176 MCCC members. During this period, BIC faculty were listed as key personnel on more than 60

The primary goals of the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center (MCCC) Neuro-Oncology (NONC) Program are to identify
underpinning pathogenic mechanisms of brain tumor biology and to develop interventions that result in
improved duration and quality of life for patients with brain cancer. To achieve this goal, work within the
Program can be divided into 3 Specific Aims. 1) Brain Tumor Biology where investigations will define basic
mechanisms of brain tumor biology and unique tumor vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the other 2 Aims;
2) Biomarkers that can be used in clinical practice to provide patients and physicians with greater
understanding of prognosis and to guide optimal, personalized therapeutic interventions for brain tumors; 3)
Novel Therapeutic Strategies to improve response and survival duration, reduce disease symptoms, and
improve quality of life of patients with brain tumors. Notable accomplishments of the Program in the last
funding period include a) seminal contributions towards the discovery of genetic loci associated with brain
tumorigenesis; b) development and characterization of FDOPA PET imaging as an improved targeting strategy
for surgical and radiotherapy planning for gliomas; c) use of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models to define
predictive biomarkers for response to combination therapies; d) continued integrated genomic, transcriptomic
and proteomic analyses of patient derived xenografts and glioma stem-like cell cultures (GSCs) as an
institutional and national resource. Drs. Jann Sarkaria (Mayo Clinic in Rochester), Joseph Loftus (Mayo Clinic
in Arizona), and Steven Rosenfeld (Mayo Clinic in Florida) provide leadership of the Program. They receive
input from the NONC Executive Committee whose membership spans all 3 MCCC sites and encompasses
diverse scientific expertise in neuro-pathology, neuro-oncology, tumor biology, neurosurgery, radiation
oncology, neuro-radiology and biostatistics. The Program makes extensive use of CCSG-supported Shared
Resources, particularly Biospecimens Accessioning and Processing, Pathology Research, Bioinformatics,
Biostatistics, Pharmacology, Survey Research, and the Clinical Research Office. The Program capitalizes on
Mayo's strengths in neurosurgery, epidemiology, molecular biology, neuropathology, and imaging, and
integrates them with Mayo Clinic's extensive clinical and clinical trial experience in treatment of primary brain
tumors. The Program comprises 24 Primary, 4 Secondary, and 10 Associate members from 14 Departments
across all 3 sites. The Program is anchored by 14 of the Primary members with R01 or equivalent peer-
reviewed funding. Recruitment in the current funding period has significantly bolstered the breadth of the
Program across all 3 sites. Total direct grant funding within the Program is $4.9M, with $2.9M in peer reviewed
funding (79% from NCI). In the past 5 years, the Program has generated 344 publications, 35% of which are
intraprogrammatic collaborations, and 18% interprogrammatic collaborations."

Antibiotics have failed to control bacterial diseases typically due to the emergence of drug resistant (DR) mutants.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is one of the world’s most successful pathogens because of its capacity to
develop DR mutants to withstand antibiotic effects. Treating DR-tuberculosis (TB) patients takes two years and
costs nearly $393,000 per person, which is substantially more expensive than ~ $49,000 per person for treating
a drug sensitive (DS)-TB patient. Despite this pressing human health problem, little is known about the
mechanistic bases underlying the development of DR-TB. Given the low genomic mutation rates and slow
replication of Mtb, intrinsic bacterial factors should play an important role in developing DR-TB, but they have
been understudied. Accumulating evidence has shown that cyclic formation of Mtb persisters, a phenotypic
variant transiently tolerant to TB antibiotics, can predispose TB patients to the emergence of permanent DR
mutants. We recently reported untargeted metabolomics profiling of Mtb persisters and revealed that Mtb shifted
its trehalose-mediated carbon flux towards the biosynthesis of central carbon metabolism (CCM) intermediates
to avoid irreversible antibiotic damage, while decreasing its flux towards the biosynthesis of cell wall mycolyl
glycolipids. This process was termed the “trehalose catalytic shift” and was identified to be essential for Mtb
persister formation, viability, and drug tolerance. In this application, we hypothesize that the trehalose catalytic
shift is an adaptive strategy executed by Mtb after treatment with TB antibiotics to achieve drug tolerance and
also to facilitate the development of DR mutants, thus altering the TB disease course. In cross-sectional studies
with 7 different clinical TB lineages, lineage 2 strains such as HN878 W-Beijing strain (HN878), have been
associated with a high risk of developing multidrug resistant (MDR)-TB and high mortality. Thus, we will examine
our hypothesis by demonstrating that HN878 is hypervirulent and more prone to develop drug resistance than
other lineage strains because of its high level of trehalose catalytic shift activity. To this end, we will determine if
the trehalose catalytic shift is an HN878 intrinsic factor responsible for its drug tolerance, DR mutation rates, and
hypervirulence in vitro, ex vivo and then apply it in vivo using a TB murine model. A successful outcome of this
application will aid in the development of new therapeutic interventions to cure DR-TB patients, including those
infected with HN878."

 This project will continue the collection of data on children in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
under Grant R01-HD052646. The current grant has supported the relaunch of the PSID Child Development
Supplement (CDS) through two major waves of data collection in 2014 and 2019, funding the collection of
panel data on a new generation of children in PSID families who were all born after the launch of the original
CDS cohort in 1997. Six waves of CDS have been conducted and a seventh is underway: three on the original
cohort of children (in 1997, 2002, and 2007) and three completed (in 2014, 2019, and 2020) and one currently
in the field (2021) on the next generation of children. Our goal is to conduct a new wave of CDS in 2023 that
will complete the transformation of CDS from a cohort design, reflected in the original CDS, to an ongoing
panel in which all children aged 0–17 years in PSID families are interviewed at least three times (4–5 years
apart) over the course of childhood and in which the sample is refreshed each wave by adding children born
since the previous wave. Steady-state data from the new, ongoing CDS will allow studies of health, develop-
ment, and well-being in childhood; the relationship between children’s characteristics and contemporaneous
family decisionmaking and behavior; and the effects of childhood factors on subsequent social, demographic,
economic, and health outcomes over the entire life course for these individuals as they are followed into the
future as part of the ongoing PSID. Further, CDS-2023 will provide an unparalleled new resource for studying
the effects of Covid-19 on children and families in the US. Data collection for CDS-2019 was largely complete
when the pandemic began, providing invaluable baseline data. Subsequent outcomes are being tracked
through limited follow-up waves in 2020 and 2021. CDS-2023 will provide a comprehensive assessment of the
effects of Covid-19 on children’s outcomes. The specific aims are to: (1) design and field a new wave of CDS
in 2023, collecting data on all PSID children aged 0–17 years through interviews with primary caregivers (typi-
cally one of the child’s parents) and older children aged 8–17 years; (2) conduct assessments of reading and
math skills, collect weekday and weekend time diaries, and obtain saliva samples (for subsequent genetic
analysis) for all children and their primary caregivers; and (3) process, document, and distribute the new CDS
data, with scale composites, time diary recodes, and individual-level links to detailed school data from the Na-
tional Center for Education Statistics (NCES). CDS-2023 will provide rich, comprehensive, and up-to-date in-
formation on a large, nationally representative sample of children that includes an over-sample of African
American children and a newly refreshed representative sample of children in immigrant families. These data
will be available free of charge through the CDS Online Data Center, which provides customized extracts, de-
tailed study documentation, and user support."
10756550,"Abstract:
Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) reduces triglyceride levels in the blood. Elevated triglyceride levels are a
risk factor for heart disease, and triglyceride levels are correlated with insulin resistance in diabetic
individuals. Here, we aim to better understand an underappreciated aspect of LPL biology: most
of the LPL that is synthesized never makes it out of the cell. Some of this LPL misfolds and can’t
escape endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control. Additionally, some fully functional LPL is
stored in poorly defined secretory vesicles at the periphery of the cell, and this LPL is degraded if
cellular signals do not trigger its release. The ER-resident membrane protein Lipase Maturation
Factor 1 (LMF1) aids in LPL folding in, and exit from, the ER. Our studies have shown that LMF1
helps to ensure LPL’s disulfide bonds are correctly processed. We don’t know the mechanism by
which LMF1 aids in LPL disulfide bond processing, and in Aim 1 we will study LMF1’s structure
and function. With respect to the trafficking of LPL stored in secretory vesicles, studies to date
indicate that, in adipose tissue, this LPL is secreted in response to insulin signaling. However, we
do not fully understand the trafficking itinerary that mobilizes stored LPL for secretion from the
cell in response to insulin. In Aim 2, we will explore how vesicles containing stored LPL are
selected, mobilized, and released after insulin signaling. Together, these two aims will define the
factors and mechanisms that contribute to ensuring LPL’s exit from the cell to the circulation where
it can lower triglycerides. Defining these mechanisms will suggest new ways to lower triglycerides
and the burden of diabetes and heart disease."
10881664,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Millions of people are affected by chronic conditions, and the number will continue to rise due to increased life
expectancy. These diseases, including wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), rely on frequent local
injections for disease management. Frequent injections required for maximum therapeutic efficacy are
associated with barriers to care including patient discomfort, high treatment costs, and risk of complications.
There is a clinical need to reduce injection frequency while maintaining treatment efficacy for these chronic
diseases to improve treatment outcomes and quality of life for these patients. The overall objective of this project
is to develop a tunable, injectable, biodegradable microcapsule delivery device that has the potential to sustain
release of therapeutics of varying molecular weights for at least 12 months. Theoretical modeling will be
combined with in vitro and in vivo experimental studies to optimize the microcapsule system and predict
therapeutic release. In Aim 1, microcapsule porosity will be modulated using two methods to tune therapeutic
release. Release of therapeutics of varying molecular weights, including anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth
factor) and triamcinolone acetonide (TA), will be evaluated at least 12 months. Therapeutic release rates and
bioactivity will be assessed in vitro by evaluating samples using ELISA, Ultra Performance Liquid
Chromatography (UPLC), endothelial cell tube formation assays, and inhibition of inflammatory markers in retinal
cells. An in silico model for drug release dependent on porosity and drug size will be refined. In Aim 2,
microcapsule outer polymer layer thickness will be modulated to tune therapeutic release. Long-term release
rates and bioactivity of anti-VEGF and TA will be evaluated in vitro. The in silico model will be refined and
validated for drug release dependent on capsule layer thickness. In Aim 3, microcapsule biocompatibility and
pharmacokinetic distribution of the therapeutics will be evaluated in vivo. The microcapsule will first be evaluated
for 1 month for short-term biocompatibility. Then, fluorescently labeled therapeutics will be loaded into optimized
microcapsules and compared to blank capsules and therapeutic only controls for 12 months. Fluorophotometry
will be used to quantitatively assess therapeutic concentrations released over time and will be compared to
assays conducted on extracted ocular tissues at study termination. Results will be compared to published studies
for effective therapeutic concentrations. This study will also provide 12 month in vivo safety data. The in silico
model will be refined to include measurements of therapeutic concentrations in the vitreous and retina to predict
in vivo distribution coupled to drug release from a capsule. Additionally, a computational tool will be developed
for optimizing capsule layer thickness and porosity for specified release duration, pharmacokinetic tissue
distribution, and therapeutic size. The goal of this project is to develop a tunable drug delivery device with the
potential to reduce injections to one time per year, improving the quality of life for patients with AMD or other
chronic diseases that rely on local injections for treatment."

Conventional chemotherapy has reached its limits in treating Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML),
the most common leukemia in adults. Many patients who receive intensive chemotherapy
followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplant eventually relapse. Therapeutic
results remain particularly dismal for relapsed or refractory and older patients, who are often
unfit for intensive therapies. Several new therapy options with the potential to improve treatment
outcomes have emerged, but they suffer from heterogeneity in responses and a lack of methods
for identifying patients who might benefit from such therapies.
New detailed simulations called Digital Twins are starting to be implemented in many sectors
including engineering, manufacturing, and medicine. Digital Twins are a simulation of a
real-world system or object that allows for experimentation without real-world consequences. A
patient oriented Digital Twin would simulate physiological response or disease and allow for
outcome predictions following treatment.
We propose to build a prototype of the ‘AML Digital Twin’ system (AML-DT), an interactive
system to be used by doctors with their patients in which the patient’s clinical and molecular
data, collected from bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood, will be used to instantiate a
digital twin model of the patient’s disease. The digital twin will enable the doctor and patient to
explore personalized model-based predictions of drug response, using measurable outcomes in
light of background knowledge generated from publicly available molecular data from AML
patients. Importantly, the AML-DT system will continuously improve by learning from the
experiences of patients and their digital twin models.
The work, conducted jointly with clinician-scientists and computational researchers at the
Institute for Systems Biology, the University of Helsinki, and Tampere University will center on
patient-specific drug sensitivity prediction of venetoclax in combination with azacitidine by
integrating with an ongoing clinical trial, VenEx, that includes ex-vivo patient selection and
molecular data generation from bone marrow aspirates from AML patients in Finland. A
prototype of the AML-DT system will be deployed at the midpoint of the 5-year project period,
coinciding with the completion of the clinical trial. Following assessment of the prototype, further
developments to the AML-DT will be carried out to accommodate other AML therapies and
recommendations made by patient advocates and clinicians."
10817904,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Genomic and other “omic” profiles hold immense potential for advancing personalize/precision medicine by
enabling the accurate prediction of disease phenotypes or outcomes for individual patients, which can be used
by a clinician to design an appropriate plan of care. However, despite this potential, the actual impact of these
omic profiles on disease phenotype prediction may be limited by the fact that even large cohorts collecting
these data do not cover large enough numbers of individuals. In contrast, a variety of clinical data types, such
as laboratory tests and physician notes, are routinely collected and studied for a much larger number of
patients undergoing treatment for such diseases at medical centers. The abundance of these clinical data, and
their complementarity with multi-omic data, offer an opportunity to advance personalized medicine by
integrating these disparate types of data. However, this disparity in data formats, namely several omic profiles
being structured, and several clinical data types, such as physician notes, being unstructured, poses
challenges for this integration. An associated challenge due to this disparity is that different classes of
computational methods are likely to be the most effective for predicting disease phenotypes from these clinical
and omics datasets. These challenges pose barriers for current data integration methods to address this
problem. Here, we propose an innovative approach to this integration by assimilating diverse base phenotype
predictors inferred from individual clinical and omics datasets into heterogeneous ensembles. These
ensembles, which have shown promise for several other computational genomics problems, can aggregate an
unrestricted number and variety of base predictors, which is ideal for this integration problem. Specifically, we
describe how existing heterogeneous ensemble methods for single datasets can be transformed and advanced
to address the multiple clinical and omic dataset integration problem. In particular, we detail novel algorithms
for improving these integrative ensembles by modeling and incorporating the inherent patient and dataset
heterogeneity in these datasets. We also propose novel algorithms for leveraging the inherent complementarity
among clinical and omic datasets, as well as an innovative approach for handling expected missing data, both
with the goal of making ensemble phenotype predictors more accurate and applicable to patient cohorts. To
assess the performance of this novel suite of data integration-oriented heterogeneous ensembles, we will
validate their effectiveness for predicting asthma and Inflammatory Bowel Disease phenotypes in substantial
patient cohorts with diverse omics and clinical datasets. We will publicly release efficient software
implementations of the methods developed in this project to enable others to carry out similar analyses with
other diverse data collections. Successful accomplishment of the proposed work will contribute to the
advancement of personalized medicine through accurate individualized prediction of disease phenotypes."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia, disability, and death in the elderly. Despite recent
advances in our understanding of basic biological mechanisms underlying AD, we do not yet know how to prevent
AD or have an approved disease modifying intervention. Animal models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have
provided important insights into the pathophysiology of disease and suggested potential avenues for therapies;
however, translation of these findings to the clinic has been largely unsuccessful. The MODEL-AD Consortium
was initiated to generate and validate the next generation of mouse models of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease
(LOAD) as well as to perform rigorous preclinical testing of the most promising therapeutics in these models.
Based on advances in human disease characterization driven by genetic, molecular, and imaging studies, we
have created more than 40 LOAD mouse models carrying genetic risk variants. These models have been
characterized using the same molecular and imaging modalities used in the clinic, revealing LOAD-relevant
phenotypes not observed in prior mouse models. The IU/JAX/PITT MODEL-AD Center is now poised to leverage
these existing models, protocols, and data to further our mission of creating translatable preclinical tools. The
Indiana University (IU)/Jackson Laboratory (JAX)/University of Pittsburgh (IU/JAX/PITT) will leverage IU’s and
PITT’s strengths in neurodegenerative research including 30+ years as an NIA-supported Alzheimer’s Disease
Center (ADRC) and considerable expertise in preclinical drug testing with JAX’s eight decades of expertise in
mammalian genetics and disease modeling to develop, validate and disseminate new, precise animal models of
AD. In addition, the IU/JAX/PITT MODEL-AD Center contains Sage Bionetworks to provide expertise in data
organization and dissemination. The IU/JAX ADPMC brings together an international, multi-disciplinary team—
including geneticists and genetics technology experts, quantitative and computational biologists, clinical experts
in AD and neuroimaging, pharmacologists and world leaders in the development of precision animal models of
disease—that possesses the collective ability to foresee disease modeling needs as they emerge on the
international stage. This will allow the IU/JAX ADPMC to serve the AD scientific community effectively and
efficiently. Ultimately, this will accelerate the application of advances in animal models for the greatest possible
medical benefit. The Specific Aims of the IU/JAX/PITT MODEL-AD Center are:
Aim 1: Prioritize genetic variants, analyze model data, and broadly disseminate results through data
sharing and online analytics.
Aim 2: Creating and characterizing novel LOAD models
Aim 3: Screening of novel compounds through the PTC pipeline.
Aim 4: Coordinate activities within the center, the MODEL-AD consortium, and across the broader
community of AD/ADRD researchers."
10795080,"SUMMARY
Inflammatory diseases are often driven by inappropriate responses of effector CD4 T cells (Teff). IL17, IFNγ, or
dual-producing polyfunctional effector Th1, Th17, or Th17.1 T cells can become imbalanced with suppressive
Treg CD4 T cells in a variety of disease settings, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). A key therapeutic
objective in efforts to shift the immunologic balance towards tolerance, therefore, is to selectively inhibit Teff and
promote Treg. We have shown that Teff and Treg subsets utilize different metabolic programs that represent
fundamental features of T cell biology. Here we explore one carbon (1C) metabolism and related
microenvironmental factors to modulate CD4 T cells in inflammatory diseases. 1C metabolism integrates multiple
nutrient inputs to provide intermediates for de novo methionine and purine synthesis and is commonly targeted
with anti-folate drugs. An in vivo CRISPR screen of primary T cells in IBD with a 1C metabolism enzyme-focused
gRNA library identified the mitochondrial enzyme Methylene-tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase 2 (MTHFD2) as
conditionally essential for effector T cell proliferation and inflammation. MTHFD2 was upregulated in T cells a
variety of inflammatory conditions and while MTHFD2-deficiency impaired Teff, MTHFD-deficient Treg had
increased FoxP3 expression in both mouse and human T cells. Consistent with a role as a metabolic checkpoint
on inflammation, MTHFD2-deficiency protected against IBD and other inflammatory diseases. Mechanistically,
MTHFD2 inhibition suppressed mTORC1 activity, possibly through reduced methionine and/or interrupted purine
synthesis. Importantly, local nutrients play key roles in 1C metabolism and T cell fate. To quantify T cell access
to nutrients in vivo, we established Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracer-based methods to directly image
and measure nutrient uptake in vivo. These studies showed a sharp increase in T cell glucose uptake in
inflammation. In addition, IBD is often associated with folate-deficiency. The effects of dietary folate on T cell
1C metabolism, mTORC1 signaling, and fate, however, are unclear. Because inflammation is associated with
fevers and enzymes are temperature-dependent, we also tested fever conditions on T cell metabolism. We found
fever led to increased cytokine production from Teff and mitochondrial Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)
specifically in Th1 cells that, surprisingly, led to Tp53-dependent apoptosis. These findings support the
hypothesis that 1C metabolism is limiting and serves as a metabolic checkpoint to integrate local nutrients and
physical conditions through MTHFD2 and mTORC1 signaling to provide new immunometabolic targets to
modulate effector and regulatory T cells. To test this, we will: (1) Test the role and mechanism of MTHFD2 as a
limiting enzyme in methionine and nucleotide synthesis essential for mTORC1 signaling and effector T cells; and
(2) Determine how nutrient and microenvironmental factors such as folate and fever influence effector and
regulatory T cell metabolism and inflammation. These studies will test MTHFD2 and identify new
immunometabolic mechanisms and targets that contribute to or may be exploited to treat inflammatory disease."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a medical condition characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol
use despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences. AUD is common with a 12-month and
lifetime prevalence in the US of 13.9% and 29.1%, respectively. Gene expression studies provide promising
opportunities to better understand AUD etiology. As cells differ in their function, gene expression will typically
also differ across cell-types. When studying bulk tissue, failure to account for cell diversity has a detrimental
impact on the ability to detect disease associations. For example, case-control differences will be “diluted” if
they affect only one cell-type, may cancel out if the differences are of opposite signs across cell-types, and
may be undetectable if the differences involve low abundance cells. Furthermore, identifying the specific cell-
types from which the association signals originate is key to formulating refined hypotheses of AUD etiology,
designing proper follow-up experiments and, eventually, developing novel clinical interventions.
 Our overall goal is to perform a rigorous study in post-mortem brain samples to detect differentially
expressed genes in AUD at a fine-grained cellular level, and identify the genetic elements that regulate these
differences. To achieve this goal, we propose a strategy that has become available with the recent evolution of
single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) technology that can characterize the expression levels of
thousands of individual nuclei with a single reaction. Our pilot data shows that our lab is able to produce
snRNA-seq data of the highest quality and illustrates the promise of snRNA-seq to detect biologically relevant
findings. Using careful selection procedures, we obtained a unique collection of relatively severe cases that
were diagnostically homogenous while having minimal comorbidities, and that were matched to the controls on
key variables. We will focus on three brain regions that are heavily implicated in AUD and capture different
aspects of the disease. Study design features were guided by a series of power analyses that are grounded in
empirical observations from our pilot study. To ensure robust results, findings will be replicated using snRNA-
seq data from independent individuals and validated with a different technology. Finally, we propose a series of
follow-up analyses aimed at identifying potential regulators of replicating findings, (functionally) characterizing
existing robust AUD GWAS associations, and detecting blood biomarkers of AUD disease processes in brain.
 Successful completion of this project will yield (i) unprecedented insights into AUD disease mechanisms,
(ii) possible blood biomarkers of genes differentially expressed in brain, and (iii) lay the foundation for
functional follow-up studies and, eventually, novel highly specific clinical interventions for improving AUD
treatment."

Human tuberculosis (TB) is caused mainly by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and represents an enormous
challenge to global health because of the inadequacy of currently available drugs and vaccines. The most
common clinical manifestation is pulmonary TB, and Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) is the only licensed vaccine
for protection against TB; however, its efficacy is highly variable. Today at least 52 countries have reported
multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensive drug-resistant (XDR) TB cases which cannot be cured or contained by
current TB therapy. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new therapies/vaccines that effectively prevent or
cure TB. It is well established that the generation of an adaptive immune response against Mtb occurs inside
germinal centers (GCs) in secondary lymphoid organs (SLOs), such as spleen and lesion draining lymph nodes,
where antigen‐presenting cells (APCs) and antigen-specific circulating T and B lymphocytes interact, clonally
expand, and are disseminated to sites of infection. We found that mice vaccinated with BCG and exposed to
Mycobacterium avium [a non-tuberculous mycobacterium (NTM)] via drinking water provide more robust and
longer-term protection than BCG alone as determined by reduced Mtb bacterial burden and inflammatory
progression of infection. Interestingly, these mice also developed ectopic germinal centers (eGC) in the lungs
and have an increased number of B-cells and higher levels of anti-Mtb cell lysate-specific IgA and IgG antibodies.
These findings suggest that NTM and B-cells play a critical role in generating protective immunity against
pulmonary Mtb infection, and the formation of eGC in these mice is a crucial factor in this improved immunity.
Thus, investigating the mechanism of eGC formation and the role of NTM and B-cells in its stimulation is an
important question to understand TB pathogenesis and develop effective vaccines and therapies. In this K99/R00
application, we propose three aims: 1) investigating the key differences between eGC in lungs and conventional
GCs in lymph nodes, 2) evaluating the role of NTM and B-cells in eGC stimulation, and 3) characterizing the
antigen-specificity and affinity of eGC B-cells against Mtb antigens. The results of this proposal will bring us one
step closer to understanding the B-cell and antibody-mediated mechanisms of protection from TB."

10770464,"TR&D 1 SUMMARY
This technology research and development project targets two major challenges for solid-state NMR and
structural biology. First, sample handling represents a major bottleneck for solid-state NMR, costing time,
money, and wasted sample. Powerful new solid-state NMR relax the volume and labeling requirements, but
only if precious biological samples can be efficiently transferred into tiny MAS rotors. We will develop tools to
make this process faster, more efficient and reliable. We will also develop tools to change sample conditions in
the MAS rotor to better assess the functional state of a sample during experiments. Second, membrane
proteins function in an asymmetric environment in the presence of transmembrane gradients of voltage, ions,
and pH, but structural biology of membrane proteins is carried out in the absence of these gradients. This
makes it difficult to correlate structure with function and creates one of the largest current knowledge gaps in
structural biology. The project develops technology to perform NMR studies of membrane proteins embedded
in lipid bilayers in the presence of transmembrane voltage, pH and ion gradients using several different
approaches to ensure gradient stability during NMR data collection. We will also develop NMR-readout
sensors to measure the membrane potential and pH and ion gradients during NMR data acquisition. This
technology will enable direct measurement of the structure and dynamics of membrane proteins in the
presence of gradients, revealing how transmembrane gradients regulate and drive membrane protein function.
Since a large percentage of drug targets are membrane proteins that create, transform, dissipate or are
regulated by transmembrane gradients, this technology will have high biomedical impact."

Although aging, germline mutations, and family history of cancer are significant risks for breast cancer, it is still
unclear why one person’s breast cells are more susceptible to this disease than another person’s. Aging changes
cells and tissues such that they become more susceptible to cancer initiation. Our published data show that
breast epithelial cells from young women who have high-risk germline mutations show accelerated aging with
intermediate filament distribution, biological clock acceleration, and stromal immune cell milieu changes
comparable to those of women who are 20–40 years older. In our currently funded R01EB024989, we discovered
that the mechanical properties of normal breast epithelial cells, as measured by our mechano-Node Pore
Sensing (mechano-NPS) platform, differ among younger and older women and that normal epithelial cells from
genetically high-risk women who carry germline BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2 variants are mechanically “older”
than their chronological age. We hypothesized that mechano-NPS can detect disease states based on the
emergent mechanical properties that arise from the underlying molecular networks that define lineage and
disease states. In this competitive renewal application, we extend this hypothesis to include detection of cancer
susceptibility or risk, which is so far not detectable with genetic screening. We will innovate mechano-NPS and
advance an in silico model of our device to increase the number of physical parameters it can measure, thereby
providing a more complete portrait of single human mammary epithelial cells (HMECS) (Aim 1). We will build a
machine learning cancer susceptibility detection system based on measuring mechanical properties of different
primary HMEC (young, old, high-risk, family history of breast cancer, etc.) (Aim 2). Finally, we will dissect the
molecular mechanisms of mechanical states measured by our advanced mechano-NPS platform (Aim 3). In the
last funding period, we successfully designed, built, and validated the first-generation mechano-NPS platform at
UC Berkeley and showed it to be portable and robust by building a second platform at City of Hope. The impact
of our competitive renewal application will be far more reaching. Clinically useful genetic testing relies on a
handful of known monogenic risk traits, but we hypothesize that emergent mechanical properties, measured
from just a few hundred cells, are a characteristic of the biology that underlies cancer susceptible states, even
those that are polygenic or epigenetic in nature and are passed within a family but that so far have defied
definition."

A growing body of work has demonstrated that increases in the generosity of cash and in-kind benefits
received by low-income women from economic security policies (ESPs) are associated with improved birth
outcomes, particularly low birth weight (LBW) (less than 5 pounds, 8 ounces) and preterm birth (PTB) (before
37 weeks). Because single ESPs rarely fill all economic gaps, most low-income families do not use ESPs in
isolation, but rather “package” them to make ends meet. While the effects of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and the minimum wage have been studied extensively, there have
been few studies of Unemployment Insurance and no identified studies of the combined effects of these four
ESPs. This study builds on existing research that demonstrates positive overall effects of individual ESP
generosity on birth outcomes among the low-income population and differential effects based on social
statuses. The study also draws from research showing that more generous ESPs improve correlates of
maternal-fetal health. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a nationally representative, longitudinal data
set, this study will examine how individual ESPs and ESP combinations compare to one another in terms of the
size of their effects on LBW and PTB. Additionally, this study will be the first to determine the relative
contribution of four potential mediators explaining the link between ESP generosity and birth outcomes (i.e.,
healthcare access, food insecurity, psychological distress, and prenatal health behaviors). Lastly, this study will
identify whether the effects of ESP generosity is moderated by poverty level, race, marital status, and
education. As the US social safety net has shifted to one that rewards labor market participation, ESPs have
become a more familiar feature of working poor households. These households—low-income, but working—
account for the majority of poverty in the US and their ranks are likely to grow in the wake of the Great
Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. This suggests a pressing need for information on which policies
generate the greatest returns, how they influence birth outcomes, and for whom they are most effective. As
such, this research will contribute significantly to scientific and policy efforts to reduce rates of LBW and PTB
among low-income women and reduce inequalities in birth outcomes."
10904646,"Responsiveness to NOT-OD-22-022: This proposal will segregate the biological effects of electronic cigarette
(e-cig) use (‘vaping’) from smoking by measuring the epigenetic and transcriptomic changes linked to risk of
disease in cells and tissues of healthy adult vapers and/or cigarette smokers as compared to controls (non-users
of either product). Furthermore, it will determine whether these molecular alterations are modulated by the
intensity and duration of vaping/smoking and the characteristics of tobacco product(s) used, including e-cig
device features and e-liquid ingredients, and cigarette brand, type, and chemical constituents. By elucidating the
molecular mechanisms underlying the biological effects of vaping vs. smoking, we will develop novel biomarkers
of exposure and effects, which will have significant utility for assessing the health risks or potential benefits of
vaping relative to smoking. Rationale: Adult e-cig users are likely to have a prior history of smoking or co-use
e-cigs and combustible cigarettes (i.e., dual users). To investigate the biological effects of e-cig use in adults, it
is imperative to tease out the consequences of vaping, while accounting for the confounding effects of ‘past’ or
‘present’ smoking. Premise: Many toxicants and carcinogens present in e-cig vapor and cigarette smoke exert
their biological effects through epigenetic effects, such as aberrant DNA methylation, and/or transcriptomic
alterations that can lead to dysregulation of disease-related genes. Project outline: Leveraging the banked
specimens from our recently completed NIDCR- and TRDRP-funded studies, we will differentiate the biological
consequences of e-cig use from those of smoking by analyzing the whole methylome and transcriptome in oral-
and blood cells of healthy adult ‘exclusive’ vapers, dual users, ‘exclusive’ cigarette smokers, and controls. We
will use a novel approach, combining primary analysis of the whole methylome (Aim 1) and transcriptome (Aim
2) and ordinal sensitivity analysis of various models built on vaping/smoking dose and tobacco product
characteristics (Aim 3). Integrative analysis of data from Aims 1 and 2 will determine the methylome and
transcriptome changes that regulate disease-specific genes, thus identifying novel biomarkers of exposure and
effects for vaping, dual use, and smoking. We will validate the identified biomarkers in patient populations using
highly curated and quality-controlled ‘omics’ datasets processed from public sources. This will verify the utility of
the identified biomarkers for assessing disease risk in exclusive’ e-cig users, dual users, and ‘exclusive’ smokers.
The detailed computational modeling and sensitivity analysis in Aim 3 will determine the impact of
vaping/smoking dose and product characteristics on the alterations of the methylome & transcriptome in vapers,
dual users, and smokers. These data will inform the FDA’s regulation of tobacco products to protect public health.
Innovation: We will investigate the effects of e-cig aerosol and cigarette smoke on cells and tissues of vapers
and/or smokers using genome-wide sequencing of the methylome & transcriptome and integrative bioinformatic
analysis & computational modeling, accounting for vaping/smoking dose and product characteristics."

Obesity is a major risk factor for NAFLD/NASH. In obesity, energy accumulation causes metabolic dysfunction
and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and oxidative stress, leading to tissue inflammation and injury, which are
hallmarks of NASH. The DNA damage response and unfolded protein response are vital to maintain the integrity
of cellular genome and proteome. The ER maintains proteostasis via ER-associated protein degradation and
unfolded protein response. Metabolic dysfunction alters ER-associated protein degradation and unfolded protein
response, leading to ER stress, caspase activation and cell death. Moreover, increased oxidative stress
enhances DNA damage-induced cell death. Defining how these pathways integrate to dictate cell metabolism
and survival is the long-term goal of The Chakraborty lab. The objective of this proposal is to decipher the role
of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ube4A in the obesogenic IP6K1 protein-mediated hepatocyte metabolic dysfunction
and DNA damage response and unfolded protein response mediated hepatocyte survival and NAFLD/NASH.
The overarching hypothesis is that Ube4A maintains metabolic homeostasis and protects hepatocytes from
stress-induced death, delaying the development and progression of obesity and NAFLD/NASH. The rationale is
that determining the role of Ube4A in NAFLD/NASH and the mechanisms by which it regulates hepatocyte
metabolism and survival will provide new therapeutic opportunities. Our specific Aims will test the following
hypotheses: (Aim 1) Test the impact of whole-body- and hepatocyte-Ube4A deletion on metabolic dysfunction,
liver injury, and NAFLD/NASH in mice; (Aim 2) Determine mechanisms of Ube4A-mediated IP6K1 inhibition and
its impact on metabolic dysfunction and NAFLD/NASH in mice; (Aim 3) Decipher the mechanisms by which
Ube4A regulates hepatocyte survival. The contribution is significant and transformative because it is expected
to unravel the role of a novel pathway that regulates obesity, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis and
distinguish the hepatocyte-specific impact of this pathway on NAFLD/NASH. Moreover, it is the first step to
defining the mechanisms of how Ube4A regulates hepatocyte metabolism and survival and how the obesogenic
protein IP6K1 is modulated in vivo. These exciting findings could lead to development of new therapeutic
approaches to treat obesity and NAFLD/NASH. The proposed research is innovative as it will utilize exciting new
tools to unravel a novel pathway that regulates cell metabolism and survival, which is therapeutically relevant
and has broad implications for many diseases."

 The main way in which non-mammalian vertebrates, such as fish, restore sensory hair cells is through
proliferation and differentiation of the residual population of supporting cells. In contrast, supporting cells lose
the capacity to proliferate postnatally in mammals, and the molecular machinery preventing cell cycle reentry
remains poorly understood.
 Our work has established that Hippo signaling serves as a major repressive mechanism that blocks
supporting cell proliferation and plasticity in the mammalian inner ear. In three Aims, we will identify the molecular
mechanism by which Hippo inhibition promotes mitotic sensory receptor regeneration in the adult utricle explants
(Aim 1); assess whether reversible pharmacologic inactivation of Hippo signaling stimulates bona fide vestibular
hair cell regeneration to support functional recovery in vivo (Aim 2); and assess the pathway’s interaction with
the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip1, specific to the organ of Corti, in the adult inner ear in vivo (Aim 3). The long-term
goal of this proposal is to identify therapeutic strategies for hearing and balance restoration through controlled
manipulation of the Hippo pathway.
 Due to its relatively recent discovery, study of the Hippo pathway in the inner ear is innovative in itself.
Furthermore, our group has pioneered this field and developed several specialized research tools to aid the
study of the pathway in the inner ear. Most notably, we identified the first small-molecule inhibitor of Lats kinases
– the core enzymes in Hippo signaling – that we show to potently induce supporting cell proliferation and the
initial stages of hair cell regeneration in vitro and in vivo. We also optimized posterior semicircular canal approach
for LKI delivery into the inner ear and utilize several cutting-edge genetic and epigenetic techniques (e.g
multiome sequencing, CUT&RUN).
 The proposed basic research is significant because understanding the molecular machinery blocking cell
cycle reentry in the inner ear may determine new therapeutic targets for induction of hair cell regeneration.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that brief pharmacologic inhibition of Lats kinases induces supporting cell
proliferation in the adult utricle, allowing progeny to re-exit the cell cycle and spontaneously upregulate sensory
receptor genes upon drug withdrawal. Collectively our data show that temporal inactivation of Hippo signaling is
sufficient to promote the initial stages of hair cell regeneration through supporting cell division – a process thought
to be permanently suppressed in the adult mammalian inner ear."

 Healthy diets reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Plant-based diets, which are comprised
predominantly of plant foods and are low in animal products, are healthy dietary patterns that are associated
with a lower risk of CVD. However, the precise mechanisms underlying plant-based diet-CVD associations are
poorly understood. The present proposal aims to elucidate the mechanisms through which plant-based diets
are associated with CVD using proteomics and epigenetics.
 Specific aims of the present proposal are to: 1) identify protein signatures of 4 plant-based diet indices
[overall plant-based diet index (PDI), provegetarian diet, healthy plant-based diet index (hPDI), and unhealthy
plant-based diet index (uPDI)], 2) evaluate the prospective associations between plant-based diet-related
proteins and incident CVD, and 3) explore DNA methylation signatures of 4 plant-based diet indices. The
proposed study will use the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a richly phenotyped
community-based prospective study of middle-aged African American and European American with usual
dietary intake, proteomics and DNA methylation data, and adjudicated CVD outcomes as the discovery data
set. Framingham Heart Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, well-characterized prospective
cohorts with similar data, will be used for external validation. Completion of the aims will identify novel proteins,
epigenetic markers, and pathways that are modifiable by plant-based diets. Such novel evidence will be the
first step for developing biomarkers for early detection and identifying therapeutic targets of CVD.

10796858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal disease notoriously resistant to therapy including immune
checkpoint blockade. Meanwhile, immunotherapy targeting the PD-1:PD-L1 pathway is inducing stunning
clinical outcomes in other advanced malignancies. Despite decades of cancer immunology research, the
underlying mechanisms governing immune surveillance in pancreas cancer are largely unknown. This is due,
in part, to a lack of animal models that permit the detection of tumor-specific T lymphocytes during disparate
clinical outcomes commonly observed in patients. We have filled this knowledge gap by creating novel animal
models that permit the interrogation or the rare tumor-antigen specific T cells over time. Based on our recent
discoveries, we are now uniquely poised to identify how to safely promote antigen-specific T cell-mediated
destruction of pancreas cancer, and our proposal will use these results to develop a novel preclinical
combination immune-based therapy to inform a clinical trial. Our compelling preliminary data support the
hypothesis that immune-mediated pancreas cancer eradication requires a combination of a 1) high affinity
tumor specific T cell, 2) modifying suppressive intratumoral myeloid cells, and 3) overcoming chronic
inflammatory signaling mediated by TNFα. We screened a series of immunotherapies and identified that
agonistic αCD40 or PD-L1 blockade has only transient antitumor activity whereas the combination leads to
tumor eradication in 63% of animals. PD-L1 blockade failed to reinvigorate intratumoral T cell functions and
instead changed the peripheral tumor-specific T cell repertoire and expands a unique peripheral T cell
subpopulation enriched for pro-survival genes and Ikzf2. In contrast, agonistic αCD40 promotes potent, yet
short-lived, cytolytic intratumoral T cells which correlates with a decrease in intratumoral myeloid cell IL-27
production. Finally, abrogating Tnfr1 expression by non-tumor/host cells overcomes tumor escape resulting in
100% of tumor eradication in αCD40+αPD-L1-treated animals. In Aim 1, we will identify the functional
significance of the altered TCR repertoire and the Ikzf2+ T cell subpopulation induced following PD-L1
blockade. In Aim 2, we will test if agonistic αCD40 promotes potent cytolytic effector T cells by abrogating
intratumoral myeloid cell production of IL-27 and/or CD8 T cell production of IL-10. In Aim 3, we will identify
how IFNγ and TNFα signaling on non-tumor/host cells lead to disparate outcomes following combination
immunotherapy of pancreas cancer and test a novel combinatorial immunotherapy that includes TNFα
blockade in combination with a CD40 agonist and a PD-1 inhibitor. The studies are designed to identify a
mechanistic basis for T cell dysfunction in pancreas cancer and to create a feasible clinical strategy to
overcome it with the goal to create a safe and effective immune-based treatment for pancreas cancer patients."
10798146,"Abstract
Unexpected findings, or incidentalomas, are increasing dramatically with the growth in the use of imaging
technology within healthcare organizations. Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as
malignancy in the medium or long term. However, they also may lead to overinvestigation, unnecessary
radiation exposure, overtreatment, substantial downstream expenditures, and patient anxiety. Several
systematic reviews have explored the prevalence and outcomes of incidentalomas. These studies used
inconsistent and often inappropriate synthesis methods, commonly only focusing on one imaging scan or
organ in a very limited number of patients. As a result, there is need for large-scale study of incidentalomas
that can inform their follow up and guide efforts to optimize health outcomes. To address this need, we
propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches to identify cancer-related incidentalomas
reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and to create the first large-scale incidentaloma database covering over
half-a-million patients (Aim 2). Our research dataset will contain radiology reports, clinical notes containing
imaging orders, as well as structured data such as demographic information (e.g., age) and diagnoses codes
of patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC),
Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), and Northwest Hospital and Medical
Center (NWMC) between 2007-2019. Our patient population will be linked to Hutchinson Institute for Cancer
Outcomes Research (HICOR) data repository for detailed cancer outcomes and claims data. The created
database will be used for clinical and economic analysis of incidentalomas (Aim 3). We will (1) evaluate the
concordance between radiologists' documentation of incidentaloma follow-up and established clinical
guidelines for thyroid, lung, adrenal, kidney, liver, and pancreas incidentalomas, (2) determine risk of
subsequent cancer diagnosis and median survival for each category of incidentaloma, and (3) determine the
incremental cost associated with follow-up imaging in patients with incidentalomas. All models and their
implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open
source. Additionally, the de-identified incidentaloma database will be made available to the research
community under a data use agreement. By identifying risk factors for cancer diagnosis and death for common
incidental findings, we will be able to provide critical information for future clinical practice guideline
development and appropriate use criteria. We assembled a highly interdisciplinary team of experts in NLP,
medical informatics, radiology, oncology, health outcomes, and health economics to ensure the successful
completion of the proposed project."
10586976,"Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) afflict younger women of African and Latino descent, present with
aggressive clinical behavior, and are in their majority unresponsive to systemic treatments. Patients with
refractory disease exhibit dismal survival rates with reliable therapies still undefined. To identify novel, disease-
relevant therapeutic targets, we conducted transcriptomic analyses of highly metastatic and tumor-initiating
TNBC cells, focusing specifically on long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), an emerging RNA family with
pleiotropic contributions to essential cellular processes. These efforts identified the lncRNA LINC01133, which
we found induced malignant tumor development by promoting the expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs):
tumor-initiating cells at the origin of metastasis and therapy resistance. Importantly, LINC01133 associated
tightly with clinical TNBC and prognosticated poor patient survival. Further, LINC01133 expression, on its own,
promoted cancer growth in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. Importantly, LINC01133 inhibition by anti-sense
oligonucleotides (ASO) inhibited cancer cell growth, altogether ascribing LINC01133 critical role as a credible
therapeutic target in TNBC. Interestingly, LINC01133 exerted additional, paracrine activities that regulated how
TNBC cells interfaced with the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Indeed, LINC01133-generated
syngeneic murine mammary tumors exhibited evident immune-suppressed phenotypes with increased
myeloid-derived suppressor cells, M2 macrophages, and anergized 2B4+CD3+ T-cells, concomitant with
striking PD-L1 induction in LINC01133-cancer cells. These results allow us to hypothesize that LINC01133
regulated immune evasion, in addition to CSC genesis, representing an opportune and novel dual target in
immuno-oncology, and our objective is to verify these notions using three concerted aims. In Aim1, we will
determine how LINC01133 promotes the expression of the checkpoint protein PD-L1 by probing the molecular
events that foster PD-L1 accumulation (1.1), and by delineating the direct proximal molecular networks through
which LINC01133 regulates PD-L1 expression (1.2 and 1.3). In Aim2, we will comprehensively determine the
TIME constituents in LINC01133-expressing syngeneic immune-competent murine TNBC models using FACS
and immunohistochemistry (IHC) (2.1). Then, we will use ex vivo phenotypic and functional assays to
determine the extent to which tumor-purified infiltrating lymphocytes are exhausted/anergized in LINC01133-
expressing tumors (2.2) and determine LINC01133 impact on metastasis (2.3). To clinically validate these
findings, we will use quantitative PCR on cancer cells laser-captured from TNBC specimens to determine if
LINC0113 levels correlate with patient metastasis and survival history and/or IHC-determined T-cell-specific
exhaustion phenotypes in their tumors (2.4). In Aim 3, we will determine if LINC01133 inhibition stunts
tumor/metastasis growth by reawakening anti-tumor responses. For this purpose, we will use in vivo tumor-
targeted gene knockdown that uses Epcam RNA aptamers – structured RNAs that bind with high affinity to the
cell receptor Epcam, highly expressed in LINC01133-expressing CSCs – to deliver covalently linked small
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against LINC01133 into TNBC growths in vivo. Knockdown occurs selectively in
Epcam-bearing cancer cells when aptamer-siRNA chimeras (AsiCs) are internalized/cleaved intracellularly to
liberate active LINC01133-siRNAs. Here, we will determine if Epcam-AsiC-LINC01133 causes immune-
mediated cancer regression in syngeneic and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) by conducting
comparative tumor growth kinetics, assessing cancer cell death/survival in treated tumors and metastases, and
by characterizing the phenotype and functionality of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ex vivo (3.1). Finally, we will
determine if AsiCs cooperate with immune checkpoint inhibitors in enhancing TIL-mediated cancer cell
clearance (3.2). Our studies will thus introduce novel inhibitors directed against two major determinants of
TNBC malignancy, CSC formation and immune escape, revolutionizing TNBC clinical management."
10745327,"Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is the broad term used to describe a number of impairments that affect millions of
women and men in the U.S. Symptoms of PFDs resulting from over- or underactivity of pelvic musculature
manifest in a variety of ways, including urinary and fecal incontinence, urinary frequency or urgency, as well
sexual dysfunction and pelvic pain syndromes. Pelvic floor disorders are poorly understood in people with
physical disabilities, and Veterans with lower limb amputation (LLA) are one such group of individuals. Pelvic
floor disorders are effectively managed with conservative, non-pharmacological treatment, but left undiagnosed
can adversely affect many facets of functioning and well-being. People with LLA frequently exhibit conditions
associated with PFDs in the non-LLA population, including low back pain and heightened fall risk, yet the
presence of PFDs have not been systematically assessed in individuals with LLA. With over a million people
living with LLA in the U.S., this may pose a significant health burden that is currently not being addressed. The
overall objective of this proposal is to better understand the magnitude and impact of PFDs on health-related
quality of life in Veterans with LLA. We will explore the prevalence of PFDs amongst men and women with LLA
and the physical and behavioral sequalae associated with the presence of symptoms of PFDs. We propose to
comprehensively address the gaps in knowledge by administering surveys, including psychometrically sound
outcome measures, to assess symptoms of PFDs, to 200 study participants of both sexes (n ≥ 100 females). All
surveys will be remotely administered to participants, to optimize convenience and study enrollment. Our
proposed study has three aims:
Specific Aim 1: To estimate the prevalence of PFDs in a cohort of male and female Veterans with LLA.
This descriptive aim will provide seminal data on the magnitude of PFDs in Veterans with LLA and can serve as
a proxy estimate for rates in the LLA population in general. Estimates will be provided based on sex and level of
LLA (trantibial, transfemoral, etc.) The primary measure of PFD symptoms will be the Pelvic Floor Distress
Inventory (PFDI-20), with secondary measures administered to explore other aspects related to PFDs in men
and women. Furthermore, this aim will assess the feasibility of collecting self-reported pelvic/urogenital
information and the acceptability by Veterans to PFD-related survey items.
Specific Aim 2: To examine associations between PFDs and low back pain, and prosthetic mobility in
Veterans with LLA. This aim is designed to determine physical sequelae related to the presence of PFDs. We
expect that (2A) there will be significant relationships between PFDs and scores on the Oswestry Disability Index
as a measure of low back pain, and (2B) lower scores of prosthetic mobility, as measured by the Prosthetic Limb
Users Survey of Mobility™ will be associated with PFDs.
Specific Aim 3: To examine the extent to which PFDs contribute to fall risk and levels of activity
participation in Veterans with LLA. This aim will examine the impact of reported PFDs relative to behavior
constructs affecting health-related quality of life. We anticipate that (3A) there will be significant levels of
association between PFDs with reported fall occurrence, and that (3B) the presence of PFDs will be associated
with decreased activity participation, both social and work related.
Impact. Successful completion of this work will establish an evidence base regarding PFDs in male and female
Veterans with LLA. This SPiRE presents an opportunity to shift the paradigm of LLA rehabilitation by elevating
the consideration of often-ignored variables that could be contributing to increased rates of falls, low back pain,
and poorer quality of life in this population."
10732777,"Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading infectious pathogen, causing pneumonia, bacteremia, meningitis, acute
otitis media, and nearly one million deaths worldwide each year. S. pneumoniae can be carried in the
nasopharynx asymptomatically, which contributes to pathogen spread, as pneumococcal carriage often
precedes active infection. Infections occur with increased frequency in high-risk populations, such as individuals
with diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and HIV. Several
vaccines are currently in use to prevent pneumococcal infection; however, several factors warrant further
research, including limited serotype coverage of current vaccines, limited vaccine efficacy against some vaccine-
included serotypes, increased incidence of colonization and infection with non-vaccine serotypes, and
widespread drug and multidrug antibiotic resistance among non-vaccine serotypes. This R01 proposal will
address these limitations by defining the structural determinants mediating the serotype breadth and
protective efficacy of broadly-reactive human mAbs that prevent and treat pneumococcal infection. The
scientific premise of this proposal is that mAbs to conserved pneumococcal antigens that are broadly reactive
could serve as priority or adjunctive therapies for pneumococcal disease management. This proposal will focus
on mAbs to pneumococcal antigens that are highly conserved and are targets of B cells during pneumococcal
colonization and infection. Our work will advance the field by generating new therapeutic options for the
prevention and treatment of pneumococcal infection for diverse serotypes, including encapsulated and
nonencapsulated serotypes, and by identifying protective epitopes on pneumococcal surface proteins. Our
innovative hypothesis is that human mAbs targeting conserved pneumococcal surface proteins will exhibit
substantial serotype breadth, can treat pneumococcal infection, and that mAb protective efficacy and serotype
breadth is correlated to epitope specificity. Our data will provide new findings for the pneumococcal protein
vaccine field. In Aim 1, the serotype breadth and protective efficacy of human mAbs targeting conserved protein
antigens will be determined in models of both primary and secondary (following influenza virus infection)
pneumococcal infection. In Aim 2, we will define the epitopes mediating the protective efficacy of the human
mAbs using X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM, which will be critical to the field by informing the development
of protein-based pneumococcal vaccines, as we have shown in our preliminary data that the epitope on
pneumococcal proteins impacts mAb breadth and protective efficacy. In Aim 3, we will conduct in depth in vitro
and in vivo mechanistic studies to assess mAb functions, including opsonophagocytic and agglutination activity,
and inhibition of bacterial growth, adhesion, invasion, and biofilm formation. We will also assess the specific
immunological pathways important for mAb-mediated bacterial clearance. Overall, our work is both practically
and conceptually innovative, and will challenge current treatment paradigms for pneumococcal infection."
10734793,"Abstract:
The continued emergence of antibiotic resistance has led to a global health crisis, leading to a predicted 10
million deaths per year by 2050 without significant intervention. Targeting bacterial virulence determinants with
novel antibiotics rather than essential proteins would limit resistance development. We will utilize two powerful
model systems, Listeria monocytogenes infection in the Danio rerio (zebrafish) model, to identify bacterial
virulence factors that will serve as novel targets for antibiotic development. L. monocytogenes is a human and
livestock pathogen that is the causative agent of Listeriosis. Perhaps more importantly, it is also a well-studied,
genetically tractable model pathogen that has been used for decades to dissect novel mechanisms of bacterial
pathogenesis, innate immune activation and cell biology. The zebrafish is a similarly well studied model host
organism with robust genetic tools, high fecundity and translucent larvae that make them ideal models for
infectious disease and innate immunity studies. In this proposal we will identify novel antibiotic targets in L.
monocytogenes using a high-throughput transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) negative selection approach. In
aim 1 we will execute our L. monocytogenes TIS screen in macrophage cell culture, identifying genes that are
required for bacterial invasion, phagosomal escape, and cytosolic survival and replication in a cell autonomous
manner. In aim 2 we will repeat the TIS screen in intact zebrafish larvae, identifying genes required for infection
in vivo. Comparing cell culture essential genes with those identified in vivo will highlight those genes necessary
for infection in the context of an immune system. Finally, to fully exploit the genetic tractability and high
throughput nature of the zebrafish, and to identify bacterial virulence determinants required for defense against
specific components of the host immune response, we will perform TIS in transgenic zebrafish deficient in
components of the phagocyte oxidase complex or the inflammasome complex. Upon completion of these aims
we will have developed and executed a whole genome screen to identify novel virulence factors in L.
monocytogenes required for cell intrinsic virulence, in vivo virulence, and virulence selectively necessary to
combat reactive oxygen species and inflammasome activation. Future studies will expand on these proof of
principle experiments to identify virulence factors required for other aspects of innate immunity (antimicrobial
peptides, nutritional immunity, specific cytokine functions, etc) as well as utilizing the hits identified in our screens
to screen for small molecule inhibitors as novel antibiotics."
10911003,"Project Summary
Gradients of chemokines control physiologic trafficking of multiple cell types, and many of these same
chemokines drive multiple diseases, including cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegeneration. Controlling
chemokine gradients also offers novel opportunities to improve recruitment of therapeutic cells to target
sites for regenerative medicine. Critical functions of chemokines and chemokine receptors in biomedicine
has motivated ongoing development of new pharmaceutical agents regulating these pathways. However,
clinical translation of compounds targeting chemokine signaling remains slow, due in part to unresolved
basic questions about how local gradients of chemokines control cell migration, particularly in diseased
tissues with loss of normal tissue architecture. While local gradients of chemokines are recognized as key
determinants of cell movement, methods to measure or manipulate the chemokine environment
immediately adjacent to cells remain limited. The objective of this proposal is to develop and utilize synthetic
cells as a synthetic biology tool to manipulate the chemokine environment that will help address how local,
cell-adjacent chemokine gradients steer chemotaxis of cells. Specifically, we will focus on two chemokine
receptor pathways, CXCL12-CXCR4 and CCL21-CCR7, strongly associated with progression of several
common diseases and promising targets for cell-based regenerative therapies. Synthetic cells can be
engineered de novo from the bottom-up with specialized functions, including chemokine secretion. Synthetic
cells are not alive, do not grow or divide, and may be a safer alternative to use in future in vivo applications.
Leveraging recent synthetic biology developments in engineered mammalian and synthetic cells, synthetic
cells with custom input-output relationship will be constructed. We will engineer synthetic cells to detect
local concentrations of a specific chemokine, allowing real-time monitoring of chemokine gradients. We also
will design synthetic cells that upon direct interaction with a living cell, respond by secreting a chemokine to
disrupt the chemotactic gradient presented to a living cell. These tools will enable us to understand how
local concentrations of a chemokine regulate signaling and movement of living cells. The proposed work
consists of two specific aims: 1) To develop synthetic cells that can report local chemokine concentrations;
and 2) To develop synthetic cells that modulate the chemokine environment to regulate chemotaxis. The
proposed research is significant as it applies established synthetic biology concepts in mammalian cells to
synthetic cells, filling a fundamental gap in tool development that has prevented complete understanding of
chemotaxis in complex environments. The work will also have a lasting impact that opens the door for
potential new interventions using engineered synthetic cells to manipulate local chemokine profiles
specifically and controllably for therapy in multiple disease settings."
10892183,"PROJECT SUMMARY
COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in children have increased dramatically worldwide. Although most COVID-
19 is mild in children, severe illness and post-infectious complications can occur. We and others have found that
children are an important source of household and community transmission. Vaccination is the most effective
way to prevent severe infection and decrease transmission. Infants under 6 months of age are at high risk for
life-threatening complications, but a vaccine for this age group is not yet in clinical trials; thus, maternal
vaccination and breastfeeding may be an important strategy to protect infects. SARS-CoV-2 infection and
vaccine immunity studies have focused predominantly on adults, but children have developing immune
systems and may respond to the new mRNA vaccination platform differently from adults. This proposal
addresses the critical need to study the short- and long-term immune responses to COVID-19 mRNA vaccination
in children, human milk, and breastfeeding infants. We have a successful ongoing longitudinal COVID-19
vaccination cohort that began in December 2020, in which we have collected biologic specimens from 368
individuals including adults, children, and lactating mother-infant pairs. We will enroll a total of 560 individuals
down to 6 months of age after the mRNA vaccine receives Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the younger
age group. Participants are followed every 3 months for nasal, saliva, milk (if lactating), and blood samples. We
will test all COVID-19 symptomatic or exposed participants for breakthrough infection throughout the study
period. Our central hypothesis is that the repertoire, magnitude, and longevity of COVID-19 vaccine-
induced immune responses will be dependent on age and previous experience with SARS-CoV-2
infection. Importantly, our study will also move beyond the systemic immune responses to examine
mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract and in human milk. To test the hypothesis, we will characterize
vaccine induced serum, nasal, and saliva SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody response (Aim 1) and cellular
(CD4+/CD8+) response (Aim 2) in children compared with adults and identify key immunologic correlates of
protection against breakthrough infection. We will also determine humoral and cellular responses in human milk
and secretory IgA in the breastfed infants’ upper respiratory tract and evaluate vaccine-induced differential gene
expression in milk that direct the immune response (Aim 3). Our collaborative team with expertise in vaccinology,
immunology, virology, epidemiology, and bioinformatics will ensure successful integrative analyses and
interpretation of these immunologic and transcriptomic data. Completion of the study will provide a
comprehensive characterization of longitudinal COVID-19 mRNA vaccination-induced immunity across age
groups and in human milk to inform vaccination strategies to optimize the protection of children and infants."
10772042,"Abstract: Neurological outcome after spinal cord injury (SCI) is dependent on the extent of primary injury and
the delayed secondary degeneration of spared white matter (WM) and grey matter. Although Ca2+ overload is
established as a key mediator of secondary injury, therapeutically targeting external sources of Ca2+ to date
have failed to improve neurological recovery in pre-clinical studies and following human SCI. This proposal will
assess the role of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) directly in spinal cord neurons and microglia after SCI
using cell type specific knockout of key SOCE mediators. Although, SOCE plays a vital role in maintaining Ca2+
homeostasis and is necessary to sustain intracellular Ca2+ at critical levels for immune cell function, we
propose that aberrant and excessive SOCE causes secondary degeneration of WM. The role of SOCE in WM
injury, microglial activation, and function remains poorly understood. Furthermore, the precise role of the
essential SOCE components including stromal interaction molecule (stim 1 and -2), and Orai 1-3 (form the
Ca2+ channel pore) in microglial function and neuronal injury remains unclear. Our preliminary data support an
important role for SOCE in mediating secondary degeneration, microglial activation and proinflammatory
cytokine release, and worsening neurological recovery. We hypothesize that dysregulation of SOCE mediates
“bystander” secondary axonal degeneration following SCI by increasing Ca2+ permeability through Stim and/or
Orai channels causing Ca2+ overload in axons. In addition, we hypothesize that SOCE regulates microglial
activation and release of proinflammatory factors that negatively impacts neurological recovery after SCI. Our
specific Aims are to, 1. Determine the role of SOCE in secondary degeneration and neurological recovery
following SCI. 2. Determine the role of microglial SOCE in secondary degeneration, wound healing, and
neurological recovery after SCI. To accomplish these aims, we will use two photon excitation intravital imaging
to visualize the dynamic response of spinal cord axons and microglia after SCI in real time. We will use both
pharmacological SOCE inhibitors and cell type specific knockout of key SOCE mediators directly in spinal
neurons and microglia. The most efficacious approach will then be assessed using behavioral testing, amount
of spared WM and grey matter, and wound healing. The technology and approach may help advance the field
as live imaging of axons over time allows unequivocal determination of the fate of injured axons and whether
they can be rescued in real-time with treatment. Furthermore, it allows direct visualization of microglia
simultaneously with axons and their interactions as these events are unfolding in the injured spinal cord. This
proposal is innovative and uses advanced imaging techniques to explore overlooked areas of SCI research.
The approach taken may also unveil novel drug targets and repurpose FDA approved drugs found to inhibit
SOCE (e.g., teriflunomide). The underlying mechanisms of WM injury may also be relevant to other
neurological diseases of the nervous system such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and TBI."
10763860,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cortical-basal ganglia network activities that are
involved with human gait control, and reveal the abnormalities in this circuit that underlie gait disorders in patients
with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Human gait is a complex motor task that requires the flexible coordination of both
cortical and subcortical structures within the brain. However, the neural encoding for gait initiation, continuous
rhythmic walking, and gait adaptation is largely unknown due largely to methodological constraints. Decoding
the neural control of gait is not only important for understanding a fundamental human behavior, but is also
important for developing novel neuromodulation paradigms to treat gait problems in PD.
 We propose to study the neurophysiology of human gait control by capturing simultaneous local field
potentials from bilateral motor cortex and globus pallidus interna (GPi) of ten PD patients implanted with
bidirectional sensing and stimulating devices. We plan to decode the cortical and pallidal neural activities that
underlie effective and abnormal gait initiation, continuous walking, and gait modification under different
medication states and stimulation cycles in the naturalistic environment in addition to the laboratory setting. Our
working model is that continuous gait is generated by rhythmic low frequency fluctuations—theta (4-8Hz), alpha
(8-12Hz), and beta oscillations (13-30Hz) in the GPi and does not require much cortical input except periodic
beta desynchronization required to disinhibit the motor cortex. Motor cortical involvement is greater during gait
initiation and gait adaptation, where top-down cortical command is necessary to modify basal ganglia activities
to maintain postural balance. We theorize that in PD, where increased beta synchrony throughout the motor
system is associated with an akinetic state, gait impairments are caused by this excessive cortical-pallidal
synchronization and disrupt the dynamic and transient synchronization required for normal gait.
 To test this hypothesis, we will study gait initiation (Aim 1) in the laboratory setting under different
medication and stimulation conditions, continuous locomotion (Aim 2) both in the laboratory setting and in the
home setting to capture dynamic changes of gait in the naturalistic setting, and a visually guided gait adaptation
task (Aim 3) under different medication and stimulation conditions in the laboratory. The impact of this study will
be 1) perform the first chronic network analysis of human gait using cortical and pallidal recordings, 2) investigate
the human brain activities underlying walking in the natural environment, and 3) provide a conceptual framework
for understanding the mechanism of supraspinal network control of gait and pathophysiology of gait impairments
in PD."

There are persistent mental health and health care access disparities between rural and urban
communities. Within rural communities, foreign- and US- born Latinos experience worse mental
health and access to care than rural Whites or urban Latinos. While the social determinants of
rural health have been recognized as a major underlying cause of health, there is limited
investigation of and data on the structural and community factors specific to improving mental
health and health care access of rural Latinos. The overarching goal of the proposed study is to
investigate the association between mental health and health care access and immigrant
policies among Latinos in rural regions by conducting a multilevel, cross-sectional study of the
impact of policy contexts, social climates, and Latinos’ direct encounters with institutions that
implement policy. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) investigate the impact of exclusionary
county policy contexts and social climates on rural Latino mental health and health care access;
2) investigate the impact of rural Latinos’ encounters with exclusionary immigrant policy on their
mental health and health care access; and 3) investigate the extent to which county policy
contexts, social climates, and policy encounters jointly influence rural Latino mental health and
health care access. To achieve these aims we will, first, collect county-level data on local policy
contexts and social climates and will implement hierarchical regression models to test their
associations with mental health and health care access, net of covariates. We will also conduct
a population-based survey of foreign- and US-born Latinos in rural counties in California and
Arizona. We will use survey data to construct a measure of respondents’ level of exclusionary
encounters with policies and will implement hierarchical regression models to test their
association with mental health and health care access. Finally, we will conduct analyses of the
correlations between county policy contexts, social climates, and policy encounters and conduct
tests of mediation and moderation to assess how their relationships contribute to mental health
and health care access. The study’s multi-level approach will contribute to knowledge on the
mechanisms that influence Latino and immigrant health. The study will produce new data to
inform health policy and Latino-focused interventions in rural communities aimed at promoting
mental health and increasing access to health care and safety net services."
10856913,"Hospital Systems Serving Health Disparity Populations (HSSHDPs) deliver needed services to racial and
ethnic minorities and other underserved communities. HSSHDPs may experience long-term effects of natural
and man-made disasters that in turn could affect health outcomes for the populations they serve. The COVID-
19 pandemic has affected virtually every US healthcare system and, therefore, provides a unique opportunity
to study the effects of large-scale and long-term stressors on under-resourced systems serving vulnerable
patient populations. Using the framework of the disaster management cycle (mitigation, preparedness,
response, and recovery), this project proposes to conduct a mixed methods study of the long-term effects of
COVID-19 on US hospitals across four critical domains (quality, workforce, finances, and innovation), with a
special focus on HSSHDPs and on the health disparity populations they serve.
 This project will be the first major national investigation of the effects of a national disaster on HSSHDPs.
This rigorous mixed methods study will be significant in identifying HSSDHPS most and least affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic and will deepen the understanding of the contributing factors that led to successes and
challenges. The study will identify actionable best practices and challenges to HSSHDPs' operations before,
during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The specific aims of this study are:
 Aim 1. Describe the long-term effects of COVID-19 on hospitals and the perceived usefulness of
disaster management planning activities (including interactions with Coalitions). In partnership with the
American Hospital Association and America's Essential Hospitals a nationally representative survey of 2000
hospitals will be conducted to examine variation by HSSHDP status and other characteristics.
 Aim 2. Analyze changes (before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic, 2018-2023) in hospital-
level quality, service levels, and finances, and in patient-level outcomes. Using secondary data sources,
the study will focus on differences among HSSHDPs, and for context, compare HSSHDPs with non-HSSHDPs.
 Aim 3. Explore the challenges faced by HSSHDPs during the pandemic and the strategies pursued
to overcome them. The study will include 12 in-depth case studies, using purposive sampling to select
HSSHDPs and non-HSSHDPs with and without major effects due to COVID-19. Semi-structured interviews
with stakeholders will be used to more fully understand existing structures, challenges, interactions with
Coalitions, and other disaster management strategies.
 Aim 4. Develop prioritized policy recommendations to enhance resilience of our most critical public
health systems for future disasters to protect the health of our most vulnerable populations and the
facilities that serve them. A national Delphi consensus panel in conjunction with the National Academy of
Science Engineering and Medicine will be conducted."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most frequent and deadly primary brain tumor in adults; the median survival of
patients with GBM remains a dismal 14-16 months with no improvement over standard of care since its
introduction 15 years ago. Thus, identifying new therapeutic strategies for GBM is an urgent unmet medical
need. Significant evidence indicates that, similar to other cancers, GBM have reprogrammed metabolism to
support the requisite demands to fuel malignant growth and survival. Notably, work from our group and others
has demonstrated a link between specific genetic alterations (e.g., EGFR) in GBM and rewired metabolism,
consequently revealing nodes of therapeutic intervention to exploit GBM metabolism. However, comprehensive
molecular profiling has shown that there is considerable molecular heterogeneity among GBM patients, and an
unbiased investigation into how this molecular diversity in GBM shapes the metabolome has yet to be conducted.
In preliminary studies, we have used integrated next-generation sequencing (RNA and Exome Seq) together
with large-scale “shotgun” lipidomics from over 50 GBM patient and patient-derived samples to determine if
molecular heterogeneity influences the lipidome of GBM. Using this cutting edge, systems-level approach we
have identified a unique lipid signature enriched in GBM tumors with deletion of the tumor suppressor, CDKN2A:
the most frequently altered driver gene in GBM. Importantly, as an apparent consequence of this specific lipid
enrichment, CDKN2A null GBM demonstrate selective susceptibility to ferroptosis – a recently described form of
lipid-peroxidation dependent cell death. These exciting preliminary results have led to the following aims both to
determine the underlying mechanistic basis for these observations and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of
inducing ferroptosis in CDKN2A-deleted GBM mouse models. In Aim 1, stable isotope-labeled metabolic tracing
and metabolic flux analysis will be conducted to evaluate how the loss of CDKN2A elicits a shift in fatty acid
composition relative to CDKN2A WT GBM. Aim 2 investigates the molecular pathways underlying enhanced
sensitivity to ferroptosis in CDNK2A null GBM. Finally, Aim 3 will assess whether the exploitation of ferroptosis
can selectively inhibit growth of CDKN2A null patient-derived orthotopic GBM xenografts. Together, the proposed
studies will provide mechanistic insight into a previously unappreciated link between a common genetic alteration
in GBM (CDKN2A deletion) and composition of the GBM lipidome, and evaluate the therapeutic potential of
ferroptosis in controlling growth of this genetically-defined subset of GBM tumors."
10760222,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Telomeres present unique challenges for genomes with linear chromosomes, including the inability of the
semi-conservative DNA replication machinery to fully duplicate the ends of linear molecules. This is solved
in virtually all eukaryotes by the enzyme telomerase, through the addition of telomeric repeats onto
chromosome ends. It is widely assumed that the primary site of action for telomerase is the single-stranded
G-rich overhang at the ends of chromosomes, formed after DNA replication is complete. A newly developed
assay that monitors spontaneous monitor fork collapse at an interstitial telomeric tract has demonstrated there
is a second substrate for telomerase in wild type yeast, which is a collapsed fork generated during replication
of duplex telomeric DNA. Newly collapsed forks are extensively elongated by telomerase in a single cell
division, indicating that a major source of newly synthesized telomeric repeats in wild type cells occurs at
collapsed forks. Furthermore, the ability of telomerase to elongate newly collapsed forks is dependent on fork
remodeling proteins. In parallel, a re-examination of the role of a telomere-dedicated RPA-like complex (t-
RPA) in budding yeast argues that this complex facilitates lagging strand synthesis during duplex DNA
replication, rather than protecting telomeres in from unregulated resection. Additional data argues that this
complex collaborates with the canonical RPA complex to stabilize replication forks during duplex telomeric
DNA replication. Collectively, these observations provide a substantial challenge to current models for how
telomere homeostasis is maintained in wild type yeast. This application tests the model that the activity of
telomerase in response to spontaneous fork collapse is a major determinant of telomere length regulation.
Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that telomerase activity at newly collapsed forks proceeds through a regulatory
pathway distinct from how telomerase engages fully replicated chromosome termini. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that two RPA complexes, one dedicated to the leading strand (RPA) and the other (t-RPA) bound
to the lagging strand, collaborate to promote stabilization of the fork during replication of duplex telomeric
DNA. The third Aim will examine a new role for the canonical RPA complex in regulating telomerase, through
surfaces that are highly conserved from yeast to humans."
10756982,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Irritability—exaggerated anger in response to non-reward—is among the most common psychiatric complaints.
Because irritability in late childhood and adolescence predicts mental disorders across the lifespan, identifying
the neural mechanisms involved in irritability across the transition to adolescence is paramount to intervene
before youth irritability problems harden into entrenched psychiatric disorders in later adolescence and
adulthood. Irritability is linked with abnormalities in reward processing, which may lead to greater frustration
when rewards are not received. Such reward processing vulnerabilities may be ameliorated by better inhibitory
control, which normatively increases with maturation. However, the interplay between reward processing and
inhibitory control in irritability is unknown. Investigating longitudinal changes in neural circuitry is important
because reward- and inhibition-related neural networks undergo substantial change from childhood through
adolescence. Our overall goal is to identify reward- and inhibition-related neural pathways that characterize
changes in irritability over the transition to adolescence. To this end, the proposal leverages data from the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, a large, national longitudinal sample of preadolescents
assessed annually (N=~8,312 with usable datasets; baseline age=9-10; 1-Year Follow-Up [1-YRFU] age=10-11;
2-YRFU age=11-12). At baseline and 2-YRFU, youth complete monetary incentive delay and stop-signal tasks
during fMRI acquisition that assess neural responses to reward and inhibitory control, respectively. Across all
waves, youth irritability and co-occurring psychopathology are assessed using clinical interviews and parent-
and youth-report measures, and multiple behavioral and parent- and youth-reported measures of youth reward
processing and inhibitory control are collected. Our central hypothesis is that preadolescents with both reward-
and inhibition-related neural deficits are more likely to show persistently high or increasing irritability across the
transition to adolescence, whereas preadolescents with reward-related brain deficits, but better inhibition, will
demonstrate decreases in irritability. Specific aims are to identify (1) separate and (2) interactive contributions
of reward- and inhibition-related neural function to concurrent irritability; to identify (3a) preadolescent reward-
and inhibition-related neural predictors and (3b) developmental changes in reward and inhibition neural
mechanisms, of irritability trajectories and future psychopathology across the transition to adolescence; and to
explore (4) the moderating role of developmental-biological-contextual factors (sex, puberty, race/ethnicity, SES,
familial characteristics) on these brain-behavior relationships. This proposal will advance the field by revealing
the neural circuitry of irritability. Innovative aspects include focusing on a key age range (transition to
adolescence) to prevent adult disorders, multiple time point imaging, formulation of a novel and comprehensive
reward-based model of irritability, machine learning methodology, and replication analyses. Our project is
significant because it will be a catalyst for a research program to inform precision medicine for irritability."

Dysmenorrhea is a prevalent pain condition and a risk factor for developing other chronic pain conditions.
Dysmenorrhea experiences vary significantly among individual women. Some women are symptom-free, and
those with symptoms fall into three dysmenorrhea symptom phenotypes: mild localized pain, severe localized
pain, and multiple severe symptoms. The mechanisms underlying this individual variation remain incompletely
understood, creating barriers for expanding and personalizing dysmenorrhea treatment options. Given the role
of the vaginal microbiota in inflammation and female reproductive health and the proof-of-concept data linking
vaginal microbiota and dysmenorrhea phenotypes, the study of vaginal microbiota and their function is a
promising avenue to understand individual differences in dysmenorrhea. Our central hypothesis is that vaginal
microbiota contributes to dysmenorrhea symptoms by modulating the host inflammatory response in the genital
tract. The purpose of this proposed, prospective, longitudinal study is to examine relationships among vaginal
microbiome, inflammatory mediators, sex hormones, metabolome, and dysmenorrhea phenotypes. Racially
diverse female participants (aged 14-39) will be recruited into four groups: three dysmenorrhea phenotype
groups and one symptom-free group. These individuals will provide vaginal samples off- and on-menses, blood
samples, and questionnaire data. The specific aims of the study are to (1) differentiate vaginal microbial taxa,
genes, and pathways associated with dysmenorrhea phenotypes using shotgun metagenomic and qPCR
methods; (2) differentiate inflammatory mediators and metabolites associated with dysmenorrhea phenotypes
using immunoassays of cytokines and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics; and (3) identify taxonomic
drivers of functional shifts in vaginal metabolome associated with severe dysmenorrhea symptoms. Network-
based systems biology and predictive modeling approaches will be used to integrate phenotypic, demographic,
behavioral, metagenomic, cytokine, metabolomic, and hormonal data. This multi-omics approach will provide
rich information on the function of vaginal microbiota and metabolites to uncover mechanisms underlying
individual differences in dysmenorrhea. The expected impact of this research is to (1) suggest new avenues for
treating dysmenorrhea through modifying the vaginal microbiota or metabolites (e.g., using drugs, probiotics,
and/or behavioral interventions), (2) reveal vaginal microbiota and/or metabolites as biomarkers, and (3)
generate a rich resource with large microbial metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and detailed
phenotype, hormonal, and behavioral data to study mechanisms of dysmenorrhea and menstrual health. In the
long term, this work has the potential to lead to additional dysmenorrhea treatment options with the ultimate
goals of reducing pain and improving women's quality of life."
10807055,"Project Summary/Abstract
How neurons guide their processes to the correct binding partner is a complicated task, but is critical during
development and recovery from injury. It involves the highly coordinated action of many cytoskeletal proteins
and their binding partners within the growth cone at the tips of extending neurites, as they feel their way through
the neuropil. There is a lot known about the signaling pathways that regulate neurite outgrowth and turning, but
the details of how molecular structures come together to achieve growth cone behavior are still unclear. This
project will initially focus on the structure of bundled cofilactin filaments (cofilin-decorated F-actin) in situ, and
how this novel filament structure and fascin cross-linking determine filopodial dynamics. Here we propose that
filopodial behavior is governed partially by the transition from the fascin cross-linked to a cofilin cross-linked
filaments, that makes filopodial bundles more pliable. Experiments are focused around three aims: 1) to study
the high-resolution structure of fascin- and cofilin-linked actin bundles to determine their impact on actin
structure, 2) to determine how changes in fascin and cofilin concentration regulate filopodial dynamics and
structure, and 3) determine how LIMKI and SSH1 form the core of a bidirectional regulatory mechanism for
regulating actin architecture via tuning the phosphorylation state of Ser3 on cofilin."
10873048,"The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) has increased among Veterans in recent years because global TB burden
has escalated with the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extremely drug resistant Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. Further, current vaccines do not elicit long-lasting protective immunity against TB,
especially in adults. Hence, this application addresses a critical unmet need for an effective vaccine against TB
and thereby, significantly improve the quality of life of our Veterans. Herein, we propose pre-clinical studies that
will identify protective CD8+ T cell epitopes and develop intranasal vaccine delivery platforms for the design of
next generation TB vaccines. The global burden of TB caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is
enormous. A third of the world’s population is currently infected with Mtb, an airborne pathogen that causes ~1.5
million deaths annually. The escalating emergence of multidrug-resistant and extremely drug resistant Mtb
strains for which treatment options are costly and limited, further exacerbates global burden. This problem
persists because current vaccines do not elicit long-lasting protective immunity against TB, especially in adults.
The challenge is multifaceted because Mtb enters the host through the respiratory tract and, therefore, optimal
protection will require installation of lung-resident CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells positioned at the frontline to
respond immediately to an infection. Traditional vaccines and approved adjuvants typically elicit weak, short-
lived T cell responses, and parenteral vaccination is ineffective at installing protective immunity within the
mucosae. Moreover, most virus-vectored and subunit TB vaccines employ a small subset of Mtb antigens,
resulting in insufficient epitope diversity for optimal protection, partly because the epitopes that are presented
during Mtb infection and confer protective immunity are not fully defined. Hence, our overall objective is to
discover immunogenic, protective Mtb epitopes and to incorporate them in an innovative nanoparticle (NP)-
based intranasal vaccine designed to promote a balanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in the lungs that are
protective against TB. As a means to accomplish this goal, we discovered >10,000 peptides that bind to HLA-
A*02:01, B*07:02, B*35:01, & B*35:03 in a high-throughput binding assay using ultrahigh-density peptide arrays.
Now the challenge is to identify epitopes recognised by Mtb-reactive CD8+ T cells that can protect against
infection in a preclinical, humanised HLA-Itg mouse models. Moreover, using different infection models, we have
developed multiple nanoparticle platforms for simultaneous delivery of antigens and adjuvants that efficiently
generate protective, tissue resident CD8+ T cells (Trm). Guided by these exciting published and preliminary
results, we will test this central hypothesis: Intranasal immunization with subunit vaccines consisting of novel
Mtb antigens and adjuvant will generate CD8+ Trm responses in the lungs. Installation of Mtb-reactive CD8+ Trm
at the port of pathogen entry will protect against a lethal, aerosol challenge of three novel humanised mouse
models with [there] clinical isolate of virulent Mtb, [including] HN878. Our strategy to test this hypothesis is to,
(a) define immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes presented by HLA-B*07:02 that protect B7.2tg mice from Mtb
infections; and (b) define common immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes presented by multiple B*07:02-related
alleles [called B7 supertype] that protect HLA-I transgenic mouse models from Mtb infections. Our
multidisciplinary team —consisting of biochemists, immunologists, microbiologists, and bioengineer, is ideally
situated to pursue the stated Specific Aims. We anticipate that successful completion of the proposed research
will inform next generation vaccine design against Mtb infections and TB disease. Our innovative “discover and
deliver” approach to vaccine design will impact clinical practice paradigms against TB and other pulmonary
infectious diseases such as SARS-COVID19 and Flu. Thereby, vaccine paradigms emerging from our research
bears with it the promise to significantly improve the quality of life of our Veterans."
10772092,"Project Summary/Abstract
Transcription dominates the gene expression landscape of circadian rhythms and a number of neuroscience
areas. Yet post-transcriptional regulation, including translational regulation and the role of RNA binding
proteins (RBPs), has become increasingly recognized as important in recent years. Moreover, understanding
the roles of RBPs in diverse cell types and diseases and ultimately therapeutic intervention requires identifying
the RNA targets of RBPs. The ribosome can be considered a RBP, so this focus on post-transcriptional
regulation and RBP targets includes identifying ribosome-associated transcripts, namely RNAs that change
their translational status under defined circumstances. RBP identification is particularly challenging from small
numbers of cells, e.g., cancer stem cells within a large, heterogeneous solid tumor or discrete neuronal
subtypes. These settings preclude traditional biochemistry and therefore require new approaches. Two new
methods recently appeared, TRIBE and STAMP, which exploit the RNA editing enzymes ADAR and APOBEC,
respectively. Their ribosome versions, Ribo-STAMP and Ribo-TRIBE, are even more recent and fuse a
ribosomal protein to the editing enzymes. This is so that the enzyme will be near RNAs that are being
translated and will “mark” them by changing their sequence. These edits are identified by mRNA sequencing
and straightforward computational methods, even from single cells. We propose to compare Ribo-STAMP and
Ribo-TRIBE side-by-side in mammalian cell culture systems, to assess their efficacy and to determine the
optimal configuration of ribosome-editing enzyme fusions. We also propose to develop Ribo-TRIBE for use in
Drosophila; we recently discovered that STAMP does not work in this organism, which limits us to TRIBE. We
will then extend these methods to the more biological context of neurons, from Drosophila as well as from
mouse brains. To complement these efforts, we will develop an extension of the TRIBE/STAMP theme called
Nanobody-editing. It consists of fusing the editing enzyme, ADAR or APOBEC, to a GFP-nanobody, which will
then deliver the editing enzyme to any GFP-tagged RNA binding protein or GFP-tagged ribosome. The
chimeric, recombinant protein will be used in vitro as a recombinant protein or expressed in vivo. Nanobody-
editing will facilitate identifying RBP and ribosome targets, because already existing GFP-tagged RBP or
ribosomes can serve as substrates. Moreover, in vitro editing will in many cases obviate the need to generate
new transgenes and transgenic animals. Lastly, TRIBE and as well as Ribo-TRIBE will be used to characterize
translational regulation “around the clock” within a few key Drosophila circadian neurons. These efforts will
deepen our understanding of circadian gene expression regulation as well as provide the community with new
tools with which to study translation in important but challenging biological systems."
10753589,"Endothelial Cell Respiration in Atherosclerotic Plaque Erosion
Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States and worldwide. Coronary
artery disease, the most common type of heart disease, is the root cause of acute coronary
syndromes, and accounts for 7.4 million deaths per year globally. Nearly all these events stem
from atherosclerotic plaque rupture or erosion. While knowledge of plaque rupture has improved
in recent decades, comparatively little is known about plaque erosion and its underlying
molecular mechanisms – despite recent recognition that it may cause from 25 to 60% of acute
coronary syndromes and is increasing in incidence. Plaque erosion is defined by loss of
endothelial cells (ECs) leading to thrombosis in the absence of plaque rupture. The
pathophysiology of erosion is largely unexplored; the few studies on this topic focus on extrinsic
factors that induce EC loss. However, most erosions are clinically silent, which suggests that
eroded regions usually heal well enough to prevent an acute coronary syndrome. Notably, the
molecular mechanisms underlying repair in plaque erosion are unknown. Our research proposal
will study EC intrinsic factors that may change the likelihood that ECs will be lost to death or
desquamation, or will contribute to repair, in particular, looking at mitochondrial mechanisms
that are unexplored in this setting. During angiogenesis, mitochondrial respiration and
metabolism support EC proliferation and migration by mechanisms other than ATP production.
We hypothesize that EC respiration is required to support endothelial homeostasis and promote
repair during re-endothelialization and plaque erosion. Using tools of molecular and cellular
biology and mouse genetics, we will evaluate: a) whether EC respiration promotes cellular
activities relevant for endothelial repair of eroded plaques, and unveil underlying molecular
mechanisms, b) whether EC respiration supports arterial homeostasis or promotes re-
endothelialization after arterial denudation, and c) whether EC respiration oposses plaque
erosion or supports re-endothelialization of eroded plaques. Our studies will also incorporate an
innovative method to study the endothelium in three-dimensions, and include the evaluation of
human atherosclerotic plaques. This research project will bring a new perspective to the
nascent field of plaque erosion pathophysiology, focused on mitochondria and cell metabolism,
which may open new avenues to prevent or treat acute coronary syndrome."

The overall performance of the NMR spectrometer impacts every research sample and outcome. Often for
complex multidimensional magic-angle spinning solid-state NMR experiments, dozens of experimental
parameters require careful adjustment and must be readjusted anytime the environmental conditions drift. Here
proposed are approaches to accelerate the setup and configuration of such experiments to maximally leverage
the available instrument time, as well as to maintain performance over long periods of signal averaging that
can be required for precious research samples that are available only in limited quantity. All aspects of the
experimental performance also rely critically on the NMR probe designs, including the radiofrequency
electronic circuits and related interfaces to spin the sample, control the temperature and deliver homogeneous
pulsed magnetic fields as part of modern multidimensional NMR experiments."
10770471,"TR&D 3 SUMMARY
Assigning each resonance in an NMR spectrum to individual atoms in a molecule is essential to almost every
NMR project. Automated programs are successful for assignment of smaller soluble proteins, but frequently fail
for larger proteins and complexes, asymmetric oligomers, and systems with predominantly one secondary
structure such as helical membrane proteins or beta-sheet fibrils. For most systems, the assignment process –
sample preparation, experiment selection, data processing, signal identification and data analysis to achieve
assignments – is expensive, time consuming and requires significant manual effort. This manual intervention
requires expertise to be done well, and poor execution at any step makes subsequent steps more difficult.
Here we propose to develop algorithms and guided user interfaces that will automate processing of higher
dimensional spectra, improve automated peak picking, and tailor acquisition of NMR spectra for assignment to
maximize data and minimize cost in a fully-automated, integrated data acquisition, assignment and structure
determination platform. Automation of this process will improve the reproducibility of NMR data analysis,
reduce the time and cost of NMR studies, and make NMR more accessible to the broad research community."

facilitate intermediate steps in technology development or make them particularly well-suited to demonstrate
the power and impact of our new technology. They are chosen to represent a broad cross-section of biological

undergoing liver transplantation. Support for my current activities involving aging research and mentorship
include a diverse pool of resources: 1) a NIA R01 to understand the role of frailty on global functional health in
patients after liver transplantation, 2) a NIA R21 to develop a laboratory frailty index for patients with cirrhosis,
3) a NIA supplement to characterize cognitive impairment and Alzheimers Disease risk factors in liver transplant

Transplantation (FrAILT) Study, which I founded in 2012 and is currently the largest cohort worldwide dedicated
to investigating the effect of aging—both chronologic (i.e., age) and physiologic (i.e., frailty)—on outcomes in
patients with cirrhosis. For the new research proposed in this K24, I will expand my research program to older
adults with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are eligible for liver transplantation by enriching our current data
with granular HCC metrics and additional aging-related metrics to: characterize distinct groups of patients by
frailty trajectories and identify novel predictors of frailty trajectory group membership (Aim 1), and investigate the
association between frailty trajectories and waitlist dropout (Aim 2) or post-transplant global functional health
(Aim 3). In so doing, I will create a unique multi-center dataset that is representative of the U.S. HCC population
and combines aging-, liver-, HCC-, and transplant-related factors that will not only expand my research portfolio
but also enable me to train new mentees interested in pursuing patient-oriented research at the intersection of
aging research, hepatology, oncology, and transplantation. This scientific proposal leverages my current skills,
clinical and research knowledge, and my established cohort to offer me the opportunity to develop new research
skills and approaches in this under-studied population of older adults with HCC awaiting and undergoing liver
transplantation. During this K24, I plan additional training in professional leadership and mentorship skills
development, and will create for my mentees a formal research/career curriculum to ensure a structured and
sustainable mentoring program for years to come. Given my own career as a medical subspecialist (hepatology)
in a surgically-oriented discipline (transplant) with long-standing intellectual and financial support from the
geriatric and aging research communities, I am particularly well-positioned to support trainees and early stage
investigators in medical and surgical subspecialties who can further promote aging research and geriatric
principles of care within their subspecialities."

The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to utilize the patient’s immune system to reject the invading “foreign”
tumor. However, the pancreatic cancer microenvironment is characterized by an abundance of
immunosuppressive cells and a dense stroma that prevents infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells.
Electroporation is a technique that has been utilized for decades in the laboratory; electrical voltage is applied
to cells to make holes for delivery of DNA and RNA. Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a technique now
being used clinically for ablation of localized tumors that cannot be removed surgically (locally advanced
tumors). Our objective is to use IRE as an ""in situ vaccine"" to help the host recognize foreign tumor proteins
(neoantigens) and generate anti-tumor immune responses that will decrease recurrence rates. We have
utilized mouse models of pancreatic cancer to show that IRE generates anti-tumor immune cells that prevent
growth of new tumors (prophylactic immunity). We hypothesize that combining IRE with agents that augment
the immune response will result in inhibition of established, distant tumors (therapeutic immunity or
“abscopal” effects). In Aim 1, we will use mouse models to compare the effects of IRE to radiation therapy
(XRT), as this is the most relevant clinical comparator. Both methods are used clinically for the ablation
(killing) of locally advanced pancreatic cancer but have been shown stimulate systemic immune responses in
preclinical models. We hypothesize that IRE will induce stronger immune responses because XRT causes
fibrosis (scarring) that will inhibit immune cell infiltration. In Aim 2, we will combine local ablation with local
delivery of agents that stimulate the innate immune system in mouse models of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
In Aim 3, we will use a novel model in which human tumors and their associated immune cells are implanted
into immunocompromised mice in order to create a “humanized” immune system. We will use this model to
study the effects of IRE on human tumors. We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team that encompasses
broad expertise in IRE, mouse tumor models, stromal biology, immunotherapy, clinical trials, and clinical care
of patients with pancreatic cancer. We envision that the combination of IRE with immunotherapy will be first
beneficial to patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer. However, if effective, this approach may also
be beneficial to patients with metastatic disease. Since the IRE technique is already in use clinically, a
clinical trial in which one or more of the agents to be studied is delivered during or after IRE as adjuvant
therapy would likely be feasible in the near future. We will use data from the proposed research to design
such a study."
10793633,"Project Summary
Now in its 13th year, the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium is perhaps the most innovative and productive
experiment in the history of psychiatry. The PGC unified the field and attracted a cadre of outstanding
scientists (802 investigators from 157 institutions in 41 countries). PGC work has led to identification of ~500
genetic loci in the 11 psychiatric disorders we study. Our work has led to 320 papers, many in high-profile
journals (Nature 3, Cell 5, Science 2, Nat Genet 27, Nat Neurosci 9, Mol Psych 37, Biol Psych 25). As
summary statistics are freely available, psychiatric disorders often feature prominently in papers by non-PGC
investigators. To advance discovery and impact, we propose to continue the work of the PGC across 11
disorder groups. Considerable new data are coming in the next five years. We thus can rapidly and efficiently
increase our knowledge of the fundamental basis of major psychiatric disorders.
Aim 1: we will continue to advance genetic discovery for severe psychiatric disorders in all working groups,
systematically interface with large biobank studies to ensure maximal comparability, and aggressively promote
new studies of individuals with psychiatric disorders from diverse ancestries to increase discovery and improve
fine-mapping. Aim 2: most studies analyze common variation (Aim 1), rare CNV (Aim 2), and rare
exome/genome resequencing results (via collaboration) in isolation: we will apply an integrative framework to
rigorously evaluate the contributions of all measured types of genetic variation on risk for psychiatric disorders.
Aim 3: we will move beyond classical case-control definitions to a more biologically-based and nuanced
understanding by enabling large trans-diagnostic studies, convene trans-disciplinary teams to use genetics to
address unresolved questions about the nature of psychiatric disorders, and to promote large studies of the
severest cases seen in psychiatric practice (leveraging the global reach of PGC investigators). Aim 4: we will
work to maximize the impact of our work via translational efforts: close collaborations with neuroscience
consortia to understand the biological implications of our findings; work to identify modifiable causal risk
factors; and work to robustly predict clinical outcomes and identify patient subsets. Aim 5: we will increase
impact of our work by extending and formalizing outreach to different communities (including pharma and
biotech), via digital media (Twitter, Facebook, Wikipedia), and by developing, distributing, and updating
resources/educational material for patients, families, and medical professionals. We will convene a Scientific
Advisory Board to ensure we respond positively to those invested in our results
Successful completion of this body of work will greatly advance knowledge of the genetic basis of psychiatric
disorders with potentially major nosological and treatment implications. These goals are consistent with a core
mission of the NIMH, and the central idea of the PGC: to convert the family history risk factor into biologically,
clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights."
10805388,"ABSTRACT:
Chronic psychological stress triggers and exacerbates major depressive disorder (MDD) and many other
psychiatric conditions – causing changes in sleep, eating habits, addictive behaviors, activity levels, circadian
rhythms, mood and other domains. The rodent stress response shares many behavioral and physiologic
alterations with that of humans. Chronic stress also has broad effects on the brain. But major gaps exist in our
knowledge in regard to the integrated behavior and physiology as well as the corresponding brain circuit changes
with chronic stress. Prior work has found many behavioral and physiologic phenotypes of stress, but we lack a
cohesive sense of how these variables co-evolve over time. Our first aim is to delineate this co-evolution of stress
response elements in stressed versus unstressed mice. We will accomplish this by examining mice under a
chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm versus controls in our new naturalistic observation system the
“Digital Homecage”. This system allows us to monitor over 50 behavioral measures simultaneously over weeks.
Mice will live in these homecages for 8 weeks: 2 weeks baseline, 4 weeks CUS and 2 weeks of recovery. An
exploratory element of that aim is to use machine learning to determine a coherent mouse stress biomarker for
future quantitative studies. Our next goal is to determine electrophysiologic signatures of chronic stress. It is
known that chronic stress alters brain circuit synaptic structure and neuromodulatory balance. It is known that
the behavior is controlled by the electrophysiologic state of brain networks and that those networks operate both
locally within regions and via coordinated multi-regional transmission. Therefore, we aim to study changes in
electrophysiology both within and across regions. We focus on the medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral
hippocampus and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex given their strong involvement in chronic stress. We will
implant tetrode arrays into these regions and will record over 8 weeks as above. In Aim 2, we will determine the
effects of chronic stress on within-region spiking tendencies including spike rate variability and excitatory-
inhibitory balance. In a second part of this aim we will use machine learning applied to a wider variety of within-
region dynamical measures to determine a potentially more complete set of differences between CUS and
control mice. In our final Aim, we will assess cross-regional coordination between these 3 regions. We will test
the hypothesis that pairwise coupling between regions will be altered in a manner consistent with MDD by
measuring coupling using both spiking and LFP. Again, we will then use machine learning methods on our large
dataset to detect further inter-regional dynamics un-revealed in our hypothesis-driven testing. This mixture of
behavior and electrophysiology is done to generate new understanding about chronic stress. We also have a
long-term vision of creating large dataset for future analysis, a fully-refined Digital Homecage system for future
studies, with an eye towards developing interventions based on natural electrophysiologic circuit function."
10813839,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand impaired phospholipid metabolism in the trabecular
meshwork (TM) tissue in glaucoma. The term phospholipid (PL) here refers to primarily three classes of lipids:
phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). A better understanding of
PL metabolism in the anterior eye chamber will provide insight into glaucoma pathology and facilitate the
development of new, disease-modifying intervention strategies. Our long-term goal is to develop better
intervention strategies for glaucoma by understanding the pathological changes in metabolism, and in
particular PL metabolism, in the glaucomatous anterior chamber. The absence of a comprehensive knowledge
of PL changes in diseased compared to healthy aqueous humor (AH) or TM represents a critical barrier to
progress in treating and preventing glaucoma. The proposed research is based on our extensive preliminary
studies performed over the past seven years.
We discovered a substantial decrease in PS and a general increase in PE lipid species in glaucomatous TM
compared to controls. This has followed rigorous analyses of levels and activity of enzymes in a
comprehensive and unbiased manner, demonstrating their alteration at critical branch points. Thus, we
propose to comprehensively investigate all PL interconversion enzymes in an unbiased manner. We also found
vastly different fold changes differing only slightly with respect to acyl-chain length (or structural features)
between control and glaucomatous TM or AH suggesting that the functions of transport proteins are potentially
aberrant in glaucomatous TM. We propose to investigate selected PL transport proteins in glaucomatous TM
tissue. Pathologic TM tissue consistently demonstrates altered biophysical properties, for example an elevated
elastic modulus. Our central hypothesis is that phospholipid metabolism is impaired in glaucoma, affecting
biophysical properties of the trabecular meshwork and contributing to its pathophysiology. In Aim 1 we will test
whether PL interconversion enzymes are altered in glaucoma, In Aim 2 we will evaluate whether PL transport
proteins are altered in glaucoma, and finally in Aim 3 we will determine whether restoring specific PLs that
become deficient in the diseased state can improve the biophysical properties of glaucomatous TM. We will
also evaluate correlation of biophysical properties with IOP lowering in murine models. We will use routine
(Western blot, immunosorbent assays) and innovative methods analytical techniques such as kinetic
histochemistry employing imaging mass spectrometry. The proposal also has brought forth a conceptual
innovation that is PL metabolism impairment in TM in glaucoma. The expected outcome of the proposed
research is the identification of aberrations in specific enzymes of PL metabolizing pathways and in PL
molecules that dysregulate biophysical properties of TM. These new insights will have an important impact on
developing novel glaucoma therapies."
10766823,"Synaptic dysfunction and neuritic dystrophy are prominent pathologic features of the prion- and 
Alzheimer’s disease-affected brain. Ubiquitinated protein inclusions are also commonly observed, 
providing strong evidence of impaired proteostatic pathways. Ubiquitination of cell membrane 
proteins and clearance through the ESCRT pathway (endosomal sorting complex required for 
transport) is critical to maintaining synaptic homeostasis. Here we will deeply investigate the 
ESCRT pathway contributions to disrupted synaptic homeostasis in prion disease. In prion-infected mice, we have found markedly reduced ESCRT-0 (an Hrs and STAM1 protein complex) 
and an enrichment of ubiquitinated proteins in synaptosomes. Strikingly, depleting neuronal Hrs 
in prion-infected mice shortened survival time and accelerated the degeneration of synapses, 
biochemically and structurally. Additionally, in a longitudinal study of the prion-infected 
hippocampus, we found an upregulation in the synaptic activity response gene, Arc/Arg3.1, and 
a chronic elevation in phosphorylated CaMKII and phosphorylated AMPA receptors, suggestive 
of enhanced and altered synapse function beginning in early disease. Our long-term goal is to 
decipher how prion and amyloid-β oligomers disrupt signaling pathways linked to the cellular prion 
protein, inducing proteostatic dysfunction and synaptic degeneration. Using electrophysiology, 
correlative light-electron microscopy, and proteomics on uninfected and prion-infected cultured 
neurons, we will first determine how Hrs expression impacts synapses, assessing activity, pre-and post-synaptic proteins, structure, and signaling. We will then test how distinct prion 
conformers impact the ESCRT pathway and neuronal signaling at glutamatergic synapses. 
Finally, we will investigate the contribution of glutamate receptor activity to prion spread and 
neurodegeneration. We will directly test how the findings in these genetically manipulated models 
compare to human prion-affected brain. These studies are the first to test how neuronal activity 
impacts prion dissemination, synaptic degeneration, and disease progression, and outcomes are 
expected to provide key insights into the deregulated synaptic signaling that drives neuron loss, 
thus revealing new therapeutic targets."

Cervical cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in many sub-Saharan countries, including Nigeria.
Expanding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for young girls/women, ages 9-26 years (primary
prevention) and HPV self-collection for cervical cancer screening for older women, ages 30-49 (secondary
prevention) are both critical to achieving WHO and Nigerian goals for reducing the cervical cancer burden. The
Nigerian government now recommends HPV vaccination and self-collection, yet uptake is poor. As such,
context-specific, targeted and culturally relevant implementation strategies are needed. We focus on HPV
vaccination among girls and self-collection among women because of the substantial burden of cervical
cancer. Mother-daughter relationships in Nigeria can be leveraged to increase HPV vaccination uptake among
young girls and HPV self-collection among mothers. Mothers (or similar female caregivers) profoundly
influence decisions and preferences about young girls’ vaccine uptake in the Nigerian cultural context. At the
same time, maternal choices about HPV self-collection can be reinforced in discussions with their daughters. In
the proposed study, Actions for Collaborative Community-Engaged Strategies for HPV (ACCESS-HPV), we will
use participatory crowdsourcing methods to drive HPV prevention among mother-daughter dyads.
Crowdsourcing open calls will allow us to identify locally relevant messages and dissemination techniques to
increase uptake of HPV prevention. Then, participatory learning communities will build capacity for community-
led implementation of selected strategies. Informed by social learning theory and the PEN-3 cultural model, our
multi-disciplinary research team proposes the following specific aims: (1) to develop a new combined
campaign to increase HPV vaccination for young girls (ages 9-26) and HPV self-collection for mothers (ages
30-49) using crowdsourcing open calls and participatory learning communities; (2) to determine the
effectiveness of a final combined campaign on uptake of HPV vaccination among young girls/women and HPV
self-collection among their mothers using a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial; (3) to estimate the
impact and cost-effectiveness of the crowdsourced campaign. Our primary outcome will be vaccine uptake
(ascertained by clinic records of vaccine uptake) among young girls and HPV self-collection (ascertained by
laboratory receipt of specimens) among their mothers. The strong support of the Nigerian Institute for Medical
Research (NIMR) alongside national HPV programs creates a rich research infrastructure and increases the
likelihood of successful implementation. Our multi-disciplinary research team has experience organizing
implementation research focused on crowdsourcing and community participation in Nigeria. This study will
enhance our understanding of HPV prevention in resource-constrained settings. This grant application directly
responds to strategic priorities of the United States government, the National Institutes of Health, the National
Cancer Institute, and NOT-CA-20-025."
10756491,"PROJECT SUMMARY
CD8 T cells specific for cancer cells are found within human tumors, but despite their presence, tumors
progress, suggesting that T cells become unresponsive. To design predictably effective
immunotherapies, we must elucidate the mechanisms controlling tumor-specific T cell dysfunction. We
previously demonstrated that T cells in tumors enter an epigenetically encoded dysfunction state that
becomes resistant to therapeutic reprogramming and found that TOX, a DNA-binding protein, is a key
regulator enforcing the dysfunctional state. The factors that drive TOX expression, and how TOX
precisely establishes the dysfunction program remain largely unknown. TCR signal strength impacts T
cell differentiation, and while we know that antigen chronicity is a key driver of TOX-driven T cell
dysfunction, we do not know how signal strength of chronic tumor antigen impacts TOX-driven
dysfunction and amenability to immunotherapeutic reprogramming. In this application, we will determine
how signal strength regulates TOX and TOX-driven dysfunction programs in mouse and human tumors,
ask how TOX induces and maintains dysfunction, and target TOX and its downstream mediators to
uncover the mechanisms underlying dysfunction imprinting. To achieve these goals, we will utilize
clinically relevant genetic cancer mouse models and track T cells longitudinally within progressing tumors
while encountering tumor antigens with varying signal strength. We will employ transcriptomic and
epigenomic methods and innovative protein degradation strategies to determine what controls TOX, how
TOX induces and/or maintains dysfunction, and how TOX downstream mediators regulate the epigenetic
programs associated with plasticity and dysfunction imprinting. We will leverage human neoantigen-
specific tumor-infiltrating T cell resources to understand how TCR signal strength determines TOX-
dependent molecular signatures and functional states of T cells in human tumors. Importantly, we will
test and design strategies to target TOX and TOX downstream mediators to improve cancer
immunotherapy."
10774304,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pediatric and adult disorders of the urethra including hypospadias, trauma, and stricture disease
represent significant health care burdens which require surgical intervention to replace developmentally absent
or damaged tissue to preserve urinary tract function. Autologous tissue grafts derived from extragenital skin
flaps or buccal mucosa are primarily utilized to restore urethral continuity in cases where end-to-end anastomosis
is not feasible. However, these approaches have been associated with adverse side effects including stricture
recurrence, diverticulae and fistula formation. Silk fibroin (SF) biomaterials provide an exceptional combination
of physical characteristics including high tensile strength and elasticity, diverse processing flexibility, controllable
degradability, and low immunogenicity to create “off-the-shelf” scaffolds for treatment of urethral stricture
disease. Novel urethral reconstructive strategies employing bi-layer (BL) SF scaffolds impregnated with SF
hydrogels capable of targeted urethral delivery of stem cell homing factors, MCP1/CCL2 or SDF1α/CXCL12, will
be developed and investigated for their ability to restore normal micturition and promote superior constructive
remodeling in newly developed, large animal models of long urethral strictures in males and females. In this
proposal, we will challenge the overall hypothesis that: composite BLSF matrices loaded with SF hydrogels
capable of controlled release of MCP1/CCL2 or SDF1α/CXCL12 will provide a superior approach for restoring
function of long urethral strictures in comparison to buccal mucosal grafts. The specific aims of the proposal
are: Specific Aim 1: Determine the impact of CXCR4-SDF1α/CXCL12 and CCR2-MCP1/CCL2 signaling axes
on scaffold-mediated, urethral tissue regeneration in a rabbit model of urethral stricture repair. Specific Aim 2:
Create MCP-1/CCL2 and SDF1α/CXCL12 releasing, composite BLSF grafts with the capacity to promote
superior functional urethral regeneration in novel male and female porcine models of long urethral strictures."
10894606,"Title: Deciphering the mechanism of non-canonical cell cycle entry
PROJECT SUMMARY
The decision to enter the cell cycle is a fundamental cellular process that is critical to development and tissue
maintenance, with dysregulation of this process being responsible for the development of cancer. Initiation of
the cell cycle is regulated by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), which is activated by mitogenic signaling.
Activating mutations are commonly found in mitogenic signaling in cancer cells, leading to overactivation of
CDK4/6 and abnormal cell proliferation. Thus, specific CDK4/6 inhibitors show immense promise as treatments
for various types of cancer. In addition to the canonical CDK4/6-dependent pathway, emerging evidence
suggests that mammalian cells can enter the cell cycle in the absence of CDK4/6 activity. Although the
mechanism by which CDK4/6 regulates cell cycle entry is well established, the molecular mechanisms underlying
non-canonical cell cycle entry remain elusive. The objective of the proposed research program is to determine
the mechanisms of the non-canonical pathway for cell cycle entry. Given cell-to-cell heterogeneity and the highly
interconnected regulatory processes of cell cycle entry, elucidating how and when mammalian cells bypass
CDK4/6 and enter the cell cycle is challenging. To overcome these challenges, we will apply live-cell sensors for
CDK activity in combination with our innovative single-cell methodologies. We will also use a variety of
pharmacological and genetic approaches to manipulate potential regulators of non-canonical cell cycle entry.
Our preliminary data point to a theoretical mechanism for non-canonical cell cycle entry that may at first appear
paradoxical: a tumor suppressor gene that is normally inactivated by CDK4/6 is routed for degradation in
response to sustained CDK4/6 inhibition, thereby providing a means for non-canonical cell cycle entry. Moreover,
our preliminary data implicate multiple factors in the regulation of this process, suggesting a dynamic interplay
of factors that further integrates extrinsic and intrinsic signals to control non-canonical cell cycle entry.
Completion of the proposed research will provide new insight into the dynamic regulation of cell cycle entry and
a greater understanding of adaptations to CDK4/6 inhibition in mammalian cells. In addition, as non-canonical
cell cycle entry severely limits the success of CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in cancer, outcomes from the proposed
research have the potential to lead to novel therapeutic interventions targeting the cell cycle in cancer."
10763025,"PROJECT SUMMARY
An intracranial aneurysm (IA) is a bulge or ballooning of the cerebral artery due to weakness in the blood
vessel wall. IA rupture causes subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), the most life-threatening form of stroke.
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IA pathogenesis are poorly understood, which greatly
impedes the identification of therapeutic targets. To date, no pharmacological treatment is available for
IA except for invasive surgical options, such as surgical clipping and endovascular coiling, both of which
are generally associated with high hospitalization costs. Our long-term goal is to elucidate the molecular
mechanisms of IA and develop new therapeutic avenues for this devastating disease. The overall
objective in this application is to determine the role of selective autophagy of endothelial focal adhesion
(FA) in cerebrovascular integrity and IA formation and progression. The central hypothesis is that p62-
VASP interaction is a critical cargo recognition mechanism for selective autophagy of FA (FA-phagy) in
endothelial cells, which impairs cerebrovascular integrity and contributes to IA formation and progression.
The central hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: 1) dissect the molecular mechanisms of FA-
phagy in endothelial cells; and 2) determine the role of endothelial FA-phagy in cerebrovascular integrity
and IA formation and progression. Our proposal is innovative, because we are the first to identify p62-
VASP interaction as a novel cargo recognition mechanism for endothelial FA-phagy, and provide
endothelial FA-phagy as a novel pathogenic mechanism for IA. The proposed research is significant
because we connect selective autophagy to cerebrovascular integrity, which will not only add cutting-
edge knowledge to the selective autophagy field but also provide anti-FA-phagy strategy as a novel
therapy for IA disease or potentially for many other diseases that exhibit the loss of vascular integrity."
10767127,"Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses (GWVI) is a complex constellation of symptoms that have persisted in Gulf War
Veterans (GWV) more than 25 years after their deployment to the Gulf. These symptoms are so diverse, they
baffle diagnostic criteria. As a result, consideration of GWVI as a bona fide illness has progressed slowly from
denial of its existence to the use of such terms as “unexplained illnesses” (used by the VA) and “multisymptom
illness”. The Institute of Medicine Committee on Gulf War and Health (2016) concludes that GWVI is not a
psychosomatic condition and sufficient evidence now exists to conclude that a causal relationship exists
between being deployed to the Gulf War and the health outcomes associated with this disorder. This
Committee noted that little progress has been made in elucidating the pathological mechanisms that underlie
the complex symptoms associated with GWVI and as a result, “it does not appear that a single mechanism can
explain the multitude of symptoms seen in Gulf War Illness, and it is unlikely that a single definitive causal
agent will be identified this many years after the war” (p. 3 of report). Another complexity relating to GWVI is
establishing the toxicant exposure conditions to which GWVs were exposed. Potential agents include depleted
uranium, pyridostigmine bromide (PB), sarin, vaccines, permethrin (PER) and other insecticide repellents,
fuels, infectious diseases, stressors, burn pits and blast exposure. These potential toxicants form the basis for
numerous animal models of GWVI. It is interesting that 3 of the major symptoms of GWVI- GI disruptions,
PTSD/anxiety and chronic fatigue- can be caused individually by a dysbiosis in the gut microbiome, so it is
reasonable to hypothesize that imbalances in the gut microbiome might contribute to these major 3 symptoms
of GWVI collectively, and others as well. We (and others) have shown recently that PER/PB results in a
significant alteration in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome. Our animal model studies of
GWVI-gut microbiome interactions are supported by a BLR&D Merit Award. A significant gap in the
understanding of the pathophysiological underpinnings of GWVI arises from the lack of knowledge of the exact
toxicant exposures. Self-reporting by GWVs is the basis of what is known about exposures, so it is hard to
state with certainty, which agents (single, combinations) and their doses, frequencies and durations led to
GWVI. This is an important point because we are learning that outcomes from animal model studies are
dependent on the specific agent(s) used. One approach that could remove toxicant exposure conditions from
the GWVI equation is the development of a humanized mouse model. In this manner, the GWVs toxicant
exposures are already incorporated into the disorder along with its chronic, persistent symptomology. The
objective of this Pilot Project is to develop a humanized mouse model via fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) from stool samples of GWVs with GWVI into healthy mice. It is predicted that the gut microbiome of
recipient mice will be colonized with that of the GWVI-donor and rapidly express the symptoms of this disorder.
A humanized model of GWVI would incorporate the heterogeneity in symptomology observed in GWVI and
maximize homogeneity in the cohorts of recipient mice. Studies of disease mechanisms, sex-based differences
in symptomology and the testing of therapies not now possible in humans with GWVI would also become
possible. These studies will also provide significant preliminary information to support a full Merit Review
Award submission."
10791760,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The mammalian genome contains four voltage-gated sodium channels that are expressed at high levels in the
central nervous system: SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN3A and SCN8A. This gene family plays an important role in the
etiology of human epilepsy and mutations in each gene are associated with different types of epilepsy. However,
the relationship between altered SCN8A function and epilepsy appears more complex. While we have shown
that mice with loss-of-function Scn8a mutations are more resistant to induced seizures, many de novo gain-of-
function SCN8A mutations have been identified in patients with a range of clinical features including catastrophic
childhood epilepsy, autism, intellectual disability and developmental delay. Individuals with SCN8A mutations
also face an increased risk for sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The mechanisms by which
SCN8A mutations lead to the observed range of clinically challenging features remain poorly understood, and
current therapies are often woefully inadequate. Our central hypothesis is that the development of the most
effective therapy for SCN8A disorders requires a mechanistic understanding of the precise cell types
and brain regions underlying SCN8A pathologies. Our proposal builds on our recent studies in which we
decoupled the cell types, circuits, and regions underlying seizure generation versus seizure resistance due to
Scn8a haploinsufficiency. We will expand on these findings by studying three different SCN8A variants: R850Q
– one of the most severe and recurrent SCN8A mutations, R1620L – a mutation associated with relatively mild
epilepsy, yet intellectual disability and social dysfunction, and N1768D – a mutation associated with epileptic
encephalopathy. We will study the R850Q mutation in Aim 1 by using a conditional knock-in (CKI) mouse line to
enable cell- and region-selective expression of this variant, which until now was not possible to study due to the
severe phenotype and premature lethality when globally expressed in mice. The CKI R850Q line will be used to
establish the contribution of different cell types to the seizure, behavioral, and biophysical phenotypes associated
with SCN8A dysfunction. In Aim 2, we will implement two parallel approaches to guide the identification of more
efficacious SCN8A therapies using pharmacological and cell-specific manipulations in both the R1620L and
N1768D lines, thereby spanning the range of SCN8A clinical presentations. Given the lack of optimized treatment
strategies for patients with SCN8A mutations, we will conduct the first systematic comparison of selected
antiepileptic and candidate drugs for their ability to decrease spontaneous seizures and SUDEP risk, and
normalize behavior. We will also use a chemogenetic approach to further interrogate cell type-specific
contributions to disease mechanisms and establish the therapeutic potential of selectively modulating the
excitability of excitatory neurons, as well as parvalbumin, somatostatin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide-
expressing interneurons. The proposed experiments provide a path towards personalized medicine for SCN8A
patients and a blueprint for treatment development in other neurological disorders."
10753436,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world. Heart failure (HF) develops in
20-30% of patients after myocardial infarction (MI) due to extensive scarring exacerbated by a persistent 2.9-
fold increase of inflammatory macrophages in the infarct borderzone and remote myocardium. Cytokines, such
as Interleukin-10 (IL-10), and cytokine inhibitors, such as Interleukin-1 receptor antagonists (IL-1Ra), are potent
immune modulators that regulate inflammation, reduce infarct size, and improve ventricular function. However,
translation of cytokine therapy to patients has been limited by poor biodistribution, toxicity, and paradoxical pro-
inflammatory responses with sustained administration. Local immunomodulation with cell therapy secretion of
cytokines holds promise, but poor cell survival (<1%) and reduced in vivo potency have remained critical barriers
preventing clinical translation. We have overcome these critical limitations by developing an innovative and
translational cell therapy platform that enables sustained locally administration to the heart after MI. We have
engineered retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells to produce IL-1Ra and IL-10 in a more physiologically relevant
paracrine fashion at high local concentrations without systemic absorption and have encapsulated them in
alginate-based core-shell capsules, shielding them from the host immune system and allowing them to serve as
a regulatable in situ cytokine “factories”. We have demonstrated that local delivery modulates inflammation and
improves outcomes after acute MI. In this proposal, we hypothesize that epicardial implantation of RPE-IL10 and
RPE-IL1Ra will sustain reductions in post-MI chronic inflammation and reverse cardiomyopathic remodeling in
HF. In Aim 1, RPE cell capsule systems will be developed and optimized for sustained 6 month secretion of IL-
10 and IL-1Ra with integration of an apoptotic cell safety switch to cease therapy post-administration. In Aim 2,
these IL-10 and IL-1Ra cytokine factories will be validated as mono- or combination therapies in a chronic post-
MI rat HF model by confirming reduction of the cardiac inflammasome, promotion of reparative macrophage
phenotypes, and reversal of adverse cardiac remodeling. In Aim 3, the ability to titrate and cease therapy post-
implantation in a clinically relevant fashion will be evaluated in a porcine model. Efficacy of RPE therapy will be
tested in a chronic porcine infarct model over 100 days. The proposed work is expected to result in a new immune
modulatory strategy for MI and elucidate mechanisms of cytokine therapy on the cardiac inflammasome.
Importantly, the developed biotechnology will be ready for pre-clinical testing and has translational benefit
beyond cytokines alone, as it can be utilized for a wide range of protein and local drug delivery directly to the
heart."

Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Increased CV risk remains
even if blood pressure (BP) is controlled, suggesting there are additional factors associated with hypertension
(influenced by, but independent of, BP per se), which contribute to adverse CV outcomes. This application
focuses on two potentially interrelated CV pathophysiologic processes: 1) impairment in myocardial oxygen
delivery (manifested as coronary microvascular dysfunction, a known predictor of CV morbidity/mortality) and 2)
impairment in cardiac efficiency (manifested as inefficient coupling of myocardial oxygen consumption and
cardiac work). There are no established treatments for coronary microvascular dysfunction or abnormal
cardiac efficiency—a critical knowledge gap. Individuals with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy
(LVH) have coronary microvascular dysfunction and excess mineralocorticoid receptor activity. Our overall
hypothesis is that, in individuals with hypertension and LVH, mineralocorticoid receptor blockade will improve
coronary microvascular function and cardiac efficiency, independent of changes in BP; and these improvements
will lead to improved myocardial structure and function and ultimately to improved CV outcomes.
We propose a randomized, controlled, basic experimental study involving humans. Men and women with
hypertension and LVH on enalapril (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor) will be randomized to
treatment for 9 months with eplerenone (mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) or chlorthalidone (thiazide-like
diuretic) + potassium. We will use cardiac PET/CT to quantify changes in coronary microvascular function (i.e.
myocardial flow reserve - ratio of stress/rest myocardial blood flow) and cardiac efficiency (i.e. myocardial
external efficiency - ratio of myocardial work to oxygen consumption); echocardiography to assess changes in
myocardial structure and function; and 24-hr BP monitoring.
This study will test the hypothesis that, in patients with hypertension and LVH on ACE inhibition,
treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, as compared with a thiazide-like diuretic,
improves:
 • Coronary microvascular function, i.e., myocardial flow reserve (Specific Aim 1)
 • Cardiac efficiency, i.e., myocardial external efficiency (Specific Aim 2)
We anticipate that improvements in these outcomes will associate with improvements in myocardial structure
and function (peak global longitudinal strain, tissue Doppler mitral annular early diastolic relaxation velocity [e’],
and ratio of mitral E velocity to e’ [E/e’])."

Clinical effectiveness research (CER) plays a central role in research related to emergency medical services for
children (EMSC). It is the conscientious use of the best available evidence in evaluating interventions, broadly
defined as medical treatments, health policies, or practice patterns, which could lead to improvements in health
care quality and patient outcomes. Observational data are more often used in the evaluation of healthcare
systems or complex clinical practice than randomized controlled trials (RCTs), due to practical or ethical reasons.
However, causal inference with observational data faces challenges: (1) Important covariates may be distributed
differently between treatment options; (2) Conventional statistical analysis lacks control for unmeasured
confounding. When the intervention is dichotomous, propensity score based adjustment is widely used to reduce
the confounding bias introduced by observed covariates, through matching, stratification or weighting. Matching
is a popular choice among researchers, as it creates data structures similar to RCTs, is easy to interpret, and
robust to misspecifications in outcome modeling. But there is a critical methodological gap hindering the use of
matching design when there are multiple (more than two) treatment options. This is due to the lack of good
matching algorithms to generate well matched sets and the increased complexity of post-matching inference.
Our overarching goal is to develop a statistically valid matching design (referred to as PMD) and subsequent
causal inference procedures for use with complex observational healthcare databases, where there are multiple
treatment arms or treatments over multiple time points. Specific aims: (1) Devise an innovative PMD for studies
with multiple treatment arms or treatments over time; Develop causal inference strategies for PMD based on the
potential outcome framework and sensitivity analysis strategies for assessing the unmeasured confounding
effect; (2) Evaluate causal mortality impact of severe TBI (sTBI) patients who received trauma care at different
type of trauma centers (PL1-level 1 pediatric, AL1-level 1 adult, and ML1-level 1 mixed trauma centers; PL2-
level 2 pediatric, AL2-level 2 adult, and ML2-level 2 mixed trauma centers); (3) Assess the effectiveness of 4
Tier 1-2 medical management/therapies (ICP monitoring, head CT scan, cerebrospinal fluid drainage,
decompressive craniectomy) on sTBI patient mortality; (4): Evaluate compliance with a Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) head CT guideline for mild TBI (mTBI) patients by different types of hospitals.
This study is expected to fill a critical gap in EMSC research by extending the commonly used dichotomous
matching design to complex observational studies with multiple treatment groups. This project is significant and
our proposed methods are innovative as they include both observed confounding adjustment and unmeasured
confounding assessment. We envision that this general-purpose methodology will be widely applicable and can
benefit government agencies, policy makers, and social and health science researchers, where observational
data are often utilized for comparative outcomes research and program/policy evaluation."

Major advances have been made in mapping the genetic basis of epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental
disorders (NDDs). In many cases, a candidate gene mutation has been identified, but there is no robust
understanding of the neuronal causes for the particular disorder. Mutations in genes encoding chromatin
regulators are commonly identified in human NDDs, with intellectual disability, autism and/or epilepsy often co-
occurring in the same individual. Our recent work showed that mice with germline heterozygous mutations in
Chd2 exhibit pathological changes across genomic, anatomical, electrophysiological and behavioral domains.
Here, we propose studies to bidirectionally control Chd2 dosage in the developing or adult brain. Our approach
involves a combination of sophisticated cellular, molecular, pharmacologic and electrophysiological
approaches in conditional Chd2+/- mice and human-derived neurons. If successful, our results will provide
important new information about the effects of chromatin regulators in driving NDD-associated pathologies in
vivo and would provide critical proof-of-concept for the therapeutic potential of pharmacologically increasing
Chd2 expression that could be rapidly translated into a new targeted therapy for Chd2 haploinsufficiency."

The aims of this proposal are to (1) enable the candidate to further develop her research program focused on
improving advance care planning (ACP) and medical decision making for older adults, particularly historically
marginalized individuals and persons with limited health literacy; (2) expand her research to older persons with
mild cognitive impairment (PMCI) at risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) and
caregivers of PMCI or ADRD; and (3) use her research platform to mentor junior investigators interested in
patient-oriented aging research, both within Geriatrics and other subspecialties. The candidate is a Geriatrician
and Palliative Medicine physician who has established a well-funded, high-impact, independent clinical
research program with an outstanding publication and mentoring record. In the past decade she has
established herself as a successful mentor of students, residents, fellows, and junior faculty who have
published high-impact aging research, become successfully funded, and continue to participate in patient-
oriented research in aging. The candidate has also developed an extensive research portfolio focused on
creating and testing literacy and culturally appropriate health education materials to improve ACP and medical
decision making for marginalized older adults. She developed an expanded ACP paradigm that focuses not
only on one-time treatment decisions, such as for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but also on the
process of preparing patients and caregivers to communicate their wishes and to participate with clinicians in
making complex, in-the-moment medical decisions over time. She operationalized this expanded paradigm into
easy-to-understand, person-centered programs (i.e., PREPARE for YOUR Care for patients and PREPARE for
THEIR Care for caregivers) that use video stories to teach people how to identify and communicate their
medical preferences and to make informed medical decisions. The candidate has received ongoing R01 and
other funding to test the efficacy of these programs in primary care settings. This K24 proposal will provide the
candidate with protected time to expand her research in a new direction. Grounded in implementation science
frameworks and community-engaged research, the candidate will conduct research to adapt the PREPARE
programs with and for PMCI and caregivers and test the acceptability of a new delivery model of online,
livestreaming, facilitated group classes. The candidate will also continue to develop her formal mentoring
program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become
leaders in aging research. She will work with each mentee to establish an individualized career development
plan in which they complete research projects and develop the skills needed to become independent
investigators. These plans will make full use of the outstanding clinical research training environment at the
University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). She will leverage her leadership positions at UCSF and
nationally to recruit mentees interested in aging research, ACP, and marginalized populations."

Psychological distress is prevalent in cancer patients and their informal caregivers (the intimate partners, other
family members, and friends who provide patients with crucial unpaid care and support). Distress has been
linked to poorer adherence to treatment and elevated mortality in patients, as well as negative outcomes for
caregivers. Whether patients or caregivers, women tend to report greater distress than men. Research on
patient-caregiver dyads has shown patients' and caregivers' physical and mental health is often intertwined,
but most prior dyadic work has analyzed predominantly middle-class spousal pairs. Given the persistent effects
of poverty and the longstanding health disparities by socioeconomic status in the United States, it is crucial to
understand the social context of financially vulnerable cancer patients and caregivers. Individual social
needs—including food, housing, or transportation—are associated with distress as well as physical health
outcomes in a range of contexts and populations. A growing body of research has analyzed single social
needs—most commonly food insecurity—among cancer patients in particular, but little is known about multiple
social needs in patients, how needs change over time, and whether the social needs of informal caregivers
affect patient outcomes. This study focuses on female patients with breast and gynecologic cancer—which
together account for over 400,000 newly diagnosed cancers among women annually—and their informal
caregivers. Our aims are: Aim 1. Document unmet social needs in patient-caregiver dyads (N = 300 dyads).
Analyze how needs affect patient and caregiver biopsychosocial outcomes including depressive symptoms
(primary outcome), physical and mental health quality of life, emergency department (E.D.) visits, and
treatment adherence (secondary outcomes). Aim 2. Analyze the experiences of patients and caregivers with
unmet social needs and explore their interest in and preferences for mental health and social needs
intervention. Use semi-structured dyadic interviews with 30 patient-caregiver pairs (N = 60 total participants) in
which one member reports at least one unmet need at baseline to explore participants' use of community
resources, whether they coordinate with the other member of the dyad to resolve unmet social needs, and their
preferences for screening and intervention. Aim 3. Explore the relationship between neighborhood-level
factors (census tract Area Deprivation Index and 2-1-1 helpline requests by ZIP code), social needs, and
depressive symptoms within dyads. This study will provide first-of-its-kind information about the
biopsychosocial effects of unmet social needs among female patients with cancer and their caregivers. A
central question is whether and how caregivers' social needs affect the patient. The answer will help us create
a targeted screening and intervention system to address the mental health and social needs of patients, and, if
warranted, caregivers. Our ultimate goal is to improve outcomes for women with cancer and their caregivers."
10863997,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Although we can readily determine a patient's genotype, we often cannot accurately predict their risk for
disease or ascertain which of many variants of uncertain significance might underlie a pathology. Indeed,
medically relevant phenotypes may emerge from the combination of thousands of polymorphisms. Complicating
matters, the effects of genetic variants are not constant across individuals due to interactions with other variants
in the genome and the environment. This project aims to build a fundamental understanding of which genetic
variants give rise to complex traits and why.
 To do so, we will exploit a unique model system in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which
we have already identified thousands of nucleotides that determine complex traits. These include regulatory
variants that likely influence gene expression and many synonymous variants that, although often regarded as
'silent,' make substantial contributions to phenotype. Reversing typical functional genomics paradigms, we will
examine the molecular consequences of known causal variants to identify the signatures that make them
important to complex traits. We will focus on ascertaining the predictive power of functional measurements (such
as nucleosome position, histone modification, gene expression level, and protein abundance) as a guide to the
application of these technologies to patient- and tissue-specific genomics. In addition to examining these
molecularly diverse linear contributors to phenotype, we will take advantage of a powerful genetic mapping panel
(which contains more individuals than segregating polymorphisms) to begin dissecting the functional basis of
gene ´ environment interactions and genetic background effects in complex traits.
 To chart this atlas of functionally important genetic variation, we will undertake the following specific aims:
 1. Define the molecular impact of functional synonymous variants
 2. Identify signatures of functional regulatory variants
 3. Build integrative genotype-to-molecule-to-phenotype maps
 The inherent complexity of quantitative traits is a daunting problem that grows ever-more challenging with
the growing catalog of variants of uncertain significance in the patient population. Using model systems in which
the genotype-to-phenotype relationship can be comprehensively mapped is a powerful approach for
understanding and building predictive models of which variants are likely to be causal. Indeed, linking changes
in DNA both to their molecular consequences and their effects on cellular phenotypes is a central challenge in
genetics that promises to allow the functional classification of never-before-seen mutations. Our approach will
help to understand the fundamental structure of these relationships, with implications for genome reading and
writing in medicine and biotechnology."

Despite the success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in identifying over 70 susceptibility loci for
Late-onset (LO) Alzheimer’s disease (AD), AD related disease and endophenotypes, it remains challenging to
pinpoint 1) which are truly causal AD variants; 2) the molecular processes that cause AD; and 3) how AD patients
are pathogenically different from each other. Emerging resources for the study of AD genetics, including
sequence, functional genomics and epigenomic data, provide unparalleled opportunity to investigate these
questions at different molecular levels. We propose a multiomics data integration project to characterizes AD
risk for both genetic variants and individual patients, by developing and applying a series of novel computational
approaches using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, variable selection and multivariate analysis, for analyses of
a wide range of existing and novel AD multiomics data. These methods are designed to integrate many genetic
factors — single nucleotide variants, brain tissue molecular traits such as gene expression, alternative splicing,
alternative polyadenylation, methylation, histone acylation and proteomics, and various functional annotations
for coding and non-coding regions — into a coherent framework for discovery of causal AD variants and genes,
and understand patient heterogeneity. Our goals are to 1) combine genetic association evidence from population
and family-based studies of diverse ancestry backgrounds; 2) incorporate functional information to infer putative
causal genetic variants; 3) identify novel molecular traits and QTLs for alternative polyadenylation and
differentially methylated regions in brain tissues; 4) dissect AD association signals using multiple molecular traits
across a comprehensive collection of brain tissues and relevant cell types; and 5) characterize AD patients’ risk
profiles using causal effects at different molecular levels across brain tissues. Our methods and bioinformatics
analyses will be engineered into a high-quality toolbox to also facilitate multiomics studies of other complex
diseases. We will develop fine-mapping methods for family and multi-ancestry data, integrated with thousands
of genomic functional annotations, to identify putative causal variants from whole-genome sequences. We will
develop a new method to generate alternative polyadenylation from RNA-seq data in brain tissues of AD patients
and controls, and fine-map its QTL. We will develop and apply new approaches to fine-map differentially
methylated regions in brains, to colocalize QTLs for dozens of molecular traits with AD, and to identify novel
gene-level associations using predicted molecular traits. Causal effects estimated at variants and gene levels
will be integrated to identify new AD gene-sets and pathways, and to characterize risk profiles for AD patients.
Causal variants and genes discovered from our project will provide insight for development of therapeutic drugs
targeting at specific cellar processes. The multiomics risk profiles built for AD patients will improve clinical trial
designs for AD drug development, paving the path to personalized therapeutics."
10862795,"Very long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs) are non-dietary lipids that are uniquely found
in the retina and just a few other tissues in the human body. These unusual C26-C38 n-3 and n-6 lipids are
synthesized from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) dietary precursors through the action of the
ELOVL4 fatty acid elongase. Enhanced membrane fluidity contributed by LC-PUFAs and VLC-PUFAs is thought
to be essential for the maintenance of the highly curved membrane disks of the photoreceptor outer segments
and to facilitate photoreceptor synaptic transmission. Autosomal dominant mutations in ELOVL4 lead to a form
of Stargardt macular dystrophy (STGD3) that shares many features with dry age-related macular degeneration
(AMD), and we and others have shown that conditional knockouts of rod and cone Elovl4 lead to depletion of
retinal VLC-PUFAs and eventual retinal functional and structural abnormalities in mouse models.
 Although ELOVL4 variants have not been associated with AMD risk, the protective effects of diets high
in lipid precursors of n-3 VLC-PUFAs against STGD3 and AMD led to us to examine the influence of diet on
retinal VLC-PUFA levels and n-3/n-6 ratios in health and disease. We have reported that dietary consumption
of VLC-PUFA precursors strongly influences n-3/n-6 ratios and VLC-PUFA content in normal human retinas and
that VLC-PUFA profiles are distinctly abnormal in AMD donors even outside of the macula. These findings
suggest that abnormalities of VLC-PUFA metabolism are intimately associated with macular degeneration and
that strategies to increase VLC-PUFA levels by supplementation could help slow the degeneration process.
 Surprisingly, the obvious therapeutic intervention of bypassing local retinal synthesis of VLC-PUFAs by
administering preformed VLC-PUFAs exogenously had never been tried in living organisms because, until
recently, there have never been adequate supplies of these lipids to perform these experiments, even in mice.
Although synthesis of VLC-PUFAs has been reputed to be very difficult, we initiated a collaboration with lipid
chemistry specialists at the University of Utah who developed improved schemes that allow for straightforward
scale-up to produce sufficient quantities of pure n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs (unlabeled, fluorinated, or deuterated)
for animal studies and even eventual human trials. We have generated exciting initial data that show that an
orally administered synthetic VLC-PUFA (32:6 n-3) is selectively targeted to the retina and the RPE after acute
and chronic gavage feeding in mice and that wild-type mice and a mouse model of VLC-PUFA dysfunction show
functional improvements in their ERGs and visual performance. With our unique access to sufficient quantities
of an array of n-3 and n-6 VLC-PUFAs, we are eager to continue to test our fundamental hypothesis that VLC-
PUFAs are key compounds for the maintenance of photoreceptor function in the retina in both health and disease
states. We will do this by more fully exploring the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of exogenous
VLC-PUFAs in the retina and RPE in novel animal models, in cell culture, and in model membranes."

Physical integrity of epithelial tissue is established and maintained by the cytoskeletal network which integrates
cells into their environment with other neighboring cells and the extracellular matrix. In particular, keratin
intermediate filament proteins ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells are responsible for the structural
integrity of epithelial tissues and recently emerged as a driver of collective cell migration. Yet, unlike actin,
understanding of keratin force-sensing is still very limited. We discovered that the keratin network responds to
externally applied physical forces by recruiting cten, a protein known to act as both a tumor suppressor and
promoter in a tissue-specific manner. Emerging evidence indicates that more proteins are recruited to the
force-bearing keratin fibers, suggesting that the keratin network may serve as a critical hub for
mechano-transduction. The overall premise of this application is that discovering the basic mechanisms and
functions of keratin-based mechano-sensing will contribute to the understanding of how the cell senses forces.
Our goal is to determine the force-dependent protein interactome surrounding the keratin network in epithelial
cells and how keratin-mediated mechano-transduction impacts cell behavior. To resolve force-sensitive
protein-protein interactions, we will inscribe proximal proteins by in situ promiscuous biotin labeling while cells
are being physically stimulated. Newly identified candidates will be tested to verify their force-dependent co-
localization with keratin filaments in live cells and in vitro, and analyzed for their roles in transcriptional
regulation, cell integrity maintenance, and collective cell migration. Our approach will reveal the comprehensive
list of keratin-associated proteins in the presence or absence of external forces and, for the first time, resolve
the force-dependent regulation of the keratin network and its physiological implications."
10837883,"More than 200,000 women are diagnosed with endometriosis every year and over half of those women
do not receive a definitive diagnosis until 8.5 years after the onset of symptoms and many times when
they present with additional comorbidities. While several studies have suggested that genomic markers,
environmental risk factors and inflammatory markers play crucial roles in endometriosis symptomatology,
there are no effective tools available to predict an individual's risk of developing endometriosis or to
predict its downstream effects. The long-term goal is to develop effective and non-invasive early
screening tools to identify patients at risk of developing endometriosis and predict long-term effects. The
main objective of this project is the development of models to predict the risk of endometriosis across
varied clinical manifestations and associated long-term health outcomes. Our central hypothesis is that
integrative risk models will successfully identify patients at risk of developing endometriosis and
associated diseases that occur either concurrently with endometriosis (reproductive age) or after
endometriosis development (long-term health outcomes), enabling early diagnosis and prevention. This
general hypothesis will be tested via the following specific aims:(1) Develop an integrative risk model to
predict patients at high risk of developing endometriosis; (2) Develop an integrative risk model combining
genetic and nongenetic risk factors to predict clinical manifestations among women with endometriosis ;
(3) Create a lifelong chronological map of endometriosis to identify individuals at risk of developing
associated comorbidities. In aim 1, we will integrate genetic and non-genetic risk factors extracted from
Electronic Health Records in linear and non-linear fashion to generate an EndoRisk model. In aim 2, we
will generate a catalog of additional risk factors linked to various clinical manifestations of endometriosis
and develop risk model for varied manifestations. In aim 3, we will evaluate mediating risk of
endometriosis on associated comorbidities and develop a mediator risk prediction model for concomitant
conditions and long-term health outcomes. At the successful completion of the proposed research, the
expected outcomes will be rigorously evaluated non-invasive computational methods for screening and
diagnosing endometriosis across various clinical manifestations and its long-term effects based on
genetic and non-genetic factors. The proposed research is innovative because our novel methodology
for integrated risk models will have immediate translational implications. These results will provide a
strong basis for future development of strategies for improving patient outcomes and translating the
knowledge to clinical practice by providing support for identifying patients at high, moderate, and mild
risk of endometriosis, which is expected to have a significant impact on women suffering from
endometriosis or its long-term effects by tailoring personalized treatments based on their relative risk."

The United States is experiencing a maternal health crisis, with high rates of severe maternal morbidity (SMM)
and other pregnancy-related health problems and rising rates of pre-pregnancy health conditions. Furthermore,
a legacy of structural racism and discrimination has led to substantial and persistent racial disparities in SMM
and other adverse maternal health outcomes. In addition to the health impact on women, maternal morbidity
imposes substantial cost burdens on families and society. Social determinants of health play a significant role
in maternal health, with economically disadvantaged women having lower access to care, increased exposure
to health risks, and poorer health outcomes before and during pregnancy. Yet there is very limited
understanding of whether economic policies aimed at increasing incomes of families can be part of an effective
strategy for improving maternal health and reducing disparities. Researchers have estimated that implementing
a $15 federal minimum wage (MW) by 2025, as is currently being debated in Congress, would increase the
earnings of 32 million workers and lift nearly four million people out of poverty. Because they are
overrepresented among lower wage workers, women and people of color could disproportionately benefit. This
study examines the role of the MW as a potentially powerful tool for addressing the maternal health crisis in the
U.S. In lieu of any federal MW changes since 2009, many states have taken the lead in implementing their own
MW increases, with 30 states having higher MW rates than the 2019 federal rate, compared to only 10 in 2010.
Although these changes are likely consequential for lower-income and minority women, there is scant evidence
on how the MW affects their reproductive and maternal health. Moreover, as the labor market impacts of MW
are not uniform across populations, assessing potential heterogeneity is critical for quantifying effects on
maternal health disparities. The overall objective of this project is to assess how state MW policies affect
maternal health, as well potentially important intermediate outcomes that may lie on the causal pathway. Our
multidisciplinary team will leverage recent methodological advances in the quasi-experimental evaluation of
staggered policy interventions to estimate causal effects of MW increases on SMM and other pregnancy-
related outcomes. We will also explore important outcomes that represent potential intermediary mechanisms
linking MW to maternal morbidity outcomes, including changes in household income and employment, health
care coverage, health care utilization, health behaviors, and pre-pregnancy health outcomes. Finally, we will
examine how the MW affects health care costs associated with pregnancy and delivery. Throughout, we will
explore potential heterogeneous effects to better understand how MWs affect health disparities. This research
addresses a critically important and potentially very impactful policy-relevant question that has significant
implications for mothers, their children, and their families."

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), a chronic lipoprotein-driven inflammatory disorder, is the leading
cause of death worldwide. Conventional lipid-lowering therapies only modestly lower cardiovascular risk in the
population due to “residual risk,” thought to be caused by excessive inflammation. Emerging evidence shows
that the interruption of inflammation resolution, an active tissue repair process, is a key mechanism that
contributes to atherosclerotic plaque progression. Therefore, identifying novel targets that mediate both
inflammation and resolution is crucial for developing cardiovascular therapeutic strategies that can both boost
resolution and prevent inflammation. As endocytic trafficking is an essential cellular process that regulates
macrophage function, we have focused on the role of C-terminal Eps15 homology domain-containing (EHD)
family proteins, the key conductors of endocytic trafficking in the immune response of macrophages. The publicly
available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of macrophage populations in both human and murine
atherosclerotic plaques reveal that EHD1 is selectively expressed in inflammatory lesional macrophages
compared with other EHD proteins, and our new study shows that EHD1 levels are increased in lesional
macrophages from both human and murine plaques as atherosclerosis progresses. These data support an
overall proatherogenic role for EHD1 and underscore its relevance to human disease. The overall objective of
this proposal is to study the role and the underlying mechanisms of EHD1 in inflammation and resolution in the
context of atherosclerosis. Our data suggest that EHD1 impairs inflammation resolution by inducing the
ectodomain cleavage of MerTK, an efferocytosis receptor required for timely resolution of inflammation, and aids
inflammation by promoting macrophage polarization toward a proinflammatory phenotype. Moreover, we have
established a novel link between EHD1 and sortilin, a human genetic risk factor for CVD, by showing that EHD1
silencing decreases sortilin protein levels. The ectodomain of MerTK is cleaved by the metalloproteinase
ADAM17, and our preliminary data show that EHD1 enhances ADAM17 on the cell surface, where shedding
takes place. Hence, we will test our hypothesis that EHD1 promotes ADAM17 recycling to the cell surface, which
leads to MerTK cleavage, defective efferocytosis, impaired inflammation resolution, and plaque necrosis (Aim
1). As autophagy is well known to suppress polarization of proinflammatory macrophages and we found that
EHD1 suppresses autophagy, we hypothesize that EHD1 promotes proinflammatory macrophage polarization
by suppressing autophagy, leading to inflammatory plaque progression (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate
whether EHD1 stabilizes sortilin and induces inflammatory cytokine secretion by facilitating retrograde transport
of sortilin (Aim 3). By exploring the role of EHD1 in atherosclerosis, we hope to bring to the forefront an important
new concept regarding EHD1-mediated intracellular trafficking in plaque progression, one that could provide the
basis for novel therapeutic strategies to prevent CVD."

Pediatric chronic non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is an inflammatory ocular disease that has a substantial risk for
sight-threatening complications. Methotrexate (MTX) is the preferred first line systemic treatment for all subtypes
of NIU given its overall safety and affordability. However, MTX failure is as high as 50%. Biologic drugs are
reserved for those who fail MTX. The long delays waiting for therapeutic effect leads to prolonged glucocorticoid
use and continued accrual of ocular damage. As MTX may not be the appropriate first line treatment for all
subtypes of NIU, identifying predictors of MTX responsiveness will allow expeditious initiation of biologic
therapies. Our long-term goal is to prevent sight-threatening damage in children with NIU by initiating early
effective treatment that controls inflammation quickly.
This investigation is a longitudinal translational study that is a collaborative effort consisting of experts in
rheumatology, ophthalmology, ocular imaging, immunology and biostatistics. The objectives of this study are: 1)
To identify baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging features in children with NIU that correlate
with response to MTX; 2) To assess the value of adding quantitative imaging modalities to monitor response to
MTX in children with NIU; and 3) To discover gene expression signatures that predict response and non-
response to MTX in children with NIU. A total of 120 children who are starting MTX for NIU will be enrolled in all
aims and followed prospectively at 3 and 6 months. Children will undergo serial clinical ophthalmic examinations
and imaging by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), ultrawide field fluorescein
angiography (UWFFA), and OCT to assess MTX response. Aim 1 will identify the combination of variables at
baseline that predict a patient’s risk of response by 6 months. Aim 2 will assess the use of quantitative imaging
to evaluate and monitor MTX response over 6 months. These modalities will also be compared to the clinical
examination. In Aim 3, 20 pediatric non-uveitic controls will also be included. This aim is designed to discover
gene expression signatures that are associated with clinical and imaging based MTX response and non-
response. The success of this study will 1) optimize treatment of children with NIU by allowing earlier initiation
of biologics in those unlikely to respond to MTX, 2) demonstrate the clinical usefulness of quantitative imaging
in therapeutic decision-making, and 3) eventually shift the current treatment standard of NIU leading to improved
ocular health of children."

Racial and ethnic minority communities experience poorer outdoor air quality and face greater burdens of lung
disease, particularly from asthma. The close proximity of minority neighborhoods to both fixed and mobile air
pollution sources combined with the disproportionate burden of asthma morbidity among these populations
supports the overarching hypothesis that racial and ethnic disparities in asthma are caused by urban
planning policies that result in exposure to more toxic sources of air pollution (AP). We propose the
following Specific Aims to test this hypothesis: 1) To characterize AP sources, estimate AP concentrations, and
examine their associations with neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics across the State of Texas. 2)
To identify the AP sources that contribute to racial and ethnic childhood asthma disparities. 3) To explore the
effects of zoning and gentrification on the distribution of AP sources across neighborhoods in Travis County.
Evidence supporting this hypothesis would constitute a major advance by (1) identifying AP sources that
contribute directly to childhood lung health disparities and (2) linking urban planning decisions to inequities in
the location of AP sources. The proposed work would fill a critical evidence gap needed to develop new
approaches to AP regulation and urban planning, which would be strongly positioned to meaningfully reduce
lung health health disparities."
10808955,"The US is in the midst of an opioid epidemic with rates of opioid-related morbidity and mortality so high they
are decrementing average US life expectancy. The current need in the US for OUD treatment far exceeds the
number of available treatment slots and treatment access is further complicated by the fact that not all patients
respond in a similar way to our current OUD pharmacotherapies. We are experts in the measurement and
evaluation of opioid withdrawal symptoms, the evaluation of novel medications for OUD treatment, and the
assessment of individual differences in response to opioid medications. We recently conducted an analysis of
a larger RCT that suggested patients could be classified into HIGH and LOW withdrawal phenotypes that were
associated with the participant’s clinical response to OUD treatment medications in the subsequent RCT. This
R01 will follow up on promising preliminary data we have published that suggests there are clinically-
meaningful human opioid withdrawal phenotypes. We propose to conduct a rigorous, highly controlled human
laboratory + spontaneous withdrawal study to verify and investigate these phenotypes. These data will
advance opportunities for phenotype-driven opioid withdrawal management. We will enroll equal numbers of
men and women who have OUD into a residential study. Participants will be stabilized onto an opioid agonist
for a brief period, during which they will complete two naloxone challenges with a placebo or the OUD
medication lofexidine, before beginning a clinical lofexidine-assisted taper and subsequent transition to the
relapse prevention medication naltrexone. Primary aim 1 will identify opioid withdrawal phenotypes. We
hypothesize that participants will separate into two latent classes that will be consistent with expressing a
HIGH or LOW opioid withdrawal phenotype. Primary aim 2 will determine the degree to which naloxone
challenge phenotype is associated with withdrawal during the subsequent clinical taper. We
hypothesize that phenotype class during the naloxone challenge will be significantly associated with SOWS
AUC values during the taper. Secondary Aim 1 will identify behavioral and physiological correlates of
opioid withdrawal severity. We hypothesize that participants who experience varying levels of opioid
withdrawal will show differences in behavioral (Subaim 1) or physiological (Subaim 2) correlates. Secondary
Aim 2 will determine role of sex in withdrawal expression. We hypothesize that men and women will have
different withdrawal severity (Aim 1), that withdrawal from the naloxone challenge session will correspond with
withdrawal during the clinical taper in men and women (Aim 2), and that men and women will have different
behavioral and physiological correlates with opioid withdrawal severity (Secondary Aim 1). Replicating our
previous results by confirming presence of an opioid withdrawal phenotype will help advance personalized
medicine approach to OUD, and understanding factors contributing to withdrawal severity (independent of
phenotype) in men and women will expand opportunities for new medication development more broadly."

The neurodegenerative disorder, fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), initially described by
us in 2001, is still considered a male-dominant disorder, with the second, normal X chromosome in females
diminishing neuronal toxicity of the premutation (55 to 200 CGG repeats). Women with FXTAS do have lower
penetrance and less severe tremor and ataxia compared to men; however, against expectations for an X-
linked disorder, females with FXTAS have the preponderance of neuropsychiatric problems, which include pain
symptoms and anxiety, and immune/inflammatory involvement. Our principal objective for the next project
period is to characterize the preFXTAS and FXTAS phenotypes in women compared to men and to assess the
role of neuropsychiatric and autoimmune problems and their molecular underpinnings in the initiation and
progression of FXTAS. Our central hypothesis is that the RNA-toxicity mechanism that underlies the male-
predominant motor dysfunction in FXTAS also drives the well-known susceptibility of females to develop both
psychiatric and immune-related problems. We hypothesize that RNA toxicity and consequent enhanced
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation are likely to amplify the intrinsic pro-inflammatory state in females,
particularly in those females with pain, where IL6 and TNFα are generally enhanced. During the proposed
project period, we will assess the role of autoimmune, neuropsychiatric, and pain disorders in women with
preFXTAS and FXTAS and determine how this relates to the development and progression of FXTAS. The
clinical phenotype including MRI studies will be assessed under Aim 1. The molecular aspects of these
mechanisms will be addressed under Aim 2. Under Aim 3, we will carry out a detailed correlation analysis of
the interrelationship between the clinical features, their possible molecular underpinnings, and their roles on
rates of progression and severity of FXTAS in males and females. In addition, under Aim 3, we will provide an
initial assessment of the relationship between the clinical features of FXTAS and comorbid conditions, such as
parkinsonism, that are common in carriers. Thus, our ongoing Genotype-Phenotype project will continue to
follow the largest known clinical cohort of premutation carriers with FXTAS, focusing particularly on females for
whom knowledge of phenotypes is more limited. Progression will be assessed every two years through
evaluation of various clinical domains, including medical and neurological testing, quantitative motor testing of
tremor and ataxia, neuropsychological testing of executive function and memory, psychiatric evaluation, and
MRI studies. For each of these clinical domains, progression of symptoms and pathology are quantified; our
preliminary data show that while males progress twice as fast as females in motor dysfunction, females have
twice the penetrance of psychopathology and progress faster in anxiety and depression. Such data will lead to
a better understanding of the natural history of FXTAS in both females and males, and such quantification
efforts will lead to improved outcome measures for future clinical trials and earlier treatments."
10737709,"Several findings suggest that a deficit in deep sleep (stage N3) with increased age impairs
ongoing memory consolidation possibly contributing to the memory decline of mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). Furthermore, impaired N3 sleep also causes inadequate excretion of beta
amyloids and tau protein, which over many years of poor sleep may contribute to the long term
neural degeneration leading to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The evidence to date implies a
vicious circle: the buildup of neurotoxins impairs the slow wave stage of deep sleep, and the
degree of sleep deficit appears to predict the buildup of neurotoxins and thus progression to AD
[1]. The present project will create the Neurosom® Electric Sleep Therapy (NEST) system to
allow researchers to conduct TES studies to improve sleep in seniors with MCI in their home
setting. The system includes a simple battery-operated bluetooth headband for
electroencephalography (EEG) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES), linked with a
powerful bedside nanocomputer for sleep EEG analysis and machine learning classification of
sleep stages. Communication with cloud services provides support for data analysis, memory
assessment, and reporting to the patient and physician. By implementing and testing the NEST
system in the home environment, this project will provide cost-effective tools for monitoring
physiologic and behavioral measures sleep quality at home. In addition, it will allow researchers
to develop TES protocols for manipulating sleep neurophysiology, such as synchronizing sleep
spindles and the slow oscillations of N3 sleep in at-risk populations. Although our focus is on
TES to extend N3 sleep, the EEG headband assessment will also provide definitive sleep
quality outcome measures to evaluate various approaches to sleep therapy in seniors with MCI,
including: sleep hygiene, improved exercise, Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Insomnia, and new
pharmacologic agents. The realistic goal from this project is improve the quality of sleep and
memory function in older persons with MCI. If it proves feasible to improve sleep over many
years, the more ambitious goal could be to delay or even avoid the onset of dementia in millions
of healthy seniors. To provide preliminary data on this long-range goal, the Phase II trial will
include serial plasma measures of beta amyloid excretion (AB40, AB42) to test the hypothesis
that improved deep sleep may improve glymphatic clearance of toxic metabolites."

This proposal seeks support for the conference on Network Biology, to take place March/April
2021 to 2025, at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). This meeting, held in biannual
rotation on the CSHL campus in New York, brings together senior and junior scientists from
both experimental and computational laboratories with common interests in network biology.
The meeting will emphasize new discoveries and provide an open forum for the presentation of
the latest research and results on molecular networks and their relevance to normal and
abnormal cellular physiology. It will be essential for advancing knowledge in all aspects of the
network modeling process, from data generation in experimental cell biology to data analysis
and computer simulation and from the development and validation of network models describing
these data to biological inferences made from the models. The conference will include platform
sessions on interaction networks, signaling and network dynamics, regulatory networks,
computational tools, artificial intelligence and big data, multi-scale networks, networks and
disease, networks in differentiation, microbiome networks, network evolution, synthetic
networks, network engineering and networks beyond biology though the exact program for the
meeting will be assembled after the abstract submission deadline in February 2021 and adapted
to ongoing developments in the field in subsequent years. This conference will include
significant components designed to facilitate the active participation of younger scientists such
as selection of platform speakers on the basis of the scientific merit of their submitted abstracts
as well as poster presentations, round tables, lightning talks and poster prizes. Distinguished
speakers will also be invited to give platform talks and interact with more junior scientists. The
intimate environment at CSHL fosters social interactions and active participation by all. The
majority of participants to the previous CSHL Network Biology meeting expressed that they
were “very satisfied”. Speakers' panels have consisted of at least 50% women; the gender
balance will be maintained in future meetings. In the 2019 iteration of the meeting, a panel
discussion was established to address the challenges of Women in Network Science. We will
continue to address big community challenges though panel discussions in this meeting. In
2021, we will discuss Applicability and Translatability of Network Biology with panelists including
network biologists whose work is deeply influential throughout the ongoing covid-19 pandemic."
10749028,"The proposed research is focused on innovative instrumentation that will enable fundamental advances in the
field of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) NMR at high magnetic fields, making this powerful technique far
more readily available and useful to the national and international biomedical research communities. In DNP
NMR, a high frequency microwave source is used to irradiate electron - nuclear transitions, thereby transferring
the high spin polarization in the electron spin reservoir to the nuclear spin system through hyperfine and dipolar
interactions. The resulting enhancements in NMR signals dramatically reduce data acquisition times, and thus
DNP NMR is now considered a major advance in NMR spectroscopy. Recently, new biological insights were
obtained using DNP on highly complex systems like HIV-1 capsid proteins, needle-like structures from bacterial
secretion systems or in-cell proteins. In DNP experiments at the high magnetic fields where contemporary NMR
research is conducted, the required microwave frequency is in the terahertz (THz) regime: 460 GHz, 527 GHz
and 593 GHz for g=2 electrons at 700 MHz, 800 MHz and 900 MHz 1H NMR frequencies respectively. However,
the enhancement in the DNP NMR signal falls off rapidly with increasing magnetic field and correspondingly
increasing microwave frequency. Time domain DNP techniques such as Nuclear Orientation via Electron Spin
Locking (NOVEL), Time Optimized (TOP) DNP and the Integrated Solid Effect (ISE) do not fall off with increasing
magnetic field and are thus very attractive at high magnetic fields. However, these techniques are currently
limited to low magnetic field NMR spectrometers due to the lack of the high power, pulsed THz sources and
instrumentation required to perform pulsed DNP experiments at high magnetic field. NOVEL requires large Rabi
frequencies (>10 MHz) in pulses of a few nanoseconds. The required power levels are in the kilowatt range and
are further exacerbated by the poor electromagnetic field coupling into the sample in the present-day magic
angle spinning (MAS) sample holders. Our pioneering research will provide the instrumentation needed for high
magnetic field DNP NMR by developing pulsed gyrotron oscillators capable of generating > 5 kW output power
at 460 GHz and higher. We will also develop a laser driven semiconductor switch that will be used to form the
nanosecond scale pulses needed for NOVEL experiments. For TOP DNP, we will use reflection of the gyrotron
output to produce the required train of nanosecond scale pulses. We will demonstrate a frequency swept gyrotron
source by using fast voltage control of the gyrotron’s electron gun to meet the requirements of ISE experiments.
The proposed research will use available gyrotron magnets, power supplies and a 460 GHz DNP NMR
spectrometer to speed up the research and reduce costs. The efficacy of these techniques will be demonstrated
in DNP NMR experiments at 460 GHz using an available spectrometer. Collectively, these advances will help
make DNP/NMR at high magnetic field a far more accessible and useful tool in modern biochemistry research."

Cancer screening for the right patients at the right level of cancer risk can save lives, but over the last several
years many expert groups have de-intensified mammography screening recommendations because of
evidence of net harm for certain populations. Newer recommendations for mammography screening highlight a
tailored approach based on age and risk and comorbidities, aiming to minimize harms and reach women who
could benefit the most. For example, according to the United States Preventive Services Task Force
guidelines, women age 40-49 should talk with their doctor and make an informed choice about whether to
initiate screening. The change in emphasis from strongly promoting annual mammograms for all women over
40 to promoting informed choice in this age group constitutes a medical reversal, in the sense that this new
message is very different from past messages and people’s expectations. Moreover, the recommendation for
informed choice can elicit negative reactions in some women. Many women express disbelief when told about
overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which are significant harms of screening. The notion of risk-based
screening—that is, creating a screening plan tailored to a woman’s objective cancer risk—can raise suspicions
of healthcare rationing. The result is a delicate situation in which there is need to convey the evidence to
women so they can make an informed choice, but also a need to do it in a way that maintains credibility and
trust despite this health message reversal. In this research we focus on four types of concerning responses
that women may express in reaction to mammography evidence: Reactance (i.e. perceived manipulation or
influence, e.g. “this is trying to ration healthcare”), self-Exemption (e.g., “this doesn’t apply to me”), Disbelief
(e.g., “you can’t believe all the research anyway”), and Source derogation (e.g., “I don’t trust this source”),
which we shorten to REDS. This research will identify affective and cognitive predictors of these reactions, and
identify the consequences of these reactions for screening preferences and shared decision-making. In Aim 1
we will conduct a nationally representative survey of women age 40-49 and test affective and cognitive
predictors of REDS reactions and consequences for screening intentions. In Aim 2 we will conduct a
longitudinal survey and identify how women’s attitudes toward the evidence predicts shared decision making
for mammography in an upcoming primary care appointment, and we will also examine how these attitudes
change over time and are influence by women’s broader social environment. In Aim 3, we will conduct
interviews and focus groups to identify strategies for communicating more effectively about screening, to avoid
negative REDS responses, and promote positive responses like empowerment and desire for shared decision
making. We will modify an existing mammography decision aid to incorporate these improvements, and then
conduct randomized pilot tests of these improvements to provide preliminary evidence that they reduce REDS
and improve women’s positive responses to mammography evidence."
10760330,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Defined by low platelet count in the absence of any other cause, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
affects over 4,000 US children and 8,000 adults each year. While the majority of ITP cases resolve
themselves, patients with ITP have an enhanced risk of bleeding, with 10% experiencing major bleeding, and
0.5% of experiencing life-threatening intracranial hemorrhage. There is no biomarker for ITP or much less,
bleeding risk, and all treatments involve significant side effects. This leaves clinicians with a significant
dilemma in deciding whether or not to treat. Patients who are ultimately at high risk may not receive treatment
until serious bleeding occurs, and low risk patients may be exposed to unnecessary treatment side effects.
The research objective of this proposal is to investigate a novel hypothesis, namely, that the contractile force of
individual platelets correlates with bleeding phenotype in ITP, independent of traditionally used biological
markers or assays of hematological function. Using a newly developed high-throughput platelet contraction
cytometer (PCC) to measure single platelet contractile forces in parallel, our latest results of a study of
pediatric patients with primary ITP suggests that platelet forces 1) vary significantly from healthy controls,
2) strongly correlate with bleeding (n=49 patients) and 3) change over time in the same patient (n=7). Using an
average force cutoff value of 26nN, we found that low forces identified bleeding in ITP with 100% sensitivity
and 89.4% specificity, with a specificity improvement to 94% when only considering patients with a platelet
count <40,000 uL. Aim 1 builds on this preliminary data and proposes a rigorous investigation into the
relationship between contractile force, platelet characteristics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes by
studying a cohort of newly enrolled ITP patients (n=100) at a single time point and prospectively for 12 months.
We will specifically see if platelet contractile force correlates with bleeding score, immature platelet fraction,
platelet activation, platelet morphology, patient demographics, treatments, and time to resolution.
The PCC also offers a unique opportunity to gain new insights into the function of platelets from patients with
ITP and mechanistic underpinnings of low force. Previous studies were hindered as traditional tools of platelet
function such as aggregometry, platelet functional analyzers, or thromboelastography are confounded by the
low platelet count in ITP. We will use the PCC to test our hypothesis that both intrinsic platelet changes and
extrinsic plasma factors modify platelet contractile force. From an extrinsic perspective, our data has shown
that IgG correlates with more severe bleeding and lower contractile forces, and furthermore that incubating
platelets in non-autologous plasma leads to lower contractile forces. From an intrinsic perspective, we have
found that patients with low mean platelet volume have lower platelet force and increased bleeding. As the
mechanistic underpinnings are unclear, Aim 2 seeks to perform systemic, unbiased investigation into both the
intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may modulate platelet function."
10930805,"Project Summary
 Organisms that reproduce sexually utilize a specialized cell division program called meiosis to reduce their
chromosome number by half to generate haploid gametes. Proper execution of this process is crucial for a
successful pregnancy, since errors in meiotic chromosome segregation result in aneuploidy (incorrect
chromosome number in the embryos), the leading known cause of miscarriages and birth defects in humans.
Meiosis in females is especially error prone and this vulnerability has a profound impact on human health: it is
estimated that 10-25% of human embryos are chromosomally abnormal, and the vast majority of these defects
arise from problems with the female meiotic cells (called oocytes). However, despite the importance of female
meiosis for successful reproduction and human health, surprisingly little is known about the mechanisms that act
to ensure accurate chromosome partitioning in oocytes.
 Oocytes have some special features that necessitate the use of novel cell division mechanisms. Perhaps
most significantly, oocytes lack centrosomes, which define and organize the spindle poles in other cell types;
therefore, spindles in these cells are morphologically distinct. Using C. elegans as a model, we previously found
that acentrosomal oocyte spindles have a surprising organization; chromosomes are ensheathed by microtubule
bundles that run along their sides, making lateral contacts, instead of forming end-on kinetochore attachments.
Moreover, we also defined new mechanisms that facilitate chromosome congression on these spindles, driven
by movement of chromosomes along these lateral bundles. Therefore, our work has revealed a new strategy
utilized by C. elegans oocytes for controlling chromosome dynamics during cell division.
 Building on these discoveries, the goals of the proposed work are to: 1) deepen our understanding of these
unique mechanisms, and 2) identify factors that regulate them. An important component of this system is a
complex of proteins that form a ring structure around the center of each chromosome pair (the “ring complex”).
Our work will therefore delve into the functions of this ring complex, to reveal mechanisms essential for proper
acentrosomal spindle organization and chromosome dynamics. These approaches will enable us to gain a
mechanistic understanding of oocyte meiosis, an important yet poorly understood form of specialized cell
division."

This R01 proposal aims to test the efficacy of a tele-cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention as a novel
treatment paradigm for body image-related distress (BID) among head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors,
examine it’s underlying mechanism of change, and characterize factors affecting its future adoption into clinical
practice. Treatment of HNC results in substantial life-altering morbidity related to disfigurement, challenges
speaking, and difficulty swallowing. As a result, 75% of HNC survivors express body image concerns and 28%
meet criteria for BID. BID is a source of devastating psychosocial morbidity, as HNC survivors with BID have a
six-fold increase in depression, high rates of social isolation, decreased quality of life (QOL), and a 2-fold higher
rate of suicide mortality relative to other cancer survivors. To date, evidence-based strategies to manage HNC-
related BID are lacking. To address this gap, we developed BRIGHT (Building a Renewed ImaGe after Head &
neck cancer Treatment), a 5-session manualized tele-CBT intervention based on a transactional coping model
of HNC-related BID. Findings from our single-arm and pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed that
BRIGHT was feasible, acceptable, and resulted in a statistically and clinically significant reduction in BID relative
to dose- and delivery-matched controls at 1- and 3-month follow-up. Our preliminary data suggest that BRIGHT
reduces HNC-related BID by enhancing adaptive body image coping skills (reducing avoidance, increasing
positive rational acceptance [i.e., rational appearance related self-talk]). Based on these promising preliminary
efficacy and mechanistic data, we propose a multi-site RCT in which HNC survivors with clinically significant BID
(N=180) will be randomized to BRIGHT or attention control (AC), a manualized tele-supportive care intervention
that controls for time, professional attention, and common factors. HNC survivors will complete measures of
HNC-related BID, psychological and social well-being, QOL, and measures of theory-derived mechanisms of
change underlying CBT. We will conduct semi-structured interviews and in-depth site visits to develop an
implementation toolkit to enhance the adoption of BRIGHT into clinical care. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the
efficacy of BRIGHT relative to AC on (a) HNC-related BID and (b) psychological and social well-being and QOL.
Specific Aim 2 will examine the mechanism of change underlying BRIGHT for HNC-related BID. Specific Aim
3 will characterize key determinants that will affect the future adoption of BRIGHT into routine clinical practice.
Findings from our study may support BRIGHT as the first evidence-based strategy to manage BID among HNC
survivors, thereby developing new standards of care and improving psychosocial morbidity and QOL in this
population. Theory-driven mechanism of change data may help identify specific therapeutic elements to optimize
the effectiveness of CBT for BID as well as advance our understanding of the underlying theory of CBT. Finally,
findings may enhance the implementation of psychosocial interventions for cancer survivors in diverse settings."

Staphylococcus aureus is a problematic human bacterial pathogen, which is broadly resistant to b-lactam
antibiotics. This resistance is inducible and is conferred by a set of genes that encode a b-lactam antibiotic
sensor/signal transducer protein, a gene repressor and two resistance determinants (the BlaZ b-lactamase and
a unique penicillin-binding protein designated as PBP2a). A key feature of these processes is the recognition
of the antibiotic by the b-lactam sensor/signal transduce BlaR, an integral membrane protein. Recognition of
the antibiotic by the sensor domain of BlaR unleashes conformational changes through the membrane, which
lead to the activation of the protease domain on the cytoplasmic side. This process culminates in expression of
the genes for the antibiotic-resistance determinants. In Specific Aim 1, we describe the use of a fluorescent
tool in live S. aureus for discovery of agents that shut down the BlaR recognition of the b-lactam antibiotics,
which would reverse the resistance phenotype. A discovery funnel is outlined for analysis of structure-activity
relationship for these compounds. In Specific Aim 2 we communicate a discovery that the BlaZ b-lactamase is
incorporated to the surface of the cytoplasmic membrane in a lipidation- and phosphorylation-dependent
manner. We outline a method for purification of the membrane-anchored BlaZ for the purpose of the
identification of the sites of phosphorylation. The protein will be used in kinetic studies to compare to the non-
membrane-anchored BlaZ, which is not phosphorylated. Plans are detailed for X-ray crystallography for
characterization of the structural issues. The generality of the lipidation- and phosphorylation-dependent
anchoring of proteins to the membrane surface in S. aureus will be explored for 10 distinct proteins. In each
case, plans are outlined to identify the sites of phosphorylation to elucidate rules for phosphorylation and
membrane sequestration of these proteins. These studies will shed definitive light on the complex machinery
that S. aureus strains have evolved for resistance to b-lactam antibiotics."

 Nearly 63 million people (20% of the US population) are eligible for VA benefits and services because
they are veterans, family members or survivors of veterans. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) contribute to
significant morbidity and mortality of the military veterans and civilians (CDC/National Center for Health
Statistics). I have been associated with VA and non-VA funded clinician-scientists and basic researchers for
the past 25 years. I am also a VA funded investigator. The overall focus of my research as a VA funded
scientist is to investigate the causal role of inflammation, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and
inhibitors of inflammation in CVD. Since inflammation is a critical component in the pathogenesis of CVD, and
CVD are the major contributing factors for morbidity and mortality within both military veteran and civilian
populations of both sexes, my studies are highly relevant to the VA mission. Since hypertension, diabetes,
obesity, and smoking predispose veterans and civilians alike to CVD, my ongoing studies are timely and critical
in further understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of these chronic diseases.
Using the most promising research strategies and problem-solving approaches, my goals are to identify newer
therapeutic targets and approaches to blunt progression of CVD and associated mortality. We identified two
molecule that show promise: TRAF3IP2 and RECK. TRAF3IP2 (TRAF3 Interacting Protein 2) is a cytoplasmic
adapter molecule and an upstream regulator of at least three major proinflammatory signal transduction
pathways that are known to play a pathological role in ischemic/non-ischemic cardiac diseases. TRAF3IP2 is
an upstream regulator of IKK/NF-kB, JNK/AP-1 and p38 MAPK, whose persistent activation exerts negative
myocardial inotropic effects. It also induces the expression of collagens and MMPs. TRAF3IP2 is also a critical
intermediate in IL-17, IL-18 and TLR4 signaling, all of which are involved in HF development and progression.
RECK (Reversion Inducing Cysteine Rich Protein with Kazal Motifs) is a membrane anchored MMP regulator.
It also exerts anti-inflammatory effects by physically associating with ADAMs, and IL-6R and gp130. Our
preliminary data show that human heart failure of ischemic/non-ischemic origin (explanted hearts) is
characterized by high levels of TRAF3IP2 and suppressed expression of RECK. Therefore, my goal and
passion are to work towards developing TRAF3IP2 inhibitors and RECK inducers and investigate their
potential in blunting the progression of heart failure in preclinical models. Towards this goal, using molecular
modeling and docking, we tested several thousands of compounds, and identified two potential small molecule
TRAF3IP2 inhibitors and one small molecule RECK inducer, and submitted invention disclosures to VA and the
affiliate. Since RECK expression is downregulated in human heart failure, my ongoing studies are focused on
investigating whether RECK induction blunts pressure overload-induced adverse myocardial remodeling and
heart failure in preclinical models. Utilizing both in vivo (genetic and interventional) and in vitro (cardiomyocytes
and cardiac fibroblasts) models, I will determine the relationship between RECK, MMPs, ADAMs, and
inflammation and heart failure (HF) of non-ischemic origin in vivo and the molecular mechanisms underlying its
reduced expression in vitro (VA Merit 2022-2026). We are also exploring whether AAV9-cTnT (truncated
cardiac troponin promoter)-mediated RECK overexpression, specifically in cardiomyocytes, will inhibit the
progression of heart failure in a preclinical model. In addition, my ongoing studies are focused on unraveling
the roles of the RNA binding protein Larp6 (stimulates collagen I expression) in adverse cardiac remodeling
and HF development."

 The dominant and increasingly evident role of the central nervous system in glucose metabolism regulation
remains an attractive therapeutic target for diabetes. Brain stem and hypothalamic coordinating centers of
feeding and glucose homeostasis have been well characterized over the years, yet uncertainty over the vari-
ous afferent autonomic pathways relaying information from the GI tract to the brain remains. While animal stud-
ies indicate that neuronal sensors relaying information about changes in glucose levels and other nutrients are
situated within the hepatic portal vein, less is known about these factors in humans. In fact, constrained by a
lack of non-invasive tools to interrogate these regulatory circuits in humans, clinical translation of much of the
recent advances in our understanding of feeding and glucose control in rodent models remains an active area
of investigation. To overcome this critical limitation our group has recently identified neuromodulation via pe-
ripheral focused ultrasound (pFUS) as a promising new tool to non-invasively and selectively alter autonomic
nervous system afferents to the brain. Exciting preliminary studies in several rodent models of diabetes have
revealed that transient application of ultrasound pulses to the hepatoportal plexus can enact long-lasting nor-
malization of the hypothalamic glucose setpoint to restore euglycemia in an insulin-independent manner. The
experiments under this proposal are designed to build upon this work to characterize the effect of pFUS di-
rected towards the hepatoportal neuronal plexus in humans with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics. We will
quantify pFUS's impact on insulin sensitivity, as measured by euglycemic clamps, hepatic glucose disposal
and glycogen synthesis by carbon13 NMR and the durability of these responses by long-term CGM glucose
recordings. These studies will be augmented with preclinical diabetes models to identify additional sensory
fields relevant to glycemic control. One site that holds great promise is the abdominal superior mesenteric
plexus, which we found when combined with hepatoportal stimulation has the capacity to enhance the durabil-
ity of the glucose-lowering response, likely by engaging the incretin axis. We will conduct additional transla-
tional studies in human subjects to determine whether this encouraging dual site pFUS stimulation response
indeed can be reproduced in type 2 diabetic subjects. As such ultrasound neuromodulation by pFUS repre-
sents a paradigm shifting new tool to investigate the role of the autonomous nervous system in homeostatic
glucose control in human subjects which if confirmed by our studies might lead to entirely new non-
pharmaceutical treatment options for patients with diabetes."

 We propose to understand at cellular and circuit levels how Kiss1-expressing neurons in the anteroventral
periventricular hypothalamus (AVPV) regulate female mating behavior. The ventromedial hypothalamus
ventrolateralis (VMHvl) and AVPV have been shown to influence diverse female reproductive behaviors and
physiology. We recently showed that presynaptic termini of progesterone receptor (PR)-expressing neurons of
the VMHvl (Pvl) exhibit significant plasticity in the AVPV across the ovarian cycle. Optogenetic inhibition of this
projection of Pvl neurons to the AVPV essentially eliminates female sexual behavior. In preliminary studies, we
find that the subset of AVPV neurons expressing the neuropeptide Kisspeptin (Kiss1) are innervated by Pvl
neurons, and that Kiss1+ AVPV (Kavpv) neurons are important for regulating female sexual behavior in vivo.
 Our proposed work is distinct from previous AVPV studies in that we will perform our unbiased circuit
mapping, imaging, and functional studies focusing exclusively on Kavpv neurons. The AVPV is heterogeneous
not only molecularly but also functionally, and brain-wide connections and behavioral contributions of distinct
AVPV neuronal subtypes remain poorly understood. Moreover, and in contrast to prior work in this region, our
studies will assess Kavpv neuronal connectivity and function across distinct phases of the female cycle, thereby
shedding new light into how physiologically distinct hormonal states influence Kavpv neurons and behavior. In
Aim 1, we will map the presynaptic inputs and postsynaptic projections of Kavpv neurons in an unbiased, brain-
wide manner and validate the synaptic connectivity across the estrus cycle using electrophysiology and in vivo
2-photon imaging. In Aim 2, we will determine the activity patterns of Kavpv neurons in female during sexual and
other social behaviors in freely moving animals. In Aim 3, we will test whether acute manipulation of Kavpv
neurons is essential for and, even when females are in a hormonal state that renders them unreceptive, sufficient
to induce female sexual behavior. The two PIs have complementary expertise for the proposed studies, and the
team is therefore well suited for this project. In summary, if successful our studies will uncover mechanisms
whereby an ovarian hormone sensitive hypothalamic circuit regulates female sexual and reproductive behaviors.
Health Relatedness: It is well known that ovarian sex hormones can influence behavioral, cognitive, and emotive
states in women. How these hormones regulate distinct behaviors and other states at the level of specific
neurons and synapses is poorly understood. In addition, translational research has identified diverse neuro-
psychiatric illnesses that are influenced by these hormones. Our basic research proposal, if successful, will
provide new insights into how ovarian hormone sensitive hypothalamic pathways regulate social interactions in
healthy animal models, and they have the potential to suggest new research avenues in translational work
focused on ovarian sex hormone influenced neural circuits in disease states."

 Our preliminary data demonstrates that in both Adipoq and UCP1-specific Stx4 knockout mice results in
the activation of pyroptotic brown adipocyte cell death through the NLRP1 (NOD-like receptor protein 1)
signaling pathway. In parallel, brown adipose function and to a lesser extent mass declines during aging and
this age-associated decline in BAT thermogenesis occur concomitant with the induction of pyroptosis.
Furthermore, in both modes the regression of BAT results in the reduction in insulin sensitivity, energy
expenditure and cold tolerance that can be reversed by over expression of Stx4 in brown/beige adipocytes
(UCP1-Stx4 transgenic mice) or by blocking of pyroptosis using an inhibitor of caspase 1. In addition, aged and
Stx4 knockout mice have reduced protein levels of the cell survival receptors Ntrk3, a brown adipocyte
selective tyrosine receptor kinase within brown adipose tissue. Based upon these data, we are proposing a
multi-principal investigator (MPI) application to understand the molecular basis for the decline in brown adipose
tissue mass and function during the normal development of aging and the functional/physiological
consequences of preserving brown mass and function, in terms of energy balance, insulin sensitivity and
metabolic homeostasis. In this proposal, we will determine 1) the specific pathways and signaling events
responsible for brown adipocyte pyroptosis and functional consequences of preserving BAT using
both pharmacological and genetic interventions; 2) the functional role of the neurotropic tyrosine
receptor kinase Ntrk3 in regulating BAT mass, function and brown adipocyte pyroptosis; and 3)
changes in tissue cellular identity and its role during age-dependent BAT dysfunction and regression.
The findings obtained from this proposal will then allow to develop strategies to prevent age-dependent
regression of BAT that will likely provide a more tractable and effective therapeutic approach than the induction

 2 Despite improvements in median life expectancy for sickle cell disease from 14 years in 1973 to
 3 61 years in recent cohorts from academic centers, adults with sickle cell disease (SCD)
 4 experience functional impairments. They develop deficits in physical, social, and cognitive
 5 function due to both age-related changes and SCD complications, such as avascular necrosis,
 6 strokes, cardiopulmonary disease, and sensory deficits. There are no validated assessment
 7 tools or interventions to improve physical function in older adults with SCD. Failure to recognize
 8 and manage vulnerabilities and functional decline can lead to disability and premature death. In
 9 a pilot study we evaluated the feasibility if the Sickle Cell Disease Functional Assessment (SCD-
10 FA) and demonstrated that it was feasible, acceptable, and safe. In this study, we will evaluate
11 the validity and reliability of the SCD-FA in a prospective cohort of older adults with SCD (age ≥
12 40 years) (Aim 1). We will evaluate the utility of the SCD-FA to predict number of days
13 hospitalized per year as the primary outcome, and change in physical performance, Sickle Cell
14 Day Hospital visits, emergency department visits, dependence in Activities of Daily Living, and
15 death as secondary outcomes. We will also determine risk factors for impaired physical
16 performance (Aim 2). The SCD-FA will provide a method for: 1) assessing vulnerabilities in
17 multiple health domains, 2) identifying targets for interventions, and 3) measuring change in
18 function. To address functional impairments, we will adapt and pilot a personalized exercise
19 training program in older adults (age ≥ 40 years) with SCD (Aim 3). The intervention will be an
20 8-week virtual program adapted from Gerofit, which is a supervised exercise and health
21 promotion program for older adults that includes exercises customized to each person’s heath
22 status and underlying functional deficits. The expected outcome is to have pilot data to design a
23 randomized control trial of a personalized exercise intervention for older adults with SCD.

10789893,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Voice disorders often lead to changes in voice quality noticed by patients, clinicians, and conversation
partners. Assessment of voice quality is essential for diagnosis, and improvement in voice quality is a critical
outcome of treatment. However, our knowledge of how voice quality is perceived is limited and the availability
of robust measures of clinical outcome is even more limited. This has restricted our ability to accurately
quantify or describe changes in quality, such as declines due to a disease or improvements resulting from
treatment. This continuation project combines concepts and techniques from voice science, speech science,
hearing science, and engineering to address these problems. The comprehensive approach to the proposed
research simultaneously envelops the three primary VQ dimensions, embraces their covariance, improves
measurement methods, and expands ecological validity through connected speech evaluation. The research
proceeds by first obtaining high-precision measures of voice quality perception in the laboratory. These data
are then used to develop mathematical models of voice quality perception that accurately reflect listeners’ data.
To obtain a close match between human judgments of voice quality and model output, models of auditory
processing are used to obtain an internal representation of the voice acoustic signal. Specific measures are
then captured from this internal auditory representation and used to model the perception of voice quality. In
the proposed work, these methods will be used to establish a comprehensive framework for understanding and
measuring voice quality perception and to enable translation to clinical practice. The specific goals of this
project are to: (1) develop a more complete understanding of the nature of VQ covariance (among breathy,
rough, and strain) using natural dysphonic voices; (2) assess VQ in connected speech at micro (segmental)
and macro (whole utterance) levels to better capture the impacts of rapid and complex transitions, co-
articulatory and prosodic variations, and unique VQ signatures related to specific pathologies; (3) incorporate
all of these components into a novel, three-dimensional VQ scaling procedure that is simple, intuitive, efficient
enough to be used clinically, and has ratio-level measurement properties; (4) use highly-predictive
computational models to overcome many of the limitations of acoustic analyses and perceptual evaluation; and
(5) evaluate full range of psychometric properties considered in test design and evaluation including reliability,
validity, sensitivity, and specificity. Perhaps most importantly, the goal is to develop an assessment that
accurately indicates responsiveness to change (i.e., disorder progression, treatment). These parameters are
considered essential for longitudinal assessment and outcome measurement. The feasibility of using these
models and metrics in regular clinical assessment will be evaluated in multiple voice pathologies through a
clinical field-trial and coordinated offline assessments by clinicians and laboratory subjects."
10747416,"One of every 20 new cancer cases is diagnosed in an adolescent or young adult (AYA) aged 12–39 years. Both
female and male AYA cancer patients experience increase risks of infertility and gonadal failure, devastating late
effects which are preventable through effective fertility preservation (FP) services prior to cancer treatment. At
the intersection of oncology and fertility, oncofertility care is the evidence-based practice of discussing
reproductive risks with newly diagnosed cancer patients and supporting shared decision-making on FP services.
Despite longstanding clinical guidelines, oncofertility care uptake is low because we currently lack scalable
interventions to support its implementation in adult and pediatric cancer care settings. Drawing on
implementation science, our transdisciplinary team conducted systematic environmental scans across 10
diverse health systems which corroborated prior research on barriers to care and led to the development,
usability testing, pilot testing and tailoring of the multi-component telehealth oncofertility care (TOC) intervention.
Intervention components are: 1) EHR-based oncofertility needs screen and referral pathway to a virtual
oncofertility hub; 2) telehealth oncofertility counseling through the hub; and 3) telehealth oncofertility financial
navigation through the hub. The proposed TOC trial is a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial of 18 adult and
pediatric oncology clinics across three health systems. We will test the hypotheses that the intervention condition
will be associated with increased proportion of patients who engage in goal-concordant oncofertility care (i.e.,
engagement in reproductive risk counseling and fertility preservation services that meet the patient’s fertility
goals) (Aim 1) and improved patient-reported outcomes and achievement of patient-centered goals (Aim 2),
compared to the usual care control condition. To decrease the time lag from research discovery to clinical care,
we will evaluate intervention implementation using mixed methods guided by implementation science
frameworks (Aim 3). The TOC intervention is innovative for its multi-level approach, medical financial hardship
target, hub and spoke model bridging a virtual oncofertility hub with multi-institutional oncology clinics, and focus
on contextual fit that enables implementation across separate EHR instances and in both adult and pediatric
settings. The proposal is innovative in taking an implementation science-informed approach that considers
policy, organizational context, and patient preference to evaluate effectiveness and implementation for future
scale-up. IMPACT: Responsive to Congress’ Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access and Research
(STAR) Act of 2018 and NCI’s NOSIs on use of telehealth in cancer-related care (NOT-CA-21-043) and
addressing cancer-related financial hardship (NOT-CA-22-045), this proposal has the potential for high clinical
impact through reducing significant inequities in access to oncofertility care and enabling AYA cancer patients
to engage in care that preserves their reproductive futures and improves life after cancer."
10763868,"Sex is a strong determinant of susceptibility and severity for many human diseases. Yet
it is often ignored as a biological variable. The liver is a sexually dimorphic organ, which leads to
significant differences liver disease outcomes between men and women. This includes non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease, which affects over 25% of the population. There are currently major
gaps in our understanding of what the sex differences are in the liver, the mechanism that drive
these differences, and the manifestations of sex differences on liver disease outcome.
 Besides sex differences, the liver is also known to have significant functional differences
along the liver lobule, the basic functional unit of the liver. Liver diseases including NAFLD also
show zonation along the lobule in their pathology. To date, little is known about whether sexual
dimorphism in the liver is evenly distributed along the liver lobule.
 We showed that more than half of sexually dimorphic hepatocyte genes show spatial
zonation across the liver lobule. Surprisingly these zonated sexual dimorphic genes are
asymmetrically distributed across sex and the lobule, which corresponds to zonated sex
differences in liver function. We showed that systemic signals that drive sex differences exhibit
clear zonated activity while local signals that drive zonation show clear sexually dimorphic
activity. Finally, we showed in a liver injury model that shows both zonated damage and sex
differences in outcomes that zonated sexual dimorphism in hepatocytes drives the sex
differences in the liver’s response to injury.
 Our hypothesis is that lobular zonation and sexual dimorphism in hepatocytes are
coordinately regulated by the interactions between local lobular signals including Wnts and
systemic signals including growth hormone. We propose a set of studies to 1) determine the
respective roles of local and systemic signals in establishing zonated sexual dimorphism in
hepatocytes; 2) characterize how zonated sexual dimorphism in hepatocytes change across
different reproductive stages of prepuberty, sexual maturity and menopause; and 3)
characterize sex differences in liver response to NAFLD across different reproductive stages.
The results of these studies will improve our understanding of how sex differences affect liver
disease susceptibility and progression."
10754958,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived membrane-bound structures released into extracellular spaces that
navigate the bodily fluids and appear to support intercellular communication. Cancer cells release significantly
higher numbers of EVs then their normal counterparts. Because the EV contents are derived from the cell of
origin, molecular profiling of circulating EVs are being scrutinized as a non-invasive means for early cancer
diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and assessing response to treatment. However, EV-based clinical
diagnostics have been limited by inadequate rigor and reproducibility of samples to specifically discriminate,
isolate, and characterize normal and disease-associated EVs.
Three analytical and conceptual challenges have prevented the identification of specific and reproducible EV-
associated cancer biomarkers with clinical relevance: 1) no unbiased strategy has been developed to evaluate
the limits of cancer detection using EVs; 2) the relative contribution of healthy tissues to the pool of circulating
EVs is not known; and 3) a systematic analysis of the number and composition of circulating cancer-derived EVs
during tumor development has not been performed.
These complications have prompted us to design a general platform capable of evaluating the contribution of
specific tissues to the pool of circulating EVs in otherwise health animals compared to animals undergoing cancer
development. The system is based on an engineered EV marker developed from the tetraspanin protein CD63
(enCD63), which facilitates collection, visualization, and quantification of EVs released by specific cells and
tissues.
By restricting the expression of enCD63 to specific normal or neoplastic cells and tissues of genetically
engineered mouse models, we will unambiguously examine the efficacy of EVs as biomarkers. We propose to
use our innovative platform to: 1) perform an unbiased calibration correlating the number of EVs with their cells
of origin (Aim 1); 2) define the relative contribution of healthy tissues to the pool of circulating EVs (Aim 2); and
3) to assess the specificity and sensitivity of EVs in cancer detection (Aim 3).
This application focuses on Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC), a deadly neoplastic disease with low
survival rate that lacks specific and sensitive diagnostic tests. Completion of the proposed studies will contribute
to the development of standardized procedures for the preparation, selection, and analysis of EV-based
biomarkers."
10755358,"Abstract. This application is to renew R01ES028802, Dr. Colacino’s Outstanding New Environmental Scientist
(ONES) award. The goal of this project is to define the impacts of chemical exposures on breast cancer
disparities. There are profound breast cancer disparities by race. African American women are two to three
times more likely to be diagnosed with the most aggressive subtype, triple negative, and 40% more likely to die
of breast cancer. The etiological drivers of these disparities are complex and multifactorial. We have identified
stark racial disparities in chemical biomarkers in US women across a multitude of toxicants. Our preliminary
data show that many of these chemicals have breast cancer associated functional and molecular bioactivity at
doses relevant to human exposure. Understanding how chemical exposure disparities impact aggressive
breast cancer biology and breast cancer mortality would provide us with much needed strategies for precision
prevention and identify new molecular targets for treatment. Aggressive breast cancers are characterized by
the acquisition of the Hallmarks of Cancer, promoted by the environmental via the Key Characteristics of
Carcinogens. Reflected in the 2022 updated Hallmarks, data from us and others shows that aggressive breast
cancers acquire a “stem cell-like” phenotype through dysregulation of developmental pathways or the
expansion of stem cells. Intriguingly, our preliminary data using high throughput transcriptomic profiling of 19 of
these chemicals shows that multiple exposures, including p,p’-DDE and lead, induce phenotypic plasticity in
non-transformed breast cells. Here, we will integrate human exposure data, publicly available toxicity data, and
high throughput in vitro characterization of chemical effects in normal breast cells from diverse donors, with
external validation in molecular epidemiology datasets. Based on our previous findings and preliminary data,
our hypothesis is that these chemicals will promote cancer hallmarks and the acquisition of stemness at human
relevant doses and will be associated with breast cancer mortality and aggressive breast cancer molecular
profiles. Aim 1 will quantify dose-dependent functional and transcriptional effects of exposure disparity
chemicals. Aim 2 will define impacts of exposure disparities chemicals on the acquisition of hybrid stem cell
states. Aim 3 will quantify chemical exposure disparities in breast cancer mortality and outcomes. We propose
an epidemiologically-informed precision toxicology approach that we expect will determine key chemical
drivers of aggressive breast cancers and their molecular targets. Understanding how chemical exposures
impact health disparities is urgently needed for new prevention and treatment strategies."
10768671,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Cerebral palsy (CP) is a major neurodevelopmental disorder affecting an estimated 1:323 individuals.
CP affects the motor stream of development, and people with CP may have difficulty walking, talking, eating, or
using their hands. Some may have involuntary muscle activation and/or movements that may be painful and/or
disruptive, affecting quality of life and inclusion. Although environmentally-mediated causes of CP such as
perinatal stroke, prematurity, prenatal infection or lack of oxygen have been known to lead to CP for some
time, recent findings from our group and others indicates that for as many as one-third of individuals with CP, a
genetic mutation may be the cause of their CP symptoms. Identifying the genetic basis of CP is important
because our data suggests that the identification of a genetic cause of a patient’s CP can lead to a change in
management > 20% of the time and this number is expected to grow steadily.
 Genetic forms of CP may occur sporadically in approximately one-half of cases. However, ~1/3 of
genetic cases of CP are estimated to exhibit autosomal recessive inheritance, wherein both parents are
unaffected carriers of the condition. Most current research in CP is focused on parent-child trio-based studies.
We propose a different approach, focusing instead on families with multiple affected children with CP inter-
related by blood. We have enrolled hundreds of such families in collaborations with physician colleagues in the
Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. Studying highly genetically-informative families such as these is
anticipated to represent a powerful approach for cerebral palsy-associated gene discovery.
 The signs and symptoms of the families we have enrolled in our studies have been diligently
catalogued, including assessments by multiple specialists, and the collection of facial photographs and patient
videos that highlight their movement disorders. These resources, as well as detailed laboratory and
radiological assessments will allow us to comprehensively catalog the symptoms of the individuals we have
partnered with for these studies. We will then perform whole exome sequencing to identify changes in the
genome found in affected members of the family but not in healthy individuals. Once a candidate gene is
identified, we will connect with colleagues worldwide to find patients with similar symptoms who harbor
variant(s) in the same gene. We will then conduct a series of laboratory analyses in order to confirm or refute a
role for the candidate gene in CP. This will include both classic and massively parallel unbiased studies of
RNA, protein, and/or metabolites, and assessment in complementation studies, cell-based assays, fly models
and human induced pluripotent stem cell-neurons/astrocytes from patient samples. Impact: We anticipate that
this approach will allow us to identify dozens of novel CP-associated genes, which in turn will facilitate clinical
advances in diagnosis and management as mechanism-based therapies continue to be developed."
10876896,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pulmonary hypertension associated with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (PH-HFpEF) is the most
common cause of PH worldwide, and at present, it has no proven effective therapies. Previously, we have
found convincing evidence that PH-HFpEF-regulating sirtuin-3 (SIRT3) is predominantly decreased in the
skeletal muscle. During the past grant period, we found a new endocrine signaling axis that links depressed
skeletal muscle SIRT3 to production/secretion of signaling molecules that interact with pulmonary vasculature
in PH-HFpEF. However, underlying mechanisms by which skeletal muscle SIRT3-mediated scretome regulates
pathological changes in pulmonary vasculature are not well-understood at present.
Based on a mass spectrometry-based plasma proteomics approach, our new data show that 2-microglobulin
(B2M) is present at higher levels in patients with PH-HFpEF. Both circulating and skeletal muscle levels of B2M
are markedly increased in mice with skeletal muscle SIRT3 deficiency. Plasma and muscle biopsies from a
validation cohort of PH-HFpEF patients also show higher B2M levels with increased disease severity.
Treatment with B2M recombinant protein reduces expression of WW domain-containing oxidoreductase
(WWOX), which plays a role in repressing cell proliferation, in PASMCs. B2M treatment also increases
expression of canopy fibroblast growth factor signaling regulator 2 (CNPY2), an unfolded protein response
(UPR) initiator known to induce excessive angiogenesis and proliferation, in PAECs. While B2M treatment
increases PAECs migration/proliferation and media conditioned by CNPY2-overexpressed PAECs reduces
WWOX in PASMCs, the role of PAECs CNPY2 in PH-HFpEF remains elusive. Thus, we hypothesize that
skeletal muscle-secreted B2M acts as an endocrine signaling molecule which induces remote pulmonary
vascular remodeling via dysregulating PAECs CNPY2 and PASMCs WWOX.
Specific Aim 1 will determine whether skeletal muscle B2M is an important signaling molecule affecting multiple
pulmonary vascular pathophenotypes. Using wild-type and skeletal muscle-specific B2m KO mice, with or
without high-fat feeding (HFD), which induces a PH-HFpEF phenotype, we will characterize the contribution of
skeletal muscle B2M in PH-HFpEF. In Aim 2, we will determine the role of PAECs CNPY2 in pulmonary vascular
remodeling and PH-HFpEF with EC-specific Cnpy2 KO mice. Specific Aim 3 will use plasma and muscle
biopsies of patients with PH-HFpEF or HFpEF alone collected from biobanks and Phase II clinical trials to
evaluate whether B2M can be a relevant biomarker of PH-HFpEF severity and prognosis. Inducible pluripotent
stem cell (iPSC)-derived ECs of PH-HFpEF patients will also be used to evaluate clinical relevance of CNPY2.
We expect that successful execution of the proposed research plan would provide new mechanistic
understanding of PH-HFpEF pathogenesis and aid in providing important information to guide future research
towards development of therapeutic approaches for the presentably untreatable PH-HFpEF."
10766775,"Abstract
 Chronic environmental exposure to neurotoxic concentrations of manganese (Mn) affects the basal ganglia
system and has been linked to the etiology of Parkinsonism. Within basal ganglia (BG), Mn primarily accumulates
in the globus pallidus and causes neuronal dysfunction in GABAergic neurons, resulting in dysregulation of the
BG neural circuitry. Unlike Parkinson’s disease (PD), DAergic nuclei in the SN are not greatly affected by Mn
neurotoxicity. Although Mn neurotoxicity manifests as extrapyramidal motor impairments, animal and human
neurotoxicity studies indicate that it is also associated with various neuropsychiatric and cognitive disabilities.
Several lines of evidence reveal olfactory deficits in humans following both occupational and environmental Mn
exposure. Despite evidence linking olfactory dysfunction and BG pathology in Mn neurotoxicity, the underlying
neurotoxicological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recently, we reported that the neuropeptide
prokineticin 2 (PK2) is rapidly upregulated in the early stages of DAergic neurotoxicity in a neurotoxin-induced
animal model of Parkinsonism, and it participates in a novel compensatory protective response to counteract
neurodegeneration by activating pro-survival pathways. We also obtained exciting new data showing a similar
biphasic expression pattern for PK2 during Mn-induced neurotoxicity in vitro and in the SN and olfactory bulb
(OB) regions, but not the striatum, of Mn-treated animals. Furthermore, our preliminary studies surprisingly
identified that pharmacological stimulation of PK2 receptors or recombinant PK2 (rPK2) significantly upregulates
the glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) expression and release in astrocytes both in vitro and in vivo.
Additional preliminary results revealed a robust colocalization of PK2 and GDNF in OB. Thus, we hypothesize
that disparity in the induction pattern of PK2-GDNF signaling in BG contributes to the differential vulnerability of
GABAergic and DAergic neurons to Mn neurotoxicity. Also, Mn-induced impairment in PK2-GDNF signaling
affects neurogenesis required for OB function and striatal neuronal survival. To fully establish the role of the
PK2-GDNF axis in the BG and olfactory regions during Mn-induced neurotoxic insult, we will systematically
pursue the following specific aims: (i) Map differential PK2 expression in BG, OB, subventricular zone (SVZ),
and rostral migratory stream (RMS) regions and functionally correlate with neurogenesis, brain region-specific
neuronal vulnerability and neurobehavioral deficits in mouse models of chronic Mn neurotoxicity; (ii) determine
whether PK2 regulates GDNF levels and characterize the molecular mechanism of PK2 signaling in regulating
GDNF in cell and animal models of Mn neurotoxicity; and (iii) evaluate the translational neuroprotective efficacy
of novel PK2 receptor agonism and AAV-PK2/GDNF gene therapy in animal models of Mn neurotoxicity. Overall,
we predict that our proposed studies will provide novel mechanistic insights into metal-induced BG and olfactory
dysfunction and its role in the pathogenesis of environmentally linked Parkinsonism and will offer a novel
therapeutic strategy."

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) provides cardiac support for patients with end stage heart disease and
has significantly improved the survival of these patients, but device-related bleeding remains common and are
associated with poor clinical outcomes. Even latest (3rd) generation devices have been able to significant
impact device thrombosis (e.g.MOMENTUM3 trial), however with some surprise they have not been able to
resolve LVAD related bleeding which remains a significant source of morbidity and complicates clinical
management, ultimately leading to poor clinical outcomes. The LVAD-associated bleeding is often called
acquired von Willebrand syndrome (aVWS) that is believed to be caused by excessive cleavage of VWF
multimers by ADAMTS-13. However, this tentative mechanism has not been experimentally validated and
significant gaps remain. The loss of large VWF multimers is observed in nearly all patients, but only a fraction
of patients experience significant bleeding. High shear stress is known to promote VWF cleavage and
activation to bind platelets, but this shear-induced VWF activation has not been studied in patients on LVAD.
We hypothesize that: 1) Plasma VWF multimers in LVAD patients are subjected to higher rates of cleavage
and activation than healthy subjects and patients with end stage heart disease prior to LVAD implant 2) LVAD-
induced high shear stress results in VWF dysfunctions responsible for impaired hemostasis and triggers
downstream VWF mediated angiogenesis 3) These shear-induced structural changes of VWF can be detected
in patients on LVAD and can predict bleeding propensity developed after LVAD implantation. We propose to
test these hypotheses with three specific aims. First, develop predictive markers for LVAD-induced hemostatic
complications by comprehensively analyzing the imbalance between VWF activity and cleavage in longitudinal
plasma samples from 240 patients collected before and after LVAD implantation using flow cytometry, mass
spectrometry, microfluidic chamber systems, and conventional VWF functional tests. Second, study shear-
induced structural changes of the VWF A1 and A2 domains and their roles in regulating rates of VWF cleavage
and activation using in vitro techniques and mouse models. Third study how VWF synergizes with extracellular
vesicles to promote immature angiogenesis, which leads to bleeding-prone arteriovenous malformation. The
objectives of this mechanistic study are to: 1) define shear-induced structural changes of VWF using state-of-
art biophysical techniques and study how these changes influence VWF cleavage and activity, 2) study how
high shear stress disrupts the inhibitory interaction between the A1 and A2 domains to alter the A1 interface
with the platelet VWF receptor GP Ib and to unfold A2 for cleavage, and 3) investigate the role of VWF in
angiogenesis. We have assembled a team of experts in related clinical and research fields from 3 institutions
to conduct this innovative research focused on improving LVAD outcomes and provide insight on how aVWS
may play a role in surgical and percutaneous continuous flow devices."
10755694,"Abstract
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by its broad, primary resistance to genotoxic
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The singular driving oncogene of PDAC is KRAS, which
is mutated in 95% of cases. Unfortunately, inhibitors of the specific mutant KRAS alleles found in PDAC are
not yet clinically available, and all attempts to target downstream effector pathways have been stymied by
feedback loops and other resistance mechanisms.
 Work from our collaborators found that inhibition of the MEK pathway, a key KRAS effector, results in
compensatory upregulation of autophagy, a survival pathway. Combination MEK and autophagy inhibition was
shown to have synergistic effects in reducing viability of PDAC cell lines and led to tumor responses in model
systems and individual case reports from human patients. However, only a subset of patients have responded
to MEK/autophagy inhibitors in early clinical trials. Among those who respond, most tumors progress within a
few months. Nevertheless, this is potentially the first example of an active regimen lacking genotoxic agents.
 Published mechanisms for the synergy between MEK and autophagy inhibitors in PDAC do not readily
explain the rapid emergence of resistance, do not account for cellular heterogeneity within the malignant
epithelial compartment, and do not address the role of the tumor stroma in the response to therapy. The
overall goal of this proposal is take a holistic approach to understanding cellular responses to MEK/autophagy
inhibition by studying the effects of treatment on every cell type in the tumor. We will do this by performing
single cell RNA sequencing and analyzing the data using single cell regulatory network analysis – an
advanced computational framework designed to systematically measure the activity of every transcription
factor in each individual cell. This innovative new approach enables us both to identify specific cellular
subtypes impacted by treatment, and to rapidly identify the mechanistic drivers of observed responses. We will
deploy this approach on tumor samples from four different model systems: genetically engineered (KPC) mice,
human patient derived xenografts (PDXs), patient-derived tumor “explant” models (freshly cultured intact tissue
slices), and samples from an active clinical trial of MEK/autophagy inhibition in PDAC patients.
 Extensive preliminary data in human cell lines, human PDAC explants, and KPC mouse tumors
demonstrate that MEK/autophagy inhibition primarily impacts specific subsets of three major cell types:
epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophage/monocytes. Our three aims will study the effects and mechanisms
of MEK/autophagy inhibition in each cell type, with the goals of annotating phenotypes, learning whether
effects are cell autonomous, determining the transcription factors driving treatment response, understanding
impacts on the remaining cells, and identifying new therapeutic combinations to potentiate anticancer effects."
10766759,"Changes in the spatial organization of the genome are directly involved in gene regulation during differentiation,
cellular stress responses and disease initiation. Existing approaches such as chromosome conformation capture
(3C) methods and DNA fluorescent in situ hybridization (DNA-FISH) have provided information on the overall 3D
structure of the nucleus at the chromatin level, providing critical insights into how our genomes are regulated.
Nonetheless, new technologies are needed to uncover the finer details on the role of nuclear architecture,
topological domains, and genomic interactions. Studies of gene regulation would benefit from a technology that
fills the niche between the ensemble averaged 3C methods and the single cell, low throughput DNA-FISH
approach. We have recently developed a novel optical technology we call “Femto-seq” that does just this – it
allows users to obtain DNA sequence information from targeted femtoliter volumes within the nucleus of selected
cells. Femto-seq provides a new way to examine genomic contacts near a specific gene locus or any nuclear
region of interest (e.g. nuclear bodies). Using 3D localized two-photon excitation, we can photochemically
biotinylate any region of the nucleus we can fluorescently label and identify in volumes which can be as small as
a ½ of a femtoliter. The process is carried out on a population of cells using a combined two-photon/confocal
microscope which images, locates fluorescently labeled regions of interest and then irradiates those regions
using 700 nm femtosecond pulses to biotinylate the chromatin by photochemically cross-linking the DNA with a
psoralen-biotin compound. Nuclei are isolated and the biotinylated DNA from the targeted region pulled down
and sequenced. Because the cells are imaged to locate the regions of interest, they can also be screened for
other parameters, allowing for the collection of targeted biotinylated DNA only from user selected cells within the
cell population, providing single-cell like genomic information from a sub-set of cells within the population. We
have proof-of-concept data from a cell line with a fluorescently labeled transgene we used as our targeted region,
and show that we can obtain DNA highly enriched in transgene locus sequences. The goals of this Focused
Technology Research and Development R01 project are to (Aim 1) design and construct a dual confocal/two-
photon microscope capable of targeting and irradiating user selected regions-of-interest in a population of cells
in a high-throughput automated fashion, (Aim 2) create a chromatin isolation pipeline based on novel microfluidic
designs to efficiently purify and prepare the DNA for sequencing, and (Aim 3) demonstrate the improvement
obtained from aims 1 and 2 in a series of Femto-seq experiments designed to produce quantitative metrics of
improvement and to uncover new knowledge on how environmental signals may be relayed through the cytosol
and into the nucleus. Femto-seq is a unique new way of investigating the spatial and regulatory relationships
between DNA sequences and any microscopically visible region-of-interest in the nucleus."
10757724,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to understand the mechanistic basis for gating and function in channelrhodopsins,
retinal-binding proteins that are similar to vertebrate visual proteins and form light-gated ion channels to control
phototaxis in motile algae. In the nearly two decades since they were first cloned, channelrhodopsins have
become important models for understanding membrane protein structure, function, and biophysics and widely
utilized molecular tools in optogenetics, in which their heterologous expression in genetically targeted cells
enables control of membrane potential and electrical excitability with light. Here, we will apply cryo-electron
microscopy to determine structures of channelrhodopsins in different functional states and electrophysiological
recordings of structure-based variants to understand the basis for channel gating and determinants for key
channel properties. We aim to capture structural snapshots of different open and closed conformations by
identifying combinations of stimulation conditions and channel variants that promote different states. We will
leverage these structural insights to interrogate the molecular basis for diverse kinetics, conductance, and
spectral sensitivity among channelrhodopsins and derive physical models for gating and functional properties.
We will focus our efforts on two channelrhodopsins that are the most potent members of the two depolarizing
channel families widely used in optogenetics, the cation channelrhodopsins (CCRs) and bacteriorhodopsin-like
cation channelrhodopsins (BCCRs). CCRs and BCCRs share a common architecture, but are structurally,
evolutionarily, and mechanistically distinct. Comparative analyses of these two channelrhodopsin families will
therefore provide additional insight into how light energy is converted into gating conformational changes and
the molecular basis for channel activity. Since the initial characterization and cloning of channelrhodopsins, the
optogenetic toolbox has been greatly expanded by the engineering of novel channelrhodopsins with varied and
improved properties. Still, these efforts have been limited to date by an incomplete understanding of the
structural and mechanistic basis for channel function. Therefore, in addition to providing fundamental
mechanistic insight into channelrhodopsin gating and activity, this work will serve as a basis for the rational
design of new channelrhodopsin variants with modified properties that further expand the potential of
optogenetic manipulations. Such tools could enable new experiments at larger scale, in deeper tissue, in larger

CANDIDATE: Alyssa Lanzi, Ph.D. is an academic speech-language pathologist and Research Assistant
Professor at the University of Delaware. In this K23 application, Dr. Lanzi will build on her training and research
studying cognitive rehabilitation approaches that preserve independence in adults with mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and early-stage dementia from Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The objective of this award is to acquire new
knowledge, skills, and experiences needed to independently conduct clinical trials of these interventions, as well
as future dissemination and implementation. Her long-term goal is to establish a productive research program
that develops, evaluates, and disseminates cognitive rehabilitation interventions for adults with AD and MCI.
CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Lanzi proposes to: 1) learn how to design and conduct randomized
controlled trials of behavioral interventions for adults with MCI and dementia from AD; 2) receive training in the
multidisciplinary assessment of the cognitive, psychological, and independent living skills of this population; 3)
acquire knowledge and skills related to dissemination and implementation of behavioral interventions for
rehabilitation clinicians. The training plan includes rich experiential learning activities such as multidisciplinary
team-based cognitive assessment activities in diverse community settings. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Lanzi will train
with a multidisciplinary team of NIH-funded mentors with expertise in clinical trials research, MCI and dementia
from AD, and dissemination/implementation research. Dr. Verdolini Abbott (U Delaware), co-primary mentor, is
a senior academic speech-language pathologist and has extensive expertise in clinical trials of behavioral
interventions. Dr. Cohen (U Delaware), co-primary mentor, is a rehabilitation-oriented neuropsychologist with a
record of multi-disciplinary cognitive assessment research. Dr. Rodakowski (U Pittsburgh), co-mentor, is an
academic occupational therapist with expertise in cognitive strategy training and independent living skills for
adults with MCI. Dr. Smith (U Florida), co-mentor, is a senior neuropsychologist and renowned expert in MCI,
AD, and behavioral intervention approaches. RESEARCH: Most treatment approaches for MCI and dementia
from AD have focused on restoring cognitive weaknesses. Unfortunately, these are suboptimal for preserving or
improving independent living skills. Aim 1 of the proposed research is to conduct a pilot trial to evaluate the
efficacy of the Structured External Memory Aid Treatment, a compensation-based approach for adults with MCI
that promotes independent living skills by teaching the use of strategies to compensate for cognitive weaknesses
(e.g., note-taking systems). Aim 2 is to evaluate the demographic, clinical, and neuropsychological predictors of
treatment adherence. Aim 3 is to refine treatment procedures and materials that will be used to train future
interventionists. The completion of these training and research aims are critical for Dr. Lanzi’s career
development and continued success in investigating the efficacy and effectiveness of compensatory cognitive
interventions that enhance the independence and quality of life of adults with AD."
10795860,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antimicrobial resistant, chronic infections are one of the greatest challenges facing our society today. This
problem is so significant that the World Health Organization named antibiotic resistance as one of the top ten
threats to global health in 2019. More than 80% of these infections have been attributed to the remarkable
capabilities of bacteria to form biofilms, communities of microorganisms encased in a protective matrix of
extracellular polymeric substance, that are irresponsive to antimicrobials. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the 2nd
leading cause of these infections, and routinely the most common cause of fatalities in patients with nosocomial
infections. Dispersion is considered a promising avenue open for biofilm control, by assisting in resolving biofilm-
associated infections. This is because dispersion is an active, regulated process by which bacteria escape
biofilms as free-living cells that are once again susceptible to antimicrobials, with dispersion thus capable of
enhancing the efficacy of antibiotics. However, while dispersion cue sensing by P. aeruginosa and how these
cues are translated into the modulation of the c-di-GMP pool has been elucidated in great detail, little is known
about downstream events enabling P. aeruginosa to egress from the biofilm, the contribution of c-di-GMP, or
factors driving the virulence switch by dispersed cells. Using RNA-seq, we have identified genes that are unique
to dispersed cells (termed “dispersion regulon”) and contribute to the phenotype ascribed to dispersed cells
including drug susceptibility, virulence, and matrix degradation. We confirmed factors involved in matrix
degradation and the reinforcement of the biofilm matrix to contribute to dispersion. However, no obvious matrix
degrading enzymes have been thus far identified which target the matrix EPS Psl, suggesting differences in
matrix degradation and dispersion by different classes of matrix-producing P. aeruginosa strains. Moreover, our
findings suggest that the modulation of c-di-GMP is not sufficient to induce dispersion and only explains some
of the phenotypes of dispersed cells. Based on these premises, we hypothesize that dispersion and dispersion-
related phenotypes require c-di-GMP-(in)dependent pathways including genes and gene functions involved in
matrix degradation that likely differ amongst the classes of matrix utilization. The goal of this project is to
elucidate the signaling and regulatory events leading to dispersion including matrix-degradation, and dispersed
cells adopting an acute virulence phenotype. We will therefore elucidate in Aim 1 pathways leading to dispersion
and dispersion-related phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, and spatio-temporally assess the fate of matrix
components during dispersion in Aim 2. Aim 3 aims at determining whether the dispersion and factors required
for dispersion are similar or are different in non-mucoid clinical isolates representing 4 different matrix classes.
We anticipate our findings to not only contribute to understanding infection but also assist in guiding the
development of dispersion towards an adjunctive therapy for biofilm control."
10829337,"Polyketides are used more frequently in human medicine than any other class of secondary
metabolites, and comprise roughly 20% of top-selling small-molecule drugs. Despite their
importance: (a) All polyketides used in human medicine are derived from soil bacteria and are
prepared via fermentation or semi-synthesis (notwithstanding eribulin), (b) <5% of soil bacteria
are amenable to culture, many phyla have eluded culture, and the few bacteria amenable to
culture express <10% of their biosynthetic genes, (c) although marine polyketides possess an
astonishing array of biological activities, commercial fermentation processes involving marine
bacteria (which are often symbionts) remain exceptionally uncommon. De novo chemical
synthesis potentially offers entry to otherwise inaccessible polyketides and their congeners, yet
current synthetic methods often do not avail sufficiently concise routes for large scale production.
To overcome this challenge, our laboratory has pioneered a broad, new family of catalytic
methods for the direct stereo- and site-selective conversion of lower alcohols to higher alcohols.
As documented in numerous total syntheses, these methods streamline polyketide construction,
allowing the target compounds to be prepared in significantly fewer steps than previously
possible.
In the proposed funding period, 3 specific aims are proposed: (a) Total syntheses of the type I
polyketides neaumycin B and gladiolin will be pursued using our catalytic methods. Neaumycin B
is a femtomolar inhibitor of U87 human glioblastoma. Gladiolin displays potent, selective activity
against M. tuberculosis strains that are resistant to the frontline antibiotics isoniazid and
rifampicin. (b) The type II polyketide antibiotics formicamycins G, H and J, arenimycin A and
analogues of viridicatumtoxin will be prepared using our catalytic methods. Antibacterial
properties of these compounds will be evaluated in collaboration with Prof. Barrie Wilkinson
and Prof. Jean Chmielewski. (c) Ruthenium-catalyzed reactions relevant to polyketide
construction (allylation, crotylation, propargylation, etc.) will be developed. Optimization of these
methods will be assisted by computational studies performed by Prof. Kuo-Wei Huang. Thus,
our studies advance an integrated program in which methodological innovation informs
synthesis, and synthesis informs medicinal chemistry."
10762454,"Osteoarthritis (OA), a leading cause of disability in the elderly (aging OA), is a complex degenerative joint disease
involving articular cartilage degradation, chronic inflammation, and bone remodeling. In addition, joint injury can
trigger post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). The prevalence and severity of knee OA are higher in women than
men during aging, although female mice are more resistant to OA progression after injury. The scientific
challenge is the incomplete understanding of the sex-specific mechanisms regulating OA progression, which
hampers the development of disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs that can target the process. The scientific
goal of this project is to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying sex-difference in OA progression. We
discovered that retrotransposon Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1, or L1), a novel marker of cell
senescence, is closely associated with OA lesions in both human and mice. Further, L1 activation mechanism
is sex dependent. Activation of stress-inducible miR-365 stimulates L1 and OA progression in female but not in
male during aging. Furthermore, senostatics that target cell senescence inhibit OA progression by inhibiting L1,
which is repressed in chondrocytes but de-repressed in senescent MSCs in the joint. These data suggest that
senescent MSCs can be a key target for effective treatment of OA. The innovative hypothesis is that females
are more susceptible to early-onset and progression of OA during aging because stress signals stimulate L1,
which leads to MSC senescence, SASP inflammation, and joint degeneration in female. On the other hand, after
OA onset is triggered by injury, males are more susceptible to OA progression because of the higher basal levels
of L1 and IL-1β in male. If so, intervention of aging-OA progression in female and PTOA progression in male can
be achieved by repressing L1 using FDA-approved anti-viral drug nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
(NRTI). This hypothesis will be tested through three aims. First, we will define activation patterns of L1 and cell
senescence in OA cartilage lesions of male and female patients. Second, we will determine sex-specific
mechanisms regulating OA progression in aging OA and PTOA using the sex-specific OA progression mouse
models. Third, we will develop sex-specific intervention for NRTIs to inhibit OA progression. This study has high
impact because it uncovers fundamental mechanisms of OA disease disparity between men and women. It is
innovative because it represents a new and distinct direction for the field by revealing sex-specific regulation of
OA progression through addressing a previously unsuspected role of retrotransposons in these processes. It
has significant clinical and translational values. If successful, NRTIs, which are safe and readily available, can
be re-purposed for OA treatment in human. It will not only change the concepts that drive the OA research field,
but also greatly impact the clinical practice of how we treat OA patients."
10818601,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The proposed study (PETAL: Promoting Early intervention Timing and Attention to Language) aims to
determine the timing of a parent mediated intervention among infants with Increased Likelihood for Autism
(ILA) (at risk for autism by virtue of having an older sibling with autism) on communication and language
outcomes at 24 months. ILA infants are likely to experience delays in language with ~ 40% at risk for language
delay and/or later diagnosis of ASD. However, interventions for ILA infants remain rare and none of the current
interventions explicitly focus on language or include many infants from lower socioeconomic circumstances
who may be at even greater risk for language delays. Although enthusiasm is high for very early interventions
due to known brain plasticity in the first years of life, we do not know WHEN or with WHAT MEASURES to
determine if an intervention is appropriate for ILA infants who are not yet showing signs of autism or delay.
The overarching goal of the proposed study is to determine the optimal timing of very early
intervention for ILA infants (starting at 9, 12 or 15 months) that explicitly targets communication and
language. We will use a battery of brain- and behavioral-based markers to identify the combination of change
in language, behaviors and brain measures that predict expressive language outcomes at 24 months. 140 infants
beginning at 6 months of age will participate at two sites, Los Angeles and Boston areas with many from
traditionally marginalized and minoritized families. All parents will receive infant developmental monitoring
beginning at 6 months, and then using a four-phase, sequential multiple assignment randomized trial design,
parents will receive augmentation with a specialized language coaching intervention at 9, 12 or 15 months; all
infant parent dyads receive coaching by 15 months. A diverse sample of dyads will be recruited; assessments
will occur at home at 6-,9-,12-,15-, 18- and 24-months using brain-based EEG measures, social-
communication, and language measures. Intervention support will be provided by clinicians remotely. The
study addresses key questions of whether earlier intervention is better on primary language and secondary
outcomes of social communication behaviors that support language development (e.g., joint engagement,
vocalizations, words, object play) and which measures will inform the ideal transition to intervention on
language outcomes at 24 months. Moreover, using LENA to capture the home language environment, adult
word count and conversational turns will be examined for mediation on language outcome. Results of this
study have potential for determining when (9 vs 12 vs 15), and based on which measures (brain, language, or
their combination), to augment parental support with a specialized parent-mediated coaching intervention."

10770497,"Abstract
Sleep disturbances are prevalent in up to 45% of persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Based on the growing recognition that prodromal stages of Alzheimer’s disease
(MCI due to AD) are the optimal time for interventions aimed at modifying neurobiology, and sleep
disturbances are commonly observed during this stage, sleep interventions are an increasingly attractive
therapeutic target. Reduced percentage rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is characteristic of MCI due to AD
patients, even in early stages of the disease process, which is likely due to impairment of cholinergic
innervation necessary for the transition to REM sleep. The cholinergic system is involved in both AD pathology
and sleep-wake regulation, and thus interventions targeting cholinergic function have the potential to improve
AD-associated sleep disruption. The PI’s recently completed NIH R00 study discovered that lower plasma
choline levels and increased inflammation is associated with disrupted sleep in non-AD individuals. Preliminary
work from the PI and others show lower choline levels are also observed in patients with both MCI and AD. As
there is a known bidirectional relationship between sleep disturbances and cognitive impairment, our team has
previously proposed neuroinflammation as a potential mediator. Citicoline is an endogenous precursor of ACh
and phospholipids. While Citicoline has been found to improve memory in a recent randomized clinical trial, to
date, no studies have examined whether Citicoline improves REM sleep %, inflammatory, or AD biomarkers in
individuals with MCI due to AD. We hypothesize that supplementation of Citicoline will result in improvement in
% REM sleep, inflammation, and AD biomarkers. We will conduct a 3-month randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing Citicoline versus placebo in 100 (50 per group) individuals with MCI
due to AD. The first aim is to determine whether the Citicoline group shows improvements in % REM sleep and
plasma choline compared to the placebo group from baseline to follow up. The second aim is to determine
whether the Citicoline has reductions in inflammation (Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-
α)), and levels of AD biomarkers (CSF Aβ42/Aβ40, total tau and p-tau 181) compared to the placebo group from
baseline to follow up. We will test these hypotheses by leveraging an existing cohort from the Alzheimer’s
Disease Research Cohort (ADRC) of 100 individuals with MCI due to AD. Baseline and follow-up assessments
at 3 months will consist of sleep questionnaires, 2 nights of the Sleep Profiler PSG2 home sleep device, and 7
nights of wrist actigraphy. Investigators on our team have extensive experience in biomarkers, sleep, and
Alzheimer’s disease. Positive outcomes from this pilot project will show that Citicoline improves sleep,
inflammation, and AD biomarkers in persons with MCI due to AD, which will enable larger studies to confirm
these findings and improve the health and well-being of older adults."
10761707,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
With dire predictions of antibiotic resistance reaching a tipping point, it is imperative that novel, antibiotic-sparing
medicines are developed to avoid facing increasing deaths due to previously treatable common infections. This
project is focused on this mission by elucidating potential therapeutic targets critical in host-pathogen interactions
for urinary tract infections (UTI), one of the most common infections leading to significant antibiotic use and
economic burden. Over 11 million women suffer from UTIs in the U.S. per year. Further, 20-30% of women
diagnosed with a UTI will experience a recurrent UTI (rUTI) in the following months, resulting in a serious
deterioration in the quality of life through pain, discomfort, disruption of daily activities, and increased healthcare
cost. This problem is exacerbated by rising antimicrobial resistance among uropathogenic Escherichia coli
(UPEC), the cause of over 80% of uncomplicated UTIs. Rates of antibiotic resistance are confounding UTI
treatment for millions of women annually. One critical aspect of uropathogenesis is the ability of bacteria to bind
to host tissues to establish an infection or colonization. Gram-negative bacteria typically utilize adhesive
chaperone usher pathway (CUP) pili, tipped with adhesins that bind to receptors with stereochemical specificity,
mediating host and tissue tropisms. Pilus adhesins are two-domain molecules consisting of a C-terminal pilin
domain that links the adhesin to the pilus tip and an N-terminal receptor-binding domain. The pangenome of E.
coli alone encodes thirty-eight distinct CUP pilus types and single E. coli genomes encode as many as 16, each
likely mediating colonization of a particular habitat. However, only a handful of UPEC adhesins have been
investigated to date. Each of them play critical roles in particular niches. FimH mediates critical binding to
mannose residues on bladder tissue to promote invasion into superficial facet cells during acute cystitis; FmlH
mediates binding to galactose moieties on inflamed bladder epithelial tissue during chronic cystitis; PapG
mediates binding to human kidney during pyelonephritis; and UclD mediates colonization of the gut where UPEC
forms a reservoir. Catheterization increases the susceptibility of the urinary tract to infection with a wider variety
of strains, including Acinetobacter baumanii resulting in increasingly common multidrug resistant catheter-
associated UTIs (CAUTI). Acinetobacter baumanii are known to encode at least two CUP pili known to be
important in CAUTI. This proposal seeks to elucidate: i) the molecular dynamics of adhesin conformational
equilibriums that govern host-pathogen interactions; ii) structure-function correlates of UPEC CUP adhesins with
unknown functions; and iii) structure-function correlates of Acinetobacter baumanii CUP adhesins critical in
CAUTIs. This proposal will enhance the understanding of the mechanism of action of host-pathogen interactions
and elucidate opportunities to develop much needed antibiotic-sparing therapeutics that block the ability of these
uropathogens to colonize/infect host tissues such as mannosides for which a candidate has been chosen for
clinical trials."

We aim to provide advanced multidisciplinary research training in the emerging field of resuscitation science to
physician- and PhD-scientists to jump-start their progression to independence as investigators. Resuscitation
science is defined in this proposal as the medical treatment of ischemia-perfusion injury (i.e., cardiac arrest),
shock (i.e., tissue hypo-perfusion), acute lung injury, and subsequent other-organ injury such as renal
impairment. Collectively, these conditions afflict millions of patients every year and are associated with high
mortality and substantial morbidity. The proposed program will help alleviate a critical shortage of well-trained
and well-funded resuscitation science investigators. Most critically, the cross-discipline research training afforded
to program trainees should make them well-positioned to advance the field as a whole due to the common risk
factors, pathogenic mechanisms, and outcome phenotypes shared by conditions requiring resuscitation. The
strong multidisciplinary faculty/mentorship T32 program team is comprised of resuscitation scientists who excel
in both research and mentorship. Their expertise spans the fields of emergency medicine, cardiology,
nephrology, as well as pulmonary critical care, anesthesia critical care, surgical critical care, and pediatric critical
care. Research conducted by the mentorship team uses a wide spectrum of approaches which include clinical
trials, epidemiology/data science, and laboratory science, with many mentors combining two or more
approaches. Trainees in our program will focus their research training in one of these approaches; all will
however receive preliminary training in, and multidisciplinary exposure to, all three approaches. The NHLBI has
noted this sort of integration is critical for breakthrough advances in public health [1], and our emphasis on this
point will produce truly multidisciplinary, and in many cases translational investigators. The specific fellowship
training will combine a formalized didactic curriculum with a mentored project, training in research
communication, and career mentorship. The didactic program will draw from courses run by Harvard Catalyst
(CTSA), the Harvard School of Public Health, and the Center for Resuscitation Science and will include required
common and track-specific core courses and elective courses. Each fellow’s coursework will be individually
tailored to match personal objectives and goals developed with the mentorship team. The individualized
mentored research project will be designed and executed by the fellow under the guidance of his or her primary
mentor with assistance from other members of the program faculty. Fellows will be encouraged to collaborate
with mentors and fellows outside of their chosen track to broaden their research expertise. Training in
communication of research results through conference presentations and research papers, grant writing, and
general career development advice will be valuable additions to the core research training. At the completion of
this program fellows will be expected to meet defined metrics - multiple abstract presentations, manuscript
publications, and grant submissions - all key steps in their path toward research independence."
10991496,"DNA damage, particularly DNA double strand break (DSB), has detrimental effects on cell survival and
genomic stability. In response to DNA damage, the cell activates several evolutionarily-conserved
mechanisms to repair DNA damage, halt cell proliferation, or induce cell death. These surveillance
mechanisms, collectively defined as the DNA damage response (DDR), constitute an important etiological
factor for many human diseases, especially cancer. Moreover, the DDR is a key determinant for the
therapeutic outcome of cancer treatment using radiation and other DNA damaging agents. A long-term
goal of our laboratory is to delineate new DDR factors and mechanisms using comprehensive
experimental tools, and thereby, revealing new insights into cancer progression and treatment. In a recent
effort to systematically identify new components of the DSB “repairosome”, we identified Kif2C and several
other MT regulators as potential DSB-associated proteins. Kif2C is rapidly recruited to DNA damage sites
and plays an essential role in DSB repair. Strikingly, Kif2C mediates the spatial movement of DSBs, and
controls DNA damage-induced chromatin remodeling. These functions of Kif2C are largely dependent on
its MT depolymerase activity, and are likely to be achieved via coordination with other MT regulators. On
the other hand, DNA damage modulates Kif2C phosphorylation and MT stabilization. These findings
suggest a novel inter-organelle crosstalk between MT components and the DDR machinery that differs
from the conventional perception that MT functions exclusively as a cytoplasmic structure. These findings
also reveal new mechanistic insights into the clinical combinations of DNA damaging agents with anti-MT
poisons in cancer therapy. In this project, we will further reveal detailed mechanisms via which Kif2C
modulates the mobility of DSBs; we will uncover how Kif2C acts in concert with chromatin remodelers and
other MT regulators to govern the dynamic chromatin compaction at damage chromatin; we will
functionally characterize ATM-mediated Kif2C phosphorylation, and regulation of MT stabilization after
DNA damage. Together, the project will potentially provide paradigm shifting additions to both the DDR
and MT biology, and improve our understanding of how the cell coordinates various cellular components
and mechanisms to maintain genomic stability and cell homeostasis after DNA damage."
10753566,"Project Summary
A normal and robust immune system relies on the development of cells with diverse repertoire of antigen
recognition but that remain tolerant of self-tissues. Breakdown of this immune tolerance can give rise to
autoimmune disease, and hence multiple mechanisms are in place to ensure immune self-tolerance. The thymus
is a critical site for the development and education of T cells to promote tolerance to self through expression of
tissue specific antigens (TSAs) by specialized medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). The transcriptional
regulators Aire and Fezf2 are known to act within mTECs to promote the expression of thousands of TSA self-
antigens for the purpose of removing developing self-reactive T cells in a process known as negative selection.
Aire and Fezf2 are shown to be required for some, but not all TSA genes expressed in mTECs, suggesting
additional transcriptional regulators are required for the full repertoire of the observed TSA expression in mTECs.
Furthermore, recent work has highlighted the complexity of mTECs with at least four mTEC populations: Aire+
mTECs, Ccl21a mTECs, Late/Post Aire mTECs, and tuft cells. However, there is limited knowledge about the
developmental regulation and progenitors of these heterogeneous mTEC subsets. We have identified the
transcription factor Ikaros (Ikzf1) as a novel regulator of mTEC composition and function, with deletion of Ikaros
in mTECs causing a reduction of Aire+ mTECs and an expansion of tuft cells. Moreover, Ikaros-deficient mTECs
have a defect in TSA gene expression resulting in specific signs of autoimmunity. Interestingly, mutations in
IKZF1 have been linked to human autoimmune diseases. Thus, we hypothesize a novel role for Ikaros in
mTEC lineage development, TSA expression and central tolerance, and that defects in mTEC function could
contribute to the autoimmunity seen in humans with IKZF1 mutations. We propose to test our hypothesis and
increase our knowledge of this novel mTEC transcriptional regulator through the following specific aims: (1)
Identify the stage(s) of mTEC development at which Ikaros modulates mTEC function, (2) Interrogate the
molecular mechanism of Ikaros function in mTECs, and (3) Determine if TEC specific deletion of Ikaros affects
T cell tolerance and autoimmunity. To complete these aims, we have developed a unique and powerful set of
genetic tools and mouse reporter lines that allow us to perturb Ikaros function in mTECs. We will use flow
cytometry to investigate mTEC and thymic immune cell phenotypes, combined scRNA-seq/scATAC-seq to
analyze gene expression and chromatin accessibility, and supplement with mechanistic studies in vitro in cell
lines. Our long-term goal is to increase our understanding of the regulation of mTEC development and function
in central tolerance, and how alterations can lead to a break of tolerance and autoimmunity."
10831419,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for over 30,000 deaths annually in the United States and current
therapies provide negligible clinical benefit. Factors that epigenetically silence HCC tumor suppressor genes are
expected to promote tumor development and thus may provide novel therapeutic targets. The histone
methyltransferase EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), a master regulator
of epigenetic silencing. EZH2 is mutated or overexpressed in a variety of malignancies and has been shown to
function as an oncogene in some cancers. Efficacious small molecule inhibitors of EZH2 have been developed
and have shown promising results in clinical trials for certain EZH2-driven cancers and recently received FDA
approval for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma and follicular lymphoma. Based upon analysis of HCC patient
samples, and experiments involving cultured HCC cells and mouse models of HCC, we have found that EZH2
is an HCC oncogene that is an intrinsic driver of tumor development. This intrinsic oncogenic activity of EZH2 is
due, at least in part, to epigenetic silencing of an ERK-specific phosphatase, DUSP6, resulting in activation of a
mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway that stimulates cellular proliferation. Furthermore, we have
demonstrated, in two published studies from our group, that EZH2 suppresses the ability of natural killer (NK)
cells to eradicate cultured HCC cells by epigenetically silencing the gene encoding ULBP1, a tumor cell-surface
activating ligand for NK cells, and suppresses NK cell migration to HCC cells by epigenetically silencing the gene
encoding the chemokine CXCL10. Thus, our published and preliminary results suggest that EZH2 drives HCC
tumor development through both a cell intrinsic mechanism (activation of a MAP kinase pathway that stimulates
cellular proliferation) and a cell extrinsic mechanism (inhibition of NK cell-mediated tumor eradication). In this
application our objectives are to establish these two roles of EZH2 in HCC mouse models, determine the
molecular pathways through which EZH2 promotes tumor growth, and evaluate EZH2 as an HCC drug target.
In specific aim 1, we will establish that EZH2 promotes HCC tumor growth by suppressing NK cell-mediated anti-
tumor immunity in humanized mice, and define the roles of CXCL10 and ULBP1 as critical EZH2 targets whose
epigenetic silencing suppresses NK cell-mediated eradication of HCC. In specific aim 2, we will establish DUSP6
as a critical EZH2 target gene whose epigenetic silencing promotes HCC tumor growth through increased
ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In specific aim 3, we will evaluate pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 alone and in
combination with other anti-cancer agents as a potential HCC therapy. Collectively, the results of the experiments
proposed in this application will elucidate the cell intrinsic and cell extrinsic pathways through which EZH2
promotes HCC tumor growth, and evaluate new therapeutic approaches for HCC."
10899439,"Summary
The capsid of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) is a 120-homodimer T=4 icosahedron. In vivo, it self-assembles,
packages viral RNA, serves as a metabolic compartment for DNA synthesis, and trafficks within the cell.
Its assembly and disassembly have become targets for potent antivirals. In the previous funding period,
we characterized assembly and disassembly with purified protein using structural, single molecule, and
bulk studies of assembly products and reactions. We characterized the allosteric transitions that activated
assembly, demonstrated the importance of reversibility during self-association for fidelity, and identified
roles of nucleation for directing the assembly path.
In this proposal, we develop hypotheses to take advantage of these results to engineer virus-like particles
with programmable assembly, cargo packaging, delivery, and release. In preliminary studies, we
developed a method for targeting cargo to a capsid by linking the cargo to a small molecule that binds
capsid with high affinity, essentially using an antiviral as a targeting device. This method can be applied to
any cargo. In some cases, it is desirable to display cargo on the capsid exterior, in other cases it is desirable
to package it within the capsid. In preliminary data, we demonstrate an approach to making “holey” capsids
that expose the particle interior and can be re-sealed to enclose the contents. Using this same technology,
we can make patches on the capsid surface; this can be used for displaying patches of receptor-binding
ligands or cell-penetrating peptides. Cargo, packaged within a capsid, is not deliverable unless it can be
released. In preliminary data, we developed techniques for triggering capsid disassembly in response to
redox potential, taking advantage of chemically-induced metastability. This same approach can be applied
to other triggering signals. The ultimate goal of these studies is to combine the approaches to a practical
end: we propose to build two model biotech reagents, one to measure antibody levels and the other to
deliver packaged cargo to specific cells. These approaches are each built on an understanding of the
biochemistry and biophysics of HBV capsid assembly.
HBV is one the smallest human pathogens. It is remarkably efficient at packaging its genome and delivering
it to target cells. Based on our understanding of capsid assembly and capsid biophysics, we will develop
approaches to specifically packaging cargo molecules and delivering these reagents intracellularly. The
tools arising from this research will provide a means for man to take advantage of HBV."

resistant to antibiotics. Failure to characterize the biochemical machinery that drives biofilm dispersal risks
missing key targets for treatment of infectious disease. Although nitric oxide (NO)-triggered biofilm dispersal in

documented, the underlying biochemical processes responsible are not understood. To bridge this knowledge
gap, a long-term goal of the PI is to determine the mechanism of NO signaling in bacteria and to use this
knowledge to develop therapeutic strategies to disperse biofilms. In her previous RO1 funding period, the PI
established the NosP (NO sensing protein) family of hemoproteins, which were discovered in her laboratory, as
NO sensors that regulate biofilm in many bacteria. Based on studies from the previous funding period, the
objective of the proposed work is to characterize the NosP-associated histidine kinase (NahK) and determine
the molecular mechanism underlying NO/NosP/NahK regulation of biofilm and virulence in PA. It is hypothesized
that NO produced downstream of RsmA binds NosP to trigger biofilm dispersal through NahK and the GacS/Rsm
MKN. The GacS/Rsm MKN integrates signals from many sensor kinases to control RsmA, the master regulator
of motility/acute infection v. biofilm/chronic infection in PA. The proposal is innovative because it challenges the
established GacS/Rsm MKN and forges new logical connections between anaerobic respiration, NO, biofilm,
and virulence. This proposal is significant because elucidation of the basis for NO signaling in PA will open new
therapeutic opportunities for controlling infection caused by this important human pathogen. The hypothesis will
be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to identify NosP/NahK interactions within the GacS/Rsm MKN; (2)
to delineate the role of NosP/NahK in modulation of RsmA-controlled phenotypes; and (3) to establish the link
between RsmA-regulated denitrification and NosP/NahK signaling. Under aim 1, NahK protein-protein and
phosphotransfer interactions with GacS/Rsm MKN members will be characterized as a function of NO/NosP
regulation. Under aim 2, the effect of NO/NosP/NahK on virulence, quorum sensing, and cyclic-di-GMP pathways
controlled by the RsmA will be quantified. Under aim 3, the effect of NO/NosP/NahK on RsmA-controlled
denitrification will be quantified and investigated as a regulatory feedback loop. The PI has significant experience
with the proposed assays. Upon completion of these aims, NO/NosP/NahK is expected to be established in
controlling the GacS/Rsm motility/virulence switch. This would represent a fundamentally important discovery,
defining a new signaling pathway and novel antibiotic targets, for which there is a pressing need, especially
considering the increased antibiotic resistance typically seen in biofilming organisms. NO-triggered biofilm
dispersal has been widely observed in bacteria, so clinical interventions based on NO signaling have the potential
for widespread application, furthering the significance of this project."

 We propose a collaborative research project in psychology, child development, and behavioral economics
investigating the comparability and predictive power of measures of human potential that are regularly used in these
fields. Using data collected on common measures of personality traits, executive function (EF) skills, and economic
preferences across multiple countries, we will apply rigorous statistical methodology to investigate the relationships
among these attributes beginning in pre-adolescence and assess which dimensions best predict health, wellbeing,
educational outcomes, wages, and workforce decisions. We will also examine the stability and malleability of child and
adolescent traits, skills, and preferences across environments with different contexts and incentive structures. (1) We
examine the commonality of traits, and (2) their uniqueness, and (3) the evolution of unique and common traits. We will
examine additional measures beyond the traditional ones (for example Guanxi, a trait capturing sociability that is widely
used in China) to examine their relationship with the standard measures, and whether they have additional predictive
power.
 Personality traits, EF skills, and economic preferences in childhood and adolescence are important predictors of
adult outcomes, including physical and mental health, educational attainment, and employment. Measures of these
attributes, such as perseverance and time preference, are increasingly used to evaluate the impacts of childhood
interventions, monitor progress in school, forecast health outcomes, and study economic and social inequality. However,
little is known about how traits, skills, and preferences evolve and co-evolve across childhood and adolescence.
 This grant will support collaborative efforts to measure child and adolescent personality traits, EF skills, and
economic preferences drawing on expertise from the Center for the Economics of Human Development (University of
Chicago), the Educational Testing Service, the briq Institute on Behavior & Inequality (University of Bonn), the Institute
of Child Development (University of Minnesota), and the Institute for Economic and Social Research (Jinan University).
Using existing data combined with new data collection, we will explore the relationships across elicited trait, skill, and
preference measures to determine the extent to which different measurement schemes capture common or distinct aspects
of human differences, and if these relationships vary across cultures, gender, ethnicity, and race. Our analysis will
standardize across the measures to account for factors that influence responses, leading to increased comparability. We
will use our elicited measures and the latent factors underlying them to predict performance in school (e.g., absenteeism,
grades, promotion, behavioral problems, graduation), health (e.g., physical, emotional, social), and wages, employment,
and occupation. We will examine the stability and evolution of the elicited measures, the malleability of traits, skills, and
preferences, the factors that predict these measures (including institutional and family background and parental influences
on their children), and the correlates of stability and change throughout childhood and adolescence."

 Formation of vascular lumen of appropriate size, or tubulogenesis, is one of critical steps during
vascular development. Many vascular diseases including venous malformations are associated with malformed
or enlarged lumens. However, we still have a limited understanding of molecular events that regulate vascular
lumen size.
 Abelson (Abl) kinase signaling regulates diverse processes during development and disease, including
cytoskeletal reorganization required for cell morphogenesis, cell motility, adhesion and polarity. Abl signaling in
different cell types can induce activation of Rho GTPases, which are known key regulators of lumen formation.
However, the role of Abl signaling in regulating vascular lumen size has not been previously investigated.
 Src homology 2 domain containing E (She) protein was originally identified as a highly conserved
factor, which interacted with Abl kinase. We have previously demonstrated that She is specifically expressed in
embryonic vasculature in zebrafish embryos. However, its biological function is still unknown in any organism.
 Here we obtained preliminary data which argues that She acts as a novel regulator of vascular lumen
size. Zebrafish mutant embryos deficient in she function display enlarged vascular lumen within the dorsal
aorta. Similarly, human vascular endothelial cells, deficient in SHE function, form enlarged tubes. Our
preliminary data further suggest that She functions as a novel regulator of Abl signaling, and argue that ABL
signaling and lumen formation are misregulated in human venous malformation (VM), suggesting a potential
role for ABL and SHE in human disease. We hypothesize that SHE is a novel adaptor protein which functions
in the ABL kinase signaling pathway to restrict lumen size during vascular tubulogenesis. We further
hypothesize that SHE overexpression may reduce lumen size in VM leading to a novel therapeutic approach.
 The following specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which She regulates tubulogenesis; 2) Determine if She restricts lumen size by inhibiting Abl kinase signaling
pathway; 3) Determine if She overexpression can reduce lumen size in VM. Zebrafish embryos deficient in
she function will be analyzed for cellular and molecular defects in vascular tubulogenesis. Conservation of She
function will be tested in human vascular endothelial cells. The role of Abl kinase signaling in tubulogenesis
and its interaction with She will be analyzed using chemical inhibitors, genetic mutants and biochemical assays
in zebrafish embryos and human cells. The therapeutic potential of SHE to reduce the size of vascular lumen
will be analyzed in the cell culture and mouse VM model as well as in primary cells isolated from VM patients.
Obtained results will identify the role for SHE and ABL signaling during normal and pathological tubulogenesis,
which may lead to the development of novel strategies to treat vascular malformations."
10746855,"ABSTRACT
KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated genes in human cancers. Despite advances in the development of
inhibitors that directly target mutant KRAS and the FDA approval of KRASG12C inhibitor sotorasib for KRASG12C-
mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), cancer cell adaptation and resistance to KRAS inhibitors are almost
inevitable and remains a major challenge that limits their clinical benefits. Our preliminary data establish
proteostasis reprogramming as an essential mechanism that mediates tumor resistance to KRAS inhibitor.
Inactivation of oncogenic KRAS rapidly downregulates both the heat shock response (HSR) and IRE1a branch
of the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, only IRE1a is selectively reactivated in KRASi-resistant
tumors. Genetic or pharmacologic suppression of IRE1a substantially sensitizes KRASG12C-mutant tumors to
sotorasib, leading to complete and durable responses in preclinical NSCLC and pancreatic cancer models.
Mechanistically, we found that oncogenic KRAS-MAPK signaling promotes IRE1a protein stability through direct
ERK-IRE1a interaction. In contrast, multiple mechanisms of resistance to KRASi, including reactivated ERK and
hyperactivated AKT, converge to re-activate IRE1a in resistant tumors. These findings provide a framework to
seek biological insight into the proteostasis reprogramming in KRAS-mutant cancers, and to further explore the
effects of pharmacological inhibition of proteostasis reprogramming as an anti-tumor approach for KRAS-mutant
cancers. We hypothesize that IRE1a-mediated proteostasis reprogramming facilitates tumor resistance to
oncogenic KRAS inhibition and that multiple resistance pathways converge with IRE1a to restore proteostasis
and promote therapy resistance to KRAS inhibitors. This proposal will determine the molecular mechanisms of
differential IRE1a regulation in response to mutant KRAS inhibition (Aim 1), define proteostasis machinery
crosstalk between HSR and UPR in KRAS-mutant cancers (Aim 2), and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of
targeting proteostasis reprogramming to overcome KRASi resistance in KRAS-mutant cancers (Aim 3).
Accomplishing these aims will establish the biological significance and biochemical basis of oncogenic signaling
regulated proteostasis network in KRAS-mutant human cancers, leading to development of more effective and
well-tolerated therapeutic strategy to reverse KRASi resistance and bypass the on-target toxicity of targeting
multiple resistance signaling pathways.

Obesity increases both the incidence and severity of asthma. Obesity-related asthma is associated with more
frequent symptom exacerbations and hospitalizations, which respond poorly to current asthma medications
leading to increased healthcare costs and decreased quality of life. The molecular mechanisms of obesity-related
asthma are yet to be defined, making effective prevention and management of this disease difficult.
Parasympathetic and sensory nerves control airway tone and mediate reflex bronchoconstriction. This proposal
builds on our previous discoveries that 1) increased insulin, associated with obesity, causes airway
hyperreactivity mediated by the vagus nerve in obese rats, 2) that asthma severity is associated with
increased density of sensory nerves in the lung, and 3) that obese mice with high levels of insulin have
increased reflex bronchoconstriction and increased sensory innervation supplying airway epithelia.
Thus, we hypothesize that increased insulin, as seen in obesity, potentiates airway hyperreactivity by changing
both sensory and parasympathetic nerves, and that these changes are mediated by insulin receptors on airway
nerves. We propose to test whether airway hyperreactivity in obese mice is mediated by increased activation of
sensory nerves or parasympathetic nerves or a combination of both, and identify how insulin may change neural
control. We will also measure insulin-related changes in airway parasympathetic and sensory nerve structure
and density, and changes in neurotransmitter expression and release. Finally, we will identify cell signaling
pathways by which insulin promotes sensory innervation and neurotransmitter expression. This project uses
cutting edge, innovative techniques developed in our labs, and will significantly increase our understanding
of underlying mechanisms by which obese patients with increased insulin are more prone to have asthma with
increased severity. The long-term goal of the proposed research is to facilitate identification of novel therapeutic
targets for prevention and treatment of obesity-related asthma."

10755731,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Recent studies have revealed an abundance of resident memory T cells (TRM) specific for viral infections in a
wide range of tumors, often outnumbering cancer-specific T cells. As these cells lack specificity to tumor
antigens, they are spared from the hallmark exhaustion/dysfunction of tumor-specific T cells. To this end, we
developed a novel immunotherapy which taps into immunostimulatory virus-specific TRM functions through
treatment with viral peptides to break the immunosuppressive tumor environment. Reactivating virus-specific
TRM with peptide was sufficient to restrict tumor growth in mice and when combined with checkpoint blockade,
promoted durable tumor clearance. Mice that cleared tumors were protected from tumor re-challenge, suggesting
anti-tumor immunity was established. Virus-specific TRM represent a major part of the tumor immune environment
and can be leveraged therapeutically, yet there is a clinically significant gap in knowledge regarding the
mechanisms of tumor clearance and how to optimally harness these cells. The objectives in this proposal are to
determine (i) mechanism of tumor cell killing and durable tumor immunity, (ii) the impact of viral specificity on
TRM function and therapeutic efficacy, and iii) define the optimal modality to reactivate virus-specific TRM. Using
both mouse and human systems, this study addresses an innovative perspective connecting antiviral memory
cells to tumor immunotherapy using cutting edge methods. We will complement mouse studies with
combinatorial tetramer staining to enable simultaneous profiling of T cells specific for an expanded panel of
viruses and vaccines in patient tumors. Completion of these aims will advance our understanding of tumor
immunosurveillance and TRM function in mice and humans, and identify new target T cell populations for tumor
immunotherapy. This contribution is expected to be significant because it will provide a strong scientific
framework to expand the efficacy and utility of virus-specific TRM therapy, and enable the development of novel
strategies leveraging these potent immune activating cells."
10827863,"In addition to the increasingly well understood repertoire of mutations in coding sequences of oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes, genome-wide sequencing of human cancers has revealed abundant mutations in
non-coding sequences. Some of these non-coding mutations are found in regulatory sequence elements
(promoters, enhancers, insulators) that determine gene expression. However, even when found in such
sequences, most of these mutations are expected to be neutral, i.e., passengers, with only a small percentage
having a functional impact. Here we seek to address the challenge of identifying oncogenic non-coding
mutations, focusing on a common and difficult to treat human hematologic malignancy, multiple myeloma
(MM). Our approach entails combined genetic-epigenetic mapping, focusing on allele-specific DNA methylation
(ASM), followed by functional assays. We will perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-genome
bisulfite sequencing (WGBS; methyl-seq) in 30 MM cases, representing two of the most common molecular
subtypes of this cancer, each paired with non-neoplastic peripheral blood B cells from the same patients. This
procedure will identify differentially methylated regions with ASM (ASM DMRs) that have arisen de novo in the
tumor cells due to somatic mutations that destroy or create transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in
promoter/enhancer elements or CTCF sites in insulator elements. These findings will nominate candidate
functional non-coding mutations, which have declared their functional activity by conferring the local physical
asymmetry, namely ASM, between mutant and wild-type alleles. We will vet these mutations for functional
effects by creating them in MM cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, followed by epigenetic and
biological assays on the isogenic pairs of wild-type and mutant cell lines. Using our mapping approach in a
small pilot series of paired samples from MM patients, we have already identified candidate regulatory
mutations, including a point mutation in a putative enhancer element of the TEAD1 gene, which we have
functionally validated as producing loss of methylation of its flanking CpGs. Lastly, we will test for recurrence of
mutations in the same regulatory sequences in several hundred MM cases in our tumor banks, apply
bioinformatic approaches to determine whether the de novo ASM-associated mutations, even if not highly
recurrent, preferentially participate in biological pathways that drive MM progression, and study sequential
clinical samples to determine whether additional non-coding regulatory mutations in these same pathways
arise during MM disease progression. Our overall goals are to develop and validate a highly practical and
generalizable approach for identifying functional non-coding mutations in human cancers, and to use the
specific data from this project to identify new targets for treatment of MM."

Abstract:
Despite the vast and ever-growing scientific literature on the efficacy of behavior, social, and structural
interventions, interpreting the scientific literature is challenging. Identifying relevant studies is time intensive.
The quality of research from published reports requires careful analysis. There are conflicting findings across
studies. Metrics and study designs used across studies are typically inconsistent. Pooling results across
studies also requires advanced statistical techniques. The state-of-the-art strategy to address these challenges
is to use systematic reviews and meta-analyses to analyze and interpret the effects of interventions evidenced
with research across multiple studies. In the prposed study we will conduct systematic reviews and meta-
analyses on studies from LMIC that focus on behavioral, social, or structural interventions. There are three key
areas we will analyze: (1) interventions designed to support linkage, retention, and adherence to ART and
PrEP with a focus on modes of service delivery; (2) interventions that integrate non-HIV health issues with HIV-
specific health issues; and (3) assessing the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on HIV-related care and
prevention in LMIC. In addition, we will add to our rigorous data extraction information on both the theoretical
basis of the interventions under consideration, as well as data on the implementation characteristics of each
intervention. Data extraction on implementation characteristics and theory will also be done retrospectively for
all 435 studies we have previously reviewed and added to our data repository."

Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one
solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As
observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding,
strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor.
Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to
identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how
genetic variation within those elements influences their function.
To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate
noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of
the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of
regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory
mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment.
Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics,
technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific
aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect”
psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing
screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and
validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ
cases with high genetic risk scores.
Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental
approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ.
In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding
variation contributes to complex human phenotypes."

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death due to birth defects. Despite its frequency,
identifying genetic causes of CHD has been challenging. Mendelian inheritance of sporadic (nonsyndromic) CHD
is rare. Instead, the genetic architecture of CHD is characterized by non-penetrance, variable expressivity, and
likely oligogenic effects. Although genome wide association studies, trio, and family-based studies have been
utilized, there has been little emphasis on examining epistasis, additive effects, or mutational burden.
Furthermore, although an improved understanding of cardiac development has identified genes and pathways
that underlie CHD in animal models, this knowledge has not always translated readily into an understanding of
disease causation in human CHD. In order to improve our ability to predict risk for CHD and prognosis, it is
important to identify new genes and pathways that contribute to sporadic CHD and integrate functional genomics
for variant analysis with developmental biology for mechanistic understanding. We propose to address these
critical needs through investigation of a novel gene causing cardiac malformations, SHROOM3, and delineation
of its interactome, as an exemplar leveraging human genomics and developmental biology. The aims of this
study are to: 1) test the hypothesis that cardiogenesis requires SHROOM3 interaction with planar cell polarity
(PCP) proteins and downstream effectors. The outcome of this aim will identify cell- and tissue-specific
consequences of loss of Shroom3, identify its interactome and consequence of its genetic interactions on CHD;
and 2) test the hypothesis that rare variants in genes encoding PCP signaling and downstream effector proteins
are enriched in patients with CHD. The outcome of this aim will functionally validate SHROOM3 rare variants
and identify genes and pathways important for the susceptibility to CHD. Using a combination of functional
genomics to define the impact of rare variants, mechanistic studies using mouse models, and human genetics,
these studies will collectively define the role of SHROOM3 in heart development and the contribution of
SHROOM3 and PCP pathway members to the genetic architecture of CHD."

THE IMPACTS OF ENHANCED DRUG-PATENT EXAMINATION
The legal patentability requirements are designed to respect the balance between patient access to existing
longevity-improving drugs and incentivizing their existence in the first place. However, the patent system may
fail to achieve this balance if it does not provide patent examiners with the resources—mainly, time—needed to
apply these patentability standards. Given the legal presumption of validity of incoming patent applications,
insufficient examination time may lead to concerns that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) will issue
patents on non-novel or obvious innovations, a result which may unnecessarily inhibit patient access and
thereby compromise patient outcomes. Patent quality concerns of this nature have been particularly
paramount in the case of “secondary” patents—i.e., patents on subsidiary drug features such as on routes of
administration. Given that secondary patent applications are often filed years after the issuance of the active-
ingredient patent, they have the potential to meaningfully extend the effective patent lives of given drug
products, potentially limiting access on the margin to clinically valuable drugs. In this project, we propose to
investigate the full extent to which secondary patenting practices may be extending effective patent lives of
FDA-approved drugs. Further, drawing on certain PTO reforms and features, we will investigate the impacts of
increasing examination time on drug-patent examination quality. In particular, we will address four aims:
  Compiling, reviewing and coding data from both the PTO and the FDA, we will build a database of
 small-molecule drug patents associated with FDA-approved drug products from the mid-1980s to the
 present, containing various information associated with each such patent, including information (if any)
 on claims associated with secondary drug features.
  We will similarly build a database of large-molecule drug patents, though this effort will likely require a
 deeper and more extensive review of raw PTO materials given the lack of a congressionally mandated
 list of biologics-related patents associated with FDA-approvals.
  Using these data and employing various quasi-experimental approaches, we will estimate the
 relationship between the examination time allotted to examiners and the likelihood that the patents they
 issue meet the legal patentability requirements.
  Drawing on the results from Aim #3, we will run simulation exercises to assess the degree to which an
 increase in examination time will shorten the effective patent lives of approved FDA drug products and
 thereafter draw on various estimated moments from the generic-entry literature to estimate the resulting
 effects on increased/accelerated patient access to approved medications."

The research project proposed here addresses the pressing need for better statistical models and methods to
analyze the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME). TME data has demonstrated there is clear
clinical and biological importance in the spatial architecture, e.g. as a determinant of response to treatment and
metastasis. Given the recognized importance of the TME in cancer, technology has advanced at pace to profile
the spatial properties of tumors using high resolution measurements including spatial transcriptomics and
proteomics. However, the requisite computational methods to fully interpret these measurements are lagging.
Accordingly, in Aim 1 we will develop a statistical framework, which we call BayesTME to model the TME at
multiple scales, ranging from the level of individual cells to top-level patient stratification. We will develop
BayesTME as a suite of innovative statistical methods for Bayesian multiscale spatial modeling that would enable
a new class of spatial statistical models to quantitatively evaluate the properties of the TME. We have gathered
a diverse and scaled collection of spatial profiling datasets upon which to test, benchmark and evaluate
BayesTME. In developing BayesTME, we will create modular tools in Aim 2 that can use the same statistical
concepts across different technologies such as multiplexed immunofluorescence, imaging mass cytometry and
spatial transcriptomics. This will permit statistical integration of datasets that may have been generated with
diverse sets of technology. In addition, we will include an extension to the base BayesTME to identify recurrent
spatial properties across a cohort of samples, enabling discovery and quantitative description of spatial
communities that related to specific cancer phenotypes. Finally, in Aim 3 we propose a validation experiment
that will generate parallel spatial profiling data–in the form of spatial transcriptomics and imaging mass cytometry
from the same ovarian cancer specimens. This dataset will help to address a critical question in ovarian cancer
which is how TME dynamics enable bowel metastasis - a major determinant of morbidity and mortality for women
with ovarian cancer. In summary, the goals of this proposal are to develop a robust, new class of statistical
methods for analyzing the spatial architecture of the TME, generate robust open-source software enabling
application of our methods across multiple spatial profiling techniques, and validate our methods and software
by using them to conduct large-scale data analyses investigating novel biological hypotheses regarding the
spatial architecture of the TME. Accomplishing these goals will lead to new quantitative encoding of the
properties of the TME that are statistically grounded that will in turn lead to a new class of spatial biomarkers to
define malignant phenotypes in cancer."
10883555,"Musculoskeletal simulations that quantify muscle forces during movements, rigorously validated in empirical
studies, have great potential to improve life-long mobility for many persons. However, current musculoskeletal
simulations generally suffer from physiologically inaccurate muscle models that hinder reliable prediction of
time-varying muscle force, which limits their quality and usefulness in the clinic. Although other factors are
known to hinder muscle model accuracy, we hypothesize that a fundamental cause is the absence of tissue
mass in musculoskeletal models. Inactive muscle mass is most relevant to submaximal activities of daily living
(ADL), significantly limiting muscle shortening velocity, work, and power output. Our pilot data show that
significant interactions occur between inactive mass, fiber arrangement, and muscle bulging that fundamentally
affect muscle contractile properties. This proposal will quantify the effects of muscle size and inactive mass on
in situ twitch time, peak shortening velocity, and work for different-sized and -shaped muscles in mice, rats,
and goats (1000-fold size range); as well as in comparison to small fiber bundles from these muscles. Our
comprehensive contractile property results from animal studies will inform the design of mass-sensitive muscle
models, which will be incorporated into computationally efficient musculoskeletal simulations (numbering
19,600 cycles – 104 more than studies previously published) of human movement to test how muscle size,
inactive mass, shape, and fiber type affect the activations needed to execute ADL and gait across the lifespan.
SA1 addresses how muscle inactive mass and size affect contractile performance via in situ and in vitro
studies of parallel-fibered animal muscles; testing [H1a] that more inactive muscle mass, due to submaximal
activation (i.e., ADL), yields slower muscle shortening and reduced mass-specific work output, and [H1b] that
these effects will be exacerbated for larger muscles and for whole muscles, as compared to fiber bundles.
SA2 addresses how fiber arrangement interacts with inactive mass to influence work in different-sized pennate
mouse, rat, and goat muscles, with comparisons to parallel-fibered muscles (SA1), testing the hypothesis [H2]
that pennate muscles will be less sensitive to inactive muscle mass caused by submaximal activation and
show smaller reductions in shortening velocity and work, compared to parallel-fibered muscles.
SA3 addresses how muscle size affects activation and function across ADL and gait dynamics via simulations
of human movement that build mass-enhanced muscle models into OpenSim simulations with computationally
efficient direct collocation to compare differently size-scaled human musculoskeletal models (1 - 1/1000th body
mass). These simulations will test the hypotheses: [H3a] that larger muscles generate less work with lower
efficiency than smaller muscles, and [H3b] that reduced work with increased mass is more pronounced for fast
muscle. Incorporating muscle mass and fiber-types in musculoskeletal simulations therefore stands to predict
greater reliance on activations of slower muscle fibers to achieve gait and activities of daily living."

The benefits of kidney and liver transplantation should be available to all Americans, but geographic,
racial/ethnic, gender, and other disparities, plus a shortage of transplantable organs, have frustrated that
promise. Because organ allocation is a complex system in which every factor prioritized affects how other
factors are prioritized, policy changes that focus on one aspect (e.g. geographic disparity or panel reactive
antibody) in isolation often fail. Prior allocation changes have often resulted in unintended consequences. The
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) has resolved to eliminate geographic boundaries in
favor of continuous allocation through implementation of a composite allocation score (CAS). However,
eliminating geographic boundaries impacts the rest of the system. To design a CAS for continuous allocation
that retains priorities of the current system without introducing unintended disparities requires simulation
optimization methods. These methods will maximize the survival benefit of transplantation while ensuring
equity by making transplant rates similar among populations that differ by race, gender, and social
determinants of health. To address the challenge of kidney and liver continuous allocation, we propose to
efficiently apply simulation and explore a vast number of alternative designs to choose a CAS that eliminates
geographic boundaries, as per the OPTN mandate, without inducing unintended new disparities. This system
will minimize waitlist deaths and maximize life-years gained from transplant, while assuring transplant rates for
relevant subgroups (e.g. by age, race, ABO blood type, urban/rural) comparable to the current system. We
then propose to improve on the CAS by making incidence rate ratios (the relative transplant rates between
races, genders, sensitization levels, etc.) closer to 1. Whether perfect equity along all these dimensions can be
achieved is an open question, but we will attempt to equalize access for every candidate. Finally, we will
explore ways the CAS might minimize discard of transplantable organs. We will use previously unavailable
timestamp data on organ offers to create a logistics and discard simulation that will predict how allocation
changes impact cold ischemia time and discards for the first time. Using this new tool, we will test prioritizing
offers to centers and candidates most likely to accept them, while maintaining equity of access. The score can
adapt flexibly as transplant center acceptance criteria change. Our findings will be immediately and directly
applicable to national conversations regarding kidney and liver allocation, using an approach that optimizes
outcomes and supports transparency, an ethical cornerstone in transplantation. Our methodology allows
stakeholders to enforce constraints on equity and outcomes in clinically detailed simulations of organ
allocation. In this era of continuous allocation, we can achieve more transplants–and assure they are more
equitably distributed–than ever before."

The nation’s first healthy checkout policy was implemented in Berkeley, CA in 2021 and will be enforced in
2022, presenting an opportunity to understand policy effects on diet quality. This policy prohibits high-sugar
and high-sodium products from checkouts, an area known for impulse purchasing. By potentially lowering
consumption of sugary beverages, sweets, and salty snacks—the most common items at checkout—this policy
could reduce population risk of obesity and types 2 diabetes. Voluntary checkout standards adopted in other
countries have successfully decreased purchases of unhealthy foods and beverages and increased purchases
of healthy ones, indicating that a mandatory healthy checkout policy could meaningfully improve diet quality.
However, because Berkeley’s policy is the first of its kind, there are no studies on the degree to which a
healthy checkout policy changes store food environments and the healthfulness of food and beverage
purchases—an objective proxy for population diet quality. This research will evaluate the long-term impact of
the nation’s first healthy checkout policy on the healthfulness of store food environments and purchases. By
leveraging a natural experiment, these outcomes will be compared between Berkeley stores and stores in
three comparison cities using synthetic control and difference-in-differences methods. The first aim is to assess
the impact of the policy on store environments at checkout and elsewhere in the store, including the
prevalence of unhealthy and healthy products and their contents of added sugar, calorie, and sodium in all 26
intervention stores and a random sample of 81 comparison stores. The second aim is to assess policy impact
on purchases of (a) small sizes of snack foods and beverages commonly sold at checkout and (b) all sizes of
these products (which accounts for substitution) using store- and product- level sales data from 16 intervention
and 172 comparison stores. The third aim is to identify implementation factors that influence policy
effectiveness, such as policy support, costs, reach, and stakeholder reactions using interviews with city staff,
policymakers, and retailers and surveys of Berkeley residents. This evaluation leverages the baseline and 1-
year post-baseline store environment data collected by the research team using a novel photo-based tool. The
proposed research is expected to provide the first evidence on the effectiveness of a mandatory healthy
checkout policy for improving food environments and store sales and the factors that facilitate or pose barriers
to implementation, which can inform policy decisions in other jurisdictions."

Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD), consisting of Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD),
are chronic progressive inflammatory conditions of the intestine. Numerous lines of evidence suggest
their origins lie in an overaggressive response of the host immune system towards the gut microbiota
in a genetically susceptible host. We hypothesize a key feature of IBD is the persistent colonization
by colitogenic microbial strains in the absence of sufficient colitoprotective strains that over years to
decades can drive the progressive inflammation and damage associated with IBD. To test this
hypothesis we propose three Aims. In Aim 1, we will sample, every year for five years, the fecal
microbiota of individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (UC or CD) and healthy controls. To
understand the implications of gut microbiota stability in the context of a gut microbiota manipulation
intervention, we will also longitudinally sample recipients of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for
ulcerative colitis, after FMT therapy has ended, for up to 5 years. We will use metagenomics
combined with high throughput microbial isolation and genome sequencing to identify the stable and
transient microbes in each individual's microbiota and determine if individuals with IBD have
significantly altered gut microbiota stability. We will also track the loss of engrafted FMT donor strains
in subjects in remission post-FMT overtime to associate strain loss with long-term-relapse. In Aim 2,
we will use gnotobiotic T-cell transfer colitis mice colonized with subsets of each microbiota to identify
colitogenic and colitoprotective microbial strains and to determine if colitogenic or colitoprotective
organisms are preferentially found in the stably colonized community members. We will also
determine if colitogenic and colitoprotective strains drive unique baseline immune tones when
colonized in unchallenged gnotobiotic mice. With an aim towards future human translation, we will
search for minimal colitoprotective subsets from previously identified colitoprotective communities,
and we will determine if strains lost post-FMT are colitoprotective, in UC subjects that achieve
remission but subsequently relapse. Together these aims will help us determine if individuals with
Inflammatory Bowel Disease are enriched in stably colonized colitogenic organisms whose
elimination might form a novel therapeutic intervention for the treatment or prevention of Inflammatory
Bowel Disease and if healthy individuals are enriched in stably colonized colitoprotective organisms
that might form the basis of a novel IBD therapeutic."

Cloud MR: an open-source software framework to democratize MRI training and research
This project is a competing continuation of our project entitled Novel Software Tools for Rational Design and
Assessment of MR Coils, which yielded seminal advances in understanding radiofrequency coil performance at
high and ultra-high field. It also delivered novel computational tools for rapid coil simulation using Integral
Equation techniques, and introduced the ultimate intrinsic transmit efficiency as an absolute metric for transmit
coil performance. Our continuing project will integrate these advances into the development of Cloud MR, a
comprehensive framework to simulate all aspects of the MRI experiment. By means of an intuitive web-based
user interface, Cloud MR will allow the development of RF coils, pulse sequences and image reconstruction
methods within an interconnected simulation environment that will enable users to optimize them jointly or
individually. We will introduce the first web-based tool for modeling and simulation of flexible RF coils, as well as
an innovative tool for pulse sequence development based on a Sequence Description Language. We will train a
convolutional neural network for the removal of Gibbs artifacts using synthetic brain images generated with Cloud
MR. The overall goal is to provide to anyone with an internet connection a powerful, innovative, comprehensive
open-source tool for MRI research and training. By providing a virtual simulation environment to test new
technology and optimize clinical protocols without operating an actual MR scanner, Cloud MR will reduce the
carbon footprint of MRI. Cloud MR will also allow to generate realistic synthetic MR datasets to train neural
networks, without the need to access actual patients’ data. We will distribute all software freely and fully
documented, including tutorials and examples that could be used to demonstrate physics and engineering
concepts in undergraduate and graduate courses."
10754573,"The long-term objective of this project is to test and refine the use BPET-DBT as a tool for co-registered
molecular and anatomic imaging to direct biopsy and deliver personalized breast cancer treatment to
patients. The integrated BPET-DBT system acquires PET data in the same (mildly) compressed position
immediately after the DBT data acquisition, thereby providing co-registered molecular and anatomical
images while also allowing easy patient workflow. The BPET scanner is a dedicated, high spatial
resolution, time-of-flight (TOF) breast PET scanner producing quantitative images. The DBT image, in
addition to providing superior diagnostic anatomical information, also provides an accurate structural
context to the PET image (necessary for guiding biopsy and/or surgical approach based on the PET
image) and the means to perform accurate attenuation correction (AC) of the PET data. In this project we
will evaluate clinical applications of this novel device using selected cohorts of patients designed to test
efficacy of the combined device for surgical guidance, monitoring response to therapy, tissue sampling,
and further enhancing the quantitative imaging capability of the device both in hardware and software.
 Our aims are to: (1) demonstrate imaging capability and utility of this unique device, with two specific
clinical situations as demonstration (tumor characterization and margin definition, and residual tumor
measurement after neo-adjuvant therapy), (2) develop new quantitative image generation techniques
and to evaluate them both retroactively and prospectively in clinical studies, and (3) test DBT-guided
biopsy using the PET portion of the image set co-registered to the DBT image to direct stereotactic
biopsy. The clinical studies in Aims 1 and 3 will: (i) characterize tumor phenotype and determine tumor
margins using 18F-fluoroestradiol (18F-FES) as the biomarker and compare to surgical pathology results
and SUV measurements with WB PET-CT, (ii) measure 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake in
small residual tumor prior to surgery in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and compare
BPET-DBT and whole-body PET-CT SUV to histopathology findings post-surgery, and (iii) perform
targeted breast biopsy using co-registered 18F-FES BPET-DBT images. In Aim 2 we will: (i) evaluate the
performance of the existing TOF reconstruction algorithm in mitigating the limited angle artifacts present
in the BPET images, (ii) develop and evaluate new BPET reconstruction and AC methods using image-
based resolution modeling (IRM) methods as well as Deep-Learning (DL) methods for direct PET image
reconstruction and generation of robust DBT images for PET AC, and (iii) develop and test a new high
performance PET detector as an extension to existing BPET detectors for improved images. At the end
of the study we expect to have demonstrated the role a high resolution, BPET-DBT scanner can play in
the future for personalized breast cancer treatment."
10764908,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals with liver cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis often experience the complications of advanced liver
disease: ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and gastrointestinal bleeding. These complications frequently lead
to hospitalizations, and after hospital discharge, disease complications can interact with medication errors and
poor provider communication, resulting in frequent early hospital readmissions. Outcomes during the
vulnerable post-discharge transition period could be improved through better transitional care (TC), focused on
optimizing treatment regimens, improving communication, and facilitating access to community and other
healthcare resources. TC addressing these issues has successfully improved outcomes in heart failure and
other conditions, but there are few data on TC programs in patients with advanced liver disease, who suffer
from unique clinical complications that can complicate TC treatment plans. To address this gap in our
healthcare delivery system, we have developed an advanced practice provider (APP)-led TC program for
patients with the complications of advanced liver disease: the Transitional Liver Clinic (TLC). In the TLC,
patients discharged from the hospital with complications of advanced liver disease are contacted by telephone
within two days of discharge, followed by a face-to-face or video telehealth visit with the APP within 7-14 days.
During this time, TLC providers reconcile and manage medications, provide education and linkage to
community resources, and facilitate necessary follow-up. This proposal aims to test the effect of the TLC on
hospital readmissions, quality of life, and patient satisfaction with care. The hypothesis is that the TLC will
improve patient outcomes across these domains. To achieve these aims, the TLC will be evaluated using a
pragmatic stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial comparing the TLC to usual care at four high-volume
tertiary care liver centers. Upon completion of the study, the investigators will have provided evidence for the
efficacy of TC in reducing acute healthcare utilization and in improving quality of life and patient satisfaction for
those with complications of advanced liver disease."
10758970,"Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread protozoan parasite that can cause life-threatening disease in
immunocompromised individuals and the developing fetus. While drugs are available to treat acute
toxoplasmosis, they are frequently discontinued due to severe adverse effects. The development of new, better-
tolerated drugs requires an improved understanding of the biology of T. gondii and the mechanisms underlying
its virulence so that critical points of vulnerability in its life cycle can be identified and targeted.
 T. gondii belongs to a group of related human pathogens, the Apicomplexa, which also includes the causative
agents of malaria (Plasmodium) and cryptosporidiosis (Cryptosporidium). Apicomplexan parasites must invade
into cells of their hosts in order to survive and multiply. During the early stages of invasion, proteins are
exocytosed from apical organelles known as the rhoptries. After their release, these proteins are delivered into
the host cell cytosol where they participate in parasite internalization, inactivate host innate immune defenses,
and manipulate host gene expression to the parasite’s advantage. Because the injected effector proteins play
such critical roles in parasite invasion and intracellular survival, they are among the most important of the
parasite’s virulence factors. While we know a great deal about the functions of these effector proteins, we know
virtually nothing about the process by which they are delivered into the host cell. The goal of this project is to fill
in this important gap in our understanding of host cell invasion by apicomplexan parasites.
 We have previously shown that when T. gondii first contacts a host cell, it causes a transient (~200msec)
disruption in the barrier integrity of the host cell plasma membrane. The central hypothesis of this project is that
this transient perforation of the host cell membrane, which we can detect using high-speed multiwavelength
fluorescence microscopy, serves as the conduit through which rhoptry proteins are injected into the host cell.
The major Aims of the project are to: (1) Determine the physical nature and proximate cause of host cell
perforation during invasion and (2) Determine how the perforating agent is delivered to the host cell membrane
and the function of the breach it creates.
 How rhoptry proteins are injected into the host cell during invasion is a fascinating cell biological problem,
and current evidence suggests that the underlying mechanisms are novel. A greater understanding of these
mechanisms may lead to new approaches to treating or preventing toxoplasmosis, since targeting the injection
process will simultaneously disrupt the delivery into the host cell of many of the parasite’s most critical virulence
factors. In addition, because rhoptry protein injection into the host cell occurs in all apicomplexans examined,
the results of this project are likely to be directly applicable to related human pathogens such as Plasmodium
and Cryptosporidium."
10784763,"This is the fourth competitive renewal of this grant application that was funded for the past 20
years. Over the years funding through this grant application led to several milestone observations
and new discoveries. In the current grant application, we will follow intriguing observations made
during the last period of funding. Our genetic studies in mice, using systemic deletion of Akt
isoforms after tumor onset, recapitulate some of the adverse effects observed in patients after
treatment with PI3K and Akt inhibitors such as hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia, severe
diarrhea, and liver damage. Our studies in mice could therefore provide mechanistic explanations
for the adverse physiological consequences induced by PI3K and Akt inhibitors. Our results using
mouse models of breast cancer and inducible systemic deletion of Akt isoforms after tumor onset
to emulate drug therapy, suggest the followings: (i) Systemic Akt1 inhibition after tumor onset
reduces metastasis by inhibiting tumor associate and pro-metastatic neutrophils. This is relevant
to human breast cancer as high ratio of neutrophils to lymphocyte (NLR) is associated with worse
overall survival and disease-free survival. (ii) Neutrophils’ specific deletion of Akt1 is sufficient to
inhibit breast cancer metastasis. (iii) Specific Akt1 inhibitors could inhibit tumor progression and
metastasis of Her2 enriched, Luminal B, and triple negative breast cancer. (iv) Systemic Akt1
inhibition prohibits breast cancer metastasis regardless of primary tumor type (Akt1 specific
inhibitors should be developed). (v) Systemic Akt2 inhibition may not be beneficial for breast
cancer therapy because of increased circulating levels of insulin and hyperactivation of the other
Akt isoforms (drugs that inhibit Akt2 might be avoided). (vi) Pan-Akt inhibitors may not be effective
unless they don’t inhibit Akt2 activity to a high extent. In the first part of the current grant
application, we will investigate how tumor associated neutrophils are programmed by the tumors
both transcriptionally and metabolically and how Akt1 deficiency impairs their ability to promote
breast cancer metastasis. In the second part of the grant application will investigate
mechanistically the adverse effects induced by pan-Akt or Akt2 inhibition and how to alleviate
them. The long-term goal of this grant application is to establish the rationale for developing Akt1
specific inhibitors and enable the efficient use of Akt inhibitors for cancer and cancer metastasis
therapy."

New studies in Uganda and Rwanda have reported increasing prevalence of mutations in pfkelch13 (K13)
associated with delayed parasite clearance following clinical or in vitro treatment with artemisinins, suggesting
that fears that resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to artemisinins will emerge in Africa, where >90% of
malaria cases and deaths occur, have been realized. However, the extent of resistance to components of
artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) is not well understood. Our ongoing research activities and
well-established infrastructure in Uganda put us in a unique position to rapidly address urgent needs for
improved surveillance and characterization of resistance to artemisinins and partner drugs in Uganda.
Benefitting from a network of 80 surveillance sites across the country and modern laboratories in Kampala and
Tororo, we will use molecular, parasitological and epidemiological approaches a) to evaluate the origins,
prevalence and distribution of known markers of artemisinin and ACT partner drug resistance and to
characterize the genetic background(s) that facilitate the establishment and spread of resistance phenotypes,
b) assess associations between genotypes and drug susceptibility/fitness phenotypes, and c) assess
ecological and epidemiological factors that facilitate the evolution of resistance. With resistance to important
drugs still geographically focal, our goal is to identify key drivers of its emergence and spread, and then to
promptly inform public health leaders on the best means of blunting the spread of resistance across Africa."
10752646,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The unpleasantness, or negative affective component, of pain perception is an emotional phenomenon distinct
from the perceptive sensory qualities. This affective dimension of pain underlies the suffering and motivational
deficits of chronic pain patients. However, similar cellular-resolution mechanisms within brain networks is lacking
relative to the intricate nociceptive detail in the peripheral and spinal circuits. Thus, a key step toward accelerating
the development of effective pain treatments must be the discovery of the specific neural circuits in the brain that
are responsible for the aversive and unpleasant quality of pain perception. We recently reported the discovery
and characterization of a basolateral amygdalar (BLA) neural ensemble, at single neuron resolution, that
transforms nociceptive information in affective-motivational behavior in both acute and chronic pain conditions.
While these studies provide a critical point of entry into the complex affective circuits of pain, it is not clear how
the BLA nociceptive ensemble connects with other parts of the larger affective brain circuitry.
Our goal here is to provide a systems-level understanding of the nociceptive cortical brain networks involved in
the affective perception of pain by integrating multimodal data from pain-experience-dependent transcriptomics,
activity based whole-brain circuit tracing, and precision chemogenetic control—anchored in motivational
behavior-based classifications—throughout the transition from acute to chronic pain. Thus, to discover this
nociceptive brain network, in AIM 1 we will use a rabies viral-genetic strategy combined with immediate early
gene mapping in cleared, intact brain tissue to locate key neuronal populations whose activity is altered by
chronic neuropathic pain. In AIM 2, we will employ single-nuclei RNA sequencing to link transcriptomic identity
and change in cellular states during pain chronification in defined nociceptive input cells to the BLA noci-
ensemble. In AIM 3, we will chemogenetically manipulate nociceptive cell-types projecting to the BLA to mitigate
pain affective-motivational behaviors with locally infused microsphere drug-delivery. The cellular and functional
identification of these fundamental nociceptive circuits should open new avenues for developing precision
therapeutics to combat different dimensions of pain experiences, including the unpleasant affective component.
Such circuit-targeted therapies could selectively diminish the suffering of pain patients, regardless of etiology
and without influencing reward, while preserving necessary sensory discriminative processes for protective pain
sensation."
10767318,"Project Summary:
Retinal degenerative diseases are a major medical issue for society. One potentially exciting approach to
restore vision is the regeneration of lost retinal neurons from an endogenous population of retinal cells, the
Müller glia. We are studying this process in zebrafish, which unlike mammals, exhibits a natural Müller glia-
dependent retinal regeneration response. However, there are two major gaps in our understanding of this
retinal regeneration response. The first is why rapid acute damage exhibits a regeneration response and a
slow chronic damage, which is what is often observed in human retinal degenerative diseases, does not induce
a regeneration response in zebrafish. The second gap in our understanding is the role of the microglia, the
immune cells of the central nervous system, which are the major source of inflammation resulting from damage
and a known regulator of the Müller glia-dependent retinal regeneration. We will address these two gaps in
three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the potential of two different chronic zebrafish retinal degeneration
mutants (gosh, an early onset rapid cone photoreceptor degeneration mutant and cep290, a late onset slow
cone degeneration mutant) to induce Müller glia proliferation and regenerate lost cones using different stimuli.
We will determine to what extent either a secondary acute damage or the introduction of molecules that
stimulate Müller glia proliferation can induce cone regeneration in chronically damaged fish and how complete
the regeneration process is. In Aim 2, we will conduct a comprehensive and unbiased, comparative analysis of
gene expression and chromatin accessibility in Müller glia and microglia using a multiomic single-nuclear RNA-
Seq and ATAC-Seq analysis in these two chronic degeneration mutants, along with two mouse chronic retinal
degeneration mutants. We will determine the similarities and differences in gene expression and chromatin
accessibility in the Müller glia and microglia between the acutely and chronically damaged retinas. These
bioinformatic analyses will reveal transcription factors and signaling (cytokine, growth factors, ligand/ receptor
pairs) molecules that are essential for regeneration following acute damage and blocking regeneration in the
chronically damaged zebrafish retina. We will also determine the differences and similarities between the
chronically damaged zebrafish and mouse retinas to determine how similar these regulatory components are
between the zebrafish and mouse. Aim 3 will then functionally test the roles of the candidate regulators
previously identified in our scRNA-Seq datasets or in Aim 2 by either modifying their expression or their activity
in the chronically and acutely damaged zebrafish retina. This work will be the first molecular analysis of how
retinal regeneration is regulated in the chronically damaged zebrafish retina and will be critical in the translation
of Müller glial-dependent retinal regenerative therapies into human retinal degenerative diseases."
10928084,"Abstract
Approximately 20% of breast cancers detected through mammography are pre-invasive Ductal Carcinoma in
situ (DCIS). If left untreated, approximately 20-50% of DCIS will progress to more deadly Invasive Ductal
Carcinoma (IDC). No prognostic biomarkers can reliably predict the risk of progression from DCIS to IDC. Similar
genomic profiles of matched pre-invasive DCIS and IDC suggests that the progression is not driven by genetic
aberrations in DCIS cells, but microenvironmental factors, such as hypoxia and metabolic stress prevalent in
DCIS, may drive the transition. We need innovative models to investigate how to halt steps of DCIS progression
to invasive phenotypes and subsequent metastasis from the primary site. This proposal directly addresses
this unmet need by developing a novel three-dimensional in vitro organoid model that recapitulates key
hallmarks of DCIS to IDC progression: tumor-size induced hypoxia and metabolic stress, tumor heterogeneity
and spontaneous emergence of migratory phenotype in the same parent cells without any additional stimulus. A
tangible advantage of the proposed organoid models is the ability to precisely and reproducibly study how the
hypoxic microenvironment induces tumor migration in real time and in isolation from non-tumor cells present in
vivo, providing unique opportunity to define tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of DCIS to IDC progression.
During July 2018-Feb 2022 ESI MERIT Award period, we have shown that inhibition of tumor-secreted factors
effectively halts organoid migration, while inhibition of hypoxia is effective only within a time window and is
compromised by tumor-to-tumor variation, supporting our notion that hypoxia initiates migratory phenotypes but
does not sustain it. We have also analyzed secretome from metastatic breast cancer pleural effusion showing
significantly higher levels of CCL2/MCP1, CXCL10/IP10, IL-6, IL-8, regulatory IL-10, and IL-7 and IL-15.
Strategies to neutralize these key cytokines may generate anti-tumor responses in the pleural environment.
Microarray analysis of hypoxia-induced migration and secretome-induced migration suggested role of Rho
GTPase and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways in maintaining migration. Our results show that hypoxic organoid
models exhibit partial EMT signatures as early as day 1, which is maintained as these non-migratory organoids
transition to migratory phenotypes.
During the two-year extension period, we will continue 1) to optimize our DCIS models incorporating ductal
structure and other components from DCIS microenvironments; 2) to test new mechanisms linking tumor-intrinsic
hypoxia, partial/hybrid EMT and collective migration; 3) to inhibit signaling mechanisms to halt emergence of
migratory phenotypes.
The successful completion of the proposed work will provide answers to two fundamental questions in the
progression of invasive breast cancer: 1) What causes some DCIS cells to become migratory and develop into
invasive tumors? 2) How and where does the migratory phenotype (IDC) emerge? The mechanistic
understanding gained from these studies will improve diagnosis, lead to the development of treatment strategies
to arrest invasion at the pre-malignant stage, and thus prevent patient overtreatment."

Evidence suggests that the prevalence of certain developmental disorders, specifically autism spectrum
disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has increased sharply in recent decades.
Recent studies have shown a moderate heritability for neurodevelopmental delays (NDDs), suggesting a
nongenetic component contributing to its etiology. The estimated annual cost of environmentally mediated NDDs
in US children is $18.3 billion. Epidemiologic studies examined prenatal and early childhood exposure to air
pollutants and NDDs, with non-conclusive evidence on the effects of different pollutants, interactions, sensitive
windows of exposure and chemical components of PM2.5. In addition, the role of socioeconomic status (SES) in
these associations is complex. Our overarching goal is to comprehensively investigate the independent and joint
prenatal and early childhood exposure to PM2.5, NO2 and O3, PM2.5 chemical components and interactions with
temperature on NDDs as well as effect modification by SES. The specific aims of this application are: 1) Quantify
the association prenatal and early childhood exposure to PM2.5, NO2, O3, temperature and NDDs, 2) Examine the
association between prenatal and early childhood exposure to PM2.5 chemical speciation and NDDs, and 3)
Examine pathways and synergistic effects, among environmental exposures and SES on NDDs. We have
established a birth cohort of more than 4 million pregnancies from two population-based databases—the
Medicaid Analytic eXtract and IBM MarketScan—that include rich information on location and individual-level
characteristics. By 8 years of age, 23.9% of publicly insured children and 11.0% of privately insured children
received a diagnosis of 1 or more NDDs. For all pollutants, PM2.5 chemical components and temperature, we
have validated highly resolved daily predictions for the entire continental US. The unique composition of these
two cohorts, allows us to determine the extent to which SES modifies these associations. For our analyses, we
will adjust for a wide range of individual-level characteristics and spatiotemporal covariates. We will estimate
hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals using cox regression, distributed-linear/non-linear lag models,
and we will examine effect modification by infant sex. We will use advanced statistical methods to estimate the
effects of mixtures. Our prior work and data support both the hypothesis for and the feasibility of the proposed
study. The proposed research is innovative because it will be the first study to: 1) investigate associations
between air pollutants, temperature and NDDs on a national scale; 2) use state-of-the-art spatiotemporal models
to assess individual exposures to PM2.5, NO2, O3 and temperature; 3) employ innovative resources of clinical data
by leveraging two large pregnancy cohorts. The proposed research is of great significance because it will guide
decisions and pollutant regulations to protect the health of pregnant women and children, inform heat wave
warning systems, potentially reducing rates of NDDs and subsequent social, financial, and public health burden."
10754241,"The complement system is a major pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory pathway and plays a central role
in the mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of experimental murine models of human rheumatoid arthritis
(RA). In these murine models, inappropriate complement activation that is directed to self-tissues drives initial
cellular influx into the joint as well as synovial inflammation and bone erosions. However, despite the extensive
insights into the murine disease that we have developed with support of this grant, including the activation
pathways involved, how control of the system is overcome and how individual effector pathways promote
tissue damage, we do not know how the complement system plays a pathogenic role in patients with RA.
Recent findings in our studies of the human disease have identified a prolonged preclinical phase in RA
characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies and mucosal inflammation that appears to drive the
initial break in tolerance to citrullinated self-antigens. Following that asymptomatic phase, where complement
activation is present in the mucosal site but not systemically, it is likely that complement activation and effector
mechanisms are then especially important as the disease transitions to the very early phases of synovitis when
circulating autoantibodies directed against citrullinated proteins initially react with antigens which develop and
are displayed in the joint. To build our understanding of the human disease and translate information from
models of disease to patients themselves, the major focus of this competing renewal proposal is to understand
how the complement system is involved in the early synovitis in RA. We are especially well positioned to
accomplish this important goal, as with other support mechanisms we are able to identify and follow subjects
from the preclinical period into the very first appearance of synovitis and the diagnosis of RA. By obtaining
synovial biopsies, a skill set also developed in our program in the last 3-4 years through other funding, and
informative blood samples from patients in this important transition period, we will work to characterize the role
of complement activation as well as its regulatory and effector mechanisms in the initial development of
inflammatory arthritis and synovitis in patients. In addition, as there are distinct sub-types of RA, designated
pathotypes, which have prognostic importance, we will determine what complement activation processes are
associated with individual pathotypes and how that influences clinical outcomes. Finally, we will focus special
attention on a major synovial cell type in human RA, which are highly inflammatory fibroblast-like synoviocytes,
whose importance is increasingly understood and for which there are reported complement signatures in
unbiased omics studies. We will define the mechanisms by which complement interacts with this cell type, both
with regard to how complement is regulated by inflammatory cytokines as well as activated, and then defining
the subsequent phenotypic changes. A major goal in these studies is to use information gained to inform the
use of current and next generation complement therapeutics in this important human autoimmune disease."
10758554,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Microsatellites, also known as simple sequence repeats or short tandem repeats (STRs), are 2-10 bp tandem
sequence repeats that occur throughout the human genome. Germ-line expansions of these repeats beyond a
critical threshold are associated with more than 50 neurological, neurodegenerative and neuromuscular
disorders, including Huntington disease, C9orf72-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/ frontotemporal dementia,
several types of spinocerebellar ataxias, as well as myotonic dystrophy types 1 and 2 (DM1/2). Although the
complete range of molecular features associated with these diseases varies among these conditions (and often
are unknown), cellular and mouse models demonstrate that RNA-mediated toxicity is a major factor. Thus,
suppression of mutant RNA levels is expected to address all associated pathologies. While numerous strategies
exist to attenuate gene expression via targeted destruction of RNA, all have limitations relating to their mode of
administration and tissue targeting (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides, siRNAs), or carry the risk of toxicity caused
by adaptive immune responses or pre-existing immunity to the therapeutic agent (systems based delivery of
RNA-targeting Cas proteins). Here we develop novel non-immunogenic RNA targeting system compatible with
delivery by recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAVs) that support safe and long-lasting expression.
Our platform is based on human spliceosomal RNAs, which in preliminary data we show can be engineered to
target and degrade STR-containing transcripts. As a proof-of principle for the therapeutic potential of this system,
we focus on DM1, the most common form of adult-onset most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy. We
have developed a novel human stem cell based organoid model that, for the first time, provides insight into the
molecular basis of the severe neurocognitive deficits associated with DM1. We will use this model to test the
safety and efficacy of our RNA-targeting systems in conjunction with a novel mouse model that we generate and
that we hope will recapitulate the multi-tissue pathology of DM1. If successful, our work will provide a flexible
therapeutic RNA-targeting based platform for treatment of STR-associated diseases."

Maintaining the junctional epithelium (JE) is of primary importance if preservation of the cementum, periodontal ligament
(PDL), and alveolar bone is to be achieved. New insights into JE barrier functions came with our discovery of a Wnt-
responsive stem cell niche in the JE. In this proposal, our goal is to characterize the cellular players, niche signals, and
regulatory mechanisms that control and maintain the JE stem cell niche in health, and after damage or disease.
AIM 1 experiments will first test whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for JE maintenance. Pathway inhibition will
be achieved in Axin2LacZ/+ mice using adenovirus expressing the soluble Wnt inhibitor Dkk1; controls will receive adenovirus
encoding the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G. At defined intervals, quantitative analyses will assess endogenous Wnt/β-
catenin signaling via Xgal staining; JE hemidesmosomal gene and protein distribution via quantitative
immunohistochemistry (qIHC); JE and GE cell cycle kinetics by EdU/BrdU labeling; and inflammatory cell infiltration in
connective tissues underlying the JE and GE by FACS. Second, whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling is necessary for JE
regeneration will be determined by subjecting Wnt lineage tracer e.g., Axin2CreERT2/+;R26RmTmG/+ mice to partial gingivectomy
followed by Ad-Dkk1/Ad-Fc delivery. Lineage-tracing and quantitative analyses will establish a relationship between Wnt-
responsive cell progeny, cell cycle kinetics, hemidesmosomal gene and protein distribution, and regeneration of JE barrier
functions.
AIM 2 experiments will evaluate the ability of a stabilized formulation of WNT protein to regenerate a functional JE. In one
injury-repair model the JE will be surgically excised; in a second model, JE breakdown will be triggered via a ligature-induced
periodontitis; both will be carried out in Axin2LacZ/+ and Axin2CreERT2/+;R26RmTmG/+ mice. Delivery of the WNT therapeutic will
be followed at multiple timepoints by quantitative analyses to assess re-establishment of JE barrier functions.
AIM 3 experiments will characterize Wnt-responsive JE stem cells and their progeny. Wnt-responsive stem cell pools from
adjacent gingival epithelium (GE) will serve as control. Axin2CreERT2/+;R26RmTmG/+ mice will be exposed to tamoxifen, followed
by harvest of JE and GE tissues at defined timepoints. GFP+ cells will be sorted by flow cytometry. Gene expression profiling
of GFP+ cells will focus stem cell and differentiation markers. Fluorescent in situ hybridization will confirm gene expression
patterns using RNA probe libraries corresponding to stem cell markers, components of Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, and Bone
Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathways. Collectively, this proposal promises to provide important new insights into the
requirement for Wnt/β-catenin signaling in maintaining the JE stem cell niche; regulating JE and GE cell proliferation and
differentiation; and influencing hemidesmosomal-mediated attachment to the tooth surface. In addition, it should resolve
the current debate over the molecular identities of JE v. GE stem cell pools and their differentiation potential. The proposed
work also has the potential to identify an innovative therapeutic strategy for rebuilding a damaged JE and thus open new
avenues for the restoration of the soft tissue attachment following periodontal diseases."

 Recent progresses in microbial genome sequencing and synthetic biology have created
a renaissance in natural product discovery. This timely combination offers great promise to find
natural products displaying new structures and biological activities. Notwithstanding such
potential, it remains difficult to i) predict product structures directly from biosynthetic gene
clusters (BGCs). This is because our knowledge of enzymes that are involved in natural product
biosynthesis remains limited, especially with regard to the highly programmed enzymes from
eukaryotic organisms such as filamentous fungi; ii) prioritize BGCs that can lead to new-to-
nature chemical structures. This is primarily due to the focus of the field on well-studied natural
product families and core biosynthetic enzymes; and iii) connect the biological activity with
BGCs in genome mining efforts. This represents a gap between genome mining and traditional
phenotypical screen-based discovery in which natural product isolation is guided by biological
activity. This MIRA grant will address these limitations with a comprehensive research program
focused on fungal natural product discovery and biosynthetic investigation.
 The first general area of this MIRA project is to gain fundamental understanding of core
enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of fungal natural products. In particular, we will
focus on understanding the iterative programming rules of fungal PKSs and NRPSs. Other
aspects of core enzyme programming rules, including cyclization and noncanonical domains will
be investigated. We will also investigate the unusual tailoring enzyme activities of fungal
biosynthetic pathways, with emphasis on PLP-dependent and oxidative enzymes. A number of
compound driven biosynthetic investigations will be conducted. The second general area of this
MIRA project is to develop and refine tools for genome mining. The most important research
activity in this area is based on our recently developed resistance gene guided target genome
mining, in which we use an co-clustered, resistant variant of the natural product target in the
BGC as a guide to discover natural product of desired biological activity. This strategy can also
be used to assign biological activities to known natural products. The objectives here are two-
fold: 1) to expand the list of targets that may be identified via resistance gene, to enzymes and
proteins in the central dogma, protein transport, metabolism, etc. Here we will perform genome
mining and/or natural product bioactivity characterization to link metabolites to targets; and 2) to
understand the mechanism of resistance, which will teach us how Nature evolves resistant
enzymes, and refine our understanding of how to overcome potential resistance."

The development of new protein biosensors has for the most part been dependent on finding a protein that is
already responsive to a known effector. While rational design and directed evolution methods exist for altering
the effector specificity of transcription factors, these methods are in general complex and slow, and have failed
to solve the more general problem of identifying new protein biosensors at will. In particular, it is often difficult to
find a receptor that is both sensitive and specific for a given end product or intermediate, and even when efforts
to generate new sensors are successful, they generally recognize effectors that are structurally quite similar to
their natural counterparts. In particular, for virtually all industrially and medically useful terpenes there exists no
corresponding biosensor. We now propose to develop a combined computational and directed evolution method
that should allow us to proceed from any of a wide variety of ‘generalist’ repressors to create highly sensitive
and specific biosensors for a structurally diverse range of terpenes and terpenoids for which no biosensors are
currently known. To this end, we have developed a novel directed evolution method for altering biosensor
specificities, and propose to synergize these with powerful machine learning tools for improving protein function.
Extensive Preliminary Results show that the TetR family of transcription factors can be readily manipulated to
take on new effector specificities, and that machine learning can be used to improve the function of a wide variety
of proteins. We now further propose to identify semi-specific transcription factors as starting points for biosensor
design and evolution (Aim 1); use neural network approaches to predict new sensor specificities (Aim 2); and
refine these predictions via directed evolution and high-throughput screening (Aim 3)."

The vast repertoires of antigen receptors (AgRs) in the adaptive immune system are dependent on V(D)J
recombination. In this somatic rearrangement process, component gene segments are assembled to generate
functional AgR genes during distinct stages of B and T cell development. Each gene segment is flanked by a
recombination signal sequence (RSS) which is recognized and cleaved by the V(D)J recombinase, containing
RAG1 and RAG2, in the first enzymatic steps of V(D)J recombination. As the RSSs are only semi-conserved,
the V(D)J recombinase must be capable of cleaving at a wide range of variant RSSs to generate diverse AgR
repertoires. However, there are millions of cryptic RSS-like sites (cRSS) that are located throughout the genome.
Erroneous RAG-mediated cleavage at cRSS sites can cause oncogenic chromosomal rearrangements.
Therefore, RAG1/2 must be promiscuous to facilitate recombination of poorly conserved RSSs at AgR loci, but
it must also be precise to avoid off-target cRSSs. Long standing questions remain as to the contribution of DNA
sequence selectivity, along with the effects of the chromatin environment, on the balance between conventional
versus aberrant V(D)J recombination events. To address the contribution of DNA sequence selectivity to V(D)J
recombination, we developed a high-throughput recombination method to analyze RSS selectivity, in which the
relative efficiency of V(D)J recombination on RSS substrate libraries are obtained by analysis of next generation
sequencing results. Using this method, we will empirically characterize RSS motifs that enhance RAG1/2 activity
to shape a diverse antigen receptor repertoire, as well as identify suboptimal RSS motifs that favor
nonconventional V(D)J recombination reactions. Our preliminary studies have yielded highly informative results,
which have shown preferred sequence motifs and sequence interdependencies between different regions of the
RSS that have significant consequences on the level of V(D)J recombination activity. Furthermore, specific RSS
motifs appear to preferentially favor nonconventional V(D)J recombination reactions. Building on our preliminary
results, we hypothesize that the specific relationships within RSSs 1) influence their relative utilization by the
RAG proteins, 2) are modulated by specific chromatin environments, and 3) govern their fate in conventional
versus aberrant V(D)J recombination reactions. Overall, we predict that findings from this project will significantly
improve our current understanding of RAG selectivity of RSSs and cRSSs in normal and aberrant V(D)J
recombination reactions, respectively."

Cancer is a very heterogeneous disease with each patient being driven by a specific set of genomic
aberrations. As such, personalized treatment has been intensively investigated as a promising strategy
for further improving patient prognosis. To aid personalized treatment, both genomic and expression-
based biomarkers have been investigated. Somatic mutations and amplification/deletions of genes,
especially driver genes, have been used to predict cancer prognosis and to preselect patients for
targeted treatment. Despite some successful examples, the overall effectiveness of these genomic
biomarkers remains unclear. Similarly, many gene expression-based biomarkers have been proposed,
but only a few of them are translated into clinical applications. In this project, we propose a new strategy:
develop an innovative statistical framework that integrates genomic and transcriptomic data to define
gene signatures by modeling the quantitative relationships between genomic aberrations and gene
expression alterations. These signatures recapitulate the downstream oncogenic pathways underlying
driver genomic events, and importantly, can capture pathway de-regulation caused by other
mechanisms. We will use this framework to leverage a vast amount of existing cancer data created from
previous studies. Specifically, we will utilize the TCGA, ICGC and TARGET data to define a
comprehensive list of gen signatures to characterize all driver genomic aberrations in 6 cancer types,
including lung, breast, and pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, melanoma, and acute myeloid leukemia.
These gene signatures will then be combined to build integrative models to predict clinical outcomes,
including patient prognosis and sensitivity to therapeutic treatment. We will further incorporate immune
infiltration scores and clinical factors to maximize the prediction power of these models. Following that,
we will utilize a collection of 85 cancer datasets with matched gene expression profiles and survival
information to develop prognostic prediction models. Outputs from these models can be used to stratify
patients for advising personalized treatment. In line with our long-term research interest, we will integrate
in-house and existing lung cancer data to develop an optimized model for predicting post-surgical
recurrence risk of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer. The resulting software, source
code, gene signatures, prediction models and other resources from this project will be released in a
timely manner. These resources will benefit a broad scientific community in the filed of basic and
translational cancer research."

for clinical research and implement clinical site protocols for evaluating vaccines, other preventive biologics,
therapeutics, diagnostics, and devices for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases, and CVD is
uniquely poised to accomplish this goal. CVD's expert and accomplished investigative team has
complementary skill sets in all areas necessary to address the NIAID priority areas, with established
management plans to effectively allocate work and conduct multiple projects simultaneously. CVD is
internationally recognized for our capacity and capability to conduct controlled human infection trials for
malaria, influenza, and enteric pathogens and to implement treatment and prevention trials in endemic areas
for malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTD), both of which have been a focus of its research for many
years. CVD has access to U.S. populations of healthy subjects in all age groups for this research and subjects
with special risks, such as patients attending outpatient clinics with sexually transmitted infection (STI) and
other conditions that generally do not requiring hospitalization. Strong domestic collaborations at sites
experienced in clinical trials provide the CVD's VTEU with surge capacity among healthy subjects of all ages
and vulnerable populations such as pregnant women in the U.S. to address public health emergencies. CVD's
international collaborators, including two long-standing permanent field sites in Africa, are an invaluable
resource for vetted international trial sites in low resource countries endemic for malaria and NTD with
experience in conducting high quality NIAID and VTEU studies. This proposal describes mechanisms to
implement protocols that arise from concepts proposed by the Leadership Group (LG) and the research
community including investigators from other VTEUs, academia, industry, non-governmental organizations,

considerations. Under our VTEU contract that is nearing completion (2013-2023), CVD was awarded over 23
Task Orders, enrolled over 1,500 participants, and successfully collaborated with national and international
sites. This renewal application is intended to supplement the new VTEU award (1UM1AI148689) that we
received in December, 2019 in response to AI18-046; funding for this award was limited to one year as a result

Zinc (Zn2+) is the second most abundant transition metal in mammals after iron. There are over two thousand
proteins encoded by the human genome that contain zinc binding motifs, where zinc binding is predicted to be
essential for function. At the cellular level zinc is important for DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, differentiation,
and apoptosis, while at the organism level zinc is required for growth, development and immune function.
Given the importance of Zn2+ in cell biology and human health, it is astounding that we still don’t understand
the mechanisms of how Zn2+ levels and dynamics impact basic cellular functions and give rise to disease.
Although the conventional view of Zn2+ in biology is that it is constitutively and stably bound to the proteins that
comprise the zinc proteome, there is growing evidence that Zn2+ in cells is dynamic. Further, our lab has
shown that Zn2+ dynamics profoundly influence fundamental cellular processes such as transcription, secretory
pathway function, and the cell cycle, firmly establishing that Zn2+ is a signaling ion. However, the proteins and
pathways that sense Zn2+ dynamics to effect cellular change remain a mystery. My research program is
poised to tackle this question by exploring the hypothesis that Zn2+ dynamics titrate occupancy and hence
activity of the Zn2+ proteome. Thus, changes in Zn2+ – during physiological signaling, environmental
perturbation, or as a consequence of disease – could fine-tune the activity of thousands of zinc-dependent
proteins, establishing Zn2+ as a major regulator of cellular function. We are addressing this hypothesis by
tackling 4 overarching questions: (1) Which proteins across the zinc proteome sense dynamic changes in Zn2+
status? (2) Does zinc regulate transcription by titrating function and DNA-binding of transcription factors? (3)
What are the pathways and proteins that mediate Zn2+ regulation of the mammalian cell cycle? And (4) how
does Zn2+ deficiency influence the regulation of other essential metals (Fe, Cu and Mn). To tackle these
questions, we will use a combination of genomics, chemical proteomics, live cell imaging, and biochemistry
approaches. Recently, my lab exploited our expertise in tool development, biophysical and photophysical
characterization of fluorescent probes, and analytical approaches to live cell measurements, to develop a new
platform for tagging mRNA and ncRNA with fluorophores to track them in live cells. This platform fills an
important technological need, as there are tantalizing suggestions of connections between RNA localization,
dynamics and function, but there are major limitations in the existing repertoire of tools. Thus, there is a
pressing need for robust, complementary, and minimally perturbing tools to visualize individual RNA molecules
in living cells to map the complex and evolving landscape of RNA biology. Therefore, the final component of
my research program is to (5) Meet the technological need for improved tools to tag and track RNA in live cells.
Specifically, we will develop a suite of riboswitch-based RNA tags that bind modular chemical probes. We will
also develop a series of robust assays for benchmarking the performance of RNA tagging tools in live cells."

Particle-based fetal therapy is a promising approach to address organ damage caused by structural diseases in
utero. By prenatal imaging, structural diseases can be diagnosed and imaging features can predict the severity
of outcome. Fetal surgery has demonstrated improved outcomes (but not cures) for structural diseases such as
congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), where lung growth is impaired and spina bifida (MMC) where the
unprotected spinal cord is damaged. The challenges with fetal surgery are the complexity and invasive nature of
these procedures and the limit to how early in pregnancy these techniques can be applied. In most cases, earlier
treatment results in shortened duration of organ damage and longer duration of normal organ growth and
development. We have generated data that nanoparticles (NPs) carrying epigenetic therapy in the form of
specific microRNAs changes various downstream targets and improves the growth of lung in a rat of CDH. This
approach can be delivered safely through a needle very early in pregnancy by clinical techniques that carry a
very low rate of fetal demise (amniocentesis and fetal blood transfusion). To improve on our success in these
animal models, we will engineer particles for two modes of delivery: 1) systemic/intravenous (IV) to reach internal
organs (lung) and 2) intra-amniotic (IA) to reach tissues sites that are in contact with the amniotic fluid (such as
the lung epithelial surface). In aim 1, we will test and improve particle behavior (stability and controlled protein
binding) in human fetal blood to improve IV delivery. We will then use optimized particles to deliver epigenetic
therapy to improve lung morphology in the rat model of CDH. In aim 2, we will test and improve particle behavior
and stability in rat, lamb and human amniotic fluid to improve IA delivery. We will use particles carrying epigenetic
therapy to treat a rat model CDH. Finally, with an eye on translation, in aim 3, we will test the distribution of
particles in lamb after IV or IA administration to lung and other tissues. This project takes advantage of the
synergistic expertise (biomedical engineering and fetal therapy) of the two principal investigators who have
already worked together for several years. Successful completion of our aims will establish principles with broad
implications for fetal therapy, would inform strategies to improve outcomes for children afflicted with congenital
diseases. Our strategies—which aim for clinical translation—could lead to a paradigm-changing “off-the-shelf”
therapy for structural diseases that, due to their simplicity, could be offered at many hospitals."
10754588,"Summary: ""Role of Alveolar Macrophage in Omega-3 Fatty acid Amelioration of Silica-Triggered
Autoimmunity”
While heredity is a primary predisposing factor for autoimmunity, cumulative exposures to
environmental factors such as toxic stressors and diet greatly impact latency and severity
autoimmune diseases such as lupus. Our goal is to understand how lupus triggering by an
ubiquitous environmental toxicant can be prevented by dietary modulation of cellular lipids. This
goal is predicated on preliminary studies revealing that 1)airway exposure to crystalline silica, a
recognized autoimmune disease risk factor, triggers early onset of systemic autoimmunity and
glomerulonephritis in the lupus-prone female NZBWF1 mouse and 2)supplementing their diets
with the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a well-known dietary supplement
extracted from cold-water fish, dose-dependently blocks this triggering. Here, we will employ in
vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo approaches to test the hypothesis that DHA consumption prevents silica-
triggered autoimmunity by suppressing inflammatory mediator production, death, and self-antigen
release in alveolar macrophages of NZBWF1 mice. Revealing DHA mechanisms against silica-
triggered lupus will bring novel insights into how respiratory toxicants initiate lupus and
subsequent flaring via lung as well as how manipulating cellular lipids through diet can be
exploited to prevent environmental triggering of human autoimmune disease."

The immune system contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression and survival, and therapies
to target the immune system are of burgeoning interest. However, the changes in the immune system during
the course of ALS and the sex-specific alterations in immune function warrant a more in depth analysis in order
to develop personalized ALS therapies and biomarkers. The long-term goals are to harness the immune sys-
tem’s potential to slow and stop the progression of ALS. The overall objective is to determine how peripheral
immune profiles, sex, age, and sex hormones, link to neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and ALS progres-
sion and survival. The central hypothesis is that peripheral immune profiles are an important pathophysiologic
agent of ALS progression and survival; that sex, age and sex hormone levels impact these profiles; and that
insight into ALS patient-specific immune profiles will yield new drug targets and therapeutic windows. Our ra-
tionale is that linking patient-specific immune cell profiles to ALS progression and survival will facilitate person-
alized immunomodulatory therapeutic development for ALS and identify potential treatment windows. The cen-
tral hypothesis will be pursued with three aims: 1) Identify specific immune profiles that associate with ALS pro-
gression and survival rates.; 2) Evaluate the effects of sex hormones on ALS immune profiles, progression,
and survival; and 3) Identify immune profiles and corresponding cellular pathways that are most toxic to neu-
rons and that associate with central inflammation. In Aim 1 longitudinal immunophenotyping of peripheral blood
samples from ALS subjects will generate composite immune profiles that will then be linked to ALS subject
characteristics, progression, and survival. Aim 2 will determine if observed sex-dependent associations be-
tween immune profiles and ALS progression and survival are mediated by sex hormones, as sex hormones
can alter immune profiles. Aim 3 will enrich a cohort of ALS subjects by immune profile clusters; their periph-
eral immune populations will be analyzed using 1) RNA-seq and 2) cell toxicity studies via co-cultures with
iPSC-derived neurons; subjects will also have positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to quantify central
neuroinflammation. Datasets will be synthesized to build prediction models and create deep neural networks
capable of associating immune profiles with sex, age, disease severity, progression, and survival The research
proposed is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it rigorously examines the effects of sex, age, and
sex hormone levels on immune cells and ALS progression and survival in a longitudinal study. It also accounts
for the interactions between immune cells by forming immune profiles for individual subjects and assesses how
specific profiles associate with dysregulated pathways, cytotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. The proposed re-
search is significant because it will provide critical data on the distinct immune profiles and pathways associ-
ated with ALS progression and survival in a sex-, age- and sex hormone- specific fashion."
10794370,"Project Summary:
How the early embryonic genome – through a progressive series of epigenetic modifications controls zygotic
gene transcription, both in `time and space' – to ensure proper cellular differentiation programs, is a major
question in biology. Crucial to this process is the activity of a subset of transcription factors (TFs), which sit
high in the regulatory hierarchy to control gene expression through combinatorial interactions with cis-
regulatory modules (CRMs) that include enhancers, insulators and silencers. DNA sequence motifs present in
the CRMs of genes act as a code to dictate which genes are to be utilized at the right time, and thus activate
specific gene regulatory programs. ChIP-seq analysis of many TFs usually identifies tens of thousands of TF
binding “peaks,” genomewide, for a given cell type, but only a fraction of these sites appears to be functional. If
so, what mechanistic constrains are needed to properly regulate gene expression? These questions are
fundamentally important, but a difficult question to address in vivo using mammalian embryos due to the need
for relatively large numbers of embryos for genome-scale analyses across numerous experimental regimens.
Here we tackle this question by leveraging the strengths of the frog embryo system and examine the events of
zygotic genome activation (ZGA). As the embryo transitions from fertilized egg to pluripotent zygotic cells
giving rise to three germ layer cell fates, the embryonic genome and transcriptome need to be rapidly
reprogrammed. How can maternal TFs collectively reprogram the genome during the ZGA remains an
important area for the current research. Our recent work shows that a network of maternal TFs encoding Fox,
Sox and Pou type proteins acts through conserved mechanisms to reprogram the cellular genome into the
embryonic states. This is in part accomplished by forming enhanceososme complexes on the enhancers of
target genes, resulting in changing in histone modifications surrounding genes, and forming super enhances,
which concentrate the transcription apparatus and form phase-separated multimolecular assemblies in the
nucleus. Our premise is that maternally expressed Foxh1 and its interacting partner TFs (Sox3 and
Pou5f) function at the top of a hierarchy of TF interactions to not only mark developmental genes for
activation prior to the onset of zygotic gene expression, but also coordinate major reorganization of
the epigenetic landscape during ZGA. Through our efforts to elucidate these conserved developmental
mechanisms controlling pluripotency, our goal is to uncover the integrative roles of maternal TFs in regulating
the onset of ZGA, coordinating nucleosome phasing and histone modifications on target genes, and shaping
the 3D architecture of chromatin. We combine both genomic and imaging approaches to provide important
insights into the unifying principles that drive genome activation.

 Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is one of the world's leading causes of
death. BCG, the only licensed vaccine against TB, is an attenuated bacterium highly homologous to Mtb, yet
safe in immunocompetent individuals because it has lost several genes that confer virulence. BCG has good
efficacy against TB in children, but poor efficacy against TB in adolescents and adults. Hence, a vaccine much
more potent than BCG is clearly needed. However, any replacement vaccine will almost certainly need to be
based on modified (e.g. recombinant) BCG or attenuated Mtb to preserve the substantial benefits of BCG.
 The goal of this project is to develop an attenuated Mtb mutant that is safer and more potent than BCG.
Our novel strategy involves manipulating two key characteristics of live vaccines: (1) their initial period of
growth in the host and (2) their rate of elimination. The inadequate protective efficacy induced by BCG and
non-replicating Mtb mutants can be attributed, at least in part, to their lack of replication in the host. Prolonged
persistence in the host is also a negative factor, resulting in the generation of primarily effector and effector
memory T cells rather than central memory T cells, important for long-term immunity. We hypothesize that
limited replication of an Mtb mutant for a brief period after immunization, mimicking the early stage of a natural
Mtb infection, followed by rapid clearance will induce a potent immune response and yet avoid the negative
inflammatory responses induced by prolonged Mtb infection.
 To achieve our goal, we first shall engineer an attenuated Mtb mutant defective in both of its iron acquisi-
tion pathways - siderophore-mediated iron acquisition (SMIA) and heme-iron acquisition (HIA). Such a mutant
will be unable to obtain iron from the host but can be pre-loaded in vitro with the precise amount of iron to allow
optimal replication in the host. Thus, an Mtb ∆SMIA ∆HIA mutant will allow us to address the first important
factor - controlling the extent of replication in the host. While growth of Mtb ∆SMIA ∆HIA in the host will cease
once it exhausts its supply of iron, the organism may persist for a prolonged period. Thus, to address the
second important factor, the rate of clearance from the host, we shall further modify Mtb ∆SMIA ∆HIA, via two
approaches – 1) knocking out persistence genes and 2) conditional silencing of essential genes. While both
should result in improved clearance, conditional silencing likely will result in faster clearance. We shall vaccin-
ate mice with persistence and conditional silencing mutants and perform clearance and protective efficacy
studies to determine the optimal replication and clearance. We expect a replication- and persistence-limited
Mtb mutant with rapid clearance will be much more efficacious than BCG and, in contrast to BCG, safe even in
an immunocompromised host. Once we have optimized the vaccine for protective immunity in mice, we shall
examine its immunogenicity in mice to assess preliminary correlates of protection, assess its safety in immuno-
compromised SCID mice, and examine its safety and efficacy in a second animal model of TB - guinea pigs."

 The kinetoplastid parasites Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania spp. affect millions
of people worldwide, causing Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), Chagas’ disease, and various forms of
Leishmaniasis, respectively. Since drugs for these neglected tropical diseases are limited, often toxic and difficult
to administer, and parasite resistance to existing drugs is on the rise, it is important to develop new chemo-
therapeutic strategies. Our research is focused on trypanosome gene expression because the underlying
mechanisms deviate substantially from those in the human host. For example, polycistronic transcription of
protein coding genes and processing of pre-mRNA by spliced leader trans splicing are parasite-specific steps in
mRNA synthesis and maturation. We discovered in T. brucei that the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase
(CDK) CRK9 is required for trans splicing. By generating a cell line that expresses analog-sensitive CRK9 and
no wild-type enzyme, we could chemically inhibit the enzyme in specific manner in cultured cells. Surprisingly,
we observed an instant splicing block after applying the inhibitor, suggesting that CRK9 carries out essential
reversible phosphorylation on the RNA processing machinery. Our preliminary data indicate that one of CRK9’s
substrate is the SR protein and known splicing factor TSR1, and that blocking CRK9 activity affects the assembly
of the spliceosome, the large and dynamic RNA-protein complex that carries out the splicing reaction.
Consequently, we will determine the mechanism of how CRK9 aids or controls the splicing process. Furthermore,
CDKs represent a highly druggable enzyme class, and CRK9 forms an unusual trimeric enzyme complex with a
deviant L-type cyclin and a kinetoplastid-specific protein, suggesting that CRK9 is a promising target for
chemotherapeutic intervention. Therefore, we propose to characterize the enzyme complex and determine a
minimal complex that is active and can be expressed recombinantly as prerequisite for future high throughput
inhibitor screens. Finally, based on preliminary data, we will test the hypothesis that CRK9 is the target of the
compound SCYX-7158 which is currently in clinical trials against HAT."

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the 4th leading cause of death worldwide, resulting in an
immense public health burden. The clinical manifestations of COPD are extremely heterogeneous, and
disease course is affected by numerous endogenous and exogenous factors. Finding groups of patients with
similar pathobiology is crucial for the accurate prediction of disease progression and the development of
personalized treatments. Currently, clinical research has been divided in the discrimination of patients based
on either their phenotypic features, such as lung function, exacerbation frequency/intensity, presence of
emphysema (clinical subtyping), or on the molecular compositions of their biological samples, as assessed
through multi-omics assays (molecular subtyping). Despite providing some insights on different groupings of
COPD patients, little agreement has been found between these two classification approaches. As such, the
connection between pathophysiological processes, exposures, and their phenotypic consequences is currently
unclear. In this application we propose to use deep neural network architectures to integrate phenotypic and
genomic data of COPD subjects and construct integrated patient profiles that describe both the phenotypic and
molecular features of the patient simultaneously. These profiles will be used to cluster patients to find joint
clinical and molecular subtypes (endotypes) for COPD and to predict disease outcomes across a 5-year time
span. We will extract the characteristic clinical and molecular features of each endotype to obtain endotype-
specific biomarkers and connect them to clinical manifestations of COPD. Finally, we will develop network-
based approaches to understand the key molecular pathways and regulators associated with each endotype.
Achieving the objectives proposed in this plan will require a unique set of skills that span biology, network
science, machine learning, and lung disease biology. Although Dr. Maiorino’s past career trajectory has
prepared him well for the proposed research, advancing our current understanding of COPD heterogeneity is a
challenging task that will require further training in specific areas. Dr. Maiorino has developed a comprehensive
training program focusing on pulmonary disease biology, omics data integration, and high-dimensional
statistics. Dr. Maiorino will take advantage of the rich intellectual environment offered by the Channing Division
of Network Medicine and Harvard Medical School to attend courses and participate in regular meetings with his
mentors and advisory board members. Altogether, Dr. Maiorino’s training and research plan will enable him to
expand his current skillset and to develop into an independent investigator contributing to the advancement of
precision medicine in COPD."
10798247,"Project Summary/Abstract: Catheter ablation targeting the pulmonary veins and other atrial sites has emerged
as the best intervention for restoring and maintaining sinus rhythm; however, 1-year success rates are only 60-
70%. Because ablation does not benefit all atrial fibrillation (AF) patients, a personalized medicine approach is
needed to avoid an unnecessary procedure (cost >$20,000, risk ~5%) for expected non-responders (30-40%).
Potential predictors of AF recurrence derived from standard clinical and imaging metrics have proven to be of
limited use. Left atrial (LA) fibrosis is more promising, because fibrosis plays a central role in the development
of an arrhythmogenic substrate for AF and may be a marker for more extensive disease less amenable to
standard pulmonary vein isolation. In fact, LA fibrosis assessed with 3D LA late gadolinium enhancement (LGE)
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), pioneered by the Utah group, has shown promise for predicting AF
recurrence post-ablation. However, the “Utah” classification of LA fibrosis has garnered skepticism because of
a lack of independent verification and validation. This lack of reproducibility stems from two fundamental
methodologic deficiencies: (a) inadequate spatial resolution (1.5 mm x 1.5 mm x 2.5 to 5 mm) and contrast-to-
noise ratio (CNR) and lengthy scan time (~11 min) at 1.5 Tesla and (b) unreliable image analysis techniques for
quantification of fibrosis in the thin (~2 mm) LA wall. These deficiencies preclude widespread adoption of LA
fibrosis quantification in clinical practice.
 To push the field of forward through these obstacles, we propose to develop disruptive technologies for
quantification of LA fibrosis by integrating the following advanced techniques: (1) free-breathing 3D LGE CMR
balanced steady state free precession (b-SSFP) readout with stack-of-stars k-space sampling and compressed
sensing (CS) or eXtra-Dimensional Golden-angle RAdial Sparse Parallel (XD-GRASP) reconstruction with self-
gating respiratory motion for achieving unprecedented image quality (i.e. CNR) with high spatial resolution (1.3
mm x 1.3 mm x 1.5 mm) and acceptable scan time (6 min) at 1.5 Tesla and (2) novel signatures technique for
precise quantification of LA fibrosis using stochastic analysis. Unique advantages of the proposed signatures
technique over standard analysis techniques include: (2a) more precise threshold-free fibrosis definition, (2b)
insensitivity to LA segmentation, (2c) self-correction for intensity inhomogeneity, (2d) standardization and
patient-specific quantification, and (2e) full automation and fast (2 min) processing.
 The specific objectives of this multi-center study are to: a) develop and validate robust 3D LA LGE CMR
acquisition and reconstruction methods for 1.5 Tesla, (b) develop and validate a novel LGE signatures technique
for quantification of LA fibrosis, and c) evaluate the prediction accuracy and reproducibility of LA fibrosis
signatures across two sites. This proposal has high potential impact because it addresses two fundamental
methodologic deficiencies precluding widespread adoption of LA fibrosis quantification in clinical practice."

This proposal seeks to engineer an allogeneic zygapophyseal (facet joint) articular resurfacing (AZAR) system
by following a rational experimental approach in three specific aims: the AZAR system will consist of a cartilage
component (chondro-portion) robustly integrated with a bone-like scaffold component (osteo-portion); the
replacement will be secured in situ in the recipient bone bed of the facet joint. In Aim 1, three levels of human
and minipig facet joints from both sexes will be fully characterized to define design criteria for the AZAR system.
The AZAR system will be designed and fabricated through three phases in Aim 2. First, cytochalasin-D and
hyaluronidase will be applied to minipig passaged chondrocytes to engineer the chondro-portion of the implant
with compressive properties mimetic to native tissue values. In the same phase, methods for using lysyl oxidase
like protein-2 (LOXL2) and tensile stimulation (CoTenS) will be identified to improve the tensile properties of the
chondro-portion to native tissue levels. In Aim 2, Phase II, the pore size of the osteo-portion (i.e., the bone
portion) directly beneath the engineered cartilage will be fine-tuned for optimum cartilage integration. In Aim 3,
minimally invasive surgical methods will be developed for implanting a total facet replacement in the minipig,
analogous to the ones currently employed in human patients. Finally, the AZAR system will be implanted into
both male and female minipigs to examine its efficacy prior to moving to bipedal models in future studies.
Successful completion of this proposal will allow, for the first time, resurfacing of an entire articular surface in a
diarthrodial joint using a tissue engineered construct. It will also shed light on as-of-yet unexplored structure-
function relationships in the poorly studied facet joint. Last, but not least, it will contribute toward new therapies
for facet-related ailments."

Heavy and frequent alcohol use remains a key public health concern, particularly among young adults. Recent
experimental evidence has shown that a single heavy drinking event is associated with short-term structural
changes in the brain among a sample of young adults and preliminary diary evidence suggests alcohol use may
impact concentration and working memory capacity. As young adults are at highest risk of alcohol use relative
to any other age group, such immediate structural changes may signal a need for early prevention and
intervention efforts, although the long-term impacts of alcohol use on the brain within a sample of young adults
remain unknown. A key indicator of longer-term cognitive outcomes is observed functional impacts on young
adult behavior in their daily lives. Changes in daily behaviors during this period could negatively impact
cognitive health into midlife. Our team aims to collect intensive data across a 21-day period from a sample of
250 young adults to explore the acute, next-day (post-intoxication) effects of alcohol use on cognitive
functioning overall, across multiple timeframes, and by type of drinking episode (light drinking, binge drinking,
high-intensity drinking, blackout drinking). We also seek to examine day-level and person-level moderators to
inform moments and subgroups at greatest risk and in need of early targeted prevention and intervention
efforts. Specifically, the current exploratory and developmental R21 has three aims. Aim 1 will (a) examine
acute, next-day effects of any alcohol use on cognitive functioning (episodic memory, executive functioning,
working memory) and across various time frames (i.e., upon waking only or persisting throughout the day); and
(b) examine whether these daily associations differ by type of drinking episode (light drinking, binge drinking,
high-intensity drinking, blackout drinking). Aim 2 will examine day-level moderators (hangover symptoms,
mood, sleep, prior day cannabis, other substance use) that may buffer or exacerbate day-level associations
between alcohol use (any drinking, light drinking, binge drinking, high-intensity drinking, blackout drinking) and
cognitive functioning. Finally, Aim 3 will examine person-level variables (sex, baseline alcohol use severity,
general cognitive functioning) as moderators of day-level associations between alcohol use (any drinking, light
drinking, binge drinking, high-intensity drinking, blackout drinking) and cognitive functioning. By identifying the
acute impacts of varying levels of alcohol use intensity on next-day cognitive functioning as well as the day-
and person-level characteristics that moderate these associations, our findings will have critical implications for
the role of alcohol use on everyday cognitive functioning and highlight subgroups most in need of monitoring
and early intervention. Findings from this exploratory and developmental R21 will also position our team well to
ultimately examine whether day-level associations accumulate and are indicative of later alcohol-related and
cognition-related problems."
10762440,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The availability of donor-matched sources of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) continues to limit access to and
outcomes following allogeneic HSC transplant. Unmet need for improved HSC sources has motivated global
improvements in donor recruitment and matching, as well as enterprising attempts to develop patient-derived or
universally compatible hematopoietic cells. At present, specification of HSCs in a dish has been inefficient, and
most methods using co-culture and expression of hematopoietic genes only produce progenitors with limited
lineage and engraftment potential.
Our studies show that biomechanical force caused by flow of blood through the vasculature is a critical regulator
of hematopoiesis and can promote engraftment of cells with long-term hematopoietic reconstitution potential. In
our prior funding period, we found that initiation of blood flow is a critical determinant of energy metabolism and
mitochondrial dynamics in the HSC precursor known as the hemogenic endothelium.
The objective of our current research is to define metabolic adaptations that promote definitive hematopoiesis, with
the long-term goal of exploiting biophysical cues such as shear stress in directed differentiation and expansion of
customized HSCs for therapeutic transplant and blood disease modeling. Specifically, we aim to define the
contribution of mitochondrial maturation to development of the hemogenic endothelium that gives rise to HSCs.
We will employ a combination of methods that provide single-cell resolution of metabolic activity, mitochondrial
ultrastructure, and hematopoietic function. Our first aim is designed to address the effects of interrupting
mitochondrial maturation on commitment of hemogenic endothelial precursors to the hematopoietic fate via
pharmacological targeting, biomimetic modeling with in vitro platforms, and cardiac mutant mouse models. In our
second aim, we leverage pilot data from complementary datasets that support a role for the mitochondrial
permeability transition pore (mPTP) in differentiation of arterial endothelium. We address how biphasic regulation
of mPTP opening over the continuum of the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) dictates acquisition of
hematopoietic fate. Consequences of disrupted or enhanced mPTP activity will be defined during EHT by
assessing indicators of metabolic and hematopoietic capacity. The proposed study will address a major deficiency
in our understanding of how mitochondrial maturation contributes to transition of endothelial to hematopoietic fate
and promises to inspire novel methods for generation of HSCs in vitro by metabolic reprogramming."

The goal of this project is to study the cellular basis of active sensation. A crucial function of all nervous systems
is to distinguish between sensory stimuli originating from the external world and that generated by our own
movements. This task relies on brain circuits that integrate sensory information with an internal model, or
expectation, of self-generated movements. The complexity and intractability of many models used to study active
sensing means that translating insights from these studies to failures of normal nervous system function remains
challenging. Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) actively move their antennae, and my recent work has
elucidated a neural circuit that processes mechanosensory information from the antenna. Given the power of
Drosophila as a genetic model organism, this project aims to develop the neural circuits controlling and sensing
antennal movement as a cellular model for studying principles of active sensing. In the K99 (mentored) portion
of this grant, I will identify the cellular location at which self- versus externally-generated mechanosensory signals
become differentially represented in the brain. I will make electrophysiological recordings of intracellular activity
from 2nd and 3rd order mechanosensory neurons and compare how these two populations encode passive and
active movements of the antennae. I will distinguish between these two types of movements using machine
learning analysis of simultaneously recorded video data. For the R00 (independent) phase, I will use
optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to identify motor neurons that control antennal movement. I will then
ask where input from motor neurons impinge on the sensory circuit. Finally, I will test the role of active antennal
movements in behavior. By perturbing active antennal movements in freely walking and flying flies, I will directly
test how these movements enable different behavioral tasks such as wind orientation and obstacle avoidance.
Together, these experiments will identify the cellular basis for active sensing in Drosophila, and their role in goal-
oriented behaviors."

Drug resistance mutations disrupt key physiological processes resulting in severe fitness costs; compensatory
mutations are expected to evolve to restore fitness. Such compensatory mutations are extensively studied in
bacterial pathogens, but are much less well understood in P. falciparum. This application aims to redress this by
using three complimentary approaches to investigate compensation. First, we will exploit reverse genetic
approaches to investigate the role of an amino acid transporter (pfaat1) in quinolone drug resistance evolution.
Like the well-studied chloroquine resistance transporter, pfaat1 is situated on the food vacuole membrane, and
several lines of compelling population genomic and experimental data suggest that interplay between these two
transporters may play a role in drug resistance evolution. We will test competing hypothesis that mutations in
this locus compensate for reduced fitness of CQ-resistant parasites, or play a role in response to other quinolone
drugs. Genetic mapping methods (e.g. linkage mapping, genome wide association) typically aim to link parasite
genotype with drug resistance; these approaches are poorly suited to identifying compensatory loci as these
may have no influence on IC50. The second aim will use a modification of an alternative well-proven approach
to identify resistance genes (in vitro drug selection) to specifically target compensatory loci. However, rather than
selecting with drugs, we will introduce known resistance mutations onto a drug sensitive background, and then
culture these parasites in the absence of drug pressure, to select for mutations that restore parasite fitness. We
hypothesize that this will provide a powerful approach to understand the mutations and biochemical pathways
that can compensate for pfcrt mutations underlying piperaquine resistance and kelch13 mutations underlying
artemisinin resistance. Monitoring longitudinal evolution within parasite populations in the field provides a
complimentary approach to identify compensatory loci: this can identify variants showing parallel rapid increase
in allele frequency with known resistance loci. The final aim in this proposal will examine genes showing similar
patterns of allele frequency change to kelch13 on the Thai-Myanmar border. We will test the hypothesis that
these are enriched for genes involved for those playing a compensatory role in drug resistance evolution."
10814342,"Project Summary/Abstract
Carcinogenic mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway are present in 46% of all human cancers. This has
inspired the successful development of many small molecule BRAF and MEK pathway inhibitors. These agents
are currently FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic melanomas containing BRAF mutations. Although
BRAF and MEK inhibitors have shown some benefits to patients, these “targeted” therapeutics have a very low
therapeutic index, since these small molecules also target normal cells, causing undesirable, even fatal, side
effects. Moreover, whether the clinical efficacy of these inhibitors is via direct effects on the tumor or through
modulation of the tumor stromal compartment remains elusive. In this application, we address the above critical
unmet needs and will develop a potent and highly tumor-selective MEK inactivator by engineering an anthrax
toxin-based protein delivery system. Through manipulating the expression of the toxin receptor on specific tumor
stromal cell types, we will also delineate how stromal MEK inhibition regulates tumor development.
We propose two parallel, but independent Specific Aims to achieve these goals. In Aim 1, we will generate an
anthrax toxin-based, highly tumor-selective MEK inactivator and evaluate its anti-tumor activity in a variety of
tumor models. This MEK inactivator specifically binds to the major toxin receptor CMG2 (capillary morphogenesis
protein-2) on tumor cells and tumor stromal cells. Specificity is ensured through strict reliance on the
simultaneous presence of two distinct tumor-associated proteases, MMPs and urokinase, to gain entry into tumor
cells and tumor stromal cells. Once inside, it inactivates MEK-ERK signaling, achieving potent selective targeting.
In Aim 2, we will employ our unique tumor-host-toxin system to determine the roles of MEK-ERK signaling in
tumor stromal cells in tumor development and in the toxin’s tumor targeting. We have previously established a
genetic system allowing CMG2 gain-of-function or loss-of-function in various specific cell types in the tumor
microenvironment. Thus, we hypothesize that a genetic manipulation of CMG2 expression on cancer cells and
various tumor stromal cells in the whole body of CMG2-/- mice will provide the first tractable genetic system to
delineate the role of specific cell types in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, in this Aim 2, we will determine
the roles of selected tumor stromal cell types including tumor endothelial cells (EC), tumor-associated
macrophages (TAM), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), B cells, and regulatory T cells (Treg), and the
molecular mechanisms of MEK-ERK inhibition in these cells in tumor development. Upon completion of these
studies, we expect to have developed a highly potent, tumor-selective MEK inactivator as a novel tumor-targeted
therapeutic. These studies will also unambiguously determine the role of MEK-ERK signaling in both the tumor
and the stroma, thereby validating and identifying specific tumor stromal cell types as targets for future
therapeutics development."
10894190,"ABSTRACT – MIDUS OVERALL PLAN
The Midlife in the U.S. (MIDUS) national longitudinal study has been ongoing since 1995. MIDUS is the only
national study focused on midlife with a wide age expanse at baseline. MIDUS also has unusual depth in its
psychosocial, biomarker, genomic, and neuroscience assessments, thus permitting a focus on neurobiological
mechanisms and pathways through which sociodemographic and psychosocial factors influence morbidity and
mortality. This application aims to conduct a 2nd wave of data collection on the MIDUS Refresher sample
(MR2) as well as a 4th wave of data collection on the Core sample (M4), including all projects in both. Four
projects (Survey, Daily Diary, Biomarkers, Genomics) are part of this U19 competing continuation application,
which is linked with an Ancillary U01 application on Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and Related Dementias (ADRD)
that will examine midlife precursurs to cognitive decline, emotion regulation, brain aging, and their interplay.
Much of that prior work is also longitudinal, although it now includes new ADRD neuroscience and biomarkers.
Overall, the proposed activities involve over 5,200 U.S. adults that will be supported by an Administrative Core
responsible for orchestrating cross-project data collection and delivering high-quality, well-documented data; a
BioCore that ensures quality control in biomarker data collection and offers guidance on use of biomarkers;
and a Statistics Core that provides workshops on multiple topics (modeling longitudinal change, using genomic
data, linking MIDUS to other datasets). Recurring scientific themes in the proposed science are health
inequalities and racial disparities examined with the rich biopsychosocial data available in MIDUS, including
wide-ranging assessments of stress exposures across multiple waves, thereby providing indicators of
cumulative adversity. MIDUS is also known for its comprehensive assessments of psychosocial and
behavioral protective factors, thereby advancing research on resilience in the face of challenge. Aging on a
changing historical stage is another key theme in MIDUS exemplified by a past focus on hardships of the
Great Recession, and going forward, a new parallel focus on hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms
of scientific engagement, MIDUS is the most frequently downloaded study at the National Archive of
Computerized Data on Aging (NACDA). Widespread usage from the scientific community (26,000+ public
users) has culminated in 1,617 publications covering 38 substantive domains. Underscoring the momentum
behind MIDUS, more than half of these products are journal articles published during the current funding cycle
(2016-present)."

 The overall goal of the PITT-ADRC is to perform and promote research that increases our 
understanding of: 1) the etiology and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), 2) the mechanisms underlying 
the cognitive and behavioral symptoms of AD, and 3) to develop strategies that will result in effective early 
diagnoses and treatments for AD and related dementias. The Neuroimaging Core (NIC) will support these 
Center-wide goals by developing and applying cutting edge neuroimaging technology to studies that are 
focused on early and presymptomatic stages of the AD spectrum. 
 As the search for preclinical biomarkers continues, it is becoming increasingly clear that functional and 
structural brain imaging data may hold the key to identifying the earliest pathological manifestations of AD prior 
to any meaningful clinical change. The NIC will continue to develop and distribute technology for acquiring and 
interpreting brain functional and structural imaging data in the support of AD research. The NIC will advance 
the Center goals by supporting and promoting research that increases our understanding of the etiology and 
pathogenesis of AD and facilitates the development of new therapies and methods for monitoring therapeutic 
efficacy. The NIC maintains data sets of structural imaging on individuals enrolled through the Clinical Core, 
and we continue to work on the expansion of leading-edge analytic technologies, and novel radiotracer ligands 
measured with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (i.e., PiB, AV-1451 and GTP-1). 
 The work of the NIC will accelerate efforts to identify early and presymptomatic AD by identifying 
imaging biomarkers to monitor the natural and treated history of the disease. The curated, “trial-ready” 
participant database will allow PITT-ADRC researchers to track biomarker-based clinical progression and to 
identify risk and protective factors. This database will also uniquely position the PITT-ADRC to identify potential 
participants based on specific biomarker characteristics. Finally, the NIC’s focus on quality assurance will 
ensure that neuroimaging methods are generating data measuring what they purport to measure and that the 
analysis stream retains the integrity of these data, ensuring that the statistical methodologies generate model 
that are biologically meaningful."

Dietary excess rapidly induces the inflammatory activation and accumulation of a heterogeneous
population of myeloid cells, broadly termed microglia, in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH), a critical
brain region involved in the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis. We showed that microglial
activation in this context is sufficient to stimulate food intake and body weight gain, however the metabolic
factors initiating this response remain to be elucidated. Diet is a major factor affecting the composition of
the gut microbiota, and high-fat diet (HFD) consumption induces unfavorable alterations in the type and
proportion of commensal microorganisms in the gut. These changes influence the inflammatory and
metabolic properties of the host and may also impact microglial function in the MBH. To this end, microglia
in germ-free (GF) mice are hyperactivated in the MBH compared to other brain regions such as cortex.
This microglial activation is already manifested during neonatal period and colonizing the gut of pregnant
GF dams at embryonic day 16 (E16) restored postnatal microglial homeostasis in the MBH of their pups.
Moreover, we found that supplementation of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), metabolites produced by
bacterial fermentation of non-digestible carbohydrates, is sufficient to reduce microglial activation in the
MBH and body weight gain in HFD- fed mice. Based on substantial work, both published and preliminary,
we propose here to test the hypothesis that MBH microglia, which reside close to fenestrated blood
vessels, are uniquely regulated by specific microbial metabolites such as SCFAs. Specifically, we aim to
A) determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which SCFA-FFAR2 (free fatty acid receptor 2)
signaling regulates microglial homeostasis in the MBH, B) determine whether SCFA-AhR (aryl
hydrocarbon receptor) interactions regulate microglial homeostasis in the MBH, and C) determine whether
microbial metabolites regulate postnatal immunological imprinting of MBH microglia. Completing these
aims has the potential to reveal unprecedented mechanistic insights of how microbial metabolites modulate
identity and function of MBH microglia engaged in regulating metabolic function, providing novel
therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases."

the intricacies of biology, from macromolecular complexes to complex mixtures, from atomic resolution structure
to dynamics on timescales of picoseconds to seconds, from chemistry to functional mechanisms and kinetic
processes. No other technology has such breadth and potential for basic and applied research and for interfacing
with other technologies, such as X-ray crystallography, small angle X-ray scattering, Cryo-EM, mass
spectrometry, and many other spectroscopic and analytical tools. Structural characterization serves as the
framework for using NMR to understand biological activities, protein-protein and protein interface interactions,
functional mechanisms, and kinetic models. Dynamics can be exceptionally well characterized by NMR, which
can lead to detailed understanding about how proteins and other macromolecules function, how complexes are
formed, and how certain kinetic processes and rates are achieved. The solution NMR spectroscopy of complex
mixtures is particularly useful in combination with mass spectrometry for metabolomics and other complex
mixtures, whereas solid-state NMR (ssNMR) is uniquely capable of measuring chemical shift and quadrupolar
tensors to provide insights into chemical biology. Here, we focus on the frontiers of NMR technology made
possible by recent breakthroughs in materials research and instrumentation, and their implementation for a broad
user community pursuing fundamental questions at atomic resolution at the forefront of biomedical research.
 Three Technology Development Projects (TDP) advance the sensitivity of NMR, each featuring novel
technologies. TDP1 features the use of high temperature superconductors (HTS) for RF coils, leading to high
sensitivity for solution NMR spectroscopy. TDP2 takes advantage of our 600 MHz MAS-DNP NMR instrument,
which will provide enhanced sensitivity through the transfer of magnetization from electrons to protons. New and
much more robust DNP probes with expanded temperature ranges will be developed. TDP3 uses the 36 T Series
Connected Hybrid (36T-SCH) and all-HTS 32 T superconducting (32T-SCM) magnets for ssNMR and solution
NMR spectroscopy – the 36T-SCH is the highest-field NMR spectrometer in the world, and the 32T-SCM will be
the highest-field spectrometer with low-temperature (4-30 K) capabilities for NMR explorations of biosolids.
These platforms will lead to dramatic enhancements in sensitivity and spectacular reductions in signal averaging
times. The science will be driven by a select team of ten scientists with Driving Biomedical Projects (DBP), and
over 30 Collaborative and Service Projects (CSP) and Technology Partnership Projects (TPP) that span a very
broad range of biomedical and biochemical research areas. A major team effort will be placed on training a new
generation of NMR users through annual workshops, as well as dissemination through publications and
presentations at meetings, a wide variety of scientific organizations, news media, a dedicated website for this

Epidemiology and Clinical Research Training Program at Hopkins. The goal of this program is to identify and
train scientists who have the potential to become leaders in the design and conduct of epidemiologic, clinical
and translational research related to kidney disease. The Program is based in the Welch Center for
Prevention, Epidemiology, and Clinical Research. It takes advantage of the faculty’s strengths in the
application of rigorous methodology to study kidney disease; their ability to design interdisciplinary, high-impact
research; and their dedication to education and mentorship. The program Director (Dr. Appel), Associate
Directors (Drs. Fadrowski, Grams, Segev), and 14 other nationally recognized kidney disease researchers
serve as core faculty, and another 11 faculty serve as affiliate faculty. An Advisory Committee of institutional
leaders and accomplished researchers advise the program’s leadership and monitor its progress.
Our training program has been highly successful. We have recruited exceptionally high-quality candidates,
provided them with rigorous training, and helped launch their research careers. Over the last 15 years, we
supported 31 post-doctoral trainees (77% women, 10% underrepresented minorities). Of the 25 graduates, 24
are pursuing academic careers, and the vast majority are scientists; 12 received federal grants (11 K
awardees). The NRSA funding has established Hopkins as a pre-eminent academic center for the design and
conduct of clinical, epidemiologic and translational research related to kidney disease; spawned new research
programs (e.g. the CKD Prognosis Consortium and the Kidney Transplant Outcomes program) and new
education initiatives (e.g. kidney disease epidemiology course); revitalized the Pediatric Nephrology fellowship;
forged close collaborative relations across schools and academic units; and most importantly, produced a
cadre of extremely successful young investigators who are doing innovative research at institutions across the
U.S. Still, we will not rest on our laurels. With funding from this application, we intend to increase the size of
our training program from 4 to 6 post-doctoral trainees, expand the core faculty (including luminaries recruited
from other institutions: D. Brennan, C. Chute, and C. Parikh), and enhance trainee recruitment efforts,

physical complications with many patients acquiring long-term impairments. Mechanisms and factors that
impede the recovery of muscle size and function after hospitalization are not understood. It is unclear if
recovery after critical illness leads to a subsequent deficiency in the ability to make new proteins (protein
synthesis) or if a catabolic/inflammatory environment persists preventing muscle regrowth which involves
muscle stem cell (satellite cell) fusion to myofibers. We will address gaps in knowledge by studying skeletal
muscle proteostasis, cellular environment, and RNA and mitochondrial biogenesis after critical illness with
closely aligned physical function outcomes. Understanding the cellular environment in the period after hospital
release, and how it impacts muscle protein turnover will direct efforts to effective therapies to accelerate
muscle regrowth. The overall goal of this application is to identify cellular properties of muscle that may
contribute to long-term physical disability in survivors of critical illness. Overall, I hypothesize that aberrant
cellular processes in muscle are underlying prolonged functional impairments in patients after critical illness. In
Aim 1, we will determine the longitudinal trajectory of muscle and physical function recovery and establish
muscle morphological and cellular characteristics in patients after critical illness. We hypothesize that patients
with higher severity of illness in the ICU and with longer duration of mechanical ventilation will have the most
persistent muscle weakness and deficits in muscle power in recovery. In Aim 2, we will identify cellular
mechanisms that contribute to muscle dysfunction after critical illness. We hypothesize that patients with
persistent muscle weakness and fatigue have impaired mitochondrial function compared to controls. Moreover,
we hypothesize that survivors of critical illness have elevated myofibrillar protein synthesis and ribosome
biogenesis in early recovery, but muscle regrowth does not occur due to elevated proteolysis. The overarching
goal of this proposal focuses on elucidating the factors that lead to muscle mass dysregulation in recovery and
inform why some patients develop persistent disability and others gradually improve. The proposed mentoring
team provides the knowledge and training to develop into an independent clinical investigator integrating basic
and applied science. The proposed training plan in Aim 1 emphasizes clinical trial methodologies and complex
longitudinal analyses. For aim 2, the training focuses on skeletal muscle experiments; specifically, knowledge
to assess muscle proteostasis, mitochondrial content and function, and muscle morphology. I will learn the
technical skills to examine skeletal muscle including stable isotope labeling, immunohistochemistry, western
blot analysis, and microscopy will be gained. Moreover, the proposed research and training plan provides the
necessary training and mentorship to translate findings in this proposal into the development of targeted
rehabilitation and pharmacological interventions in future R01 studies."
10887480,"Project Summary/Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the second most common malignancy among children and adolescents. The
prognosis of pediatric AML has improved significantly over recent decades, but still nearly half of patients
suffer refractory disease or relapse following a first remission. These patients have a relatively poor prognosis,
with a probability of five-year survival following relapse of only ~35%. This is achieved with intensive
chemotherapy leading to potentially significant toxicity and even treatment-related mortality. While there has
been substantial standardization in practice related to frontline therapy for AML, there is greater variability in
treatment of relapsed disease – variability that is poorly understood. Furthermore, given the variability in
treatment and the small numbers of patients at any one institution, there is a dearth of information on toxicity
risks for the treatments being utilized for refractory or relapsed disease. Cardiotoxicity is a prevalent adverse
consequence of AML therapy. However, given the incomplete data captured by frontline clinical trial databases
once a patient experiences relapse, data on the onset, progression and potential recovery of cardiotoxicity are
generally restricted to the time period during and shortly after frontline therapy and late in long-term
survivorship. The current lack of data over the duration of the patient experience precludes a complete
assessment of the incremental risks associated with AML therapy, including transplant and salvage. Data on
how early cardiotoxicity onset during frontline therapy may impact approach to treatment for relapsed disease,
the impact of salvage therapies on cardiac function, and subsequent survival outcomes is thus, also poorly
understood. The aims of the proposed work are to establish a unique data resource by combining data from
the Children's Oncology Group (COG) clinical trial databases, electronic medical record (EMR) abstraction for
a multi-center AML cohort, longitudinal quantitative echocardiographic measures of measures of left ventricular
(LV) size, systolic and diastolic function, and administrative data from the Pediatric Health Information System,
that will enable assessments comparing toxicity and outcomes associated with the variety of approaches to
therapy for refractory/relapsed AML. Specifically, our aims include the following: (1) determine the natural
history cardiotoxicity and the incremental effects of treatment from initial diagnosis, through relapse and early
post-relapse follow-up, (2) to quantify the influence of prevalent salvage therapies on longitudinal changes in
LV size, systolic and diastolic function and the incidence of cardiomyopathy, and (3) to evaluate salvage
chemotherapy and transplant as mediators of the documented association between early cardiotoxicity onset
during frontline therapy and decreased overall survival."
10887481,"The mission of the Office of Indiana State Chemist (OISC) is to protect the public consumer, livestock and
pets, and manufacturers/producers from: Falsely represented and otherwise misrepresented feed, fertilizer,
seed, and pesticide products in the marketplace; misuse of feed, fertilizer, seed or pesticides such that these
may cause disease or harm to persons or animals, or unacceptably disturb the environment. This mission is
accomplished by assuring truth in labeling for feed, fertilizer, seed, and pesticide products offered in Indiana
commerce; by requiring training of identified users and handlers of these materials; and by regulating products
and persons to gain compliance with Indiana and federal laws that have been assigned to OISC. OISC may
involve legal remedies (fines and penalties) 1) to secure an expectation of safety in the purchase of feed,
fertilizer, seed, and pesticide products marketed in Indiana for consumers, and therein, provide protection for
pets or livestock; 2) to ensure responsible use of these same products through labeling and educating the user
to gain compliance; and 3) to actively support an integrated food safety system and contribute to improving the
Indiana environment. The primary objective of our proposal is to further develop, implement, and sustain
Indiana's best practices for a quality regulatory program to enhance animal feed and food safety. This would
entail the strengthening of interagency collaboration, cooperation, and communication; achievement and
sustainment of compliance with the Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS); enhancement of
coordination and interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other states' feed
inspection programs. Under this proposal we are requesting $300,000 annually in grant funds for the next five
years. Grant funds will be used to augment current animal feed inspection program capabilities and provide the
necessary infrastructure to continue further development and sustainment of AFRPS. Time of one full-time
equivalent (FTE) employee, travel necessary for collaboration and innovation, and some laboratory equipment
and supplies will enable enhancements to the program's ability to conduct high-quality inspections and
investigations to reduce the incidence of animal feed contamination and ultimately foodborne illness associated
adulterated animal feed material/supply facilities."
10887603,"Diabetes mellitus causes microvascular complications in the retina and is a leading cause of blindness in the United
States. Treatments to restore vision are limited. Reduced retinal blood flow occurs in early diabetes, suggesting
that vasomotor dysregulation of retinal arterioles and/or venules leading to ischemia may contribute to later retinal
damage. However, no study has examined both arteriolar and venular vasomotor function together in the retina of
same diabetic subjects. Thus, a gap in knowledge is the limited understanding of mechanisms for retinal
arteriolar/venular vasomotor dysregulation in early diabetes to yield treatment before overt pathology. Excessive
production of vasoconstrictor and inflammatory agent endothelin-1 (ET-1) in the retina occurs in early diabetes,
so in-depth insight into molecular events regulating vasomotor responses to ET-1 in health and disease has
clinical implication. This proposal is based on evidence in type 1 diabetic pigs showing reduced retinal blood flow
at 2-wk diabetes, along with elevated retinal lactate and diminished oscillatory potentials in the electroretinogram,
indicating retinal ischemia and neural abnormality. Also, vitreous ET-1 level and retinal arteriolar endothelin-
converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) activity were elevated in diabetic pigs. Because ET-1 is derived from ECE-1 and causes
vasoconstriction via Rho kinase (ROCK) signaling, activation of ECE-1/ROCK may lead to retinal vasomotor
dysregulation and flow deficiency in early diabetes. Interestingly, diabetes enhances retinal venular, but not arteriolar,
constriction to ET-1 by activating reverse-mode Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), possibly involving Na+-H+ exchanger-1
(NHE1) and stress kinases (p38 and JNK). Thus, the objective of this study is to unveil the sequential molecular
pathways for vasomotor dysregulation of retinal arterioles and venules that promote retinal ischemia in early
diabetes. The central hypothesis is that early diabetes activates microvascular ECE-1 leading to enhanced ET-
1 production, which promotes retinal arteriolar constriction via Ca2+-dependent ROCK2/JNK signaling. In early
diabetes, the elevated ET-1 not only elicits retinal venular constriction via Ca2+-dependent ROCK1/JNK axis but
also augments the response by further promoting Ca2+ entry through activation of the p38/NHE1/NCX axis. The
cooperative promotion of arteriolar and venular constrictions to elevated ET-1 contributes to retinal ischemia and
neural abnormality. Two specific aims will be pursued to support the hypothesis: (1) Determine roles of ET-1
system activation and its molecular signaling in promoting retinal arteriolar constriction and consequent retinal
ischemia via Ca2+-dependent ROCK2/JNK axis in early diabetes. (2) Determine roles of ET-1 system activation
and its molecular signaling to augment retinal venular constriction with consequent retinal ischemia via Ca2+-
dependent ROCK1/JNK axis and activated p38/NHE1/NCX signaling pathway in early diabetes. Outcomes will
advance the knowledge of diabetes-induced retinal complications and suggest effective molecular targets for
improving and protecting retinal microvascular perfusion of the retina in early-stage diabetes before development
of retinal structure damage."
10839818,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Transcriptional cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as enhancers and promoters, play an essential role in all
biological processes by controlling the expression of their target genes. Sequence variants in these CREs can
perturb their target gene expression by altering the binding of transcription factors (TF). It is now clear that the
substantial risk is encoded within these noncoding regulatory variants in most human disorders. However,
systematic identification of regulatory variants and their causative transcriptional machinery for human
diseases remains challenging. Over the past decade, we have pioneered to solve these important problems and
have made significant progress in developing machine-learning-based methods to predict CREs (gkm-SVM)
and regulatory variants (deltaSVM) from DNA sequence. We recently demonstrated that these regulatory
variants predicted by deltaSVM significantly contribute to the heritability of human traits and diseases in a
tissue- and cell-specific way. Here, we will extend these methodologies to further improve the discovery of
regulatory variants in the human genome and explore their contribution to human diseases and traits. Toward
this end, we will employ a two-step training approach. We will first build multiple sequence-based models to
predict regulatory variants trained on a compendium of genomic data. We will then train ensemble models to
find optimal combinations of these models to predict experimentally identified regulatory variants that exhibit
allelic imbalance in chromatin accessibility. Uniquely, we will build this model in a cell-type resolved manner
using human kidney single-cell chromatin accessibility data. Next, we will systematically assess these models
using a broad range of human traits and diseases from well-powered genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
We will then computationally identify targeted genes of these predicted regulatory variants and prioritize genes
based on their contribution to traits and diseases relevant to tissues and cells using co-localization analyses.
Lastly, we will experimentally validate these putative regulatory variants with massively parallel reporter
assays and their predicted target genes with multiple CRE deletion experiments using CRISPR-cas9. As an
exemplar, we will focus on kidney traits and use kidney relevant cell lines for these validation experiments. Our
framework will enable us to further improve regulatory variation discovery and ultimately help us better
understand how gene regulatory mechanisms are perturbed in human diseases and trait variation."
10764953,"The capacity of the immune system to govern repair after tissue damage is fundamental to protect the host
against infections. The gastrointestinal tract represents an ideal tissue to explore the mechanisms underlying
the exquisite balance between tissue damage and repair. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are a group of
heterogenous disorders, associated with contributing genetic and environmental factors, that are characterized
by inflammatory phases kept in balance by tissue repair. Although the etiology of IBDs is not clear, a hallmark of
these inflammatory diseases is a chronic and dysregulated immune response. Despite significant progress in
elucidating the mechanisms that govern tissue damage, the mechanistic underpinnings controlling how the
immune system affects the restitution phase following IBD flares have not been thoroughly explored. Interferons
(IFNs) are key players during an immune response and are increased in IBD. IFNs belong to three families: type
I, type II, and type III (also known as IFN-λ) IFNs. Type I IFNs and IFN-λ play potent anti-viral roles, both inducing
a similar set of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) that were believed to play only redundant roles. We recently
challenged this paradigm and showed that IFNλ, but not type I IFNs, limits inflammation during murine colitis by
dampening the tissue damaging functions of neutrophils. In keeping with a key role of IFN-λ in tuning
inflammation in the gut and in maintaining a healthy intestinal environment, we have recently identified two
unrelated IBD patients presenting in infancy that have rare-damaging mutations in IFN-λs that lead to defective
IFN-λ receptor signaling. This potential novel monogenic disorder links directly for the first-time defects in anti-
viral regulation with IBD pathogenesis. Although IFN-λ has anti-viral properties and limits inflammation and tissue
damage, the involvement of this group of IFNs during tissue restitution of the gut is more controversial. In keeping
with a detrimental role of IFN-λ at mucosal surfaces, we have recently demonstrated that IFNλ delays
proliferation and favors apoptosis of lung epithelial cells in mouse models of persistent viral infections and in
critically ill COVID-19 patients. By investigating the activity of IFNλ in multiple mouse models of intestinal
damage, we now revealed a new molecular cascade initiated by IFNλ in intestinal epithelial cells that culminates
in a form of cell death called pyroptosis. Our data demonstrate that IFNλ delays gut restitution. We hypothesize
that along the intestinal tract, IFNλ can play opposing roles during IBD. Although IFNλ dampens tissue damage,
it can delay tissue restitution because of its compartmentalized action on either neutrophils or IECs. Employing
murine and human model systems and human tissue, our goal is to decipher the mechanistic basis for both the
pathogenic and protective roles of IFNλ and to identify new therapeutic targets. To reach our goals we will
address: i) What drives the production of IFNλ, and which cells produce, or respond to, IFNλ; ii) What are the
components of the signaling cascade that controls pyroptosis induction in IECs; iii) How the production of IFNλ
is regulated during early childhood and how it impacts IBD development in patients."
10756166,"SUMMARY: The discovery and reﬁnement of brain-based signatures of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has
for many years been a highly desired, but as yet elusive, goal. One key challenge identiﬁed has been that
numerous levels and sources of variability — between sites, between participants, and within participants —
obscure the search for these reproducible neural signatures, complicating the search for biomarkers and
undermining the elucidation of cognitive and neural mechanisms. In this renewal application we propose a
sequence of studies to dissociate and quantify these sources of variability. We will acquire a new fMRI dataset
that is partly continuous with data accrued during the prior funding period and has 3 key features. First, we
will scan participants with ASD and matched controls while they watch complex videos with rich narrative
content. Evoked responses to videos constrain variability within and across participants and data collection
sites, as borne out by strong pilot data, and naturalistic videos better approximate the demands of processing
complex real-world social situations. Second, we will use densely-sampled, longitudinally-acquired, high-
quality neuroimaging data that will permit precise, stable, and reliable measurements of an individual's brain
function. Third, we will collect primary data at two sites (Indiana University and Caltech) in order to ensure
broader generalizability. Using machine learning techniques, Aim 1 will learn where in the brain and when, in
response to the video, individuals with ASD diverge most from control participants. Extending beyond group-
level averages, we will also take a dimensional approach to link brain diﬀerences to phenotypic variation, and
a clustering approach to identify variation consistent with the presence of ASD subgroups. In Aim 2, we will
leverage these results together with state-of-the-art computer vision and speech algorithms to quantify the
stimulus features of the videos that evoke these neural diﬀerences, both at the level of the group and of the
individual, and examine their relationship to phenotypic diﬀerences. Our comprehensive feature
decomposition of the videos will query high-level semantic features, object-level features like faces, and low-
level perceptual features. Finally Aim 3 will share the all the products of this work — e.g., raw and processed
data, acquisition tools, annotations, analysis scripts — on OpenNeuro, NDA, and Github in modern formats
(e.g., using BIDS format, and with fMRIprep and MRIQC as processing and quality assurance tools) to make
them maximally accessible to others. Uniquely, this data release will be validated and reﬁned at yet a third
site, the University of Iowa, on a smaller sample of control participants. This renewal application will thus build
upon tools, data, and progress from the current funding period, and capitalize on state-of-the-art computer
vision and neuroimaging analysis methods to identify audiovisual stimulus features that evoke atypical neural
activity in individuals with ASD. This project will provide new insight into neural and cognitive diﬀerences in
ASD, and help guide future investigations toward neuroimaging-based markers."
10813185,"Immunity to viral infections of the lung require cooperation between humoral and cellular arms of the immune
system. A newly defined subset of CD8 T cell, called CXCR5+ CD8 T cells, have been identified. CXCR5+ CD8
T cells can gain access to the B cell follicle of lymph nodes and interact with B cells. In settings of chronic
infection these CXCR5+ CD8 T cells may have stem-like potential and can differentiate further into effector CD8
T cells. Therefore, CXCR5+ CD8 T cells may have unique polyfunctionality to control both humoral and cellular
arms of the immune system. However, a fundamental understanding of the functions of CXCR5+ CD8 T cells
is lacking due to a paucity of tools to study these cells in vivo. The object of the proposed studies is to elucidate
the precise roles of CXCR5+ CD8 T cells in regulating cellular and antibody mediated anti-viral immunity during
acute respiratory infections, and to assess intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms controlling these functions. We
hypothesize that polyfunctional CXCR5+ CD8 T cells restrain humoral immunity yet are essential for cellular
immunity and T cell memory. We also hypothesize that the immune system can fine-tune immunity by altering
CXCR5+ CD8 T cell fates through extrinsic signals from effector Tfh cells, and intrinsic factors such as the
expression of the transcription factor Tbet. To test these hypotheses, we will: 1) assess the roles of CXCR5+
CD8 T cells to control humoral and cellular immunity at distinct times in vivo during viral infection and vaccination
with Influenza and SARS-CoV-2, and 2) assess the roles of extrinsic signals from Tfh cells and intrinsic signals
from Tbet to control CXCR5+ CD8 T cell memory and polyfunctionality. We will pursue these aims using
innovative strategies to identify and perturb CXCR5+ CD8 T cell subsets in vivo during viral infection and
vaccination in intact, polyclonal, mice. These strategies include newly developed CXCR5+ CD8 T cell deleter
and Tfh cell deleter models which facilitate the assessment of functionality during the distinct stages of viral
infection and vaccination. The expected outcome of these studies is an elucidation of the precise functions of,
and mechanisms controlling, CXCR5+ CD8 T cell regulation of humoral and cellular immunity. These studies
are significant because they will lead to a deeper understanding of how the immune system mediates anti-viral
immunity and will provide framework for the development of new therapeutics to enhance anti-viral immunity and
promote vaccine efficacy to influenza and SARS-CoV-2."
10833500,"Project Summary
The objective of this Phase II clinical trial is to identify how exercise training parameters, particularly the
specificity and intensity of stepping practice, influence long-term mobility outcomes in patients with subacute
stroke. Previous work indicates these variables can influence the efficacy of training interventions in
individuals without neurological injury, with some data to support their utility in chronic stroke. However,
studies that systematically assess the independent and combined effects of these principles in individuals early
following stroke are sparse. This critical research gap impedes clinical translation, and current clinical
practices remain adherent to traditional theories of rehabilitation, including lower intensity interventions focused
on underlying impairments. Additional concerns of providing only high-intensity walking training revolve around
the lack of attention toward movement quality will result in use of compensatory movement strategies that
could be reinforced with repeated practice, or that other risks of cardiovascular events should preclude high-
intensity training. Unfortunately, there is little data to support these hypotheses, and our studies suggest that
application of these training parameters can strongly influence walking function, as well as improve underlying
impairments and improve gait kinematics. Our approach is to characterize the effects of these training
variables on recovery of locomotor function and quality, as well as changes in impairments and other mobility
tasks in patients early post-stroke, in an effort to evaluate whether such training influences neurological
recovery or whether patients utilize compensatory strategies. In this 2x2 factorial RCT design, Aim 1 of the
study will characterize changes in mobility function associated with manipulation of specific and intensity of
exercise interventions. We will evaluate functional measures of gait speed and endurance, spatiotemporal
symmetry, as well as measures of cardiopulmonary fitness. We postulate that combined application of high-
intensity, task specific stepping practice will result in significantly greater increases in locomotor measures as
compared to lower intensity or non-specific training paradigms. In Aim 2, we will characterize the changes in
impairments (strength) and other mobility tasks (balance, sit-to-stand transfers) to determine whether stepping
intervention can mitigate the major impairments underlying post-stroke impairments. Quantitative measures of
volitional strength will be the primary outcomes. In Aim 3, we will characterize changes in community mobility
and quality of life, the later of which can inform us about cost-effectiveness. Overall, these results have
potential implications on the delivery of effective exercise interventions in person with subacute stroke."
10807106,"Project Summary: Proper mineralization of dental enamel protects against bacterial attack that causes
tooth decay (caries). The ameloblasts cells are responsible for producing and secreting an abundance of
proteins (laying a foundation for enamel growth) as well as engaging in active mineral transport (calcifying
the enamel). These functions are stage dependent with amelogenesis being divided into the secretory
(protein synthesis) and maturation stage (mineralization). However, the mechanisms providing metabolic
support for these processes and how mitochondrial dysfunction might alter them is poorly understood.
Mitochondria are organelles within the cells that convert nutrients into energy via the production of ATP,
and deficiency in mitochondrial function results in human diseases. Mitochondria play an important role
in enamel as evidenced by defects in mitochondrial DNA causing abnormal enamel development.
Therefore, the goal in this competing renewal proposal is to investigate the interplay between
mitochondrial function and enamel formation during environmental insults and determine whether this is
altered in patients with genetic disorders that effect mitochondrial function. We will specifically address
this in the context of Down syndrome (DS), or Trisomy 21, and during dental fluorosis, a process in which
exposure to excess of fluoride during development weakens tooth enamel. DS patients present with
enamel defects including hypocalcification and hypoplasia, both caused by developmental defects in
enamel formation. Mitochondrial dysfunction is widely reported in DS. The overarching hypothesis of
this proposal is that altered mitochondrial function in DS ameloblasts alters enamel crystal
formation and impacts sensitivity to fluorosis. In strong support, our preliminary data show that Dp-
16 mice (an established mouse model of DS) have mechanically weak and morphologically abnormal
enamel. Moreover, overexpression of RCAN1 (a gene associated with DS pathophysiology that is
expressed in ameloblasts) in enamel cell lines, significantly impaired mitochondrial function. We have
also reported that fluoride exposure of enamel cells significantly affected the biosynthesis of the proteins
of the electron transport chain (ETC) responsible for maintaining ATP production, but not in other cells
tested, suggesting unique sensitivity of enamel cells to fluoride, possibly associated with higher ROS
levels. In the proposed studies we will use DS mouse models (Dp16 mice, Rcan1-KO mice, Dp16 x
Rcan1-KO mice) to address the role of mitochondria in the ameloblasts of these mice. We will also use
recently developed reporter mice expressing fluorescently labelled secretory and maturation stage
ameloblasts to induce fluoride and investigate mitochondrial defects using single cell RNASeq and bulk
RNAseq to compare ameloblasts with other tissues. To address if ameloblasts of DS models are more
sensitive to fluoride, we will treat the cells with fluoride and analyze mitochondrial function."
10810782,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Proper brain development requires precise dosages of genes critical for synapse formation. Alterations of gene
dosage through loss-of-function mutations, such as genomic deletions, or gain of function mutations, such as
genomic duplications, result in approximately 50% change in protein content. This often has devastating
consequences for brain development and function. In one example, dominant, loss-of-function mutations in the
post-synaptic scaffolding protein encoded by the SHANK3 gene causes a severe neurodevelopmental
disorder, Phelan-McDermid syndrome. Individuals with Phelan-McDermid syndrome have moderate to severe
intellectual disability with developmental delays often noted in the first two years of life. There are currently no
targeted therapies for this disorder.
This proposal aims to investigate SHANK3’s post-translational regulation to add fundamental knowledge of
synaptic development and physiology and develop treatment avenues for individuals with SHANK3 mutations.
In this proposal, a combination of biochemistry, behavior and neurophysiology will be utilized to address the
following: 1. Determine if in vivo inhibition of ERK2 rescues molecular and behavioral abnormalities due to
SHANK3 haploinsufficiency. 2. Determine the impact of Casein Kinase inhibition on SHANK3 stability and
function and 3. Identify the proteasomal elements which regulate SHANK3 stability.
The impact of this work will be to understand the dynamic regulation of SHANK3 through post-translational
mechanisms, develop pre-clinical insight into therapeutic treatment avenues for Phelan-McDermid syndrome
and develop a molecular approach for identifying personalized therapies for neurodevelopmental disorders due
to mutations in dosage sensitive genes."
10755334,"SUMMARY
Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer, results in ~55,000
deaths in the US every year. Despite the recent advancements in LUAD treatment, the disease remains highly
intractable. Thus, a critical unmet clinical need exists for novel and effective therapeutic strategies for LUAD
patients. Cancer cell plasticity – the capacity to differentiate and adapt to cell-extrinsic pressure – drives tumor
progression and is a major cause of treatment failure in LUAD. Thus, targeting plasticity in LUAD is a promising
therapeutic concept. Realizing the therapeutic potential of targeting cancer cell plasticity requires fundamental
understanding of the cell states that promote plasticity in LUAD as well as the molecular mechanisms that drive
them. Using a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of LUAD and single-cell mRNA sequencing
(scRNA-Seq) to investigate LUAD evolution we identified a high-plasticity cell state (HPCS) that is acquired by
a subset of LUAD cells in early stages of tumor evolution. The HPCS was ubiquitously maintained in mouse and
human LUAD in vivo irrespective of stage and considerable intra- and inter-tumoral genetic and phenotypic
diversity. Further, the HPCS gene expression signature correlated with particularly poor patient outcomes.
Prospectively isolated HPCS cells were endowed with robust capacity for differentiation (plasticity) and
proliferation, and the HPCS was strongly enriched following chemotherapy. Our preliminary work strongly
supports plasticity is concentrated in the HPCS and that it is associated with high growth potential and
chemoresistance. However, the contribution or essentiality of the HPCS for LUAD growth, treatment resistance,
or emergence of new malignant cell states within LUAD tumors is not known. Similarly, little is known of the
transcriptional drivers of LUAD plasticity. We hypothesize that the HPCS is essential for progression of
premalignant neoplasias to LUAD as well as for LUAD growth, cell state transitions, and chemoresistance. To
address this hypothesis, we will interrogate HPCS in LUAD progression and treatment resistance using lineage-
ablation and lineage-tracing using a novel reporter system that we have generated, which we will combine with
scRNA-seq. To address molecular HPCS drivers, we will inactivate or overexpress two candidate transcription
factors in the LUAD GEMM and in human patient-derived xenograft (PDX) LUAD models, followed by gene
expression and chromatin accessibility profiling. Our proposed study will allow us to establish the HPCS, a
previously unknown cell state, as key to eradicating plasticity in LUAD. This would lead to a new treatment
paradigm, motivating targeting of high-plasticity cell states across solid tumors. Furthermore, our work will
contribute a novel platform for the in situ investigation of cell state heterogeneity in cancers in vivo."
10764296,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The vagus nerves are important carriers of appetitive and nutritive information from the viscera to the central
nervous system (CNS). New studies are revealing surprising and striking differences between left and right
vagal-CNS connectivity. In particular, it was recently shown that activation of ascending gut projections through
the right, but not left, vagus nerve may activate classical dopaminergic “reward” circuits in the CNS. These recent
findings raise the intriguing possibility that electrical vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) delivered to the right cervical
nerve, rather than the traditionally-targeted left cervical nerve, could be used to modulate activity within these
reward networks, providing novel strategies for the treatment of movement disorders. However, both left and
right vagal fibers branch extensively in the periphery and carry information from the gut as well as liver, pancreas,
and other organs that may convey potentially rewarding nutritive or metabolic information. Additional research is
thus needed to fully understand the functional and translational relevance of lateralized vagal signaling.
Understanding whether and how lateralized vagal stimulation differentially activates reward networks is crucial
for further clinical development of this therapeutic technology. Left cervical VNS is currently FDA approved for
the treatment of epilepsy and major depressive disorders, and is rapidly emerging as a treatment to promote
weight loss, extinction of drug seeking, and motor rehabilitation after neural injuries. Importantly, the
effectiveness of VNS over this expanded set of therapeutic indications depends on optimal activation of the
dopaminergic pathways known to support reward-related reinforcement of learned behaviors. Thus, targeted
modulation of these pathways could provide additional mechanisms to induce therapeutic neuroplasticity within
the motor system. Delivery of VNS to the right cervical nerve may therefore offer additional benefits compared
to traditional left VNS for the treatment of motor dysfunction arising from, e.g., Parkinson's disease or stroke.
While evidence of strong laterality in vagal-midbrain connectivity is emerging, the extent to which right versus
left VNS evokes differential activation of central reward networks has not been systematically tested. Here, we
propose to comprehensively compare the dose-dependence of right vs. left VNS-driven midbrain activity, and to
test the functional relevance of lateralized VNS-driven dopaminergic signaling for the induction of neuroplasticity
within the motor system. We additionally examine the extent to which VNS-evoked midbrain activity and
behavioral reinforcement are impacted by known modulators of vagal signaling, including prior exposure to food
and food rewards. To elucidate the mechanisms of VNS-mediated reinforcement, we propose to record neural
activity and optogenetically manipulate dopaminergic signaling in the midbrain during VNS-reinforced behavior.
These studies will provide fundamental insights into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying lateralized vagal
signaling, informing the development of novel VNS strategies for therapeutic modulation of the dopamine system."
10892022,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 An evidence-based treatment that simultaneously addresses intensive care unit (ICU) sleep and circadian
disruption (SCD) is desperately needed. Such treatment is needed because patients admitted to the ICU are at
high risk for adverse outcomes resulting directly from acute SCD. It is well established among healthy controls
that acute SCD is associated with immediate negative consequences such as metabolic, cognitive,
cardiovascular, respiratory, skeletal muscle, and immune dysfunction. Normalization of sleep and circadian
processes improves these dysfunctions. In the ICU, sleep and circadian processes cannot be segregated, and
there are likely several overlapping domains of SCD (e.g., sleep duration, timing, architecture, and continuity,
and circadian alignment and amplitude). Thus, a bundled approach to sleep and circadian promotion holds the
most promise for reversing SCD, normalizing broader physiologic disruptions, and improving ICU outcomes.
 To date, ICU sleep promotion bundles have had limited success in documenting improved sleep, and sleep
bundles have commonly ignored circadian disruption and circadian-based sleep promotion strategies. This is a
critical gap. Translation of circadian principles to ICU sleep promotion is essential because alignment between
biologic and clock time allows for subsequent strategic scheduling of behaviors, for example, scheduling sleep
promotion during the biologic night to improve sleep duration and quality. In addition, circadian alignment has
broader physiologic implications and related potential to improve function across a wide variety of organ
systems, for example, scheduling eating during the biologic day to improve glucose tolerance. Investigations to
date have not tested the effect of a multifaceted intervention that includes promotion of both circadian
alignment via photic and nonphotic zeitgebers and overnight sleep via non-pharmacologic strategies (sleep
chronobundle). The overall objective of this project is to test whether a sleep chronobundle, including daytime
bright light, time-restricted daytime feeding, increased daytime mobility, and overnight sleep promotion
mitigates ICU SCD. A mechanistic randomized controlled trial will be used to test our central hypotheses that a
sleep chronobundle will (1) align biologic and clock day-night; (2) overlap behaviors (e.g., sleeping and eating)
correctly with biologic time periods; and therefore (3) improve sleep and metabolic processes in the ICU. We
are focusing on sleep and glucose metabolism metrics because of their high relevance to critical illness.
 Project aims include (1) Establishing the effect of the sleep chronobundle on circadian alignment via
sampling of urine 6-sulfatoxymelatonin; (2) Determining the impact of the sleep chronobundle on overnight
sleep using portable polysomnography; and (3) Defining the impact of the sleep chronobundle on glucose

SCD and form the basis of studies that can test the impact of the sleep chronobundle on ICU outcomes."
10824328,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Wnt signaling and mechanical loading are key regulators of skeletal health. Wnt signaling
initiates when a Wnt ligand binds to frizzled (FZD) and LRP5/6 co-receptors. Several Wnt
pathway factors (Lrp5, Sost) have known roles in bone’s anabolic response to loading. In the
past funding period, we focused on the Wnt ligands (‘Wnts’), which have been relatively
understudied. We discovered that Wnt ligand secretion by Osx+ bone cells
(osteoblasts/osteocytes) is essential for the anabolic response to skeletal loading, and that
Wnt1 upregulation in particular is required. But with aging, loading induces less Wnt1
upregulation and less bone formation. We now shift focus to intervention, and to test the overall
hypothesis that molecules that mimic Wnts can rescue the loss of bone mass and
mechanoresponsiveness that are hallmarks of aging. The ability to test this hypothesis is
enabled by the recent development of Wnt surrogates – antibody-based molecules that function
like Wnt ligands by directly binding FZD and LRP5/6. In contrast to sclerostin antibody-based
treatments that work by “inhibiting the inhibitor”, Wnt surrogates directly activate Wnt signaling.
Our pilot data show that a novel tetravalent molecule that targets several FZD receptors and
LRP5 potently increases bone formation, bone mass and strength in young-adult mice. We
propose to test whether this LRP5-binding Wnt surrogate is effective in increasing bone mass in
two mouse models of osteoporosis – aging and Wnt1 conditional deletion (which models the
early-onset osteoporosis that afflicts people with WNT1 mutations). We also will evaluate the
possible synergy between Wnt surrogate treatment and mechanical loading, and test whether
the surrogate rescues the impaired response to loading seen in aged mice and in Wnt1 mutant
mice. Next, because LRP5 and LRP6 are each required for skeletal health, we will take
advantage of the modularity of the Wnt surrogate platform to compare cell and bone responses
to LRP5-binding and LRP6-binding surrogates. Finally, we will test whether the LRP6-binding
surrogate can rescue osteoporosis in mice with conditional deletion of Lrp5, which models
human osteoporosis-pseudoglioma (OPPG) syndrome. Development of Wnt surrogates
addresses a need for new, targeted anabolic therapies that can be used for a personalized
approach to the treatment of osteoporosis."
10762982,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
RNA therapeutics and their corresponding nanomedicines are poised to rapidly change the landscape of
healthcare. To address needs in various diseases, RNA-based technologies must function in vivo with
biological interactions at various levels from whole body (systemic biodistribution and immunological) to
tissues and organs, to intracellular trafficking and endosomal release. Unfortunately in oncology, efficient
systemic delivery of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to solid tumors has been plagued by poor tissue
accumulation largely due to a gap in the knowledge of fundamental interactions between these materials
and biological systems. Here we propose to investigate the structure-activity-relationship (SAR) of
nanoparticle carriers through use of a chemically and topologically diverse library of lipopolymers fine-
tuning the biointerface of RNA-LNP. Utilizing a combined barcoding and serial in-depth mechanistic
assays, we will test our central hypothesis that a defined series of first-principles relationships govern the
biophysical interactions of LNPs in vivo. Using cancer models, we will correlate the spatial and temporal
accumulation of mRNA at target tissues and cells with biophysicochemical properties of the LNP
biointerface. The goal of this project is to establish a framework of physiochemical properties to guide the
development of RNA-LNP based cancer nanomedicines. We will achieve this goal by the pursuing the
following aims: Aim 1 - Structural and topological fine-tuning of LNPs biointerface. Aim 2 - Elucidate the
biological interactions of LNPs with respect to whole-body, tissue-level, and intracellular distributions. Aim
3 - Investigate the biological interaction and efficacy of LNPs in the context of multimodal breast cancer
therapy. The immediate outcomes of this research will be applied toward advancing the use of
nanotechnology in oncology. Our project will yield a critical and detailed understanding of the role the LNP
biointerface and its effects on the fate of LNPs in complex biological systems as well as their efficacy. This
invaluable knowledge would greatly aid in future developments in nanomedicine as a whole."
10754939,"Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) remain at high risk for the development of significant co-morbidities,
specifically those associated with autonomic dysfunction, peripheral artery disease (PAD), and cardiovascular
complications with a 2 to 10-fold higher mortality rate. PAD may manifest as stress induced leg pain
(claudication) due to vascular insufficiency or critical limb ischemia (CLI) as the most severe manifestation of
lower extremity PAD characterized by lower limb ischemic rest pain and/or the presence of tissue loss. The
sympathetic nervous system plays a critical role in the normal autoregulation of the vasculature, and loss of
vasomotor control is responsible for postural hypotension but also for the remarkable increase of peripheral
blood flow and arteriovenous shunting in the neuropathic diabetic foot. Therefore, sympathetic denervation
increases blood flow, as it results in vasodilation and non-nutritive, arterio-venous shunting. Sympathetic
denervation may cause structural damage to peripheral arteries resulting in degeneration of arterial medial
smooth muscle with subsequent medial artery calcification (MAC) a feature of diabetic neuropathy. Positron
emission tomography (PET) imaging with 82Rb provides high-sensitivity and high-resolution images for
quantification of absolute flow, while a 18F-labeled norepinephrine analog (18F-LMI1195) provides information
about sympathetic activity. This project will optimize and apply dual isotope (82Rb/18F-LMI1195) hybrid PET/CT
imaging for evaluation of lower extremity flow and denervation and vascular calcification in pre-clinical models
of PAD and in patients with DM and PAD. We propose a clinical imaging sub-studies of two active multi-center
observational registry called SCOPE-CLI and PORTRAIT, which were designed to phenotype patients with CLI
and claudication, respectively. These registries collect observational data on treatment patterns, and other
outcomes that are relevant to patients with DM and PAD. In Aim 1, our hybrid PET/CT imaging approach will
be optimized using a porcine model of hindlimb ischemia in the presence and absence of an acute peripheral
nerve block. These studies will establish methods for evaluation of skeletal muscle rest and stress flow and
flow heterogeneity. Aim 2 will apply dual isotope PET/CT imaging for quantification of acute and chronic
changes in regional flow and flow reserve before and after regional denervation of the lower extremities in
relation to development of MAC in a chronic rabbit model of peripheral denervation. In Aim 3 we will translate
this approach to patients with DM and a spectrum of PAD disease severity to evaluate the prognostic value of
hybrid PET/CT imaging of lower extremity for predicting progression of MAC, rates of amputation, and major
adverse cardiovascular events. The proposed multi-isotope PET/CT imaging of lower extremity flow and
innervation developed and applied in this project in conjunction with imaging of vascular calcifications will
characterize the pathophysiology of autonomic dysfunction in critical limb ischemia and this information may
lead to a paradigm change in the evaluation and long-term management of patients with DM and PAD."
10900454,"Heart failure (HF) disproportionately affects older adults, who carry a high burden of cardiovascular risk
factors and experience accelerated decline in cardiac function. Subsets of older adults do not experience
progressive cardiac dysfunction, but the factors related to late-life cardiac resilience are not well defined. This
is a critical barrier – and missed opportunity – to identify novel interventions and treatment targets to prevent
HF. The objective in this application is to define the lifestyle factors, social drivers, and molecular pathways
underlying cardiac resilience in very late life. The central hypothesis is that in addition to optimal risk factor
control, salutary health behaviors (exercise, diet) and favorable structural factors (less social adversity) protect
from age-related cellular senescence (assessable via plasma proteomics) and promote trajectories of preserved
cardiac function in late life. Leveraging rich longitudinal phenotypic data – including echocardiography – of
participants in the community-based Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, sequential
echocardiography will be performed in ~2,175 participants attending the 12th study visit (age ~86±4), in
addition to functional assessments and measurement of plasma proteomics. The resulting three serial
echocardiograms over 12 years will be used to identify trajectories of change in cardiac function and to address
the following aims: (1) Define late-life behaviors and factors associated with cardiac resilience; (2) Identify
proteins and protein networks underlying cardiac resilience with particular attention to circulating markers of
cellular senescence; and (3) Determine the association of cardiac resilience with preservation of physical and
neurocognitive function and freedom from frailty. The contribution of the proposed research will be to define
the impact of modifiable individual behaviors and structural factors on trajectories of cardiac function in very
late life, establish the role of a novel and targetable biologic pathway, and quantify the relation of these
trajectories to functional and neurocognitive outcomes highly relevant to older adults. This contribution will be
significant in enabling the identification of persons at high risk of progressive LV dysfunction in very late life
when traditional risk factors perform poorly, and in determining the importance of a promising and targetable
biologic pathway to preserve cardiac function – essential steps to decrease HF-associated morbidity and
mortality. This research proposal is fundamentally innovative in: (1) focusing on longitudinal cardiac imaging
in very late-life (75 to 91 years of age) when data is sparse but CVD burden is high; (2) interrogating a novel
biological pathway (cellular senescence) potentially impacting late-life cardiac, physical, and neurocognitive
function using serial high throughput proteomics integrated with genomic data; and (3) using innovative
analytic approaches to identify trajectories, including Bayesian nonparametric trajectory mixture modeling.
The project outcomes are expected to provide a novel understanding of the shared biologic pathways
underlying preservation of cardiovascular, physical, and neurocognitive function in late life."
10757715,"Project Summary
Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a carcinogen produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus which grow on maize.
Given the high prevalence of stunting and other nutritional disorders in low- and middle-income countries where
maize is highly consumed, the role of aflatoxin exposure is worth investigating. Observational reports have
shown associations between aflatoxin exposure and child growth. However, most have been cross-sectional and
have not assessed seasonal variations in aflatoxin, food preparation, and dynamic changes in growth. In
addition, biological mechanistic data on how aflatoxin may exert impact on growth is missing. We will advance
the science of aflatoxin and child growth by assessing temporal changes in diet, aflatoxin exposure, and
growth faltering in a prospective cohort of children from rural Guatemala, a country that has one of the
highest rates of child stunting and aflatoxin exposure in the world. In addition, we will use bioreactors to
investigate possible biological mechanisms, specifically direct aflatoxin-gut microbiome interactions.
We hypothesize that aflatoxin exposure negatively impacts child growth by inducing inflammation and disrupting
the gut microbiome. In Aim 1, we will prospectively evaluate aflatoxin exposure and height-for-age difference
trajectories among 185 children between 6-9 and 24-27 months of age. We will assess aflatoxin exposure using
serum AFB1-albumin adduct levels, and we will measure biomarkers of systemic and gut inflammation. In Aim
2, we will evaluate the association between aflatoxin exposure, stunting status, and gut microbiome composition
and function. We will evaluate the fecal microbiome of each child using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and whole
genome sequencing to identify key species and metabolic pathways for differing AFB1 exposure levels and
stunting status. In parallel, we will use bioreactors inoculated with fecal samples to evaluate the response of the
gut microbiome composition to varying levels of AFB1 exposure. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the impact of aflatoxin
exposure on microbial nutrient metabolism and the impact of gut microbiota on aflatoxin
detoxification/metabolism by monitoring key nutrient metabolites (e.g., short-chain fatty acids) and AFB1
biotransformation products in bioreactors. We will also evaluate the effect of inflammation, aflatoxin, and
microbiome composition on child stunting based on the results from the three aims using path analysis.
Significance and Innovation: Through a multidisciplinary approach that leverages access to an exposed
population and expertise on epidemiology, toxicology, environmental engineering and human microbiome, we
will be able to evaluate the impact of aflatoxin exposure on growth and its possible mediation by the gut
microbiome.
Impact: Completion of this R01 proposal will advance understanding of the physiologic mechanism of aflatoxin-
mediated growth restriction, pointing the way toward new public health strategies for mitigation of aflatoxin
exposure and for microbiome-directed treatments."
10765680,"Aneuploidy is a ubiquitous but poorly-understood feature of tumor genomes. For instance, approximately 25%
of human cancers harbor extra copies of the “q” arm of chromosome 1, making this amplification more common
across cancer types than mutations in KRAS, PIK3CA, RB1, and many other widely-studied cancer driver genes.
Despite the prevalence of 1q aneuploidy in cancer, we have little insight into its role in tumorigenesis. While
evolutionary studies have defined consistent patterns in which single nucleotide substitutions occur in oncogenes
and tumor suppressors during cancer development, the relative timing of most copy number alterations remains
unknown. Additionally, while multiple approaches have been developed to experimentally manipulate single
genes in cancer, our ability to alter and study chromosome-scale dosage changes is extremely limited. Thus, we
lack genetic strategies that would allow us to develop a mechanistic understanding of how aneuploidies like
Chr1q gains influence cancer biology.
We hypothesize that certain commonly observed aneuploidies like Chr1q-amplifications may function as cancer
“addictions”, in the same way that some cancers can be addicted to oncogenes like KRAS and PIK3CA.
Eliminating these aneuploidy “addictions” could therefore block cancer growth and suppress various malignant
phenotypes. To investigate this hypothesis, and to uncover the role of 1q-gains in cancer biology more broadly,
we have developed novel computational and functional approaches to study cancer aneuploidy. In preliminary
work, we discovered that Chr1q gains are commonly the first arm-scale copy number change that occurs during
tumor development, and we found that genetically eliminating Chr1q aneuploidy prevents malignant growth in
human cancers. To build on these findings, in Aim 1, we will optimize and apply a strategy to reconstruct the
evolutionary timing of somatic copy number alterations from multi-sample sequencing studies of human tumors.
In Aim 2, we will apply a novel chromosome-engineering approach to eliminate Chr1q aneuploidy from human
cancers, and then we will characterize how aneuploidy-loss affects various malignant phenotypes. In Aim 3, we
will identify the dosage-sensitive driver genes encoded on Chr1q that contribute to this “aneuploidy addiction”
phenotype. In total, these aims will shed light on the functional consequences of an enigmatic genomic alteration
found in many cancers. As 1q gains commonly arise during malignant growth but are extremely rare in normal
tissue, a greater understanding of this aneuploidy could point toward treatment strategies that are effective
against a wide range of tumors but that have little effect on normal diploid tissue."
10772029,"Project Summary
The major goal of the proposed research is to develop tools to enable the study of dissolved gases on
biological samples. Both blood gases (O2, and CO2) as well as trace signaling gases (NO, CO and H2S) play
critical roles in regulation of wide array of tissue functions as diverse as regulation of heart rate, blood flow,
immune responses, hormone and neurotransmitter secretion, as well as cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory
properties. Indeed, most if not all tissues produce and are regulated by NO, CO and H2S on top of the central
role of O2 in regulating bioenergetics and metabolic pathways. Research by academic institutions as well as
pharmaceutical companies are endeavoring to harness the beneficial effects of gas signals in order to treat a
range of conditions including diabetes, transplant rejection, sepsis, atherosclerosis and cancer. Despite the
scientific and clinical importance of dissolved gases, quantitative methods to measure real time effects of
dissolved gases on tissue/cells are not available. Investigators who have studied the beneficial signaling
initiated by trace gases and/or who are developing drugs to trigger the same benefits almost exclusively use
water soluble surrogates/donors of each signaling gas. A critical point for this proposal is that such chemical
donors of gases may not allow for accurate control of gas levels within tissue, and due to their low aqueous
solubility, rapidly deplete from culture media. Preliminary data we have generated and published revealed
opposite effects of dissolved H2S vs. that obtained with an aqueous provider of H2S, indicating a need to re-
evaluation the effects of what is established regarding NO, H2S and CO from studies using donor molecules.
As most life science researchers do not have the ability to study the direct effects of trace gases at
physiologically relevant concentrations, we will develop a turnkey, automated instrumentation to control
the concentration and exposure time of tissue to media containing user-specified levels of 6 gases
including NO, CO, H2S, O2, CO2 and N2. This automated and user-friendly system will be constructed to
supply gas mixtures to a variety of widely used tissue assessment modalities including fluidics systems, static
culture in plates, and cuvette systems for studying gas binding interactions to purified proteins. We have
assembled a team consisting of Bio- and Mechanical/Combustion Engineers with many years of experience
designing and constructing gas fluidics system applied to biological analysis, as well as an Applied
Mathematician, an Analytical Chemists and Cellular Physiologists who will be involved with the validation of the
instrumentation. This technology will have broad impact on fundamental research by facilitating the study of
kinetic and concentration-dependent effects of signaling gases on tissue function, signaling and bioenergetics,
and evaluation of therapeutics being developed to mimic the cytoprotective properties of the gases."
10772095,"SUMMARY
A mass casualty radiation event, such as the detonation of an improvised nuclear device or radiological dispersal
device, could lead to severe hemorrhage, multi-organ failure, and infection, potentially leading to sepsis and/or
death. The hematopoietic system and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract are among the most vulnerable tissues to
radiation injury. High-dose radiation results in GI syndrome characterized by microbiome dysbiosis, destruction
of mucosal layer, intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction, and aberrant inflammatory responses that initiate a
vicious cycle of further GI tract damage that can lead to rapid death. Although progress has been made to
counteract the immediate effects of hematopoietic acute radiation syndrome, no FDA-approved
countermeasures exist that can treat radiation-induced GI injury. To meet this critical need, Synedgen Inc., has
developed a glycopolymer radiomitigator (MIIST305) that is specifically targeted to the GI tract that could
potentially ameliorate the deleterious effects of radiation. The therapeutic drug has been shown to reduce cell
death, suppress local and systemic inflammation, and improve tissue regeneration in models associated with
inflammatory bowel disease. Our preliminary studies have shown that MIIST305 confers significant survival to
mice exposed to high-dose partial body x-irradiation, when administered 24 hours post-irradiation. Furthermore,
MIIST305 appears to promote pro-inflammatory resolution and maintain more normal gut microbiota composition
in response to GI injury. We hypothesize that MIIST305 maintains the integrity of the mucosal layer thus
preserving a healthy microbiome in response to irradiation, minimizing disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier
function and alleviating inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will
perform longitudinal structural and functional studies to determine the impact of acute dose, partial body
irradiation with 5% bone marrow sparing on GI architectural integrity, commensal gut microbiota composition
and diversity, and inflammation compared to MIIST305-mitigated animals. In Aim 2, we will define the importance
of MIIST305-regulated commensal microbiota composition and elucidate the molecular pathways leading to
MIIST305 suppression of the pro-inflammatory response and ultimately, mitigation of radiation-induced toxicity,
using both transgenic mouse models and cell-based assays. To address the overarching goals of this funding
announcement, we propose to (a) explore how the microbiome affects severity of radiation injury, (b) develop
novel countermeasures against radiation-induced GI damage with efficacy starting 24 hours after radiation
exposure, and (c) define the mechanism of action of the countermeasures, which will provide the necessary
information for FDA approval under the Animal Rule."
10791795,"Abstract
Lupus nephritis (LN) is diagnosed by kidney biopsy in patients with proteinuria > 0.5g/24h, but the
presence of proteinuria means that kidney damage has already occurred. It is estimated that 30% of
nephrons are permanently lost with each flare of LN. The identification of LN before kidney damage
using urine proteomic biomarkers could shift the management strategy of LN to prevention,
potentially leading to earlier, more effective, and less toxic treatment. Three specific aims will be
addressed in this R01 building on the work of the Hopkins Lupus Cohort (a 35 year, 2855 SLE
longitudinal cohort in which patients are followed by protocol every 3 months) and in particular on the
urine biomarker discoveries from the NIH RA/SLE Accelerated Medicines Partnership (AMP).
Aim 1 - Develop a urine biomarker panel to identify new lupus nephritis BEFORE proteinuria.
Previous AMP urine proteomic studies revealed that urinary IL-16, CD163, and neutrophil granule
content indicate intrarenal LN activity. These biomarkers will be quantitated in urine samples collected
within 3 months before the onset of proteinuria in lupus patients who ultimately were diagnosed with
LN by renal biopsy to determine if the biomarkers are elevated compared to patients who do not
develop LN. A full urine proteomic profile will also be assessed to discover additional biomarkers that
could contribute to a robust panel for predicting onset of LN before proteinuria.
Aim 2 - Develop a urine biomarker panel to guide tapering of immunosuppression in treated
LN patients. Patients with a histological NIH activity index >2 on repeat biopsy developed a
proteinuria flare and increased mortality upon tapering of immunosuppression in one study. Four
urinary biomarkers associated with NIH activity index >2 in AMP (IL-16, CD163, Galectin-1, and
PRTN3) will be quantitated ( with analysis of 1200 additional urine proteins) in urine samples from 12
LN patients in apparent clinical remission who flared upon tapering immunosuppression versus 12 LN
patients who did not flare upon tapering. The most predictive biomarkers will be combined into a 10-
plex panel to be validated in a prospective cohort of 60 patients tapering immunosuppression.
Aim 3 - Develop a biomarker for detection of early chronic kidney disease (CKD) in LN. Urine
proteomic studies on 187 patients enrolled in AMP identified TGF-β-mediated fibrosis and TNF
signaling related proteins that may be superior to proteinuria alone in detecting early CKD. These
AMP patients will be followed clinically for at least five years to determine the trajectory of their kidney
disease and to find differences in urine proteomic (and other omic) profiles between those who
maintain stable renal function versus those who do not."
10758263,"Oral anticancer agents (OAAs) are increasingly being prescribed and now account for over half of the new
cancer treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Older adults have the highest incidence of
most solid tumor cancers and are often prescribed OAAs. Despite the speculated convenience of OAAs,
patients and their caregivers have steep literacy needs specific to information regarding this complex treatment
and are often met with numerous challenges. They must demonstrate self-efficacy in the management of
complex OAA regimens, adherence, symptom/side effect management, monitoring and reporting of drug
toxicities, potential drug-drug or food-drug interactions, and polypharmacy in the home environment.
Both patients and caregivers report that OAA information is inadequate, potentially affecting safe treatment
administration and management. Today, oncology care is shifting from oncology clinics to home environments,
resulting in implications for how care is delivered and communicated to patients, given the decreased
frequency of face-to face contact with oncology providers. Older adults have reported worse communication
with oncology providers related to chemotherapy treatment compared with their younger counterparts, leaving
older adults vulnerable to worse outcomes. Web-based programs offer a potential solution to increase
communication and generate new ways to support self-management of cancer care.
The specific aims of this mixed methods study are to: 1a) Explore concordance of the timing, frequency, and
continuity of information sharing and communication regarding OAA treatment between patients, caregivers,
and oncology health care providers 1b) Identify patient and caregiver OOA knowledge gaps; 2) Evaluate
patient-reported outcomes associated with the self-management of OOA treatment including health literacy,
satisfaction with OAA information, symptoms, self-efficacy for managing medication, social support for taking
medications, medications taken for other comorbid conditions, palliative care referral,and technology
ownership/use via quantitative questionnaires; ad 3) Assess web-based program design features that will
assist in the development of a future intervention tool to manage OAA treatment and to evaluate customized
considerations needed for older adult oncology patients using technology.
Findings will inform future research with aims geared towards; 1) development of a supportive web-based
program for older adults receiving OAAs and their caregivers that is theoretically driven and rooted in
behavioral change and technology use in older adults and 2) evaluating the web-based program for
acceptability, usability, feasibility, and user engagement. The long-term goal is to inform a larger RCT to test
the efficacy of the web-based program to improve OAA-specific outcomes of older adult patients."
10830490,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anxiety is a common symptom across psychiatric disorders and is associated with worse quality of life and
impairment. However, the existing treatments for anxiety remain limited despite its widespread prevalence. My
career goal is to become an academic psychiatrist and neuroscientist focused on the neural circuits underlying
various dimensions of anxiety in the human brain with the aim of developing targeted novel therapeutics.
Previous studies suggest that the anterior insular cortex is a critical node within a larger corticolimbic `anxiety
network,' which mediates various dimensions of anxiety. It is one of the most heavily implicated regions across
all anxiety disorders and frequently observed in anxiety-related task studies. Despite the large body of
evidence implicating the insular cortex across serious mental illness, the underlying role of insular circuits in
anxiety remains unclear. Intracranial electrophysiological mapping with high density recordings offers a unique
and promising method to study insular networks with high spatiotemporal resolution. To date, there are no
studies that have investigated insular neurophysiology in the context of anxiety-related symptoms using iEEG.
In our pilot studies, we found preliminary evidence that insular activity in distinct spectral bands correlates with
dimensions of anxiety. We also found evidence that stimulation of the anterior insula can elicit an increase in
self-reported anxiety associated with propagation of activity to downstream corticolimbic structures. This
proposal builds upon these preliminary findings to validate our model that distinct spatiotemporally overlapping
insular circuits mediate specific anxiety-related processes through coordinate oscillatory activity. Aim 1 utilizes
a task-based approach to identify insular representations of anxiety-related symptoms and behaviors using
intracranial recordings. Aim 2 tests the role of insular activity on anxiety-related symptoms and downstream
corticolimbic networks using direct electrical stimulation. To address these research goals, I will need
additional training in advance signal processing, affective neuroscience, and biostatistics. My rigorous training
plan and expert mentoring team will provide me with the experience necessary to become a fully independent
investigator able to bring advanced systems neuroscience approaches to basic mental health research."
10770998,"The family of flavivirus consists of over 90 vector-borne, single-stranded RNA-containing viruses, including Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV), which cause major epidemics among humans and pose a serious threat to global public health. No vaccines or antivirals exist to prevent or treat infections caused by DENV, ZIKV, and some other flaviviruses. To establish infection, flaviviruses need to overcome the antiviral state induced by type 1 interferon (IFN-1), the first line of host defense. In this regard, flaviviruses have encoded several antagonists to suppress IFN responses. For example, the nonstructural NS5 proteins of DENV, ZIKV, and some other flaviviruses have been shown to be potent suppressor of IFN signaling, targeting different steps of the IFN signaling pathway. Like DENV, ZIKV NS5 protein bind human signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (hSTAT2) protein and trigger its proteasomal degradation, albeit using different downstream mechanisms. To elucidate the mechanistic basis of flavivirus NS5-mediated hSTAT2 suppression, we propose to provide structural insight into the ZIKV NS5-hSTAT2 and DENV NS5-hSTAT2 complexes, which, in turn, will guide interrogation of the consequence(s) of the flavivirus NS5-hSTAT2 interactions in proteasome-mediated degradation of hSTAT2 and suppression of IFN signaling. Toward this goal, we will use structural, biochemical, molecular, cellular and virology approaches to investigate the structural basis of the ZIKV NS5-hSTAT2 and DENV NS5-hSTAT2 interactions and their functional consequence. In Aim 1, we will establish the structural basis of the ZIKV-hSTAT2 interaction by using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy and validate our observations with mutational and in vitro pull-down analyses. In Aim 2, we will examine the ZIKV NS5-hSTAT2 interaction at a cellular level and investigate the functional consequence of the ZIKV NS5-hSTAT2 interaction through evaluation of the mutational effects of ZIKV NS5 on hSTAT2 degradation, IFN response and viral infection. The results of these studies will provide critical structural and functional insights into the virus- and species-specific ZIKV NS5-hSTAT2 interaction, thereby establishing a mechanistic link between flavivirus NS5 proteins, hSTAT2 degradation, suppression of the IFN response and viral infection. Results from the proposed studies will ultimately benefit development of novel antivirals and live vaccines against flaviviruses infection."
10850649,"Summary
A majority of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) develop benign kidney tumors known as renal
angiomyolipoma (AML) that can cause renal insufficiency and spontaneous life-threatening hemorrhages. The
main therapy for AML is everolimus, a rapamycin analog inhibitor of the kinase mTOR with cytostatic activity that
only partially reduces tumor size. AMLs become stable over time, and tumor re-growth is often occurs after
treatment is interrupted due to side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to elucidate mechanisms of
tumor resistance for the development of more efficacious therapies.
 Efforts to recapitulate AML experimentally have failed for the past 20+ years, precluding the study of AML
biology. To address this problem, we have used genetically engineered patient-derived induced pluripotent stem
cells (iPSCs) to generate AML organoids. Organoids generated from iPSCs carrying biallelic inactivating
mutations in the TSC2 locus (i.e. TSC2-/-) faithfully recapitulated key anatomical and molecular features of human
kidney AML (reported in Hernandez JOR et al. Nat Commun. 2021 Nov 11;12(1):6496). Some of those features
included the presence of myomelanocytic AML-like cells co-expressing smooth muscle and melanocyte markers,
and the transcriptional activation of signaling pathways shared with kidney AML. Transplantation of TSC2-/- AML
organoids into the kidneys of immunodeficient rodents resulted in fully vascularized human AML xenografts for
mechanistic studies and for drug testing testing in vivo. Using these novel tools we identified potential
mechanisms of tumor resistance driven by p21CIP1 and by BCL-2 apoptosis modulators, preventing AML cell
death induced by rapalogs. Our in vivo experiments also indicated that drug delivery via nanocarriers may
increase the efficacy of anti-tumor therapy while reducing undesired effects in other tissues. The objective of this
proposal is to elucidate anti-apoptotic mechanisms driven by p21CIP1 and BCL-2 proteins for the development of
novel anti-tumor therapies combining BCL-2 protein inhibitor drugs and rapalogs, that can be co-delivered using
tissue-targeting nanoparticles. Our long-term goal is to design new therapies for AML with increased efficacy
and specificity. The central hypothesis is that antiapoptotic mechanisms driven by p21CIP1 and BCL-2
apoptosis inhibitors sustain AML cell survival promoting tumor resistance to rapalog therapy. Our three
aims are: Aim 1: To investigate anti-apoptotic mechanisms of tumor resistance driven by p21CIP1 in renal AML;
Aim 2: To elucidate the role of IGFBP2 in stabilizing p21CIP1 promoting AML cell survival; Aim 3: To study the
contribution of BCL-2 proteins to AML cell survival through pharmacologic blockage of BH3 domain interaction.
Collectively, these studies will provide much needed insight into the mechanisms of AML and will assess the
efficacy of BCL-2 inhibitor therapy alone or in combination with rapalogs in AML-targeting nanoparticles."
10766274,"The heart consumes more ATP than any other organ, the vast majority of which is generated by fatty acid oxidation (FAO) coupled to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in mitochondria. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) regulates numerous aspects of mitochondrial function through activation of alpha-1-adrenergic receptors (α1-ARs) and beta-ARs (β-ARs) in cardiomyocytes, as we recently reviewed. Persistent stimulation of cardiac β-ARs causes pathological structural and metabolic changes resulting in myocardial energy depletion and heart failure (HF), but α1-ARs exert adaptive effects in the failing heart, mitigating the toxicity of chronic β-AR activation. The mechanisms underlying this cardioprotection remain largely unclear. There are three α1-AR subtypes: A, B, and D. Mounting evidence indicates that the α1A subtype protects cardiomyocytes against multiple types of injury. We previously published that a selective α1A agonist increases ATP content in anthracycline-exposed failing mouse hearts. Our preliminary data now show that permeabilized cardiac muscle fibers and isolated mitochondria from knockout mice lacking the αA-AR (α1AKO) exhibit decreased FAO and diminished activity of electron transport chain (ETC) Complex I and II. We also recently found that treatment with a selective α1A agonist enhances Complex I, II and IV activity in uninjured mouse hearts and protects cardiac energetic capacity and contractile function in mice subjected to experimental myocardial infarction. Collectively, these findings suggest a novel mechanism for α1A-mediated cardioprotection, as regulation of neither FAO nor OXPHOS by β1-ARs has been studied previously. We now propose three Specific Aims to build upon our published findings and novel preliminary data to test the central hypothesis that α1A-ARs metabolically support the uninjured heart and protect the failing heart by enhancing mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Aim 1 will determine whether α1A-ARs enhance OXPHOS in the heart through cardiomyocyte-autonomous effects using our cardiomyocyte-specific β1A knockout mice, novel focused studies of α1A skeletal muscle FAO regulation, and a high fat diet model. Aim 2 will find if α1A-ARs preserve energetic capacity through maintenance of long chain FAO and regulation of ETC enzyme activity, coupling in vivo profiling of α1A knockout and α1A agonist treated mouse hearts with mechanistic in vitro approaches. Aim 3 will test whether selective α1A-AR agonists act as mitotropes—drugs that enhance mitochondrial function--to protect against HF using three clinically relevant mouse models: chronic isoproterenol infusion, cardiomyocyte-specific loss of FAO (Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 knockout), and a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy model in which Complex I activity is impaired. If successfully completed, the proposed experiments have the potential to significantly expand our understanding of SNS regulation of cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function, elucidating new mechanisms of α1A-mediated cardioprotection in clinically and physiologically relevant mouse models. These studies also represent the next step in our ongoing efforts to advance α1A-AR agonists as novel HF therapies."

When cancer is suspected in a patient, the tissue in question must be removed and analyzed. This procedure is
called a biopsy and is a crucial step in early detection of cancer. However, the procedure leaves a hole in the
tissue which can continue to bleed, or in the case of lung tissue, leak air. In order to prevent any complications,
we propose a new device to fill these tissue voids that addresses limitations of current technologies. The Biopsy
Tract Sealing Device will be made of a shape memory foam and a gel that expand to fill the void made during
biopsy. The device will seal the hole to prevent any leaks of air or blood, with an added benefit of being visible
under MRI and X-ray imaging. This feature allows the physician to monitor any disease progression at the biopsy
site in follow-up visits.
The proposed work includes extensive pre-clinical testing and design verification that is required to translate this
technology. Namely, we plan to: 1) finalize design of the device, 2) perform studies to confirm the devices are
non-toxic and do not cause any undesirable tissue reaction after implantation, 3) conduct device design
verification tests to ensure performance is successful, and 4) summarize all test results in reports that can later
be used in an application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
This proposal has the potential to improve the safety and utility of a common procedure that can save lives
through early detection of cancer. Approximately 140,000 lung biopsies and 110,000 liver biopsies are performed
in the US each year. With high complication rates (~20-50%) of lung biopsy procedures and risk of severe
bleeding complications with liver biopsies, the healthcare of thousands of patients will be improved by this device
development."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly with currently no cure or effective
disease-modifying therapy. The pathogenesis of AD is unclear; however, a leading hypothesis is that
accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein is one of the earliest
pathological events resulting in neuronal dysfunction, at least in part by dysregulating intracellular Ca2+
homeostasis, and disruption of neural networks culminating in dementia. While cognitive impairment is the major
manifestation of AD, non-cognitive manifestations such as unintentional body weight loss often occurs prior to
the cognitive decline. Furthermore, weight loss in AD correlates with worsening disease progression and
increased mortality, while weight gain is protective. Collectively, this suggests that brain regions such as the
hypothalamus that regulate body weight and systemic metabolism may be selectively vulnerable to Aβ early in
the pathogenesis of AD during the presymptomatic or preclinical stages. However, the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underlying the early systemic metabolic dysfunction in AD have remain largely unexplored.
Therefore, the goal of this application is to test the hypothesis that hypothalamic networks regulating systemic
metabolism are selectively vulnerable to Aβ pathology and contribute to the early pathogenesis of AD. We will
use a “bench-to-bedside” strategy using state-of-the-art molecular, neurophysiological, imaging, and genomic
approaches in genetic mouse models, and verify key findings in clinically relevant human studies. We will test
the following working hypotheses: (a) disruption of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis by Aβ is an early pathological
event leading to dysfunction of leptin-responsive hypothalamic NPY/AgRP neurons; (b) Aβ causes disruption of
hypothalamic networks regulating systemic metabolism; and (c) central leptin signaling dysfunction is an early
manifestation of human subjects with Alzheimer’s disease. The findings from this project will shed light on the
mechanisms underlying early selective vulnerability in the hypothalamic network regulating systemic metabolism
and identify the cell types affected, thereby filling a knowledge gap in our understanding of one of the earliest
clinical manifestations of AD."

Our proposed research seeks to understand the evolutionary origin and capacity to adapt of complex
molecular machines. It is challenging to comprehend how protein function, which depends on finely tuned
cooperativity between many components, is adapted and altered as an organism evolves. That is, how does
evolution satisfy the demands of high performance while maintaining the capacity for diversification and
adaptive specialization? To gain insight into these processes we plan to carry out high-throughput mutagenesis
and functional studies of a set of proteins involved in DNA replication.
High-speed DNA replication relies on proteins known as sliding clamps, which are proteins that encircle DNA
and can diffuse rapidly along the double-helix without dissociating from it. Because the sliding clamps form
closed circles, they do not readily associate with DNA on their own. Sliding clamps are opened and loaded
onto the start sites of DNA replication by ATP-driven molecular machines called clamp loaders. Clamp loaders
are members of an evolutionarily ancient family of ATP-dependent molecular machines called AAA+ ATPases,
which are a diverse set of proteins that transduce ATP binding and hydrolysis into mechanical action on
proteins. Because the DNA polymerase clamp-loaders are very well understood in terms of their three-
dimensional structures, they are excellent models for understanding intramolecular force transmission as well
as, more generally, the evolution of complex protein machines. The central goal of this proposal is to develop
an understanding of the mechanisms and evolutionary divergence of such complex protein machines, leading
to advances in our ability to predict and control the behaviors of cellular systems in both normal and disease
states.
The T4 bacteriophage (T4) is a small virus that infects the E. coli bacterium. The T4 genome encodes its own
DNA replication proteins, including a sliding clamp and clamp loader, proteins that are closely related to their
counterparts in eukaryotic cells, including human cells. We have developed and validated a powerful high-
throughput functional assay for the T4 bacteriophage (T4) clamp loader system. This platform opens up many
avenues to investigate mechanism and design principles in a proper biological context. We will use high-
throughput mutagenesis to map mutational sensitivity and allosteric coupling in the clamp loader and examine
the conservation of these properties in a very divergent AAA+ ATPase, a protein that controls transcription in
bacteria. We will use statistical models trained on genome sequences to infer the essential constraints on and
between amino acids in clamp loaders and test these inferences in a biological context. The aims of this
project represent a unified body of work to use new assay systems to understanding clamp loader and AAA+
mechanism, and to test the potential of emerging sequence-based models for understanding and engineering
complex macromolecular machines."
10809767,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genes and variants often act in combination to drive cellular and organismal phenotypes. Mapping these
functional interactions advances our fundamental understanding of biological systems and has broad
applicability to therapeutics development. Gene-gene interactions also likely constitute a considerable
component of the undiscovered genetics underlying human diseases, due to the extensive buffering encoded
in genomes which makes many individual genes appear dispensable. In this regard, we and others have
shown that combinatorial screens, such as those based on CRISPR-Cas systems, are powerful platforms for
mapping synergistic relationships among genes and variants. However, unlike screens based on single-gene
perturbations which are broadly utilized, combinatorial screens have been significantly harder to deploy. Two
fundamental challenges underlying combinatorial CRISPR screens are: 1) the requirement to physically link
multiple perturbagens on the same library element which, in addition to complicating library generation,
prevents different classes of genome and epigenome engineering toolsets from being readily combined; and 2)
analysis of the resulting combinatorial screening data is highly complex, especially in the context of multi-
dimensional phenotypic assays. Furthermore, because the perturbation space scales exponentially with the
number of simultaneous perturbagens, it is critical to be able to computationally infer interactions beyond those
measured experimentally. To address these challenges, we propose to engineer a new screening platform,
CombinX, that auto-tethers individual library elements expressed at the RNA, instead of the DNA, level to
enable massively multiplexed combinatorial screens. Scalability of this platform is thus limited only by cell
culture and sequencing power. We propose to develop the system for both two-way and multi-way (>2
perturbagen) combinatorial screens via application to genetic interaction mapping and cellular reprogramming
respectively. Resulting screening data will be interpreted via new advanced computational methods and
machine learning approaches to systematically determine genetic interactions, as well as to predict interactions
well beyond those that can be covered by direct experimental screens. We anticipate this experimental and
computational platform will have broad applicability in basic science and therapeutics discovery, and that it will
generate widely useful reagents and data."

 Advanced prostate cancer represents a major cause of cancer death in men, usually as a consequence
of treatment failure, which gives rise to aggressive disease variants that are highly metastatic. Among the major
biological processes that are causally dysregulated in advanced prostate cancer are those related to DNA repair.
Notably, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are among the most frequently altered DNA repair genes in advanced prostate
cancer, and are also key targets for its treatment. To study their functions in prostate cancer, we have generated
genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) based on inducible loss-of-function of Brca1 and Brca2 in the
prostate. In preliminary studies, we have found that loss-of-function of Brca2 results in aggressive prostate
tumors with highly penetrant metastases, including to bone, that are coincident with increased DNA damage and
accelerated by androgen deprivation. In parallel, we have developed computational tools to elucidate the
molecular determinants of Brca1 and Brca2 functions in prostate cancer. We have also developed a new
precision oncology platform called OncoLoop, to computationally match individual patients to individual GEMMs,
and to predict and validate drugs that target specific patient-GEMM pairs.
 Leveraging these models and resources, we will systematically investigate the functions of BRCA1 and
BRCA2 in prostate cancer, guided by the hypothesis that defective DNA repair plays an important role in
prostate cancer progression and treatment, particularly in the context of androgen deprivation. In Aim 1, we will
investigate the consequences of loss-of-function of Brca1 and Brca2 in GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoid
models, and patient-derived human organoid models for prostate tumorigenesis, metastasis, and DNA damage
response. These studies will provide fundamental insights into the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in prostate
cancer and elucidate the relationship of DNA repair mechanisms for disease progression. In Aim 2, we will
investigate molecular determinants of DNA repair functions in prostate cancer by identifying and functionally
characterizing master regulators (MRs) that represent mechanistic determinants of Brca1 and Brca2 loss-of-
function in prostate tumors and metastases. MRs will be prioritized based on conservation with human prostate
cancer, and functionally validated in mouse and human organoids. We will complement these studies by
analyses of tumors and metastases using single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) to identify MR signatures
associated with specific cell states. In Aim 3, we will leverage our GEMMs, GEMM-derived organoids and
allografts, and patient-derived organotypic models to pursue co-clinical investigations of DNA repair function in
prostate cancer. In Aim 3A, we will systematically evaluate drugs/drug combinations currently in or advancing
to clinical practice. In Aim 3B, we will use the OncoLoop platform to predict new drugs that target DNA repair in
prostate-specific contexts. Overall, these studies will provide biological and molecular insights to inform on
current trials and to support the development of future ones."
10769798,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The long-term goal of this project is to develop stem-cell-based, autologous therapies for diseases affecting the
lung epithelium. Different potential approaches for the use of stem cells for lung disease treatment include
enhancement of endogenous stem cell differentiation or in vitro differentiation of stem cells to lung lineages
followed by cell transplantation. Both approaches require that the identity and pathways of differentiation of lung
stem or progenitor cells be known and well characterized. The discovery of induced pluripotent stem cells
(iPSCs) has opened new possibilities for regenerative medicine as these cells are easy to derive, are not fraught
with ethical issues and offer the possibility of patient-specific therapies. A major roadblock in the effective
application of the iPSC technology to lung regenerative medicine is the incomplete understanding of the cell fate
decision repertoire that characterizes various progenitor cell types during lung differentiation. This is particularly
relevant to the primordial lung progenitors, the rare cells that appear at the moment of lung specification and
give rise to all lung epithelial cell types. We hypothesize that this hurdle is directly related to paucity of information
on the gene regulatory network (GRN), i.e. the specific combination of transcriptional regulators and their
interactions, that defines the identity of primordial lung progenitors. Understanding and manipulating the GRN of
the primordial lung progenitors is the overall objective of this proposal.
In Aim 1 putative new regulators of primordial lung fate will be studied. We will map their expression during in
vivo lung specification and early lung epithelial differentiation. The function of these genes in lung development,
will be evaluated by their deletion within the anterior foregut endoderm. In Aim 2, similar studies will be
undertaken in vitro using CRISPR interference in a human NKX2-1 reporter line. We will introduce perturbations
of putative regulator expression (either overexpression or knock-down) during in vitro lung specification and
evaluate the competency of the resulting lung progenitors to give rise to distal and proximal lung epithelial cell
types. In Aim 3, the epigenomic landscape of early epithelial lung development will be characterized. We will
combine single-cell RNA-Seq with ATAC-Seq, a technique that reveals chromatin accessibility, to identify the
potential regulatory regions and provide insights in early lung cell-fate decisions. ChIP-Seq will also be used to
reveal the global DNA binding sites of our putative regulators and the Wnt signaling effector, β-catenin. Finally,
in Aim 3 we will use computational methods to construct a proof-of-principle model of the putative GRNs
governing lung primordial identity and the integration of lung specification signals, such as Wnt, with the core
regulatory program. At the conclusion of our studies, we will have defined the lung primordium GRN and gained
insights in the reconfiguration of this GRN during early lung development."
10815871,"Project Summary
How epithelial sheets remodel themselves to adopt new tissue conformations through changes in neighbor
relationships and cell shape dynamics has been a key question in development and disease. Interestingly,
many of the pioneering studies performed in model systems have largely been confined to 2D analysis, and
have often been challenged to image cell behaviors that occur in basal regions that lie deeper into the tissue.
The intercalation movements that occur during tissue elongation in the Drosophila gastrula have been a classic
system for understanding epithelial remodeling, and have been fundamental to informing the developmental
paradigms that describe how cells can change position in an adherent epithelium. Nearly all of the studies in
this system have been confined to 2D analysis of apical events in the early fly embryo, and no studies to date
have systematically analyzed the full 3D behaviors that drive epithelial remodeling and tissue extension in the
Drosophila embryonic epithelium. Thus, one of the biggest remaining questions in the field is how the
volumetric nature of epithelial cells affects force propagation and remodeling of the cell surface along the entire
apical-basal axis. Fundamental questions on where forces originate from as well as how far and fast forces
propagate across different apical-basal layers have remained unanswered. In our preliminary analysis, we
have been successful in completing the first full 4D segmentation of the intercalating Drosophila epithelium
through the use of Lattice Light Sheet Microscopy (LLSM). We find that intercalation can be initiated at any
position we have surveyed along the apical-basal axis. This is striking as previous studies have largely
implicated apical force generation, and a single study has suggested that contractile forces can also originate
from the basal surface of the epithelium. In the proposed project, we are developing the tools to perform the
first comprehensive, quantitative 3D analysis of cell intercalation in the early Drosophila embryo. We will then
determine the molecular mechanisms driving 3D force generation, and whether different mechanical regimes
exist across the apical-basal axis. Preliminary data suggests highly novel dynamic Myosin II and F-actin
populations that show rapid axial propagation in lateral and basal regions. The 3D distributions of these
populations are being mapped and the relevant actin nucleating and Myosin regulatory networks will be
determined. These results will provide the first comprehensive understanding of the cortical and contractile
networks that determine the mechanical environment of a gastrulating epithelium. We will also use 3D data
sets in wild-type and functionally compromised backgrounds to examine how epithelial forces propagate along
apical-basal and planar dimensions using topological mapping metrics. We will determine how far, and at what
velocities, contractile forces spread in an intact, developing epithelium. These results will give fundamental
answers into how the viscous cytoplasm and elastic cell cortex respond to force-driven displacements, and
how these displacements spread within individual cells and across tissues to drive new tissue topologies."
10757015,"Cardiac damage occurs following sepsis, trauma, and ischemia. Acute inflammation triggered by these injuries
impairs mitochondria, a key determinant for the severity of cardiac damage. While sex dimorphism impacts
consequences of these injuries, no information is available regarding sex-specific mitochondrial responses to
acute inflammation. We have observed that TNFa acutely depresses cardiac function and female hearts are
resistant to TNFa-induced cardiac dysfunction. We have also found sex differences in mitochondrial performance
in cardiomyocytes exposed to TNFa or LPS. Thus, we reason that sex-specific mitochondrial responses to
inflammation is the underlying mechanism for sex disparities in cardiac damage. Mitochondrial connexin-43
(Cx43) and caveolin-3 (Cav3, a structural protein essential for caveolae formation) are involved in mitochondrial
protection in the ischemic heart. To date, neither mitochondrial (mito)Cx43 nor mitoCav3 has been studied for
sex-dependent mitochondrial resilience to inflammation. Our recent study has suggested that mitoCx43 and its
smaller isoform, Gja1-20k, play a role in sex-related mitochondrial responses and estrogen-mediated cardiac
protection following acute ischemia/reperfusion. Our preliminary work has further indicated: 1) better cardiac
function is associated with higher levels of mitoCx43 phosphorylation (p-Cx43), mitoGja1-20k and mitoCav3 in
female hearts than in male hearts following TNFa or LPS challenge; 2) female cardiomyocytes have better
mitochondrial performance than male ones upon TNFa or LPS exposure; 3) knockdown of Cx43 or Cav3 impairs
mitochondrial function in myoblasts subjected to TNFa or LPS; 4) 17b-estradiol (E2) treatment improves
mitochondrial function with increased p-Cx43 and mitoGja1-20k; ablation of cardiac Cx43 abolishes E2-elicited
mitochondrial protection in cardiomyocytes exposed to TNFa; and 5) E2 enhances Cx43 and Cav3 binding to
estrogen receptor (ER)a and promotes Cx43-Cav3 interaction in cardiac mitochondria. We hypothesize that
female heart mitochondria are resistant to acute inflammation-induced damage via ER(s) activation-increased
mitochondrial Gja1-20k, p-Cx43 and Cx43-Cav3 interaction in comparison to the male ones. In this proposed
study, we will employ LPS- or cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis models to explore the role of
mitoCx43 and mitoCav3 in regulating sex-specific cardiac mitochondrial protection. We will determine the roles
of Cx43 (Aim 1), Cav3 and their interaction (Aim 2) in maintaining cardiac mitochondrial health and in sex
differences of mitochondrial resilience upon acute inflammation; and assess the therapeutic potential of Gja1-
20k-loaded exosomes in LPS- or CLP-induced septic cardiomyopathy (Aim 3). We expect that novel approach
using engineered exosomes to specifically deliver Gja1-20k to cardiomyocytes will improve mitochondrial
preservation and cardiac function in septic cardiomyopathy. Completion of the proposed study will bring novel
insights about sex-specific differential mitochondrial responses to acute inflammation and offer the basis of
developing novel approaches in treating acute inflammation-caused cardiomyopathy in both sexes."

With the rapidly aging population and improved survival rate, the number of breast cancer survivors in the U.S.
is projected to reach 4.4 million by 2030, among which more than 60% of them will be aged ≥65 years. A key
issue facing older cancer survivors is the impact of cancer and its treatment on their cognition. Cancer and brain
aging have both common and distinct etiologies. For example, shared germline genetic heritability was identified
between breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in large cross-trait genetic analyses, while other studies
showed differential regulation of p53 and Pin1 in cancer and AD. Compelling clinical and observational studies
report deficits in cognitive functioning in women diagnosed and treated for breast cancer over the short-term (<2
years), and consistently support acute toxicity of chemotherapies on cognition (i.e., chemo-brain). In contrast,
population studies, often with long follow-up (>10 years), show lower incidence of AD in cancer survivors
compared with cancer-free controls. While these inverse associations have persisted in studies with attempts to
reduce diagnostic and competing risk biases, the possibility of survival bias, which would increase with time
since cancer diagnosis, cannot be ruled out. Until we can determine how breast cancer and its treatment
(chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapy) affect cognitive trajectory, we will not be able to improve quality
of life and care for breast cancer survivors. However, most previous research is limited by a lack of (a)
consideration of both the short- and long-term effect of breast cancer on cognition (which may reduce survival
bias for breast cancer with a 5-year relative survival rate of 90%); (b) repeated global and domain specific
cognition measures before and after treatment; (c) focus on the role of post-diagnostic lifestyles in the treatment-
cognition relation; (d) investigation of gene-treatment interactions; (e) and identification of shared and distinct
molecular etiologies of cancer and AD. The overarching goal of this proposal is to comprehensively determine
the association of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment with cognitive trajectory over time, and identify the
intersection of cancer hallmark pathways with AD to inform targeted intervention. This proposal leverages the
unique resources from the Nurses’ Health Study with follow-up of 3,120 breast cancer survivors for >30 years,
and repeatedly collected objective cognitive assessments; and the Gene Expression Omnibus with 2,520 human
brain transcriptomics on AD patients and controls, and addresses the following hypothesis: (1) Women
diagnosed and treated with cancer experience more rapid cognitive decline over the short-term, and (2) Cancer
hallmarks of genomic instability, oxidative stress and inflammation are shared mechanisms between cancer and
AD, but the hallmarks of proliferation and cellular pluripotency are differentially regulated. Dr. Peng plans to
receive training in areas of aging research, cancer survivorship, advanced statistical modeling, and professional
skill development. Together, the scientific and training components of this K01 will position Dr. Peng to become
an independent interdisciplinary investigator specialized in the integration of aging and cancer research."

While white adipose tissue is the primary energy storage organ, brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy
through non-shivering thermogenesis. Discovery of the presence of BAT/BAT-like tissues in human adults has
generated a considerable interest in BAT biology to design strategies against obesity and insulin resistance.
Recently, we have identified a new microprotein of 76 aa in length, highly expressed in BAT compared to other
tissues, and is induced upon cold exposure. Microproteins in general function by affecting protein-protein
interaction between signaling molecules. Our microprotein contains consensus docking motifs for Protein
Phosphatase 2B. Our preliminary studies showed that overexpression of this microprotein in differentiated BAT
cells increased oxygen consumption rate (OCR), while knockdown decreased OCR in basal and forskolin
stimulated conditions. Moreover, we detected higher PKA activity without changes in cAMP levels upon
overexpression of this microprotein in BAT cells. To document its physiological function, we have generated
conditional knockout mice and transgenic mice overexpressing the microprotein in UCP1+ cells and in
adipocytes. We propose that, our microprotein interacts with PP2B to regulate classic b-adrenergic
downstream signaling and potentiates PKA activity for promotion of thermogenesis. Aim 1 is to study its effect
on thermogenesis in differentiated brown adipocytes in culture. Aim 2 is to dissect the biochemical basis of its
function in promoting thermogenesis. Finally, Aim 3 is to evaluate its in vivo function in thermogenesis by loss-
and gain-of function studies in mice. This research may allow us to devise small molecule therapeutics to
increase thermogenesis for preventing obesity and improving insulin sensitivity in the future."

 Discovery of the genetic basis of inborn errors of immunity in humans provides impactful information
about genes, proteins, and pathways that are fundamentally important for healthy immune function. Inflammation
is a critical component of immune activation that normally signals the presence of microbes to initiate molecular
and cellular responses required to contain and eliminate a pathogen. However, aberrantly high inflammation is
detrimental to host fitness and contributes to pathology in an array of human diseases. In order to control
inflammation, there are many intracellular and secreted anti-inflammatory proteins that are transcribed in a cell-
type and context-dependent manner. A prime example is IL-10, which when defective in humans causes
monogenic very early-onset IBD. However, there is relatively limited knowledge about transcription factors that
act as master regulators of these inducible anti-inflammatory genes in humans. We have now discovered a new
human inborn error of immunity caused by novel loss-of-function mutations in the ELF4 transcription factor gene
that we hypothesize serves as a master regulator at the intersection of interferon, inflammasome, and Th17
biology. The three patients identified through our genomics program suffer from mucosal autoinflammation with
IBD features, fever, and oral ulcers, and we have now generated powerful Elf4 knockout, point mutant, and
floxed mouse models to advance our knowledge. Our preliminary data in ELF4-mutant human and mouse cells
emphasize cell type-specific functions of this factor, with increased inflammatory responses in myeloid and T
cells associated with failed anti-inflammatory gene expression programs. We will pursue two aims to illuminate
how ELF4 functions as a cornerstone in the cross-regulation of interferon, inflammasome, and Th17 responses.
Aim 1) Dissect molecular and biochemical effects of WT and mutant ELF4 in myeloid and Th17 cells. Aim 2)
Define the roles of WT and mutant ELF4 in cellular and organismal inflammatory responses mediated by myeloid
and Th17 cells. The results of these investigations will provide invaluable new insights with direct relevance for
understanding the etiology and devising targeted therapy in this new human disorder and, by extension, more
broadly in prevalent inflammatory diseases."

Exposure to cockroach allergen can lead to allergic sensitization and an increased risk of allergic asthma.
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are currently not well-established. Our long-term goals are to
elucidate the fundamental underlying mechanisms and identify novel therapeutic targets for allergic asthma.
During the pilot studies, our group has made significant contributions to unraveling an important link between
cockroach antigen and development of allergic asthma. Specifically, our profiling of N-linked glycans from
cockroach allergen identified several major glycans with high affinity to mannose receptor, MRC1/CD206.
Furthermore, we have identified a critical but previously unrecognized role of MRC1 in allergen clearance as a
natural defense mechanism and in limiting the progression and severity of cockroach allergen-induced allergic
inflammation in a mouse model of asthma. This occurs through alterations in macrophage clearance of the
inhaled cockroach allergens and balance of M1/M2 macrophage polarization. This was at first perplexing
because MRC1 lacks any known signaling motif, therefore, the signaling cascades of MRC1 in allergen-induced
airway inflammation and macrophage polarization remain obscure. Our breakthrough for a deeper understanding
of the MRC1 signaling pathway came with the recognition that a key regulatory miR-511-3p, encoded by both
mouse and human MRC1 gene, is transcriptionally co-regulated with MRC1 in macrophages. These exciting
findings lead us to propose a novel hypothesis that MRC1 is largely involved in allergen clearance as a natural
defense mechanism, and MRC1-encoded miR-511-3p is involved in mediating MRC1 downstream immune
responses and protecting against allergen-induced airway inflammation. This hypothesis is further buttressed by
our recent findings that plasma levels of miR-511-3p were much lower in asthmatics compared to controls, and
that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated miR-511-3p over-expression ameliorated the allergen-induced
airway inflammation in Mrc1-/- mice, but miR-511-3p knockout mice showed increased allergen-induced airway
inflammation. These exciting data set the stage to critically evaluate the functional significance of miR-511-3p in
allergic asthma and its underlying mechanisms. Three independent yet related specific aims are proposed. Aim
1 will determine the significance of miR-511-3p in allergic asthma by quantifying miR-511-3 in plasma, sputum
and extracellular vesicles (EVs) from plasma and sputum of allergic asthmatics and testing its role in macrophage
polarization and function. Aim 2 will define whether miR-511-3p protects against asthma using miR-511-3p global
and macrophage conditional knockout mice (e.g., LysM-cre; miR-511-3pflox/flox) and mannose-decorated EV-miR-
511-3p-treated mice. Aim 3 will identify miR-511-3p targets by integrating gene profiling and our unique affinity-
based transcriptomic approach for miR-511-3p binding partner mRNAs/long non-coding RNAs. Collectively, our
studies will provide a conceptual framework linking allergens, MRC1, and miR-511-3p to key features of asthma.
Ultimately, these studies may allow for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for asthma."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed malignancy and the second leading cause of
cancer death worldwide. There is an unmet need for accurate, cost-efficient, and broadly accessible risk-
stratification tools to identify patients at increased risk of recurrence , who are most likely to benefit from
adjuvant therapy. Current standard-of-care risk stratification approaches are inadequate. Every CRC surgical
candidate undergoes pathologic and radiologic evaluation of their tumor; these two modalities represent a rich,
readily accessible and, thus far, underutilized resource for developing new risk-stratification tools. Deep
learning (DL) has demonstrated great potential for augmenting physicians on an increasing range of diagnostic
and prognostic tasks in pathology, radiology, and clinical medicine. We hypothesize that applying integrated
DL-based analysis to multimodal (pathologic, radiologic, and electronic medical record (EMR)) data will yield
greatly improved stratification of CRC patients for adjuvant treatment planning. We propose to build the first
comprehensive, publicly-available, expert-annotated multimodal CRC dataset for deep learning, containing
annotated CRC pathology whole-slide images (WSI), preoperative CT and MRI images, and structured clinical
EMR data. Using this dataset, we will develop both single and multi-modality DL models for risk stratification of
surgically-resectable (Stage I-III) CRC patients.To test our hypothesis, we will compare the performance of
multi-modality models with that of single-modality models and existing methods of stratification. This project
benefits from the complementary expertise and resources of a unique interdisciplinary team spanning the fields
of machine learning, pathology, radiology, and oncology."

Molar-Incisor Hypomineralization (MIH) is a highly prevalent in children all around the globe affecting their
primary and permanent teeth. The affected enamel has chalky to yellow lesions that are demarcated and
less mineralized causing increased caries susceptibility, enamel breakout, esthetic concerns and sensitive
teeth. While the treatment and management of these lesions are challenging, the pathophysiology of MIH is
not known, hampering the development of a precise, targeted therapy. A striking feature of MIH is the
demarcation of defects, such that affected and unaffected enamel are located adjacently, with abrupt
changes in mineral density. This feature is in stark contrast to fluorosis which is characterized by diffuse
hypomineralization. Ameloblastin is one of the essential enamel proteins required for proper enamel
formation. In the absence of ameloblastin enamel is hypoplastic, known as amelogenesis imperfecta. When
ameloblastin is expressed too much, the enamel displays demarcated, hypomineralized lesions in mice.
The pathoetiology of MIH is unknown. Exposure to environmental toxicants are currently discussed. The
enamel of MIH teeth is characterized by an imbalance of enamel proteins and enzymes degrading the
m atrix.
The hypothesis of this research is that ameloblastin overexpression causes demarcated and
hypomineralized lesions through enzymatic imbalance. The proposed Aims will define the pathways of
demarcated enamel hypomineralization caused by Ambn overexpression and insufficient enzyme. In SA1
we will determine if demarcated, hypomineralized lesions are caused by insufficient enzyme relative to
ameloblastin overexpression. In SA2, we will determine the transcriptome and transcriptional regulation of
Ambn and overexpressed Ambn in ameloblasts using cultured primary enamel organ epithelium, termed
‘ameloblastoids’. In SA3, findings from the mouse model will be translated into a minimally invasive MIH
treatment protocol addressing conditioning and infiltrating the porous, hypomineralized enamel. Ultimately,

research."
10732265,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Food allergy is highly prevalent, burdensome, and stressful. Food allergy affects up to 7% of adolescents in the
United States, or two adolescents in every classroom. Anaphylaxis, a multi-systemic allergic reaction, can be
fatal if not treated with epinephrine quickly, and can only be prevented by strict allergen avoidance. The daily
burden of allergen avoidance, fear about allergen exposure and emergency treatment, and food allergy-related
bullying can incur stress and anxiety on patients and caregivers and is related to lower quality of life. Daily
adherence to allergen avoidance and emergency preparedness is challenging, particularly during early
adolescence when executive functioning skills are still developing, conformity to peer norms are predominant,
and food allergy management responsibility shifts from caregiver to adolescent. Most fatal food-induced
anaphylaxis cases occur during adolescence/young adulthood when allergens are unknowingly ingested away
from home, treatment with epinephrine is delayed, and/or asthma is comorbid. Early adolescents need to be
equipped with the skills and self-efficacy to engage in food allergy self-management behaviors that minimize
accidental allergen exposures and increase the probability of prompt treatment. Behavioral interventions that
promote illness self-management and adjustment are common in other chronic illness populations. However,
there are no evidence-based behavioral interventions that promote early adolescent food allergy self-
management. The proposed research project will evaluate a novel behavioral intervention that promotes early
adolescent food allergy self-management and adjustment through 1) food allergy education, 2) problem-solving,
communication, assertiveness, and anxiety management skill building, and 3) peer support. The Food Allergy
Mastery (FAM) program is a 6-session food allergy self-management program that will be delivered to early
adolescents with food allergy, a high-risk population that is growing in size, and a primary caregiver by a trained
interventionist. The specific aims are: 1) To evaluate the intervention’s impact on food allergy knowledge and
self-management skills, 2) To determine the intervention’s impact on food allergy self-management behavior and
psychosocial functioning and healthcare utilization, and as an exploratory aim 3) to determine if early
adolescents’ race/ethnicity moderates response to treatment, including food allergy knowledge, skills, self-
management behavior, psychosocial functioning, and healthcare utilization. The study has the potential to
positively impact the health care utilization of youth with food allergy by evaluating a scalable behavioral
intervention for adolescents and their caregivers. The intervention will equip youth with food allergy knowledge
and self-management skills by bolstering their food allergy-related knowledge and problem-solving, social skills,
and social support and attenuating food allergy anxiety. Successful development and implementation of the FAM
Program that promotes the attainment of integration of food allergy into daily life has the potential to decrease
health care utilization reducing emergency visits and improve food allergy-related quality of life."

Chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) has emerged as one of the major cause of morbidity and mortality
after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, there is limited therapeutic option for cGVHD
prevention and therapy. Steroid, the standard initial therapy of cGVHD, often is unsuccessful in preventing
permanent organs damage and has been associated with significant toxicities. Fatty acid (FA) metabolism
decides T cell (Tc) fate and function in cGVHD development. However, how medium chain fatty acid (MCFA)
participates in cGVHD pathobiology has not been studied. GPR84 has been well known as the MCFA sensing
receptor. Using peripheral blood nonnuclear cells (PBMCs) and fecals from cGVHD patients along with murine
models of cGVHD, we elucidate the implication of GPR84 signaling in cGVHD pathobiology. The scientific
premise of current research proposal is to understand how GPR84- mediated MCFA signaling regulates T cell
metabolism in cGVHD and therefore validate GPR84 targeting as an effective approach to control cGVHD. In
Aim 1, we will elucidate the biological function of GPR84-mediated MCFA metabolism in cGVHD. We will
use GPR84 genetically knockout mice and MCFA- enriched diet to understand the role of MCFA signaling in
bronchiolitis obliterans (BO)-, and thymus-damaged cGVHD. In Aim 2, we will elucidate mechanisms
responsible for the impact of GPR84- mediated MCFA signaling in cGVHD pathobiology. Utilizing stable
isotope-resolved metabolomics, high dimensional flow cytometry, and single cell ATAC-seq, we will validate how
GPR84 signaling by regulating cellular metabolism would influence Tc and follicular helper Tc (TFH) survival,
migration, differentiation, and function. We will elucidate the function CD8+T follicular cells (TFC), which is found
enriched in cGVHD patient’s PBMCs and elucidate how GPR84 signaling regulates this novel cell subset post-
transplant. In Aim 3, we investigate whether GPR84 targeting would be a therapeutic option for cGVHD
while preserving the GVL effect. We will use a combination of pharmacological antagonist; CRISPR-cas9
induced gene silencing, and diet programming approaches with human-to-mouse cGVHD model to test our
hypothesis. We will also examine if GPR84 targeting would be effective in the prevention steroid refractory
cGVHD. Because GPR84 inhibitor GLPG1205 has been found safe and effective in phase 2 clinical; precise
dietaries and microbiome- modulating therapies are important in the treatment of cGVHD, current research
proposal is highly translational and critically important."
10923791,"Diabetes affects over 10% of the US population and another 35% are at imminent risk of developing diabetes.
As many as half of the diabetic population will develop chronic pain that is poorly treated with current
medications. Chronic pain is a major contributor to a poor quality of life in diabetic individuals. While we do not
know the exact cause of diabetic neuropathic pain, increases plasma levels of methylglyoxal (MGO), a
chemical by-product of energy production, have been correlated with pain in diabetes. We have recently shown
that MGO induces the integrated stress response (ISR) in nociceptors, causing them to become
hyperexcitable. The ISR controls protein synthesis by repressing eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) and
recruiting eIF2A to the mRNA translation machinery. This leads to a global suppression of translation while
promoting the translation of select mRNA transcripts, particularly those with an upstream open reading frame.
We predict that eIF2A-mediated translation following the induction of ISR regulates the excitability of these
cells. Our initial work shows that the ISR is engaged in mouse and rat models of diabetes as well as human
sensory neurons treated with MGO. Our overarching hypothesis is that the ISR causes pain in diabetes and
that the ISR pathway can be targeted for treating pain in diabetes. As such, initial experiments in mice lacking
eIF2A show that the loss of eIF2A protects these mice against evoked and spontaneous pain caused by a
single or repeated MGO injections. Aim 1 will harness the power of mouse genetics to generate Nav1.8+
nociceptor-specific knockout of eIF2A. We aim to show that the ISR in mouse nociceptors is required for MGO-
evoked and diabetic neuropathic pain. We will further use this model to examine the translatome and identify
which mRNAs are translated under the influence of eIF2A, especially after MGO treatment. For Aim 2, we will
use cultured neurons and nervous tissues from organ donors to find out how MGO changes gene expression
and excitability of human neurons and whether treatment with an ISR inhibitor (ISRIB) can reverse these
aberrant changes. Our access to donor tissue presents a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses in a
model system that is representative of the people that this research will benefit. Finally, Aim 3 will take
advantage of a rat model of type II diabetes, the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, to understand how targeting
the ISR can be used to treat diabetic pain. We plan to use non-opioid therapies that are currently in
development, such as ISRIB, in the ZDF rats. We aim to show that targeting the ISR is an effective strategy for
preventing and reversing diabetic neuropathic pain and its electrophysiology correlates. We will also perform
RNA sequencing on ZDF rats treated with ISRIB to examine pathways influenced by ISR in a whole animal
model of diabetes. By using rodent and human models we will create a unique opportunity to clinically model
therapies with a specific biomarker that can be used to select patients and monitor drug efficacy. The ultimate
goal of this project is to promote the development of non-opioid therapies targeting the ISR, such as ISRIB"

Artificial turf fields and playgrounds have become common playing surfaces. It is estimated that
there are over 13,00 fields, and up to 1,500 new artificial fields are installed each year. Most of
these fields and playgrounds utilize infill generated from recycled tire crumb. Communities have
consistently reported chemical smells in fields, playgrounds, and surrounding areas. Despite the
widespread usage of artificial turf fields and playgrounds, uncertainty remains about safety and
the potential for exposure to toxic chemicals, heat exposure, impacts resulting in injury, and
environmental impacts in the community. Many studies have identified the presence of toxic
chemicals, known to be neurotoxic and carcinogenic in tire crumb infill. Parents and communities
are concerned because young children and athletes could be exposed and could potentially
experience health effects in the future from playing on these surfaces. Laboratories have identified
toxic chemicals in tire crumb, but results of exposure assessment information generated under
realistic playing conditions in children and adults are very limited. Exposure assessment studies
are underway at a state and federal level. Despite that, an increasing number of communities are
opting to use alternative infills made from plastics, virgin rubber, silica sand, cork, and waste shoe
materials. However, as with tire crumb infill, safety information is also lacking. As such,
communities in general struggle to make informed decisions about safe playing surfaces. The
proposed community-engaged project will employ a citizen science approach to collect samples
from alternative infill fields, identify chemicals in alternative infills materials, and characterize
exposure in such fields under real-life conditions. This project is well-positioned to achieve our
goal to address concerns from the community and inform policymakers in their communities to
incorporate environmental health research into consideration during the decision making for the
procurement, installation, use, and disposal of playing surfaces. This project embraces the
involvement of community member participation in the project’s research activities. Active
community involvement will allow community members to gain first-hand knowledge of the
chemicals in their fields and heat during playing conditions. Most importantly, it will enable them
to assist other communities regarding better practices and effective policies to protect concerned
communities."

Environmental factors have profound influence on brain plasticity during early-life. Maternal care arguably has
the greatest influence on this process, with neglect resulting in an array of mental health issues in adolescents
and adults. Childhood adversity (physical abuse, neglect, food insecurity, violence) is estimated to account for
up to 45% of child-onset and 32% of adult-onset mental health disorders. Neglect is the most prevalent form of
childhood maltreatment in the United States. Neural activity in early life shapes circuit development and can
have lifelong consequences on brain function. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is late-developing, making it more
susceptible to early-life adversity. Our previous study revealed that maternal presence/absence from the nest
regulates the activity of the PFC of rat pups at postnatal day 11 via the serotonergic system. In this study, we
propose to test the relation between PFC activity during early-life and behavioral expression in adulthood. In Aim
1, using single nucleus RNA sequencing, we will test how early-life adversity affects the expression profile of
distinct cell populations. Furthermore, using voltage dye imaging, we will test how early-life adversity affects PFC
activity in the immediate and long-term. In Aim 2, we will test whether activation or inhibition of the PFC in early-
life is causal or protective of long-term behavioral deficits associated with maternal separation. In Aim 3, we will
test whether a decrease in serotonergic activity during early-life is sufficient to produce the behavioral deficits
observed after maternal separation and, ultimately, whether normalizing serotonin levels in the PFC during
maternal separation can prevent the development of behavioral deficits."

This proposal describes a 5-year research career development program focused on a non-canonical role of RB1
loss in bladder cancer. Dr. Qiang Li is an Assistant Professor of Oncology at Roswell Park Comprehensive
Cancer Center in the Department of Urology. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous experience and
current research projects using genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) and organoids. The proposed
experiments and training will enable his transition to independence as a physician scientist in bladder cancer
translational research. He will be mentored primarily by Dr. David Goodrich. Dr. Goodrich is an expert in RB1
cancer biology, genetically engineered mouse models, acquired drug resistance and cancer cell plasticity. The
training plan includes the following goals: (1) Enhance expertise in preclinical cancer modeling (GEMM and
organoids); (2) Probe the molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer cellular plasticity and drug resistance; and
(3) Gain expertise in bioinformatic analysis.
RB1 mutations are predictive of pathologic response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in bladder cancer. Other
clinical observations suggest that the basal type of bladder cancer is more likely to respond to chemotherapy
than the luminal type. However, the biological impact of RB1 loss on molecular subtypes of bladder cancer
pathogenesis and chemotherapy response has not been investigated. Newly discovered features of the RB1
pathway in other cancer types suggest that RB1 loss promotes lineage plasticity and acquired therapy
resistance. Thus, we hypothesize that RB1 loss promotes bladder cancer progression, metastasis, and cellular
plasticity (luminal to basal, and therapeutic resistance). We use two transgenic mouse systems (Uroplakin II
driven reverse tetracycline trans-activator, TRE-Cre) to investigate the role of RB1 loss in bladder urothelium by
facilitating deletion of tumor suppressor genes (Trp53, Pten, Rb1) under control of doxycycline administration.
We engineered doxycycline inducible triple knockout mice Trp53-/-: Pten-/-: Rb1-/- (referred as TKO) and double
knockout mice Trp53-/-: Pten-/- (referred as DKO). We propose the following Specific Aims: (1) Define the function
of RB1 loss in accelerating tumor progression, metastasis, and cellular plasticity in bladder cancer GEMMs; (2)
Dissect the impact of cell-of-origin on bladder tumorigenesis, metastasis and response to chemotherapy in TKO
tumors derived from basal cells versus luminal cells. Successful completion of this proposal will allow the
candidate to gain valuable technical knowledge and expertise in preclinical modeling of advanced bladder cancer
and further his development as an independent physician scientist. The work will also establish experimental
models and analysis pipelines that will provide the foundation for the candidate’s independent research program."
10795949,"There is a fundamental gap in treatment for Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT).
Pharmacological treatment of CPVT is partially effective for a disease that causes sudden death. A fuller
understanding of novel gene editing approaches is needed to develop safe, non-surgical, and effective
therapies that target the underlying causes of CPVT. In approximately 60% of CPVT patients, mutations in
RYR2 cause arrhythmia through abnormal calcium handling in cardiomyocytes. The lab has shown that using
CRISPR/Cas9 to knockdown the RYR2 mutant allele is effective in preventing ventricular tachycardia(VT) by
decreasing expression of dysfunctional RyR2. The overall objective of this application is to improve therapy for
patients with CPVT. Preliminary data generated by the applicant showed that directly targeting a disease-
causing mutation with traditional CRISPR/Cas9 therapy in a CPVT mouse model prevented pacing induced VT
but reduced total expression of RyR2. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that novel methods of
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing can treat CPVT by specifically correcting causative mutation sites, reducing mutant
RyR2 expression while preserving total RyR2 expression, normalizing Ca2+ handling, and decreasing
susceptibility to VT. The rationale for this research is that an understanding of the effectiveness and specificity
of gene editing in the correcting mutations in the heart may lead to safe novel approaches to treat genetic
cardiac disorders. The hypothesis will be tested with the following specific aims 1) test the therapeutic potential
of human RYR2 mutation correction in an iPSC-CM preclinical model of CPVT and 2) test the therapeutic
potential of mouse RYR2 mutation correction in a mouse model of CPVT. To determine aim 1, we deliver
CRISPR/Cas9 prime editing vectors to IPSC, derive CM, and measure function through confocal and light
sheet imaging of IPSC and 3D cardiac organoids. To determine aim 2, we will use Lenti-CRISPR/Cas9 prime
editing vectors to treat mouse models of CPVT and measure long-term cardiac function through
echocardiography, EKG, programmed electrical stimulation, and molecular analysis. This research is
significant in that it will advance gene editing correction of RYR2 mutations as a safe and effective method for
the treatment of CPVT."
10791824,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression are unavoidable at the single-cell level and affect fate decisions from
HIV to embryonic development. Yet, there remain fundamental gaps in our understanding of the mechanisms
generating and regulating expression fluctuations in mammalian cells. Addressing this gap in knowledge is
critical to therapeutic development in systems where fluctuations and heterogeneity present treatment barriers,
such as in HIV, stem-cell therapeutics, and cancer. Our long-term goal is to develop therapeutics that target
mechanisms of cellular heterogeneity to overcome barriers to precise control of cell fate.
During the past 5 years, our work established mechanistic roles for noise and heterogeneity, demonstrating that
noise is a feature, rather than a bug, of biological systems that can be modulated for therapeutic effect.
Specifically, we: (i) elucidated a viral transcriptional-feedback circuit that harnesses noise to regulate HIV latency,
(ii) found this circuit to be optimized by evolution to function as a viral bet-hedging circuit, (iii) made contributions
to cell biology showing that transcriptional fluctuations are, in general, amplified by nuclear export and translation,
and, (iv) we discovered a novel post-transcriptional feedback architecture that efficiently suppresses noise to
stabilize fate commitment. Most excitingly, and most relevant to this application, we (v) discovered noise-
enhancer molecules that appear to substantially improve viral reactivation from latency and have been used
by other labs to increase noise in diverse systems (e.g., circadian rhythm).
The objective of this renewal is to identify molecular mechanisms of noise modulation in mammalian cell-fate
circuits to enable therapeutic control of noise. Based on our findings and extensive preliminary evidence in
embryonic stem cells (ESCs), our central hypothesis is that generalized `core' cellular mechanisms exist to tune
expression noise and that these mechanisms can be pharmacologically perturbed. Our specific aims build off
our unique tool of noise-enhancer molecules and will: (Aim 1) map the molecular mechanistic pathways of noise
enhancer molecules to develop a mathematical model predictive of transcriptome-wide noise in mammalian
cells; (Aim 2) map the molecular mechanisms of noise-suppressor molecules; and (Aim 3) to quantify relative
contributions of stochastic vs. deterministic mechanisms underlying HIV latency in vivo and safety &
efficacy of noise-modulating molecules in vivo. The proposed research has broad significance as it will determine
core molecular mechanisms regulating expression in disparate fate-specification models, reveal genetic targets
of noise enhancement and suppression that can lead to the development of new broad-spectrum noise
modulators, and propel clinical translation of noise-modulating molecules. Ultimately, the knowledge gained will
guide new therapeutic approaches to overcome barriers to precise cell-fate control across diverse mammalian
systems."
10782510,"Glial HIFa: mechanisms and implications in hypoxia/ischemia-induced oligodendroglial pathology
Preterm birth before 37th gestational week affects 1 of 10 infants and is an enormous burden on public health.
Due to the immaturity of the respiratory system and the brain white matter vasculature of preterm infants,
hypoxia/ischemia (H/I)-elicited diffuse white matter injury (WMI) frequently occurs in preterm brain. Disturbed
myelination is a hallmark pathological feature in diffuse WMI. Impaired differentiation of myelin-producing
oligodendrocytes from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (referred to as OPC differentiation) is a primary culprit
for disturbed myelination. No clinical therapies exist for promoting myelination in preterm infants affected by
WMI. Therefore, studying molecular mechanisms underlying arrested OPC differentiation in WMI is important
and instrumental in designing myelination therapies for treating hypomyelination in preterm infants. This project
aims to define molecular mechanisms underlying the disturbed myelin formation in diffuse WMI with a focus on
the function and mechanisms of glial HIFα in OPC differentiation and myelination. The developing central
nervous system (CNS) is exposed to a physiologically hypoxic environment under which hypoxia inducible
factor alpha, HIFα (HIF1α and HIF2α) is transiently stabilized to regulate neural development. The role of HIFα
in glial cell development remains unknown until a seminal study reported a concept that oligodendroglial HIFα
stabilization disturbed normal OPC differentiation through activating autocrine Wnt signaling (Yuen et al., 2014
Cell). However, our recent in vivo study (Zhang et al., 2020 Nature Communications) weakens the concept and
unraveled a glial type-specific HIFα-Wnt regulation: oligodendroglial HIFα does not regulate Wnt signaling
while astroglial HIFα surprisingly does. Our submitted study (Zhang et al., 2020 BioRxiv,
doi:10.1101/2020.03.30.015131) further demonstrated an autocrine Wnt-independent role of HIFα in normal
oligodendroglial development and discovered a novel HIFα target whose activation inhibits OPC differentiation.
Going forward to WMI, we found persistent HIFα activation in glial cells and interestingly, dampening such
HIFα activation mitigated myelination disturbance in an animal model for diffuse WMI. Built on these
substantive data, we propose an overarching hypothesis that, under WMI, oligodendroglial HIFα regulates
OPC differentiation in a manner independent of autocrine Wnt signaling as previously thought (tested in Aim 1),
instead, through activating SOX9, a new non-canonical HIFα target we identified (tested in Aim 2) and that
astrocytes control OPC differentiation through HIFα-activated paracrine Wnt signaling (tested in Aim 3). We will
use glial type-specific and time-conditional genetic mutants and a preterm human brain-equivalent mouse
model for diffuse WMI to test our hypothesis. This project will likely advance our fundamental mechanism
knowledge of glial HIFα in oligodendroglial biology and pathology and provide new data into the therapeutic
potential of glial HIFα in overcoming disturbed myelination in preterm infants affected by diffused WMI."
10772085,"Recent clinical and preclinical studies suggest that highly selective positive allosteric modulators
(PAMs) for specific muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have exciting potential as novel
treatments for positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and cognitive disturbances in patients suffering from
schizophrenia. However, the precise mechanisms by which mAChRs regulate brain circuits that are relevant
for the major symptom clusters associated with schizophrenia are unknown. It will be critical to develop a full
understanding of the precise cellular and circuit roles of each mAChR subtype that could be relevant for
schizophrenia and related brain disorders. Early stages of schizophrenia are associated with hyperactivity of
the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and this is important for some of the cognitive and negative symptoms associated
with the disease. Interestingly, we have found activation of the M1 subtype of mAChR induces long-term
depression (M1-LTD) of transmission at excitatory synapses in the PFC, and also induces a robust increase in
inhibitory transmission in this region. These combined actions could contribute to the established ability of
highly selective M1 PAMs to reverse cognitive deficits in rodent models that are relevant for schizophrenia.
Based on previous and new preliminary studies, we postulate that M1-LTD and M1-induced increases in
synaptic inhibition in the PFC are mechanistically distinct and depend on activation of M1 in different neuronal
populations. Specifically, we postulate that M1-LTD is mediated by activation phospholipase D (PLD) in PFC
pyramidal cells, and that M1 increases inhibitory transmission through direct excitatory effects on specific
populations of inhibitory interneurons through a PLD-independent mechanism. We propose a series of studies
in which we will selectively delete M1 from specific neuronal populations and use M1 PAMs that differentially
regulate coupling of M1 to PLD and phospholipase C (PLC), along with optogenetic silencing of specific
neuronal populations, to rigorously evaluate the roles of M1 expressed in each of these major neuronal
populations. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that M1 PAMs induce M1-LTD by actions on M1 expressed
in PFC pyramidal cells and do not require activation of M1 in inhibitory neurons (Aim 1). We will then perform
a series of studies to test the hypothesis that M1 activation increases inhibitory transmission in the PFC by
actions on defined populations of inhibitory interneurons (Aim 2). Finally, we will take advantage of our range
of genetic, optogenetic, and pharmacological tools to test the hypothesis that M1 PAMs reverse deficits in
specific behavioral measures of cognitive function by actions on different neuronal populations in the PFC
(Aim 3). These studies will provide important new insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms by which
M1 PAMs enhance and restore deficits in specific domains of cognitive function that could be critical in
advancing novel therapeutic strategies based on targeting these receptors."

The treatment for children and young adults with T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic
lymphoma (T-LL) has harmonized over time as T-LL patients were shown to have superior outcomes with T-ALL
therapy. The recently completed Children’s Oncology Group (COG) phase 3 clinical trial AALL1231, however,
found that T-LL but not T-ALL patients had improved event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) when
randomized to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib plus cytotoxic chemotherapy vs chemotherapy alone. In
addition, corticosteroids were intensified on AALL1231 to eliminate prophylactic cranial radiation in most children.
T-ALL patients benefited from the corticosteroid intensification and T-LL patients did not. This trial changed the
treatment paradigm for T-ALL and T-LL and it is critical we identify the mechanisms underlying the differential
response to therapy. For T-ALL patients, we performed comprehensive -omic analyses under R01CA193776
and an associated Gabriella Miller Kids First X01 award (X01HD100702). These studies included proteomic
profiling on over 250 children with T-ALL and whole genome, whole exome, and RNA sequencing (WGS, WES,
RNAseq) on over 1250 children with T-ALL. We also performed single cell genomic profiling (scRNASeq) on
bone marrow from 30 T-ALL cases to understand clonal architecture and microenvironment. We now have
access to tissues from over 250 children with T-LL which we will use to test our central hypothesis that specific
proteomic, transcriptomic, and genomic profiles can: (1) identify patients with T-ALL and T-LL that have a higher
risk of relapsing, (2) define patients that have a higher likelihood to benefit from novel therapies, and (3) delineate
intrinsic (tumor) and extrinsic (microenvironment) biologic differences that lead to the differential response to
therapy. We will leverage and expand our existing T-ALL data and generate new data in T-LL to test our
hypothesis with the following specific aims. We will perform bulk genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling
on T-LL tissues, as well as single cell profiling on T-LL bone marrow and T-ALL and T-LL CSF and compare the
tumor and microenvironment in T-ALL and T-LL to identify biologic differences between the two (Aim 1). We will
perform transcriptome and proteome profiling to define mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to
corticosteroids (Aim 2) and proteasome inhibitors (Aim 3) in T-ALL and T-LL and target dysregulated proteins
driving resistance with small molecule inhibitors and CRISPR-Cas9 to overcome drug resistance.
Impact: We are uniquely positioned to perform highly innovative studies in samples collected from children and
young adults with T-ALL and T-LL treated on multi-center phase 3 trials. We will improve understanding of T-
ALL and T-LL biology and define intrinsic (cancer cell) and extrinsic (microenvironment) biologic factors that
distinguish the two. We will identify which T-ALL and T-LL patients should receive proteasome inhibitors and
intensified corticosteroids as standard therapy and identify novel targets for the next generation of clinical trials."

sample analyses. A succesful completion of this study will provide novel mechanisms for breast

10816612,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Drosophila Gene Disruption Project (GDP), since its foundation in 2000, has produced a large,
publicly available library of individual, sequence-mapped transposable element (TE) insertions that have
become an essential resource for fly research. Generating and sequencing 180,000 TEs allowed the most
useful ~22,000 (located in/near 13,000 genes) to be selected and deposited in the Bloomington Drosophila
Stock Center. More than 750,000 GDP cultures have been distributed to thousands of labs nationally and
internationally, facilitating the analysis of thousands of genes. The features of the TEs developed by the
GDP, particularly the MiMIC TE, greatly enhance their value as they allow characterization of gene
expression, protein distribution, tissue specific knock down, isolation of interacting proteins, assessment of
the function of homologues of other species and other sophisticated, state-of-the-art manipulations. The
flexibility to swap any DNA cassette into existing MiMIC TE sites provides a genetic toolkit that is unrivaled,
greatly advancing the field of functional genomics and impacting our understanding of gene function across
species.
 During the proposed budget period, the GDP will provide tools to analyze gene function that will
constitute a new resource not only to tackle basic biological questions but also medical questions aiding with
the discovery and study of new human diseases and their underlying mechanisms. A critical prerequisite for
modeling disease in Drosophila is the ability to express each of the 9,000 evolutionarily conserved human
genes in the endogenous expression pattern of their fly ortholog. This can currently be achieved by using
MiMIC and the SA-T2A-GAL4-polyA cassette (T2A-GAL4). When inserted in introns between two coding
exons, this cassette is highly mutagenic and produces a GAL4 that can be used to drive the UAS-cDNA of a
fly or human homolog, frequently rescuing the mutant phenotype and allowing disease modeling. Here, we
propose to expand the tagging of most genes that can be tagged with this approach. We have also
developed a new strategy to permit replacement of all genes that do not have suitable introns for T2A-GAL4
integration, which constitute about 45% of all fly genes. This method exchanges the gene's entire coding
regions with a Kozak consensus sequence followed by GAL4. We propose to target 2,300 currently untagged
Drosophila genes using these two strategies depending on the structure of the locus and the nature of the
cassette to be inserted. The vast majority of the genes will be tagged with GAL4 because it permits numerous
elegant applications. The resulting lines will be characterized genetically and molecularly and the expression
pattern of the genes will be documented in third instar larval brains. The generation and distribution of these
reagents is highly appreciated by the Drosophila community as shown by the many letters of support from
leaders in the fly community."

Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent gynecological disorder affecting 10-15% of women of
reproductive age resulting in pelvic pain and infertility. It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue
outside the uterus, predominantly in the pelvic peritoneum. The activity of endometriotic lesions or implants, and
the development of subsequent adhesions, is the likely causes of the disease symptoms. Lesion development
is difficult to study in women with endometriosis because of the significant delays in diagnosis. In the past 20
years we have developed the baboon as an appropriate model to better examine the establishment and
progression of endometriotic lesions. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate the development and
progression of ectopic lesions at the onset of the disease will result in new opportunities for targeted therapies
to prevent and/or treat endometriosis. The Notch family of transmembrane receptors (NOTCH1-4) transduces
extracellular signals responsible for cell survival, cell-to-cell communication, and differentiation. Our Central
Hypothesis is that IL-6, which is present in the inflammatory peritoneal environment induces the expression of
the E-protein transcription factors E2A and HEB, which in turn upregulates NOTCH1 expression by directly
binding to the NOTCH1 promoter. The induction of NOTCH1 promotes endometriotic lesion development by
controlling cell proliferation, invasion and EMT. In this proposal we will utilize our innovative engineered mouse
models, the established baboon endometriosis model together with well characterized human tissues to
understand how NOTCH1 is induced and how the induction and upregulation of NOTCH1 contributes to
endometriotic lesion development. Specific Aim 1 will focus on the molecular mechanisms by which IL-6, in the
context of endometriosis, regulates the expression of E-protein transcription factors (E2A and HEB) to induce
NOTCH1 in vitro and in vivo and determine the molecular mechanisms by which NOTCH1 activates signaling
pathways that contribute to endometriotic lesion development. Specific Aim 2 will focus on functional studies
using 3-D and organoid cell culture models and our unique fluorescence-tagged NOTCH1 gain of function and
loss of function mouse models to dissect the molecular mechanisms and pathological consequences by which
increased NOTCH1 expression in endometriotic tissues regulates cell proliferation and induces EMT to enhance
migration and invasion. Specific Aim 3 will use both engineered mouse models and the baboon endometriosis
model for targeted delivery of a dominant negative Mastermind-like (DN-MAML) peptide (SAHM1) using
fluorescently labeled nanoparticles to inhibit NOTCH1 signaling as a novel therapeutic approach to inhibit the
pathologic processes associated with the disease. The outcomes of these studies will enhance our
understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of endometriotic lesion development and elucidate novel
pathways which will translate into identifying novel non-hormonal therapeutic approaches for treating
endometriosis."
10814378,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The human gammaherpesviruses (γHVs) Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus and Epstein-Barr virus are
DNA tumor viruses that establish a lifelong infection. These viruses are strongly associated with pathogenic
outcomes in immune suppression, including the AIDS defining malignancies Kaposi's sarcoma and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma. A major challenge of the γHVs is that these viruses present a lifelong risk for viral re-
emergence and pathogenesis, especially in the context of acquired or medically-induced immunosuppression.
Lifelong infection is further confounded by the limited therapeutic interventions against γHV diseases. To date,
the best defense against γHV-induced disease is an intact immune system. Despite this correlation, there
remain major knowledge gaps in our understanding of: 1) protective aspects of successful vaccination to γHV
infection, and 2) consequence of vaccination on the composition and frequency of infected cells, either before
or after established infection. In this R01 application, we seek to investigate how vaccination alters γHV
infection, using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68), a mouse model of γHV infection, that facilitates study of
infection and associated responses from primary infection through lifelong latency and re-emergence of lytic
infection. We recently undertook studies to characterize how latency is regulated by viral and host factors at
the single-cell level, identifying that the latent pool is heterogeneous based on expression of the latency-
associated nuclear antigen (LANA), and that the proportion of LANA+ latently-infected cells is subject to
regulation. These studies further identified that CD8 T cells, and the cytokine interferon-gamma, limit LANA+
latently-infected B cells, and that vaccination with a live-attenuated vaccine is capable of profoundly restricting
LANA+ latent B cell infection in an interferon-gamma-independent manner. We now seek to investigate the
role of myeloid cells in infection and vaccination on γHV infection both in vitro and in vivo. We will make use of
vaccination protocols with defined differences in efficacy to identify the critical features using single cell
analysis and high dimensional methods to distinguish the features of vaccine efficacy. We hypothesize that
vaccination with a live-attenuated vaccine induces: 1) local and systemic myeloid reprogramming,
which 2) redirects γHV myeloid infection into an immune-susceptible myeloid target. We will test this in
three aims. First, we will analyze the impact of vaccination on local and systemic myeloid cells. Second, define
how vaccination affects primary γHV infection of myeloid cells. Third, dissect how viral tropism is influenced by
vaccine-induced effector mechanisms. By analyzing specific viral and host processes in the context of
vaccines with varying efficacy, this proposal seeks to investigate myeloid reprogramming as a necessary, and
therapeutically viable, target for vaccination against γHV latency."
10808904,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Modern healthcare has implemented medical devices to help and improve the life quality
of people with chronic and lifestyle diseases. Paradoxically, although these devices are successful in achieving
their purpose, they make the patient susceptible to infections. Urinary catheters are among the most widely used
medical devices, and currently, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are the most common
healthcare-associated infection (HAI) worldwide, accounting for 40% of all HAIs. In addition, the treatment and
control of CAUTI is becoming increasingly challenging due to the rise of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Critically,
CAUTIs are very different from uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), exhibiting unique clinical and
pathological manifestations, as well as causative organisms. For example, in uncomplicated UTI, E. coli accounts
for >95% of the causative agent, whereas in CAUTI, urinary catheterization allows pathogens such as
Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Candida spp., Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and
Acinetobacter baumanii to colonize the bladder, something that otherwise would not occur. Given that the
frequency of catheter usage is only expected to increase due to both an aging population and medical advances,
it is imperative to understand the pathophysiology of CAUTI if we are to develop ways to treat and/or prevent it.
Recent work has found that urinary catheterization elicits bladder inflammation and mechanically disrupts the
host defenses, compromising the host for microbial colonization. Further findings in mice and humans have
shown that fibrinogen (Fg) is released and accumulated in the bladder to heal the damaged tissue. Fg is also
deposited on catheters, coating them and forming a platform for colonization by CAUTI-associated pathogens.
It was found that Fg levels modulate outcome of the infection and, in the absence of Fg, E. faecalis is unable to
stick to the catheter and colonize the bladder. On the other hand, high Fg levels enhance enterococcal bladder
and catheter colonization. This suggests that protein deposition on urinary catheters is a key factor for microbial
infection. This proposal tests the hypothesis that by controlling the amount of protein deposition on the surface
using a novel liquid surface coating, we will be able to control the rate and extent of uropathogen biofilm
formation, urinary tract colonization, and systemic dissemination, as well as the inflammation response. Through
a combination of material modification, proteomics, histological, and immunological approaches with a mouse
model of CAUTI, we will: 1) develop liquid-infused catheters that control protein deposition; 2) assess their
contribution in reducing protein deposition and biofilm formation in vitro; and 3) characterize in vivo how protein
deposition modulation affects biofilm formation, the outcome of infection, and inflammation. Understanding the
role of protein deposition in promoting pathogen-material-host interactions will provide new perspective in the
establishment and progression of CAUTI, generating key insights into the development of alternative treatments
that do not contribute to microbial resistance."
10746839,"SUMMARY
Maternal immune activation (MIA) during fetal development increases risk for neurodevelopmental disorders
(NDDs) later in the offspring life. Chronic microglial activation in the adult offspring exposed to gestational MIA
leads to a range of altered behaviors. Yet, the developmental mechanisms whereby MIA induces this sustained
activation of offspring brain microglia across the lifespan are not understood. Systemic inflammation triggered
during adulthood was shown to disrupt blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, inducing microglial activation,
neuroinflammation and leading to the progressive emergence of neuropathologies. Even though comparable
outcomes are observed in adult offspring who experienced gestational MIA, whether there is similar BBB
disruption and the mechanisms leading to these phenotypes in utero are not known. This is an important
knowledge gap because MIA is a risk factor for NNDs and there is growing evidence of vascular dysfunction
contributing to the molecular pathology of these disorders.
The investigators obtained preliminary data showing that MIA triggered by the viral mimetic poly(I:C) in pregnant
mice disrupts fetal BBB formation leading to increased nascent BBB permeability measured using live fetal MRI.
Their data further suggest that activation of the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2; Ptgs2) pathway in fetal brain microglia
is causal to MIA effects. Importantly, longitudinal MRI analyses suggest that disruption of fetal BBB formation
induces persistent BBB hyperpermeability and life-long brain microglial activation, cerebrovascular inflammation,
and behavioral alterations in the offspring.
 Through the combined expertises of four different research groups, the investigators developed and
validated new methods for measuring fetal brain BBB permeability in vivo (MRI) and ex vivo (whole fetus
perfusion) which, together with conditional knockout mouse lines, will be used to test: 1) if and how MIA activation
of the COX2 pathway in fetal microglia perturbs fetal BBB formation at a critical time of development, leading to
incomplete maturation, and 2) if and how the resulting protracted activation of COX2 pathway in resident
microglia prolongs BBB structural disruption and neuroinflammation over the offspring lifespan. This self-
perpetuating cycle of brain inflammation and BBB disruption would ultimately promote increased risk for
neuropathology in the offspring. From an etiological standpoint, this pre-clinical proposal will define novel cellular
and molecular pathways involved in life-long effects of prenatal insults, shedding light on the mechanisms by
which early inflammation is causally linked to vascular disruptions in neurodevelopmental disorders."
10805446,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Nurses represent the largest numbers of health care workers. As a critical component of the health care
workforce, nurses must have a strong foundation in genomics. This is particularly true for faculty preparing the
next generation of nurses to provide clinical care and conduct research. Advances in genomic science are
redefining our understanding of health and illness, necessitating a concomitant shift in nursing education and
 1
practice. A goal of the nursing profession, highlighted in the Institute of Medicine Future of Nursing report , is to
increase the number of nurses with doctoral degrees to ensure that sufficient numbers of faculty are available
to prepare the nursing labor force needed for delivery of health care services. Doctoral-prepared nurses with
terminal degrees of DNP and PhD have opportunities to lead change in health care systems and transform care
with the translation and integration of genomics in education, scholarship and practice.
 The purpose of this educational project is to improve the knowledge and skills of doctoral nurses in medical
genomics. The need for the project was identified through a literature review and targeted needs assessment
of nursing faculty and students. The project will commence with a half-day medical genomics course provided
as a preconference at the American Association of Colleges of Nursing annual doctoral conference followed by
monthly webinars and web conferencing sessions for the remainder of the year. The project will use the
training-of-trainers model2 to disseminate information and strategies to implement genomics nursing education
and is expected to prepare at least 200 additional ""trainers"" in medical genomics over the course of five years.
These trainers will translate and integrate genomic information in nursing academics, scholarship and practice
to serve as genomic champions at their schools of nursing.
 The primary aims of this proposed educational project are to: 1) develop and implement educational
programs and materials aimed to achieve competency in medical genomics for doctoral nurses. 2) prepare
doctoral nurses to integrate genetic and genomic content into academics and clinical practice; and 3)
determine areas of strengths and weaknesses of doctoral nurses in foundational genomic concepts to inform
future educational planning. The course offers didactic and experiential training as well as written and online
resources, to facilitate the translation and integration of genomic content. Ongoing program evaluation will
guide subsequent courses to address gaps in understanding and barriers to implementation. Doctoral nurses
will obtain knowledge and skills to incorporate genomic medicine into academic curricula as well as in research
and clinical practice. This educational program in medical genomics builds on the investigators' collective
experience with educational endeavors in genomics and is an educational collaboration between the
investigator/s and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN)."
10767948,"Adolescents and young adults (AYA) under the age of 25 in the United States (US) are the least likely of all age
groups to: 1) know their HIV status, 2) initiate PrEP if HIV-negative even when indicated, 3) take medication as
prescribed, attend medical appointments, and be virally suppressed if living with HIV. Persistent rates of new
infections among US youth indicate that evidence-based and integrated approaches to increase the uptake and
use of effective biomedical prevention and treatment products are required. Adolescence and young adulthood
are challenging developmental periods, with significant physical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social changes.
While multiple vulnerabilities and complex community factors drive the HIV epidemic among youth, these
developmental periods are also characterized by opportunities for growth, achievement, and resilience. HIV
research networks must be broad in agenda, go beyond traditional clinical sites and individual level interventions
and address the multi-faceted, multi-level barriers that have thwarted HIV prevention and care progress among
AYA. The newly envisioned Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) is a multi-
component collaborative research enterprise focused on the reduction of new HIV infections among AYA in the
US as well as improvements across the HIV continuum of care for youth living with HIV. Such a large-scale,
complex clinical research program demands high productivity and strong contributions from each essential
component. Our proposed overall network structure is conceptualized as a well-oiled machine with
interdependent structures working together seamlessly to achieve the mission of the ATN. The Scientific
Leadership Center (SLC) will bring all elements together and ensure that they function collaboratively, effectively,
and efficiently with the Operations and Collaboration Center (OCC), NIH, and the overall network. The ATN has
identified five high priority research areas to address the substantial and disproportionate gaps in the health
outcomes of AYA across the HIV prevention and care continuum. With this application, we include seven highly
innovative and impactful clinical trials led by talented multi-disciplinary teams, addressing all five priority research
areas, spanning key populations of youth, multiple socioecological systems, and a variety of regulatory phases.
We are also poised to accept emerging research opportunities as the field of prevention and treatment science
advances. Communities will be situated at the center of the ATN’s work because community ownership,
engagement, and connectedness are critical for successful research implementation. Drs. Hightow-Weidman
and Hosek are uniquely qualified as MPIs to lead the SLC. Both have worked in the field of adolescent HIV
prevention and treatment for the entirety of their careers and have worked collaboratively within the ATN for >16
years, giving them clear insight on how best to make this new iteration successful. Our overall vision for a
redesigned and robust ATN is one that not only anticipates and plans for ongoing evolution in the HIV field and
an emerging scientific agenda but one with a renewed focus on the most impactful science and priority areas."
10767949,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) fills a unique role among the NIH-
funded networks by bringing together scientific and clinical investigators with the requisite knowledge and
experience to design and implement interdisciplinary, developmentally appropriate prevention strategies for
youth living with HIV and those at-risk in the United States (US). An experienced, multidisciplinary, and visionary
Scientific Leadership Group (SLG) is needed who is poised to develop, refine, and support both an established
and emerging ATN scientific agenda that impacts the HIV epidemic among youth domestically. Seamless
collaboration will be essential at all levels, expecting and requiring innovation from investigators invested in
addressing the significant challenges and seizing opportunities within the field of adolescent HIV prevention and
care research. Efficient and effective communication strategies to accomplish high-impact research obligates
synergies between the ATN SLG and Scientific Leadership Center (SLC), the Statistical and Data Management
Core (SDMC), the Operations and Collaborations Center (OCC), the Research Project teams, Site Consortiums
and NIH and industry partners. The SLG, working collaboratively with the SLC, SDMC, OCC and NIH is poised
to actuate the unique mission, strengths, and expertise housed within the ATN, to identify gaps in the ATN
research portfolio, and to form additional strategic partnerships that ensure the ATN’s swift response to high
priority and emergent research areas. Given the broad ATN agenda, we have formulated a strong,
interdisciplinary SLG which includes the world’s experts in all areas relevant to ending the HIV epidemic among
adolescents in the US. This team consists of investigators with diverse expertise and experiences, including
diversity in terms of race/ethnicity, sexual and gender identity, HIV-status, geography, discipline, and training.
Building upon years of collective experience, Drs. Hightow-Weidman and Hosek will provide the necessary
leadership and infrastructure to support the SLG to develop and refine the research agenda of the ATN, convene
working groups as needed, prioritize emerging research projects, efficiently manage the development of clinical
protocols, implement, and complete clinical trials and ensure timely publication and communication of results.
Drs. Hightow-Weidman and Hosek aim to use an approach toward management of the SLG, honed through
decades of prior ATN and clinical trials experiences, that will foster innovation and effectiveness through
flexibility, open communication between all SLG team members, mutual respect, collective problem solving, and
shared accountability. The SLG is configured through Leadership Teams organized around six areas: Biomedical
Therapeutics, Comorbidities and Coinfections, Laboratory, Diagnostics and Mobile Technologies, Institutions,
Organizations and Policy, Equity, Inclusion, and Engagement, and Risk and Resilience, and supported by a
Bioethics Committee. These content areas encompass the areas of focus required to truly catalyze
multidisciplinary research and translate the findings to ensure maximum clinical and policy impact by the ATN."
10767951,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adolescents and young adults (AYA) are disproportionately affected by HIV in the US. Despite adolescents
accounting for over 20% of new infections, this age group is the least likely to be tested for HIV, linked to care,
and achieve viral suppression as compared to their adult counterparts. Further, AYA also have low rates of HIV
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness and uptake. Therefore, there is an urgent need to expand HIV
screening and prevention strategies to nontraditional healthcare settings such as emergency departments (ED)
to reach AYA who would otherwise not receive preventive healthcare. The goal of this application is to
leverage our recent insights obtained from a multi-center, ED-based, adolescent gonorrhea and chlamydia
screening study to determine the most clinically and cost-effective HIV screening approach for AYA that will
also use digital health and rapid start PrEP or antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at risk youth. This will be
accomplished through the Adolescent Medicine Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) by leveraging
its infrastructure which includes geographically diverse site consortiums including adolescent clinics and their
associated pediatric EDs. This research will contribute to the evidence base for creating clinically effective,
cost-effective, and sustainable HIV screening programs that can be successfully implemented into the clinical
workflow of the ED. It will also improve identification and linkage to PrEP/ART care for at risk adolescents
using mHealth strategies by first identifying AYA who are PrEP/ART candidates based on their responses to a
computerized sexual health screen (cSHS) and subsequently providing clinical decision support (CDS) to
providers via the electronic health record and educational information by text message directly to PrEP/ART
candidates based on their HIV results. This intervention will rely on an innovative approach that electronically
integrates patient-reported data to guide CDS. This work is significant because it has the potential to fill gaps in
the literature needed to provide evidence for the best method of HIV screening in a pediatric ED setting. First,
we will conduct a pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial of targeted HIV screening (screening only those
disclosing high risk sexual behavior) versus universally offered HIV screening (both opt-in and opt-out methods
offered to all, regardless of risk) through electronic integration of patient reported data for provision of CDS and
identification of PrEP candidacy. Based on HIV test results, we will then harness digital health for status neutral
rapid or same-day mHealth PrEP/ART start (SMART) and linkage to care. This research is novel in that it shifts
the usual clinical practice paradigm of HIV screening and prevention in the pediatric ED from a scattered
approach to a consistent and sustainable approach that is critical to addressing the HIV epidemic among AYA."
10767956,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Young persons, aged 13-24 years, accounted for 21% of new infections in the United States in 2018, and 81%
of these occurred in young gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (YGBMSM). Currently, there
are 4 different regimens of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) available for YGBMSM: 1) daily tenofovir
disoproxil fumarate co-formulated with emtricitabine (TDF/FTC), 2) daily tenofovir alafenamide co-formulated
with emtricitabine (TAF/FTC), 3) peri-coital TDF/FTC (“2-1-1 PrEP”), and 4) injectable long-acting cabotegravir.
PrEP Choice is a package of three mobile health tools designed to increase the uptake and adherence to PrEP
for YGBMSM, aged 13-24 years, to be tested in multiple sites in the United States. PrEP Choice consists of 1)
MyPrEP, a website to help YGBMSM choose the type of PrEP that works best for them; 2) PrEPmate, a two-
way SMS texting tool to check in with YGBMSM on a weekly basis and troubleshoot any problems with PrEP
that arise; and 3) PrEPsmart, an app that reminds PrEP users taking PrEP pills when their next pill should be
taken. These tools have been developed and tested individually; this is the first study to test the package of
these tools to see if they increase the proportion of YGBMSM who take PrEP, and their adherence to PrEP
once they start. The study begins by ensuring that PrEP Choice is relevant for both Spanish- and English-
speaking YGBMSM across the country, through the use of focus groups, followed by a technical pilot in 20
YGBMSM, to work out any bugs in the system and to help determine how best to apply PrEP Choice in this
population. Then, 200 YGBMSM not currently on PrEP will be recruited into a trial in which 100 are randomly
chosen to get PrEP Choice, and the other 100 are randomly chosen to get a brochure describing the different
types of PrEP available. After 9 months of follow-up, PrEP starts and use over time will be compared between
the two groups. Then, the 100 participants initially given the brochure only will get access to the PrEP Choice
package, and both groups will be followed for another 9 months to study their use of PrEP over time. PrEP use
will be measured by testing for tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) levels in dried blood spots (for the 3 types of
PrEP that use pills) or the number of PrEP injections they get (for injectable long acting cabotegravir.) The
primary outcome is PrEP use at 9 months into the study, and this study will enroll enough participants to be
able to tell whether there is at least a 20% increase in the proportion of YGBMSM who use any PrEP in the
PrEP Choice group compared with the brochure group, and a 22.5% increase in PrEP adherence (as
measured by TFV-DP levels or administration of long-acting cabotegravir) in the PrEP Choice group compared
with the brochure group. The cost and cost-effectiveness of the PrEP Choice package will also be assessed for
YGBMSM. The trial will be conducted through the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN),
making use of their biostatistical and modeling resources, geographic and site diversity, and multidisciplinary
expertise, including young advisors from the target population."
10767964,"ABSTRACT
In the United States (US), transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth have high rates of new HIV diagnoses,
with Black, Latinx, and other TGD youth of color representing the majority of these cases. The HIV prevention
and care continua emphasize the need to reduce HIV transmission risk via regular HIV testing, consistent
condom use, and linkages to HIV prevention and care, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) among HIV-
negative individuals and antiretroviral therapy (ART) and viral suppression among people living with HIV.
However, there are inequities at each step of these continua among TGD youth of color. TGD youth of color
experience intersectional oppression that results in unmet gender affirmation, legal, and economic needs,
which have been linked to inequities in HIV prevention and continua outcomes. Building on formative work, this
project seeks to test the effectiveness of the LEAP intervention, a HIV status-neutral intervention designed to
address social determinants of health to reduce sexual risk behaviors, increase HIV prevention uptake (PrEP
use), and treatment outcomes (viral suppression). LEAP will harness the resources, geographic diversity, and
multidisciplinary expertise of the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV/AIDS Interventions (ATN) to provide
gender-affirming individualized HIV prevention and treatment peer support, address health-harming legal
needs, and improve educational and employment outcomes for translation into real-world practice. We propose
a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation study focused on testing the effectiveness of LEAP and
secondarily conducting a prospective implementation process evaluation. HIV risk will be assessed using a
composite indicator of risk, which is a binary HIV risk indicator of validated measures of sexual risk behavior,
as well as self-reported and biomarkers of HIV status, PrEP use, and viral suppression. We will recruit and
randomize 250 TGD youth of color from five different ATN Site Consortiums (stratified by site, HIV status, and
gender), following participants for 12 months and collecting biological (i.e., HIV status, PrEP use, or viral load)
and behavioral data. Findings will provide critical insights into the effectiveness of an urgently needed
multicomponent intervention designed to address unmet gender affirmation, legal, and economic needs to
reduce HIV inequities among TGD youth of color."
10767972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Adolescents assigned female at birth (AFAB) in the United States (US) have unmet needs for pregnancy
and HIV prevention; 75% of pregnancies in adolescents are unplanned and 12% of new HIV diagnoses occur
in youth aged 13-24 years AFAB. Sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth may have particular vulnerabilities
and yet their sexual and reproductive health needs are often overlooked or misunderstood. Multi-purpose
prevention technology (MPT) products that can simultaneously prevent pregnancy, suppress menses, and
prevent HIV are desirable, may bring efficiencies to both users and healthcare systems, and may serve to
improve uptake of HIV prevention products among youth. Early studies suggest that adolescents AFAB would
prefer an MPT that is discreet and long-lasting, with injections being a preferred delivery modality. The success
of cabotegravir (CAB) as the first generally safe and highly effective long-acting systemic agent for HIV
prevention opens up opportunities for the development of an injectable MPT that combines CAB with an
effective contraceptive, like levonorgestrel (LNG); LNG has been widely used and has an established safety
track record. CONRAD has developed a first-in-class long acting systemic MPT that consists of a
bioresorbable injectable depot and that employs a novel drug delivery technology to deliver both CAB and LNG
together for at least three months, and possibly longer. Pre-clinical studies in rats and non-human primates
show promise. To advance the development of this injectable CAB/LNG MPT our team with complementary
expertise will conduct studies to 1) assess the values and preferences for a novel MPT for pregnancy and HIV
prevention in adolescent cisgender women (CW) and transgender men (TM) AFAB aged 16-24 years in the
USA, using a combination of qualitative interviews and participatory attitudinal ranking approaches to inform
the selection of attributes and levels for a Discrete Choice Experiment to be conducted in a sample of 200 CW
and 200 TM AFAB; and 2) conduct a multi-site, phase I, single arm PK trial of the CAB/LNG injectable
biodegradable depot in a sample of 16 healthy, HIV-negative adolescents and young adults AFAB, ages 18-24,
to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of the products in CW and TM AFAB who are receiving
gender-affirming hormone therapy. Incorporation of end-user preferences for MPTs early on in product
development can enhance acceptability, optimize uptake and use, and ultimately ensure public health benefit.
The evaluation of the safety, acceptability and pharmacology of a first in-human CAB/LNG biodegradable
depot injection in CW and TM youth will ensure that data on adolescents across genders is available for
regulators should co-formulated CAB/LNG move forward for licensure. The availability of a highly effective,
long-acting MPT that places a premium on safety and acceptability in adolescents AFAB across genders, has
the potential to accelerate access to effective sexual and reproductive health, to potentially address disparities
in health access for SGM populations, and to have a substantial impact on the HIV epidemic."
10831386,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality that is incompletely understood and
lacking effective treatment. Accumulation of senescent cells (SnCs) has recently been implicated in AD
pathogenesis and targeted removal of these cells may offer new therapeutic avenues. Cellular senescence is a
cell fate defined by stable proliferative arrest, apoptotic resistance, and production of a pro-inflammatory
secretome. Though senescence programming can contribute to proper development and regenerative
processes, its dysregulation is increasingly linked with disease burden and pathology, including AD. While SnC
modulation and clearance is a promising therapeutic target, it is increasingly clear that these cells are highly
heterogeneous in their characteristics and function. We recently developed a mouse model to characterize a
unique population of SnCs that highly express the cell cycle blockade protein p21 (p21high cells) and
demonstrated that these cells play a causal role in age related physical dysfunction and metabolic disease.
Furthermore, other literature has implicated clearance of pan-SnCs, which include p21high subpopulations, with
cognitive improvements in AD. However, it is unknown if p21high cells make distinct contributions to AD or if their
targeted removal can further counteract AD pathology. Therefore, this proposal aims to investigate the specific
contributions of p21high SnCs to AD. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that p21high cells accumulate in
the brain of mouse AD models featuring amyloid- β plaque. However, it is unknown when these cells begin to
accumulate in relation to the underlying disease process and what cell types are undergoing senescence.
Therefore, in Aim 1, we will define the precise timeline of p21high cell accumulation in relation to amyloid- β plaque
deposition (1A) and determine what cell types these represent (1B) by tracking these cells with a transgenic
fluorescence reporter system and immunohistochemistry. To understand if these p21high SnCs play a causal role
in AD, in Aim 2 we propose to selectively eliminate these cells via an inducible suicide gene to determine if
targeted removal of these cells can either prevent (2A) or alleviate (2B) AD associated amyloid- β plaque
formation and impaired performance on cognitive assays. We will also conduct single nuclei RNA sequencing
(2C) on brains with or without p21high cell elimination to assess for changes in AD associated neuro-inflammatory
pathways and explore underlying disease mechanisms associated with p21high cells. These aims will help to
define the role of p21high SnCs in AD and may serve as a basis for new targeted disease modulating therapy.
Furthermore, these results will further implicate p21high cells in age related disease and broaden the field’s
appreciation of SnC heterogeneity. This work is part of a tailored career development plan at UConn Health that
integrates training in aging biology, computational analysis, scientific communication, mentorship, clinical
practice, and more to advance my career as a future physician-scientist that studies the drivers of aging."
10875930,"Opioid overdoses and deaths continue to increase nationally and in the Seattle area. Despite improvements in
our data infrastructure and care continuum locally, significant gaps remain. We propose to use an intensive
data to action framework to guide rapid data infrastructure, medical, opioid use disorder treatment, and
public health/harm reduction interventions. We will test the impact of these activities on the rates of opioid
overdose (fatal and non-fatal) as well as accessing medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), harm
reduction, and other services. In the exploratory R61 phase of this project, year 1, we will bring together a
targeted, multi-sectorial group of stakeholders to identify data infrastructure issues and opportunities in order to
support near real time data-driven decision-making. We will utilize Continuous Process Improvement (CPI)
tools including root cause analysis and plan-do-study-act to monitor and improve data and care delivery
system processes. Existing data systems will be used by Public Health-Seattle & King County including: EMS
medical incident report forms, mobile integrated health case management data, and King County Medical
Examiner Office data for near real time data analyses, visualization, and action planning. Initial service
planning and ongoing outcome monitoring will utilize the King County integrated data hub (e.g. jail, substance
use disorder/mental health treatment, housing services, Medicaid health care utilization). Each of these initial
activities will have specific, concrete measurable milestones that will be met before proceeding to the
next phase.
For the developmental R33 phase of this project, years 2-5, we plan to create a sub-acute stabilization
center (SASC) for people at high risk for opioid overdose, including those who have recently overdosed
and are referred and transported by EMS. Services will also be available to those who self-refer or are referred
by community agencies. The SASC will leverage the physical infrastructure and clinical expertise of Evergreen
Treatment Services, a long-time provider of MOUD and community based outreach in the Seattle area.
Research indicates that MOUD supports recovery, improves outcomes, and cuts mortality rates in half.
Providing naloxone and other harm reduction supplies in partnership with existing programs will help decrease
morbidity and mortality in the short term and may increase engagement and care utilization. The ongoing
stakeholder group will utilize the data infrastructure and CPI processes throughout the second phase of the
project to adapt services and inform an expanded cascade of care framework. The primary outcomes are to
test the impact of the stabilization center on MOUD initiation and retention, acute care utilization (EMS,
ED), morbidity, mortality, incarceration, and utilization of housing supports. We will also conduct cost
benefit analyses from a public agency perspective."
10757735,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The dissemination of antibiotic resistance and the drying-up of antibiotic discovery pipelines threaten to
increase morbidity from routine medical procedures and worsen the spread of infectious diseases. The main
objective of this project is to address the dual challenges of antibiotic resistance and discovery by (1)
pinpointing the cellular pathways involved in antibiotic-induced bacterial cell death and (2) leveraging these
mechanistic data to discover and develop novel structural classes of antibiotics from chemical libraries of >11
million compounds. The working hypothesis is that antibiotic mechanisms of action (MoAs) manifest through
physical changes to cellular structures, and that approaches to antibiotic discovery which integrate this MoA
information can more reliably discover novel classes of antibiotics than current discovery pipelines. This
hypothesis will be tested in two specific aims: (1) develop novel methods of probing and perturbing antibiotic
lethality at the single-cell level (Years 1 to 4) and (2) develop a computational platform for deep learning
classes of new antibiotics which exploits the mechanisms of action of known antibiotics (Years 2 to 5). During
the first phase of this award, microfluidic, optical, and fluorescence microscopy will be used to record changes
to physical properties of cytoplasmic and cell envelope components in Escherichia coli cells treated with
various bactericidal antibiotics. Additional targeted experiments based on chemical perturbations, physical
perturbations, and genetic overexpression and knockout will inform physical and mathematical models, based
on multiscale continuum mechanics, that classify the phenotypes associated with antibiotic-induced cell death.
During the second phase of this award, a deep learning platform which predicts both antibiotic leads and their
predicted MoAs in silico will be developed. This mechanism-guided approach will be used to identify antibiotic
leads and their MoAs from vast chemical spaces, and leads will be experimentally validated in vitro against
laboratory strains and multidrug-resistant clinical isolates. Leads will be further investigated using human cell
cytotoxicity, hit-to-lead, pharmacokinetic, and in vivo mouse bacterial infection experiments.
A better understanding of antibiotic MoAs and the development of novel drug discovery efforts with detailed
mechanistic underpinnings fit NIH’s public health mission and have direct implications for the prevention and
treatment of infectious diseases. This work will establish a quantitative, model-guided platform for better
characterizing and discovering antibiotics, one which promises to offer a fertile source of mechanistic
information and chemical diversity. By providing the applicant the opportunity to develop his research career,
acquire new wet-lab experimental skills, undertake translational coursework, and receive mentorship from
leading experts in antibiotics, machine learning, biotechnology, and infectious diseases at MIT, the support and
training provided by this award will enable the applicant’s development as an independent researcher."
10770530,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex autoimmune disease resulting from immune-mediated destruction of
pancreatic beta-cells within the islets of Langerhans. Unfortunately, gaps in our understanding exist on the exact
mechanisms triggering the initial break of immune tolerance in T1D that leads to beta-cell loss. Increasing lines
of evidence support posttranslational modifications (PTM) as a key mechanism in production of beta-cell-specific
neoantigens and neoepitopes that may play a prominent role in triggering T1D. Beta cell neoepitopes, despite
being significant, have not been experimentally confirmed in situ; thereby highlighting the importance of their
discovery and characterization in the islets of at-risk individuals as early triggers. The overall objectives of this
application are to achieve a broad discovery of in situ islet PTM as potential neoepitope candidates through
direct characterization of pancreatic islets from at-risk and recent-onset T1D donors by ultrasensitive proteomics.
Novel beta cell neoepitopes will be functionally validated using allele-specific binding predictions and neoepitope-
reactive T cell characterization from patient samples. Our hypothesis is that inflammation in the islet
microenvironment leads to the production of neoepitopes through PTM of beta cell proteins, which exhibit favored
loading into disease-predisposing HLA molecules in at-risk individuals. To discover and validate such in situ PTM
neoepitopes, we pursue an innovative strategy consisting of three main aims: 1) in situ PTM discovery by
ultrasensitive proteomics; 2) allele-specific HLA binding prediction, affinity analysis, and production of stable HLA
complex tetramers; and 3) characterization of neoepitope T-cell reactivity and specificities using essential T1D
patient samples and determine if these specificities can serve as biomarkers of T1D. Specifically, in Aim 1 we
pursue in situ PTM discovery, which is enabled by our recently developed nanoPOTS (Nanodroplet Processing
in One-pot for Trace Samples) technology for single islet proteomics and deep proteome profiling. The
achievable deep coverage allows the direct identification of different PTMs (e.g., phosphorylation, deamidation,
citrullination, oxidation, etc.). In Aim 2, we focus on PTM-neopeptide/HLA binding prediction and affinity
confirmation of promising candidates and generate stable HLA tetramers with synthetic PTM-neopeptides for
identifying specific reactive T cells. In Aim 3, we will identify PTM-neoepitope reactive T-cells in patient tissues,
confirm the neoepitope T cell reactivity and specificities, reconstruct the human T cell receptor (TCR) alpha/beta
sequences in primary T cells, and further validate the T-cell specificities as biomarkers for T1D.
Statement of Impact: We anticipate the overall project will not only establish a first-of-its-kind patient islet
database resource potential islet neoepitopes, but also confirm novel functional in situ neoepitopes from human
patients, identify novel biomarkers, and provide important mechanistic insights into the initiation of T1D and
potential prevention strategies for at-risk individuals."
10588857,"The incidence of malignant melanoma is increasing steadily for the past three decades and it is among the
leading causes of new cancer diagnoses in the US. Despite recent advances in targeted chemotherapy and
immunotherapy for treatment of melanoma, there are no durable treatments for this cancer. Cutaneous
melanoma can often be cured if diagnosed at early stages as a primary lesion in the skin. Survival rates decrease
dramatically with diagnosis of increasing stage (Stage II and III) primary cancer. Even within a given stage of the
early stage cancer, the survival rates are highly variable. Although majority of melanomas are diagnosed early
and excised when presented in the skin, a significant number of patients diagnosed with early invasive skin
lesions die from melanoma. Concerted efforts to identify and validate tissue-based biomarkers for prognosis
have yielded mixed results. There is a need to better define prognostic markers that can reliably identify patients
to assess, monitor and manage their risk of developing lethal metastatic disease.
 Circulating tumor cells (CTC) and/or tumor cell-derived macromolecules in peripheral blood are now
considered reliable indicators of the presence of metastatic tumor. Enumerating the CTCs in patients’ blood
sample is approved by US FDA for monitoring cancer before, during and after treatment. However, detection of
the rare CTC in the blood before the appearance of metastatic disease remains a challenge due to the low
sensitivity and lack of specificity of the currently available methods of CTC detection. We have developed a
highly sensitive and specific biosensor to detect melanoma cells based on their cell surface proteins. This
biosensor is readily adaptable to a multiplexed microfluidic device for sequential or parallel capture, detection
and isolation of melanoma CTC based on melanoma-specific cell surface protein biomarkers.
 The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a sensitive and selective method to capture and
characterize CTC in patients to monitor and manage patients diagnosed with early stage melanoma. In this
project, we propose to employ a multiplexed microfluidic biosensing device to detect, enumerate, isolate and
characterize CTC in the blood of Veterans diagnosed with Stage I-III primary melanoma. The specific aims of
this project are:
Aim 1: Detection and capture of melanoma cells based on surface marker heterogeneity
 Using a panel of antibodies against melanoma cell surface antigens, we will optimize an immunosensor for
sensitive detection of primary and metastatic melanoma cells. We will employ cultured human primary and
metastatic melanoma cells spiked in normal blood and CTC in blood samples from Veterans with metastatic
melanoma.
Aim 2: Detection and characterization of CTC heterogeneity using multiplexed microfluidic immunosensor array
 We will integrate the immunosensor into a flow-through microfluidic platform for detection, capture and
isolation of CTC in blood of Veteran patients diagnosed with Stage III primary melanoma.
Aim 3: Phenotypic and molecular characterization of CTC
 We will isolate captured CTC, propagate in vitro for short time and perform molecular (RNAseq) and
biochemical (proteomic) analysis of CTC to evaluate the prognostic significance of phenotypic and molecular
features of CTC.
 The long-term goal of our studies is to understand the phenotypic and molecular characteristics
associated with the metastatic behavior of melanoma cells. The proposed research on isolation and
characterization of CTC has the potential to yield new knowledge that will impact the management of patients at
risk of developing metastatic melanoma."
10765667,"The high prevalence of obesity among the veterans is a major challenge for the VA healthcare system. This is
because obesity is associated with increased sympathetic nerve traffic leading to hypertension, a major risk
factor for end-organ damage, stroke, myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure. However, the cellular
and molecular etiology of obesity-associated cardiovascular risks remain poorly understood. We and others
have previously demonstrated the importance of the brain mechanisms in the pathophysiology of obesity-
induced sympathetic activation and hypertension. Brain action of leptin and the melanocortinergic system have
emerged as major drivers of the increase in sympathetic nerve traffic and blood pressure in obesity. Studies
from our lab also revealed the importance of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) in the
control of sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure. Moreover, we provide compelling preliminary data
demonstrating that disruption of mTORC1 signaling in the leptin receptor (LepRb)-containing neurons interfere
selectively with the ability of leptin to increase renal sympathetic activity and blood pressure. Notably,
mTORC1 disruption in the LepRb neurons protect mice from the sympathetic overdrive and hypertension
evoked by diet-induced obesity without affecting weigh gain and adiposity. Moreover, we identified serine
peptidase inhibitor A3N (SerpinA3N) as a novel gene downstream to mTORC1 signaling. This led us to
hypothesize that mTORC1 signaling and SerpinA3N in the LepRb neurons mediate obesity-induced
sympathetic nerve activation and hypertension. We will test our hypothesis by examining the transcription
mechanisms that regulate SerpinA3N gene. In addition, we will investigate the role of SerpinA3N in the control
of sympathetic nerve traffic, arterial pressure and obesity-associated hypertension and sympathetic nerve
activation. We will also dissect the neurocircuit underlying the protection conferred by disruption of mTORC1
signaling in LepRb neurons on obesity-induced hypertension and sympathetic nerve activation. This research
will advance understanding of the mechanisms underlying the sympathetic overdrive and hypertension
associated with obesity that has become common in the VA population."
10784597,"Mitochondria are at the intersection of metabolism and immunity. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear
DNA (nDNA) variants affect mitochondrial function and diseases relevant to Veterans. This project includes a
team with extensive experience studying the genetics of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and viral infectious
diseases (VID). A new collaboration is proposed to define the mitochondrial genetic associations with and
interactions between these two common and important phenotypes. The overarching hypothesis is that
mitochondrial genetic information available in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) will be associated with T2D
and VID, and will modify interactions between them. Important mechanistic connections through immune
responses (both innate and adaptive) relevant for VID and T2D pathogenesis are regulated in part by
mitochondria. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new VID that has infected >600,000 Veterans to date
and highlights the bi-directional intersection between T2D and VID. COVID-19 includes profound immune
dysregulation (particularly interferon [IFN] signaling and responses), metabolic derangements including
exacerbation of T2D, and is also made more severe by these conditions. Several mitochondria-related effects
of COVID-19 have already been reported. MVP genotyping currently contains 20 common and ~130 rare
mtDNA variants in ~650,000 Veterans and will soon include whole genome sequencing (WGS) with more
extensive mtDNA genotyping for 150,000 of these Veterans. This project will characterize, curate, and derive
information from these variants in the MVP by established and novel methods to establish a new resource
(“MitoMVP”) and perform new analyses. The following aims will enhance the understanding of mitochondria-
related VID and T2D interactions, facilitate development of new therapeutic targets, and provide a data
resource to accelerate broader mitochondria-targeted precision medicine efforts. First, MitoMVP, a curated
dataset of mitochondrial genetic information in the MVP including expanded mitochondrial genetic information
on quantity (mtDNA copy number) and quality (predicted pathogenicity) will be established. Next, mitochondrial
genetic information and nDNA genetic variants associated with T2D and VID will be identified, and genetic
interactions between them defined. Finally, phenotypic interactions between T2D and VID that influence
genetic associations will be assessed through stratified analyses focused on severe COVID-19 as a prototype.
Because T2D is a complex phenotype, information in the MVP will be used to define subgroups with T2D-
related clinical and laboratory metabolic phenotypes (e.g., obesity, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia/low HDL
cholesterol) for stratified analyses, potentially yielding new associations and important clues to mechanisms of
gene-by-environment interactions. This aim will also include mitochondrial phenome-wide association studies
(PheWAS) to identify novel genotype-phenotype associations of interest, providing additional MitoMVP
information that will be available for future studies by other MVP investigators."
10739811,"Project summary/Abstract:
Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and is the leading cause of death due to a
single bacterium. In 2020, around 10 million people developed TB worldwide and approximately 1.5 million
people died from TB. TB is curable but the treatment is toxic and long (minimum of 6 month). In the case of drug
resistant TB, the treatment lasts even longer (9 to 24 months) and the chances of patient survival are reduced.
Among the 4 first-line anti-TB drugs used to treat TB, pyrazinamide (PZA) is notorious for its poor activity against
Mtb in vitro. PZA was originally identified in a screen performed in Mtb-infected animals which explains why the
poor activity of PZA in vitro did not stop its discovery as a major anti-TB drug. The main consequence of the poor
activity of PZA in vitro is the lack of understanding of PZA mode of action which results in a reduced capacity to
fight against PZA-resistant TB. We recently established an in vitro model in which PZA displays a high
bactericidal activity against Mtb. In this application, we will validate the involvement of the genes/pathways
identified in a genetic screen to alter PZA susceptibility by constructing selected mutants and measuring their
susceptibility to PZA. Moreover, we will also isolate spontaneous PZA-resistant clones in order to identify bona
fide PZA targets and measure the frequency of resistance to PZA in our in vitro model. The PZA susceptibility
profile of the mutants generated will then be validated in a macrophage model of TB infection. In addition to the
identification of genetic determinants for PZA susceptibility, we will characterize how PZA impacts Mtb
metabolism. Using our in vitro model, we will analyze the metabolome of Mtb using metabolomics and we will
measure the impact of PZA on Mtb respiratory chain functions. Mutants with altered susceptibility to PZA will be
used in addition to wild-type Mtb to elucidate the mechanism of action of PZA. We anticipate that this project will
advance our knowledge on the mechanism of action of PZA and will help the fight against PZA-resistant TB. We
believe this study will also pave the way for the use of in vitro conditions more closely related to the infection
settings in order to improve the discovery and the study of drugs to fight against TB and other infectious diseases."
10922671,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Vaccination is an effective public health measure, yet host factors including advanced age, sex, obesity,
physical or mental health status may influence vaccine efficacy. Adjuvants improve immunogenicity to
vaccination but often result in greater side effects. As an alternative to the inclusion of adjuvants in the vaccine
formulation, evidence suggests physical exercise performed at the time of immunization may serve as an
effective non-pharmacological approach with the potential for greater impact in individuals with suboptimal
immune response and reduced reactogenicity. The effect of host factors on immune response to SARS-CoV-2
and long-term protection remains to be established, and positive findings for an adjuvant-like effect of physical
exercise would have an immediate translational impact. However, major barriers to the implementation of
exercise are inconsistent findings and a gap in the knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie such effects. Our
recent publication shows that we have identified an exercise protocol that consistently increases antibody
response to vaccines that is reproducible across several different vaccines. This finding holds the potential to
transform vaccine efficacy and address questions on the breadth and durability of immune response and
underlying mechanisms. The goals of this application are to determine the extent to which physical exercise
exhibits an adjuvant-like effect across long-term antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses to COVID-19
mRNA-based vaccines and establish the degree of immune enhancement in individuals who may have
suboptimal vaccine response due to high psychological stress. An additional goal is to identify potential operative
mechanisms, and compelling preliminary data show promise for metabolism-related mechanisms, a new
direction in this field of study. Aim 1 will identify the extent to which a single exercise session applied at the time
of initial immunization shapes the magnitude, breadth, and durability of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA
vaccine. Outcome measures are serum anti-spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) IgG titer, neutralizing
antibody, antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response measured up to one-year post-immunization. Aim 2
will determine the influence of psychological stress on antibody and antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell
immune response to SARS-CoV-2 immunization and the extent to which exercise may override any potential
effect of stress. Aim 3 will apply transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) and metabolomic (Raman) measures to identify
pathways by which exercise influences immune response to vaccination. The long-term goals of this research
direction are to refine and develop behavioral interventions that optimize immunity and more broadly apply the
findings learned with respect to critical pathways of immunogenicity to optimize vaccine development for
currently underserved populations."
10740858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria cases have recently surged, with an estimated 627,000 deaths in 2020,
mostly in young African children. Efforts to reduce the burden of disease in Africa include both chemoprevention
strategies to protect vulnerable populations and treatment of symptomatic infections with effective artemisinin-
based combination therapies. Clinical studies have identified piperaquine (PPQ) as an ideal chemoprevention
and treatment partner drug due to its potency against asexual blood stage parasites, long plasma half-life, and
good safety profile in children and pregnant women. However, both drugs in the first-line combination of
dihydroartemisinin-PPQ have encountered widespread resistance in Southeast Asia. Given the recent
emergence in Rwanda and Uganda of artemisinin-resistant Pf parasites, there is a pressing need to investigate
whether PPQ resistance can emerge and spread in Africa, identify its genetic mediators, and develop new ways
to neutralize resistance. In Aim 1, our studies will focus on novel mutations that emerged on the background of
chloroquine-resistant isoforms of the Pf chloroquine resistance transporter PfCRT, as well as the amplification
of plasmepsins 2 and 3 (pm2/3), both of which contribute to PPQ resistance and treatment failure in Southeast
Asia. Using gene editing and overexpression approaches, we will determine whether PPQ resistance can be
generated in African lines by introducing individual mutations into African-specific PfCRT isoforms and assessing
whether increased pm2/3 copy numbers augment resistance. We will also assess whether pm2/3 amplifications
afford a fitness benefit to PfCRT mutant parasites, which could help establish and maintain PPQ resistance in
high-transmission African settings. In Aim 2, we will examine the role of inhibition of heme detoxification and
concentration-dependent drug efflux in PPQ action and resistance, respectively. Our studies will also test the
hypothesis that PPQ-resistant PfCRT isoforms perturb intracellular hemoglobin-derived peptide levels, which
may be corrected by pm2/3 amplification. In Aim 3, we propose that directly targeting PfCRT-mediated
resistance represents a high-value approach to retaining PPQ efficacy. Leveraging insights regarding opposing
selective pressures, we will test whether combining PPQ with other quinoline-based drugs (chloroquine,
amodiaquine or mefloquine) can eliminate PPQ-resistant parasites and prevent the recrudescence of resistant
variants. We will also screen for inhibitors that reverse resistance by blocking PPQ efflux via mutant PfCRT.
Assays will include ZY19489, an antimalarial in human clinical trials that inhibits PfCRT-mediated drug efflux and
hypersensitizes Pf parasites to PPQ. Concurrently, we will conduct a high-throughput screen designed to identify
novel PPQ resistance reversal agents. This proposal, which aligns with NIAID’s priority of supporting research
on antimicrobial drug resistance, is designed to proactively predict the emergence of PPQ resistance in Africa
and to identify inhibitors that can neutralize resistance and help sustain the clinical efficacy of this essential drug."

10818419,"Skeletal Muscle Molecular Drug Targets for Exercise-induced Cardiometabolic Health
 The health benefits of exercise training are substantial, summarized in the Physical Activity Guidelines
Advisory Committee Report, and incorporated into the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans in both 2008
and 2018. Understanding the mechanisms whereby exercise mediates its effects will have two major benefits.
It will promote an understanding how to tailor exercise programs to an individual’s specific clinical needs—
personalized lifestyle medicine. Also, it will provide critical information for the development of new therapeutics
for the myriad of health conditions exercise treats so well. It is likely that exercise—like many environmental
bodily exposures—induces epigenetic modifications directing gene expression, protein expression and
metabolic responses in target organs whereby exercise mediates its effects. Adaptations in skeletal muscle to
exercise training mediate many of the health benefits of exercise. However, how these beneficial effects are
mediated are little understood. It is the purpose of this project to understand these processes in three human
STRRIDE cohorts containing a broad range of seven different exercise exposures—and inactive control—with
extensive clinical, physiologic data paired with a biorepository of blood and skeletal muscle samples. The
hypothesis driving this work is that epigenetic modifications in skeletal muscle—serves a mediator and
integrator over time— DNA chromatin methylation—drives a major biological program mediating improvement
in cardiometabolic health in humans undergoing exercise training. Our work will be conducted in three specific
aims. 1) Determine the time course of the effects of exercise training and subsequent detraining on the
human skeletal muscle epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome. This will be approached
through classical associative modeling. Although we know that some DNA methylation targets and
downstream molecular signaling are responsive to a single bout of exercise, we do not know how long these
modifications persist; how they might integrate responses of single exercise bouts, and how they are related to
other downstream molecular targets at the epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome levels. 2)
Determine the specific and differential effects of exercise amount (dose), intensity and mode on the
human skeletal muscle methylome and downstream molecular signaling pathways on important
physiologic and clinical outcomes. In order to understand the pathways mediating exercise effects on
human health, it is important to relate the specific effects of exercise characteristics on molecular determinants
of exercise responsiveness with a focus on dose-response relationships. This aim will be approached through
a team-science approach involving causal modeling and regulatory circuits and known regulatory networks—stable
dynamic networks—consistent with the known literature generation. 3) Determine and test putative drug targets
mimicking exercise effects in an in vitro system. We will test regulatory nodes by manipulating candidate
regulatory pathways in our muscle organ-on-chip microphysiological system. At the end of this work we will
understand better how exercise has its salutary effects on human health and how this knowledge may be used
to develop both individualized exercise programs targeting an individual’s health goals, and an understanding
of the cellular molecular physiology at a level leading to new therapeutic drug targets."
10894614,"Abstract
One of the most important organizing principles in all life forms is the uninterrupted flow of electrons through
reactions that involve reduction-oxidation (redox) changes. Not surprisingly, an imbalance in this fundamental
cellular process, i.e. redox homeostasis, has been attributed to numerous diseases, including mitochondrial
disorders, cancer, diabetes, neurodegeneration and the aging process itself. The redox cofactors, NADH and
NADPH, and their oxidized forms are key contributors to the cellular redox environment, but it is unclear whether
perturbations in their metabolism contribute directly to disease etiology or is simply a reflection of ongoing
pathology. For most of these conditions, it is not known whether the observed redox imbalance is linked to
altered bioenergetic efficiency or to a cellular process that is neither linked to ATP production nor to
maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Another major challenge is that some of these redox
reactions are redundant, i.e. have overlapping substrate dependency (towards NAD(P)H) or are found in
more than one cellular compartment. To systematically address these pressing questions, methodology to
modulate the steady-state concentrations of the NADH and NADPH cofactors is needed. Recently, we have
developed genetically encoded tools to selectively decrease the NADH/NAD+ and NADPH/NADP+ ratios in
live cells that are based on the heterologous expression of native or engineered versions of bacterial H 2O-
forming NAD(P)H oxidases. In this proposal, we plan to expand our toolkit by developing a genetically
encoded tool for the direct modulation of NADH reductive stress (i.e. increased NADH/NAD+ ratio) (Project
1). Preliminary screening of several bacterial enzymes has furnished promising candidates for driving NADH
overproduction in different cellular compartments. The development of compartment-specific tools will enable
studies to elucidate how overproduction of reducing equivalents in one cellular compartment is communicated
to another and how NADH reductive stress remodels cellular metabolism (Project 2a). Multiple lines of
evidence indicate that NAD(P)H-consuming redox cycling agents at low concentrations mildly exhaust
antioxidant systems and that the resulting pro-oxidative shift promotes stress resistance and improves heathspan
in several model organisms. We are using Drosophila as a model organism, to directly test whether redox
modulation in either the oxidative or reductive direction are correlated with stress resistance, healthspan and
lifespan (Project 2b). A third goal is to develop variants of our genetically encoded tools that are controlled by
small molecules or by light to afford greater spatiotemporal control (Project 3). The latter is especially
important as many redox processes crucial for redox signaling or energy metabolism and dysregulated in
pathologies, occur rapidly (on an acute time scale). The successful completion of our studies will lead to
enabling technologies for modulating the redox environment, which will be widely useful for metabolic studies on
an acute or chronic time scale at the resolution of subcellular compartments."
10802201,"Project Summary
This application, “Discovery of PSD95 protein-protein interaction inhibitors as novel non-opioid analgesics”,
addresses the critical need for more effective medications to treat chronic neuropathic pain. Pain is responsible
for more encounters with the health care system than any other single cause, yet treatment options for
neuropathic pain have limited efficacy and carry a high risk for side effects, including opioid addiction. These
factors add an additional $560-635 billion annually to an already strained United States health care system.
Glutamate activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediates central nervous system (CNS)
sensitization, which is implicated in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. NMDA-mediated
central sensitization depends on formation of a multi-protein cascade complex at the receptor consisting of the
NMDA receptor bound to the scaffolding protein, postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), and recruitment of
neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). By bringing these proteins close together, multiple signaling cascades
are activated leading to neural network reorganization (plasticity) and neuronal cell death. Small molecules and
cell penetrating peptides that disrupt this complex act as effective analgesics in preclinical animal models with
better side effect profiles than non-selective NMDA receptor antagonists and NOS inhibitors. Our team, the first
to publish a small molecule targeting this complex, IC87201, demonstrated its efficacy in preclinical pain models.
A similar small molecule, ZL006, is effective in preclinical stroke models. We designed and synthesized a unique
and novel set of IC87201 and ZL006 analogs, advancing one molecule into IND-enabling studies for post-
traumatic stress disorder. After identifying concerns with the candidate molecule, we systematically redesigned
it resulting in a new set of molecules. Further funding is needed to improve on these molecules prior to advancing
them toward new IND-enabling studies. Importantly, advanced toxicology studies with the candidate molecule
suggest a low risk of target specific side effects and predict an excellent therapeutic index for compounds with
acceptable activity and drug-like properties. In this SBIR Phase I/II fast track application, Anagin, in concert with
our collaborators and the Blueprint Neurotherapeutics Network, will design and test molecules for improved drug-
like properties, confirm target engagement in in vitro and ex vivo assays, demonstrate efficacy in preclinical pain
models and establish a therapeutic margin using behavioral models. We will advance a new clinical candidate
molecule through IND-enabling studies. Compounds that do not meet our set criteria will not be advanced. At
the conclusion of these studies, we will have a new clinical candidate thoroughly interrogated and poised for
testing in clinical trials for chronic pain. Data summarized in this proposal strongly suggests that our approach
will yield effective analgesics with better therapeutic indices than other compounds in development or the clinic.
These compounds are likely to be useful in many other glutamate-driven CNS diseases."

 During pregnancy, viral infections in the mother may have catastrophic effects on her health, or on the
viability of the developing fetus. Recently, emerging pathogen outbreaks such as those involving Zika Virus
(ZIKV), SARS-CoV-2 or Ebola Virus (EBOV) have highlighted how understudied the role of the placenta is in
transmission of viral infections. This project specifically focuses on the cell tropism of EBOV during pregnancy.
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is caused by infection with EBOV or other members within the Ebolavirus genus.
During pregnancy, EVD results in loss of ~100% of fetuses or neonates with or without the additional loss of
the mother. Anecdotal data from EBOV outbreaks in Africa suggest that EBOV directly infects placental
tissues, thus transmitting virus to the fetal compartment, but rigorous experimental evaluation of placental
infection has not been performed; the tropism of EBOV for placental cells, mechanisms of cellular entry, and
route of infection from mother to fetus are currently unknown. Aim 1 will examine tropism of EBOV in placental
tissues. Further, as EBOV has been shown to bind to and internalize into many cell types via interactions with
phosphatidylserine (PS) receptors, Aim 2 studies will evaluate the role of three PS receptors on EBOV
infection of the placenta and fetus. These studies will be performed using two low containment EBOV model
viruses, rVSV-EBOV-GP-GFP and EBOV ΔVP30, that have been used extensively to understand filovirus
tropism and receptor usage. The knowledge gained from these rigorously designed studies will elucidate cell
populations within the placenta infected and important for fetal transmission as a first step toward
understanding the catastrophic pathogenesis of EVD in pregnancy. Additionally, this work will provide insights
for the development of therapeutic treatment options to improve the maternal and fetal outcomes of EVD.
 The experiences, techniques, mentoring, and concepts in this proposal were specifically tailored to Ms.
Hanora Van Ert and her training goals. As a developing researcher passionate about improving the health and
wellbeing of pregnant women, Ms. Van Ert is currently completing her studies in the MSTP at University of
Iowa under the scientific mentorship of Dr. Wendy Maury and Dr. Mark Santillan receiving individualized

Current estimates suggest that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacts 1 in 44 children in the United States.
Many young children with ASD demonstrate language delays, which are often the first area of concern noted by
their parents. Young children with ASD show markedly different word learning profiles than their neurotypical
(NT) peers, characterized primarily by atypical or delayed use of word learning mechanisms. We currently have
an incomplete understanding of these differences. Discerning the mechanisms that underlie language learning
deficits in ASD will afford greater success in alleviating these difficulties and supporting language learning in this
population. One theoretical account, a predictive impairment in autism (PIA) hypothesis, has shown promise for
explaining some phenotypic characteristics of ASD (i.e., difficulty making social predictions). The utility of this
theoretical framework for explaining difficulty with language learning, however, remains largely unclear. Autistic
children show intact statistical word learning abilities on experimental tasks. However, given that children learn
words in their natural, often unpredictable environments, difficulty tracking unpredictable stimuli might have
profound impacts on autistic children’s word learning. The overall objective of the proposed project is to
determine how established, domain-general difficulties with prediction in ASD might impact novel word learning.
This project will employ established eyegaze methodology to test the impact of predictable and unpredictable
presentations on word learning in this population. The central hypothesis is that unpredictable contexts during
training will disproportionately disrupt word learning in children with ASD and result in disproportionate detriments
to the retention and generalization of object-label pairings. Preliminary data suggest that autistic children are
disproportionately disrupted by unpredictable input in a fast-mapping task. Guided by the PIA hypothesis and
this strong preliminary data, the proposed project will address three specific aims. Specific Aim I will characterize
the impact of predictable and unpredictable presentations of novel-word object pairings on initial word learning
(fast-mapping) in autistic toddlers compared to cognitively matched NT peers. Specific Aim II will investigate the
impact of predictability during initial learning on autistic toddlers’ retention and generalization of word-object
pairings over a short (5-minute) delay, compared to NT peers. Specific Aim III will evaluate the extent to which
child characteristics (e.g., language and cognitive abilities) predict individual variability in word learning
performance following predictable and unpredictable input in autistic children. The proposed project will be the
first to apply established eyegaze methodology to test this theoretical framework and its application to initial word
learning, retention, and generalization in this population. The proposed project’s significance is that it will
advance theories of autism and our understanding of language learning in this population. The proposed project’s
impact is that findings will inform best practices and novel treatment strategies that allow for optimal language
learning for autistic children."

Despite the diversity of racial and ethnic groups in the US population, there is a marked lack of diversity
amongst research scientists. This is progressively more apparent moving further along stages of training and
of the profession, from undergraduate through graduate research to faculty. This is likely because in research,
as in many other professions, it is invaluable to have immersive early experience in the field to give individuals
the skills and self-confidence to succeed. Talented individuals without access to such experience are in effect
left out. We propose a comprehensive two-year post-baccalaureate (‘postbac’) program: Columbia Access to
Doctoral REadiness (CADRE) to address this lack of timely research experience. It is aimed at recent college
graduates of high potential who are interested in pursuing a research career in neuroscience but lacked
research opportunities as undergraduates. The core of CADRE is a two-year research project advised by
selected mentors within the Doctoral Program in Neurobiology and Behavior (NB&B) at Columbia University.
Postbacs will choose a lab from a range of neuroscience areas including behavioral and systems
neuroscience, cellular, molecular and developmental neuroscience, computational neuroscience, human
cognitive studies, and the neurobiology of neurological diseases. They will be supervised by engaged and
enthusiastic mentors chosen for their mentoring track record and skills, as well by a graduate student ‘buddy’ in
the lab. Importantly, the postbac will be fully integrated into the lab like other NB&B graduate students at the
same stage of training, attending lab meetings and journal clubs, discussing data and experimental design,
and participating in lab social life. This will give the postbac an immersive hands-on experience of starting a
research career. The postbac’s research project will also be complemented with coursework to strengthen their
academic foundations. In addition, throughout the program, postbacs will attend seminars, lectures, and other
educational events around Columbia University. In a step that is equally as important as the research
experience, postbacs engage in events that foster networking and professionalism. Activities will include: 1) a
professional development series addressing topics such as applying to research-focused graduate programs,
professional writing and presentation skills, maintaining work/life balance, and assessing mentorship styles; 2)
a career awareness series: “What you can be with a PhD?” 3) social and cultural activities around New York
City, and get-togethers with students; and 4) professional events during the academic year such as traveling to
two national scientific conferences, one in their first and one in their second year. We will evaluate the
effectiveness of the program with a starting, a midpoint and an exit survey through the course of the two-year
postbac. We will also gather long-term feedback from alumni."

Most eukaryotic messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) must undergo extensive co-
transcriptional processing in the nucleus before they can be exported to the cytoplasm
and function as mRNAs. The processing events include 5¢-end capping, splicing, and 3¢-
end cleavage and polyadenylation. The 3’-end processing of most pre-mRNAs requires
a large number of protein factors for its execution, including cleavage and
polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), cleavage
factors I and II, and poly(A) polymerase (PAP). The 3’-end processing machinery in
yeast has similarity to that in mammals, although there are also significant differences.
Replication-dependent histone pre-mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop near their 3¢-
end and employ a distinct machinery for its processing, although it shares some key
protein factors with the canonical pre-mRNA 3¢-end processing machinery.
mRNA 5¢-end capping occurs early during transcription by RNA polymerase II, and it
was generally believed that capping always proceeds to completion. We discovered
earlier that the DXO/Rai1 family of proteins are part of a mRNA capping quality
surveillance mechanism. They can possess RNA 5¢-end pyrophosphohydrolase (PPH)
and decapping activities, and help remove incompletely capped mRNAs from cells.
Despite the extensive studies on these mRNA processing and quality control factors,
significant gaps remain in our knowledge on their molecular mechanisms of action.
During the previous funding period, we determined the structure by cryo-EM of an active,
fully-reconstituted human histone pre-mRNA 3¢-end processing machinery, the first
structure of an active processing machinery. We have also shown that the DXO/Rai1
and Nudix family of enzymes can remove nucleotide metabolite caps on RNAs, such as
NAD (deNADding), FAD (deFADding) and dephospho-CoA (deCoAping). These
successes provide an excellent foundation for the proposed project.
Our main goals for the current funding period are to produce new structural information
on pre-mRNA and snRNA 3¢-end processing machineries, and to understand the
molecular basis for the diverse decapping activities of the DXO/Rai1 and Nudix
enzymes. We will carry out structural studies on the protein factors and their complexes
by both cryo-EM and crystallography, and assess the structural observations by careful
biochemical and functional experiments. The proposed project will greatly enhance our
understanding of these important events in the mRNA lifecycle."
10612806,"SUMMARY: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in approximately 5% of clinically recognized pregnancy
losses. The etiology of RPL is not well characterized: after excluding the known etiologies, approximately half
of women with RPL still have no identifiable cause. The fact that RPL is, in fact, recurrent suggests a strong
genetic component, however there is currently a very limited understanding of the genomic contributions to
RPL. Previous studies are typically deficient in their design, limited by small sample size, incomplete clinical
phenotyping and/or the recruitment of singletons only. In this proposal, we put forward our plan to recruit 1000
rigorously-phenotyped RPL trios including from diverse and underrepresented backgrounds across the US and
to apply WGS and sophisticated variant detection and interpretation methods developed by our labs to identify
pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for RPL. We will then perform comprehensive integrative data
analyses to define the genetic basis of unexplained RPL and map the genes and regions of the chromosome
that are absolutely required for human development and a successful pregnancy. Our variant interpretation
pipeline includes cutting edge approaches to map likely pathogenic noncoding and structural variants rarely
assessed in any pregnancy loss study. We will also perform a pilot RNA-seq study to assess the utility of this
approach for gene discovery in the pregnancy loss setting. We will first look for recessive pathogenic variation,
including compound heterozygosity and then test for models for de novo mosaicism, mitochondrial mutations,
regulatory noncoding variation and overall mutational burden. From these combined analyses, we expect to
uncover many variants in genes and regions of the chromosome that are intolerable to functional variation,
which we define as the human intolerome. We will build on our previous studies to map the intolerome by
combining i) available data from all clinical studies to define the genetic etiology of unexplained pregnancy
loss, including data generated in this proposal and in our prior work, ii) network-based approaches to prioritize
variants genes important for human development and pregnancy, iii) mouse (KOMP, DMDD/MGI) and cell line
knockout studies iv) rare and common disease sequencing studies including Centers for Mendelian Genomics
(CMG), Center for Common Disease Genomics (CCDG) and Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC),
iv) emerging human pangenome studies HPP, and v) population-scale biobank projects such as UK BioBank
and All of Us. We will then confirm these predictions via collaborator-led functional studies and retrospective
analyses of RPL first losses, siblings and grandparents. The sharing of early, unpublished data from the Yale
CMG and HPP enabled by our leadership in these projects is a significant strength of what will be by far the
largest and most comprehensive study of RPL performed to date. Our findings will take great strides towards
the goal of comprehensively mapping the human intolerome and will further expand and refine the exploratory
space in which to investigate the genes and chromosomal regions essential for human development."
10747417,"About half of US children experience significant sleep issues, according to the American Academy of
Pediatrics. Sleep health is critically important to a child’s overall health, including physical, cognitive, and
behavioral development. Further, sleep characteristics in childhood can persist into adolescence and then
adulthood. It is possible that sleep health may be affected or programmed by factors experienced in utero.
Fetal development is sensitive to common environmental chemicals like perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
which are highly prevalent among US mothers. PFAS are endocrine disruptors, meaning they can disrupt the
body’s normal hormonal processes, crucial to the healthy development of the fetus. It is clear that chemical
exposures in pregnant mothers can lead to health problems for their infants that continue into childhood and
adolescence. Further, assessments of PFAS-related health outcomes using a mixtures approach are being
called for by regulators, given that typical human exposure involves complex combinations of PFAS. In
addition, preliminary IKIDS findings indicate a sex-specific association between certain PFAS and sleep
disturbance, where boys’ sleep was more affected by PFAS exposure during pregnancy than girls for two
specific PFAS in our current sample. The proposed project would use novel statistical methods to assess
associations between PFAS exposure during the prenatal period and child sleep quality longitudinally across
early childhood, using multiple measures of sleep. PFAS are measured in maternal blood collected at 16-18
weeks’ gestation, and sleep outcomes in young children are measured with three validated parent-report
measures capturing different aspects of sleep—disturbance, impairment and sleep problems. We propose to
leverage existing data from a prospective cohort of pregnant women and their children based in central Illinois,
known as the Illinois Kids Development Study, or IKIDS. Specifically, we will assess the longitudinal effects of
prenatal exposure to 12 perfluoroalkyl substances on sleep problems at ages 2, 3, and 4 (aim 1), as well as
PFAS mixtures on sleep disturbance, and impairment at age 4 alone (aim 2). Sleep disturbance and sleep
impairment are parent-report Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)
measures and sleep problems is one of the syndrome scales of the preschool Child Behavior Checklist. Child
Prenatal PFAS exposure has been shown to be associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes in children, yet
there is no literature pertaining to prenatal PFAS effects on sleep quality during early childhood. Both PFAS
and child sleep problems are highly prevalent, and preliminary findings show that PFAS exposure in utero may
be responsible for some portion of the attributable risk of sleep problems in children. Yet, the area remains
vastly understudied. Given that sleep is so crucial to a child’s overall health and development, identifying
prevalent and persistent environmental factors that influence sleep health could have a substantial public
health impact."
10775761,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is a chronic pain subtype that affects multiple body sites, and is strongly
associated with poor function and disability. Although CWP is highly prevalent in adults with obesity, CWP
outcomes are disproportionately worse in non-Hispanic Black (NH Black) and Hispanic/Latino/a/x adults. Thus,
the obesity-related health disparity in CWP could augment existing racial and ethnic pain disparities in these
populations. Bariatric surgery is often prescribed to treat obesity and musculoskeletal pain comorbidities.
However, there is significant variability in weight loss and pain trajectories after bariatric surgery. Moreover, many
patients experience recurrent or unresolved pain after bariatric surgery that can inhibit weight loss or facilitate
weight regain. There are critical gaps in our knowledge of the primary driver(s) of CWP outcomes and how
driver(s) of CWP respond to weight loss, particularly in racial and ethnically diverse groups. As such, the main
objective of the proposed mentored project for the Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development
Award (K23) is to fill these knowledge gaps by: 1) comprehensively characterizing pain at rest and movement-
evoked pain (MEP) in NH Black and Hispanic/Latino/a/x adults after bariatric surgery, and 2) identifying potential
key driver(s) of intra-group variability in the resolution or maintenance of pain after bariatric surgery. We will
focus on pain sensitivity, joint motion and mechanical loading biosignatures, and psychosocial factors. The aims
proposed in this K23 application feature highly innovative methods that synergize mechanism-based pain
phenotyping with obesity and health disparities research approaches. The methodologies employed represent a
substantive departure from static, self-reported pain assessment to the integration of rigorous assessment and
measurement multiple dimensions of pain at rest and MEP using precise quantification of nociceptive processing
and joint motion and loading biosignatures in ethnically diverse populations. For the K23, I have assembled a
strong interdisciplinary and multicultural cadre of highly successful clinical, basic, and translational scientists who
have a strong and demonstrable commitment to the successful implementation and completion of my career
development plan and research project milestones. The primary training goals that are the linchpin of my
research training and career development are: 1) developing expertise in the integration of weight loss and
lifestyle change evaluations with pain phenotyping data, 2) to develop and implement clinical trial designs that
identify and address pain disparities, and 3) to enhance training in advanced statistical methods to inform clinical
trial design to examine pain disparities. New York University (NYU) and the University of Florida are very strong
incubators of pain, obesity, and rehabilitation research. Furthermore, these institutions are robust research
environments that have the resources available to me to build on my previous training to foster independence in
research that is focused on improving pain management in racially and ethnically diverse adults with obesity."
10738303,"This application is for a renewal of my K24 Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research
(POR) on Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) Infections. I, Dr. William Geisler, am a federally-funded physician
scientist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) with expertise in CT infections and significant
mentoring experience. During the initial K24 period, I obtained new funding (R01 renewal, a new R01, a new
R21, etc.), expanded my POR program in new directions, had 35 publications, became UAB Assistant Dean
for Physician Scientist Development, and mentored 16 early stage investigators who had many successes
(awards included a K08, KL2, TL1, an F30, an F31-D, etc.). The protected time afforded by this K24 renewal
would enable me to: 1) broaden my mentoring knowledge and develop new research skills, 2) continue
providing POR mentoring to early stage investigators, and 3) expand my research program in new directions.
Despite current CT prevention and control efforts, CT infection rates continue to rise and CT remains the most
prevalent bacterial STI worldwide, one with significant disparities in women and African Americans and
associated with reproductive morbidity. A CT vaccine is urgently needed. However, a better understanding of
immunogenetic determinants that impact CT infection risk and which CT antigens are most immunogenic and
induce protective immunity to CT is needed to advance vaccine development; My Current POR is focused on
this need (2R01AI093692 and 1R01AI148359). CT vaccine availability does not ensure it will be utilized.
Lessons learned from HPV vaccine implementation have taught us that psychosocial and behavioral factors
influence STI vaccine acceptability and studies on factors impacting CT vaccine acceptability are needed.
 In this K24 renewal, I plan to broaden my mentoring knowledge through didactic and interactive
experiences, develop new research skills in entrepreneurship and research commercialization through didactic
and experiential training under mentorship, and continue mentoring early stage investigators in POR. Mentees
will be provided with educational and research experiences tailored to their career stage and interests.
Mentoring will be on my Current CT immunogenetics POR (noted above and discussed in detail in this
application) and on two new POR studies suported by this K24 renewal award that will expand my CT POR
program. New Study 1 aims to determine if HLA-DQB1*06 and CT-specific CD4+ IFN-g can be useful
biomarkers for predicting incident CT infection; I previously found that DQB1*06 was a risk marker and CD4+
IFN-g a protective marker for CT reinfection. Findings can be used to guide CT testing frequency in women
based on incident CT infection risk determined by the biomarkers. New Study 2 seeks to identify enabling and
limiting factors that affect acceptability of a CT vaccine through surveys and qualitative interviews to aid in
designing strategies to increase CT vaccine uptake. The long-term goal of my POR is to improve prevention
and control of CT infection. Thus, knowledge from Current POR and new studies addresses this goal."
10764282,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cascade of pathological changes involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) starts many years before AD
diagnosis, suggesting that intervening with still-healthy adults will be most successful. According to the
influential amyloid hypothesis, an imbalance between β-amyloid (Αβ) production and clearance initiates
changes that lead to AD. This hypothesis suggests that early intervention targeting Αβ levels should be
particularly effective in preventing AD, but the field has yet to test this core prediction of the hypothesis. A
major obstacle is the lack of safe and low-cost interventions that reduce Αβ. Initial findings (N = 108) from our
recently completed heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback clinical trial indicate that daily sessions attempting
to increase (via resonance-frequency breathing) vs. decrease (via personalized strategies) heart rate
oscillations have significant opposing outcomes on plasma Αβ levels. Resonance-frequency breathing reduced
overall plasma Αβ levels in both younger and older adults, and, among adults aged 55-70, increased
Αβ42/Αβ40 ratios, a biomarker of reduced amyloid deposition in the brain. In this stage II double-blinded
randomized trial, we aim to test hypotheses regarding the mechanisms behind this result as well as cognitive
outcomes in African-American and European-American adults aged 50-70. Participants will complete ten
weeks of daily paced breathing sessions, randomized to either a resonance-frequency breathing or a random-
paced breathing condition. We hypothesize that resonance-frequency breathing reduces plasma biomarkers of
AD risk via two synergistic pathways: 1) afferent vagus nerve activity suppresses noradrenergic activity that
stimulates Aβ production; and 2) heart rate oscillations increase cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow, increasing
brain clearance of Aβ42 in adults in their 50’s and 60’s in whom glymphatic clearance is declining. We will
model how pre/post intervention change in plasma AD biomarkers relates to biomarkers associated with each
of these hypothesized pathways. Compared with European Americans, African Americans have higher AD risk
and higher noradrenergic/sympathetic system activity. They therefore may particularly benefit from resonance-
frequency breathing. Across ethnicities, reduced levels of Αβ should especially benefit adults in their 50’s and
60’s, in whom amyloid is starting to aggregate in the brain as glymphatic clearance becomes less effective.
The initial aggregative Αβ form (oligomeric Αβ) interferes with synaptic plasticity, so we will assess how much
participants in the two conditions improve their performance on cognitive tasks they practice daily for 10
weeks. This innovative project will serve as a foundation for future long-term clinical trials to test the potential
of resonance-frequency breathing to slow cognitive decline and prevent AD by reducing Αβ."
10793520,"Abstract
 Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) transposable element derived sequences comprise
approximately 17% of human genomic DNA. Although the overwhelming majority of LINE-1s have been rendered
immobile by mutational processes over evolutionary time, an average human genome contains approximately
100 active LINE-1s that can mobilize to new genomic locations via an RNA intermediate by a process known as
retrotransposition. The retrotransposition of active LINE-1s in the germline, during early development, or in select
somatic cells continues to generate inter- and intra-individual genetic variation and can lead to sporadic cases
of human genetic diseases, including hemophilia A, hemophilia B, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and certain
cancers. We posit that a mechanistic understanding of LINE-1 biology is essential to understand the forces that
contribute to human disease, human genetic variation, and human evolution. This proposal represents the third
competing renewal application of GM060518, and seeks ongoing support to continue our studies of LINE-1
biology. We will build upon our experience and knowledge in the field of mobile genetic elements, use insights
gained from studies of the mobility mechanisms of evolutionarily related retrotransposons, and employ a LINE-
1 cultured cell retrotransposition assay in conjunction with an integrated strategy that combines genetic,
molecular biological, biochemical, multi-omic, and computational approaches to answer cutting-edge questions
in LINE-1 biology. This proposal comprises two Aims, which build upon our extensive toolbox of reagents,
previous findings, and preliminary data. In Aim 1, we will elucidate mechanistic aspects of LINE-1
retrotransposition. In Aim 2, we will determine how host proteins act to facilitate or restrict LINE-1
retrotransposition. This project will benefit from a long-standing successful collaboration between the Moran and
Kidd laboratories at the University of Michigan and our outstanding research teams. The successful completion
of the above Specific Aims will increase our understanding how LINE-1s mobilize to new genomic locations, how
the host has evolved mechanisms to prevent unabated LINE-1 retrotransposition, and how LINE-1 has exploited
cellular proteins to aid in its retrotransposition. This knowledge also will provide insights into how LINE-1
retrotransposition contributes to human disease, human genetic variation, and human genome evolution."
10746140,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative brain disorder that causes progressive memory loss and cognitive decline, and is the No.1 cause of dementia. It is characterized by the coexistence of extracellular amyloid plaques, mainly formed by the amyloid beta-42 (Abeta) peptide, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles containing aggregates of abnormal tau. Abeta and tau were considered as disconnected culprits for many years, but in view of recent studies, it is clear that they are intimately related and possess synergistic activities. Sadly, very little is known about how Abeta and tau interactions trigger AD pathogenesis, which significantly hinders the development of effective treatments. To address this, we generated a new fly model of AD that genetically produces both human Abeta and tau resulting in synergistic pathology. These flies display extracellular deposits of thioflavin-S-positive Abeta, intracellular aggregation and phosphorylation of wild-type tau, and progressive loss of neuronal cells. The robust and consistent pathology of these flies provides a unique opportunity for gene discovery efforts and thus we performed a massive loss-of-function RNAi screen in the fly eye, which provides a useful and easy-to-score phenotype. Out of 6,600 RNAi stocks tested, we identified 31 suppressors and 119 enhancers, including multiple genes not previously known to be associated with AD. Most suppressors are linked to protein modification or cleavage, ribosomal function, cell metabolism, transcription, chromatin modulation, and transport to name a few. Here, we will employ a strategically designed pipeline that integrates genetics with high-throughput behavioral platforms and target prioritization to identify robust late-stage modifiers of the disease (Aim 1). On the other hand, we will fast-track a mechanistic and therapeutic analysis of one of the strongest suppressors along with its human homologue (Aim 2). This suppressor encodes a highly disordered protein of uncharacterized function and was also found in two other genetic screens performed by us. Thus, we have labelled it as a high-priority target. We strongly believe that manipulation of the 150 modifiers of Abeta+tau toxicity presented here will provide the foundation for new types of targets or therapeutics. Therefore, this work may contribute significantly to the goals of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer’s Disease."

Baseline reduced kidney function is highly prevalent among patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and is one
of the most powerful risk factors for adverse clinical outcomes. The association between acute kidney function
declines and outcomes, however, remain controversial, with some studies showing acute declines in estimated
glomerular filtration (eGFR) to be associated with worse outcomes but other studies not. The goal of Dr.
McCallum’s proposal is to better understand the mechanisms of acute eGFR declines that occur in the setting
of AHF and examine how acute eGFR declines are related to outcomes including long term kidney function,
mortality and AHF hospitalizations. The overall hypothesis is that three key components—congestion,
cardiac hemodynamics, and neurohormonal (NH) activity—are the primary risk factors for acute eGFR
declines, and that the relation between acute eGFR declines and clinical outcomes needs to be interpreted
within the context of changes in these three factors. In order to examine these relations, her Aims would
include 1) retrospective analysis of patients admitted to Tufts Medical Center for AHF and requiring a
pulmonary artery (PA) catheter (n=890) for repeated measures of congestion and cardiac hemodynamics; 2)
prospective enrollment of 140 patients admitted to Tufts Medical Center for AHF with an indwelling PA catheter
to assay for repeated measures of plasma NH activity; and 3) adoption of multi-trajectory modeling to develop
clinical phenotypes of acute cardiorenal syndrome (CRS) by incorporating trajectories of eGFR change,
congestion, cardiac hemodynamics, and NH activity. The career development plan incorporates didactic
training in longitudinal data analysis including joint modeling and multi-trajectory modeling, biomarker
methodology, introductory informatics for electronic health record research, as well as immersion and practical
training in cardiac hemodynamics and prospective patient recruitment, all under the mentorship of an
experienced group of nephrologists, cardiologists and statisticians with expertise in various aspects of the
CRS. Successful completion of these aims is feasible, as shown by Dr. McCallum’s preliminary data under her
institutional KL2 funding, as well her track record of productivity under her primary mentor Dr. Mark Sarnak.
Her co-mentor will be Dr. Jeffrey Testani, a cardiologist and Director of Heart Failure Research at Yale
University who has expertise in the CRS, has collaborated with Dr. McCallum on several manuscripts, and has
incorporated her into his research group and sponsored several trips for her to his research lab at Yale. With
this K23 award, Dr. McCallum will receive extensive training in biostatistical methods, dataset creation, CRS
pathophysiology, biomarker methodology, primary data collection and prospective study design. In aggregate,
completion of these aims will provide Dr. McCallum with expertise in the CRS and arm her with the tools
necessary to successfully compete for independent funding."
10893935,"Project Summary
Murine roseolovirus (MRV) is a beta-herpesvirus that is genetically highly related to the human roseoloviruses,
HHV-6 and HHV-7. The human roseoloviruses have been associated with autoimmune disease but
demonstrating causality is confounded by the ubiquitous and chronic nature of roseolovirus infections. We have
shown that neonatal MRV infection results in transient thymic and peripheral CD4+T cell depletion. Interestingly,
we found that neonatal MRV infection leads to development of autoimmune gastritis (AIG) in adult mice, in the
absence of active MRV replication. In our preliminary studies, we demonstrated that neonatal MRV infection
resulted in a transient decrease in medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) as well as reduced expression
of AIRE and tissue restricted self-antigens in the thymus. Moreover, MRV appears to directly infect mTECs,
suggesting a potential mechanism for MRV-induced autoimmunity. Indeed, neonatal MRV infection results in
development of autoreactive CD4+ T cells that are necessary and sufficient for MRV-induced AIG. Our
preliminary data suggest that roseoloviruses can induce autoimmunity by disrupting central tolerance.
The broad goal of this proposal is to define the mechanism by which roseoloviruses induces autoimmune
disease through its impact on central tolerance. We intend to meet this goal by, first defining the impact of human
and murine roseolovirus on mTECs. This will be done by delineating mTEC transcriptomic changes that occur
after MRV infection in vivo and by MRV and human roseolovirus infection in vitro. Second, we will establish the
impact of MRV on TCR repertoire and neonatal CD4+ T cells. We will evaluate the impact of MRV on TCR
repertoire over time by using TCR sequencing, while neonatal CD4+ T cell studies will utilize lineage tracing as
well as in vivo and in vitro functional assays.
My overall career goal is to understand the interaction between viruses and the immune system,
especially in regard to autoimmunity. This five-year K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career
Development Award will allow me to begin my transition of the proposed research project toward one that will
be pursued independently. The overall scope of this research is broad, with multiple future directions that can
be pursued during my career. By carrying out the Aims of this proposal as well as the career development goals,
I will be able to establish myself as an independent physician-scientist and make significant contributions to the
fields of viral immunology and autoimmunity."

This proposal seeks support for the forty-sixth, forty-seventh, forty-eighth and forty-ninth in an
annual series of meetings on “Retroviruses” to be held at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that
has emerged as the premiere conference for this field. The proposed meeting series will
assemble leaders in the field, junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students to
discuss new, cutting-edge developments in the field of retrovirus biology. The meeting series is
focused on the viruses and their interactions with host cells rather than the particular diseases
they cause. The large majority of the work to be presented will be unpublished and subject to
immediate comment and discussion by the audience. Each meeting will be structured in a
manner that parallels the biology of the viruses; beginning with the entry phase of the replication
cycle, proceeding with post-entry events, including reverse transcription and integration, RNA-
related events (transcription, processing, export, and packaging), particle assembly and release,
pathogenesis/host factors, and concluding with antivirals and evolution. Selected speakers will
include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty from around the world. Each
session will be chaired by two leading scientists in the field selected by the organizers from
among the registrants. Two eminent invited speakers will give special lectures to inspire and
inform young scientists and to stimulate discussion between scientists working on related but
distinct areas. There will also be three poster sessions where a majority of participants can
present their work. Mentoring sessions for young scientists will address career development
issues including: finding the right postdoc; applying, interviewing, and negotiating faculty
positions; setting up your first lab; balancing responsibilities; primarily undergraduate
institutions; careers in industry; and, careers in scientific publishing. Each meeting will be of
moderate size, and we expect ~400 retrovirologists in attendance."
10814167,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
More than 1 million patients in the U.S. undergo cardiac catheterization each year, and more than 200k of these patients
have stable coronary artery disease. Approximately 10% of patients with stable disease will experience a major adverse
event within a given two year period. Current imaging approaches based on independent indicators have largely failed to
predict adverse events, thus there are currently no techniques capable of determining which patients are likely to
experience adverse events such as myocardial infarction (MI). The ability to make treatment decisions based on
comprehensive, simultaneous measurements of the complete coronary environment—including biomechanics and
hemodynamics—rather than independent indicators could improve outcomes and reduce costs in at-risk patients.
This project proposes to develop a very small, forward-viewing ultrasound catheter capable of simultaneously
interrogating the comprehensive 3D coronary environment in order to guide decisions in the cardiac catheterization lab.
Specifically, the CoSHIS catheter (Composition, Structure, and Hemodynamics in Intermediate Stenoses) will
simultaneously quantify the coronary environment (including plaque mechanics and blood flow) in real-time 3D, unlike
current imaging approaches that seek to identify independent indicators of plaque rupture. In order to enable this multi-
functional quantification to guide treatment decisions, technological development is needed to ensure accurate
performance in a very small form factor. By leveraging recent advances in ultrasound imaging technology including array
design, data reconstruction, high frame rate image formation, and internal flow catheters designed to minimize flow
disturbance, this project will develop the core technology on for 4D mapping of the coronary mechanical enviornment
This technology for imaging-guided intervention in the cardiac catheterization lab will unite expertise in ultrasound
imaging and technology development, imaging-based computational modeling, animal models of coronary artery disease,
and interventional cardiology, and will be developed according to the following three Aims:
1. Development of a forward-viewing system for 3D intravascular ultrasound (US) imaging of lesion morphology,
hemodynamics, and plaque composition.
2. Validation of novel ultrasound measurement technology with established techniques including computed tomography
(CT), computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on angiography, and virtual histology intravascular ultrasound.
3. Evaluation of simultaneous US-based measurement in animal models of intermediate stenoses with validation using
established techniques."

Critical social and vascular risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) occur in
childhood, early adulthood, or midlife, decades before ADRD is typically diagnosed. Most cohorts dedicated to
the study of aging are initiated in mid to late life, and are therefore not ideal for evaluating the effects of early
life risk factors. Synthetic cohorts, which pool multiple data sources that in combination span early to late life,
provide an unparalleled opportunity to rigorously evaluate lifecourse mechanisms of ADRD. Lifecourse
research, especially when based on synthetic cohorts, faces several methodological challenges related to
survival, enrollment and attrition that are differential across the pooled studies, and reverse causation from
incipient dementia. The long-term goal of our research is to pinpoint how and when we can intervene to
prevent or delay the onset of ADRD. Yet, the differential selection forces in a synthetic cohort can make it
impossible to identify protective factors, can spuriously make harmful factors appear innocuous, and can
provide incorrect guidance on prevention priorities. In this study, we propose to pool eight data sources
comprising children, young, middle-aged, and older adults to create a SYNthetic Birth cohort for research on
ADRD (SynBAD), correcting for differential survival, enrollment or attrition, and reverse causation, allowing us
to rigorously evaluate the effects of lifecourse social and vascular risk factors. SynBAD will include the
Bogalusa Heart Study, the Muscatine study, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, The National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, the Coronary Artery Risk in Development in Young Adults,
the Health and Retirement Study, the REasons for Geographic And Racial Disparities in Stroke, and the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Studies. SynBAD will be large (N=304,171) and exceptionally
diverse, facilitating research on the drivers of ADRD among women (56%) and Black individuals (25%).
Specifically, we propose to (Aim 1) create a diverse synthetic birth cohort (age 0 to 90) for the study of social
and vascular risk factors for ADRD, incorporating corrections for differential survival, enrollment, and attrition;
(Aim 2), evaluate and correct for reverse causation -- in which incipient dementia induces changes in risk
factors -- by using a reverse Mendelian Randomization approach based on identifying the age-specific effects
of a genetic risk score for ADRD on risk factors; (Aim 3), rigorously estimate the causal effects of social and
vascular factors on ADRD risk using the synthetic cohort corrected for selection and reverse causation biases;
and (Aim 4), quantify reduction in lifetime ADRD cases and ADRD racial disparities that could be achieved with
a variety of hypothetical interventions on social or vascular risk factors at different ages. Given the role of
biological sex with social and vascular risk factors and dementia risk, we will allow for distinct risk models for
men and women. This study will improve the validity of lifecourse research using synthetic cohorts and provide
more valid and public health relevant estimates of the effects of social and vascular determinants of ADRD."
10870036,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The primary goal of this investigation is to develop and validate a comprehensive, robust deep learning (DL)
framework that improves MRI reconstruction beyond the limits of existing technology. The proposed framework
uses “plug-and-play” algorithms to combine physics-driven MR acquisition models with state-of-the-art learned
image models, which are instantiated by image denoising subroutines. To fully exploit the rich structure of MR
images, we propose to use DL-based denoisers that are trained in an application-speciﬁc manner. The proposed
framework, termed PnP-DL, offers advantages over other existing DL methods, as well as compressed sensing
(CS). Compared to existing DL methods for MRI reconstruction, PnP-DL is more immune to inevitable variations
in the forward model, such as changes in the coil sensitivities or undersampling pattern, allowing it to generalize
across applications and acquisition settings. Compared to CS, PnP-DL recovers images faster, with higher quality,
and with potentially superior diagnostic value.
Our preliminary results highlight the potential of PnP-DL to advance MRI technology. In this work, we will fur-
ther develop PnP-DL and validate it in these major applications: cardiac cine, 2D brain, and 3D brain imaging.
In Aim 1, we will train and optimize convolutional neural network-based application-speciﬁc denoisers for the
above-mentioned applications. The denoiser with the best denoising performance will be selected for further
investigation. In Aim 2, we will develop and compare different PnP algorithms. The algorithm yielding the best
combination of reconstruction accuracy and computational speed will be implemented in Gadgetron for inline
processing. In Aim 3, we will compare the performance of PnP-DL to other state-of-the-art methods using retro-
spectively undersampled data. This study will demonstrate that, in terms of image quality, PnP-DL is superior to
CS and existing DL methods and, despite higher acceleration, is non-inferior to parallel MRI with rate-2 acceler-
ation. In Aim 4, we will evaluate the performance of PnP-DL using prospectively undersampled data from adult
and pediatric patients. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate that PnP-DL outperforms state-
of-the-art methods in terms of image quality while exhibiting a level of robustness and broad applicability that
has eluded other DL-based MRI reconstruction methods. The acceleration and image quality improvement
afforded by these developments will beneﬁt almost all MRI applications, including pediatric imaging, where
reducing sedation is a pressing need, and high-dimensional imaging applications (e.g., whole-heart 4D ﬂow
imaging), which are too slow for routine clinical use."
10824267,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
All major mammalian glial subtypes of the central nervous system (CNS) make direct contacts with neuronal cell
bodies; however, how glia support and communicate with neuronal somas is vastly understudied compared to
glial interactions at synapses or axons. The overarching goal of this project is to gain a deep mechanistic
understanding of glial development, communication, and function at neuronal cell bodies to begin to fill in the
gaps of how these associations regulate CNS health and dysfunction. Drosophila glia demonstrate remarkable
similarity to a number of mammalian glial subtypes measured by morphological, functional, and molecular
criteria. Among these is cortex glia, a glial subclass that forms a lace-like meshwork to individually ensheath
nearly every neuronal cell body in the CNS. We recently developed new genetic tools to manipulate gene function
with remarkable specificity in Drosophila cortex glia, and now have a powerful system in which to study glial cell
development and neuron-glia interactions at neuronal cell bodies in vivo. In addition to regulating neuronal
health and behavior, cortex glia provide metabolic support to neurons, regulate neuronal ion and nutrient
balance, engulf neuronal debris, and can therefore inform the interrogation of multiple vertebrate glial cells that
interact with neuronal cell bodies.
We previously demonstrated that when cortex glia lack a single secreted neurotrophin, Spätzle 3 (Spz3), they
take on a globular appearance and no longer wrap neuronal cell bodies. The loss of Spz3 and these glial-somal
interactions leads to widespread nervous system dysfunction, including increased neuronal cell death, locomotor
impairment, and aberrant growth of surrounding healthy glial cells. We propose to use powerful in vivo genetic
tools available in Drosophila, along with a variety of techniques in cellular and molecular biology, biochemistry,
and imaging to elucidate the mechanisms of glial-somal interactions that maintain neuronal health in a live, intact
nervous system. Specifically, we will dissect the mechanisms that regulate the maturation and distribution of this
neurotrophin to maintain glial contact at neuronal cell bodies (Aim 1), define how this neurotrophin signals to its
receptor to support glial morphology, somal interactions, and neuronal health (Aim 2), and finally, we will
determine how nearby glial cells compensate when glial-somal signaling and associations are impaired (Aim 3).
These findings will begin to shed light on an understudied, yet important phenomenon by providing a foundation
for elucidating the cellular and molecular underpinnings of glial interactions with neuronal cell bodies in the
healthy and diseased CNS."
10805412,"The goal of this career development award is for the applicant to expand her knowledge and technical expertise
in tumor immunology and bioinformatic analyses in order to apply these new skills to investigation of the
childhood cancer Ewing sarcoma. Relapsed Ewing sarcoma is nearly uniformly fatal, and thus new treatment
approaches are desperately needed. A growing number of immune-based therapies are now being incorporated
into pediatric cancer treatment protocols. Thus, in order to be a successful clinician scientist directing a cutting-
edge research program in Ewing sarcoma, it is essential that the applicant gain expertise in tumor
immunobiology. Currently, very little is understood about regulation of the Ewing sarcoma tumor immune
microenvironment. This proposal addresses the interplay of two broadly important facets of pediatric cancer
research: DNA damage repair and tumor immune response. This proposed work specifically examines the ability
of DNA damage to activate Ewing tumor cell immunoregulatory pathways. The proposed aims will utilize a
combination of in vitro cell co-culture analyses, in vivo tumor animal modeling and human specimen analyses in
order to address this important topic. The applicant has chosen a primary mentor who is an expert in
immune/inflammatory signaling in cancer, and a co-mentor with expertise in T-cell biology and advanced
immunology techniques. Additionally, the applicant has constructed a physician-scientist career mentoring
committee and network of collaboartors including individuals with expertise in Ewing sarcoma, humanized mouse
models, DNA damage repair, the tumor immune-microenvironment, and bioinformatic analyses. As a team, the
mentor, co-mentor, committee members and collaborators are dedicated to providing the applicant with
technique training in tumor immunology and advanced cancer biology, as well as critical feedback on grants and
manuscripts and career guidance. The primary mentor and co-mentor are invested in guiding the applicant
toward a highly successful career as physician scientist by transitioning her to senior authorship on manuscripts,
preparing her to start an independent laboratory and encouraging her to directly mentor scientists and clinicians
at various levels of training. The University of Pittsburgh is an outstanding environment in which to develop a
career and expand a research program in tumor immunobiology. The applicant’s career development plan takes
full advantage of the many unique offerings at Pittsburgh including face-to-face career development workshops
with seasoned scientists, participation in the Pittsburgh Women in Science forum, graduate level tumor
immunobiology and bioinformatics courses and opportunities for presentation of work-in-progress at the
University of Pittsburgh Cancer Immunology Program meetings. With the enthusiastic support and exceptional
scientific expertise of her mentor and co-mentor, the applicant is eager to gain specific training in tumor
immunobiology and bioinformatic analyses and to launch an independent research career as a pediatric
oncologist physician scientist studying Ewing sarcoma at the University of Pittsburgh."
10820496,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The wasabi receptor, TRPA1, is a non-selective homotetrameric cation channel expressed in primary
sensory neurons where its activation by noxious chemical irritants contributes to pain perception and
local inflammation. Local inflammatory cues, in turn, sensitize sensory neurons to painful stimuli. Within
the pain and local inflammation regulatory cycle, TRPA1 serves as a positive regulator and its
dysregulation could contribute to the development of chronic pain. Genetic loss of TRPA1 in mice
abrogates pain perception to chemical irritants, mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity produced from
tissue injury, and asthma-induced airway inflammation supporting this model. Gain-of-function TRPA1
mutations cause congenital painful disorders in humans highlighting its direct role in pain perception.
This makes understanding TRPA1 function and dysregulation highly significant. Basic science research
in the Paulsen Laboratory broadly aims to determine molecular mechanisms of TRPA1 regulation and
dysregulation by second messengers, local inflammatory cues, through protein-protein interactions,
and as imparted by novel gain-of-function mutations. High-resolution TRPA1 structures exist in the
open and closed states, which are sampled during normal channel activity. While they represent a
major advance, these structures do not address the fundamental question of how TRPA1 becomes
sensitized to confer channel hyperactivity in disease. Understanding these mechanisms would open
the door to develop new targeted therapeutics. During the next 5 years, we will use complementary
biochemical, biophysical, and structural biology approaches to determine the molecular basis of
channel hyperactivity conferred by a novel gain-of-function TRPA1 mutation. Our preliminary data
suggest this TRPA1 mutant protein co-assembles with wild type TRPA1 subunits to form hyperactive
channels. We want to understand how the structural alterations introduced by this TRPA1 mutant affect
channel function. Additionally, we will determine how TRPA1 is sensitized and/or activated by calcium
and calmodulin. Many local inflammatory cues indirectly activate TRPA1 downstream of G-protein
coupled receptors that promote intracellular calcium release. TRPA1 could bind calcium directly or the
universal calcium sensor, calmodulin could mediate calcium sensing. Our preliminary data support an
interplay of calcium and calmodulin in regulating TRPA1 and we want to understand how calmodulin
binding works in concert with calcium-binding sites to confer TRPA1 calcium-dependent channel
activity. Collectively, this work will enhance our understanding of regulation and dysregulation of TRPA1
at the molecular level and will uncover novel avenues for drug development to target aberrant channels
in chronic pain and inflammatory conditions."
10821337,"Close to 45,000 Americans die from suicide each year and rates have been steadily rising for the last two
decades. There is an urgent need for better access to effective suicide prevention strategies that are highly
transportable across medical settings. Data from the current team indicates that a single session of crisis
response planning (CRP) reduces suicide behavior by 76%; however, it is unknown how CRP works, and for
whom, curtailing strategy optimization and widespread implementation. Clinicians speculate that CRP works by
strengthening emotion regulation capabilities and reducing stress reactivity; however, this hypothesis has never
been tested and no prior study has identified neural mechanisms and predictors of changes in suicide risk
following intervention. Related, there are no objective brain-based markers of ‘reduced’ suicide risk to inform
clinical decision making and guide high-risk patients to needed services. To address these gaps and ultimately
improve suicide prevention efforts we seek to identify brain-based mechanisms and predictors of changes in
suicidality following a single session of CRP in a cohort of adults with active suicidal intent. We will take an
innovative and comprehensive approach by probing stress reactivity and emotion regulation neural circuits in
the context of a clinical trials design. Specifically, we will combine sources of information and simultaneously
collect assessments of neural function, psychophysiology (i.e., startle eyeblink potentiation), behavior
and self-report during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before (Time 1) and after (Time 2)
randomization to a single, one-hour session of CRP or standard suicide risk management (control). A small
group of volunteers with no history of suicide ideation or intent will be included for comparison. Using ecological
momentary assessment (EMA) technology, acute changes in suicidality following intervention will be assessed
twice daily for the first week. Monthly online clinical surveys will also be administered, and at 6-months post-
intervention, the entire multimodal assessment battery will be re-administered (Time 3). This innovative,
multilayered, longitudinal design will allow for a well-controlled test of how a single session of CRP acutely
changes suicide risk (Aim 1). The study will also address whether the acute effects of CRP are sustained over
time and how neural function influences long-term changes in suicidality (Aim 2). Lastly, we will conduct
sophisticated analyses to integrate data across ‘units of analysis’ and functional domains to test whether there
are reliable prognostic indicators of CRP intervention success (Aim 3). Findings from this study will provide
critical new knowledge regarding how an ultra-brief session of CRP works and for whom, while uncovering a
mechanistic signal of reduced suicide risk. In addition, consistent with the mission of the NIMH BRAINS program,
the award will facilitate the launch of the PI’s innovative translational program of research and pave the way for
a series of large-scale studies aimed at identifying neurobiological targets for resolving suicide risk and testing
whether interventions with effective target engagement can enhance suicide prevention outcomes."
10828785,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest malignancies despite the recent
paradigm shifting success of immunotherapy noted in many other tumor types. Neoadjuvant strategies in PDAC
provide a distinctive opportunity for therapeutic intervention to decrease systemic recurrence, yet this remains a
substantial problem for patients undergoing curative intent surgery. The significant desmoplastic stroma,
immunosuppressive and T cell barren tumor microenvironment (TME) are obstacles for immunotherapeutic
efficacy in PDAC. Yet, the neoadjuvant approach offers a unique advantage for comprehensive and robust
analysis of the TME and stroma. This proposal describes a career development plan coupled with a parallel
research strategy carefully designed through a neoadjuvant translational approach. This approach is specifically
proposed in order to cement an independent career as a leader in translating novel findings of stromal and TME
biology into future science-driven clinical trials in PDAC. As an oncologist focused on pancreas cancer, the
applicant’s long-term goals are to become a leader in the field of pancreatic cancer with an expertise in translating
findings from collaborative laboratory research and patient biospecimen analysis. This mentored Career
Development Award proposal is based on a continued focus from previous extensive preclinical and clinical work
by the applicant, surrounding a master regulator of the TME, known as focal adhesion kinase (FAK). This
proposal is also grounded on a hyperfocus in opportunities for deeper clinical-translational experimental learning,
expert mentorship, and intensive didactics that will inform future bedside-to-bench-to-bedside investigation and
translation. The proposed work will be conducted under the exceptional mentorship of Dr. Lei Zheng and Dr.
Stephen J Pandol, international leaders in pancreatic cancer research. The environment of the Johns Hopkins
Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Bloomberg Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and
the Pancreatic Cancer Precision Medicine Center of Excellence is an optimal setting from which the proposed
studies can originate novel findings and develop an independent investigator. This five year proposal
encompasses: (1) the conduct of a clinical trial to evaluate intratumoral T cell infiltration, clinical response and
safety of immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 antibody, pembrolizumab, with or without FAK inhibitor (FAKi),
defactinib, following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in subjects with high-risk resectable PDAC, (2) employing a
novel multiplex immunohistochemistry technique to examine TME immune mechanisms underlying the response
and resistance of pembrolizumab and defactinib, and (3) the investigation of the impact of pembrolizumab with
and without defactinib on fibroblast phenotypes and immunomodulation associated with reactive oxygen species
in the TME utilizing RNAseq and tumor/fibroblast co-culture. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to be able to
generate new hypotheses and develop innovative treatment approaches for patients with PDAC."
10812321,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an often-chronic eating disorder with the highest mortality rate of any mental illness,
significant costs, and global disease burden. There is a critical need to identify brain-based factors that
perpetuate AN symptoms and that may serve as mechanistic targets for existing and novel treatments. Most
neurobiological studies in AN have focused on food-related behavior, and have specifically linked these
symptoms to broad deficits in frontostriatal activation. However, biobehavioral research to date has failed to
account for brain-based mechanisms that may maintain driven exercise, an alarming symptom experienced by
a majority of adolescents with AN (59-80%). The goal of this K23 mentored patient-oriented research career
development award is to better understand the neurocomputational underpinnings of reinforcement learning in
adolescents with AN who engage in driven exercise (AN-DEx). Specifically, the proposed study leverages
decision tasks to examine whether adolescents with AN-DEx demonstrate differences in reinforcement
learning related to food or exercise reward stimuli. This study will compare task responses in 50 adolescents
with AN-DEx, to those of 50 with AN, and 100 age-and activity-matched controls. As a secondary exploratory
aim, this study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to characterize neural activity
substantiating task performance for a portion of each group (25 from each, 75 total). This study design will test
the following hypotheses: Aim 1: H1a: Compared to controls, AN + AN-DEx will demonstrate deficits in model-
based strategy (forward planning) in response to food and exercise stimuli. H1b: Compared to AN, AN-DEx will
demonstrate deficits in model-based strategy in response to exercise stimuli; Aim 2: H2a: Compared to
controls, AN + AN-DEx will demonstrate increased OFC - NAcc functional connectivity (frontal-limbic pathway,
key brain regions implicated in inhibitory control). H2b: Compared to AN, AN-DEx will demonstrate increased
OFC-NAcc functional connectivity in response to exercise stimuli. Data from this project will substantiate an
explanatory model of DEx, pinpoint which components of reinforcement learning are altered in AN-DEx, and
identify ways in which behavioral control-focused interventions may be most effective. This line of inquiry will
ultimately inform targeted interventions that can more effectively interrupt DEx, and other compulsive AN
symptoms. The current study will also serve as a vehicle for mentorship and training in concepts and skills that
are critical to the candidate’s current project, and next steps. Specifically, the proposed training will allow the
candidate to gain new knowledge in: (i) cognitive neuroscience and neural substrates specific to eating
disorders, (ii) neurocomputational tasks and modeling, and (iii) preliminary training in fMRI. This project and
fulfillment of the training goals will launch the candidate’s independent career in the translational neuroscience
of AN and lay groundwork for future high-impact studies that combine sophisticated analytic approaches and
neuroimaging to improve eating disorder treatment."
10816988,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This is a K23 award application for Dr. Anne Kirby, a licensed occupational therapist with expertise in autism,
to independently conduct translational research studies to reduce suicide and advance quality of life for autistic
people. The K23 will provide her the support necessary to acquire critical skills in four key career development
areas: 1) community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches with autistic community partners; 2)
qualitative and mixed methods research approaches; 3) efficacy and implementation clinical trials of
community interventions focused on suicide prevention; and 4) research leadership and management skills. To
achieve her goals, Dr. Kirby has assembled an interdisciplinary mentoring team comprised of Dr. Hillary Coon
(Primary Mentor), a senior scientist and recognized leader in autism research, and three Co-Mentors: Dr.
Christina Nicolaidis, an accomplished CBPR researcher with autistic adults, Dr. Susan Zickmund, an expert in
qualitative and mixed methods research, and Dr. Craig Bryan, a leading suicide prevention clinical trialist.
Complementing these experts, Dr. Kirby also has a 4 member advisory committee to support her proposed
CBPR work with autistic stakeholders and development of a suicide prevention community-based intervention.
 Current evidence demonstrates that autistic individuals are at elevated risk for suicidal thoughts, suicidal
behaviors, and, ultimately, suicide deaths. Suicide prevention is a high priority of autistic adults, and research
is needed to better understand risk factors and prevent suicide. However, few autism researchers are trained
in working effectively with the autistic community. Dr. Kirby's objective is to address the gaps in current
knowledge about suicide and autism, and the lack of available evidence-based suicide prevention strategies.
Her research will result in preliminary data to support a clinical trial to test a novel community-based suicide
prevention intervention for autism communities. She proposes the following Specific Aims: Aim 1]
Qualitatively explore suicide risk and protective factors for autistic people as well as preferred aspects of
evidence-based suicide prevention interventions; Aim 2] Develop a community-based intervention built upon
the PC CARES (Promoting Community Conversations About Research to End Suicide) model framework to
educate and empower autism community stakeholders about autistic mental health and suicide prevention;
and Aim 3] Pilot test and refine the intervention content, delivery, and efficacy and implementation measures
in preparation for a Hybrid Type 1(efficacy + implementation) clinical trial. A critical component of this proposal
will be the use of CBPR methods throughout the proposed aims to ensure community relevance and
acceptability.
 The proposed research is significant because it expands our understanding of suicide risk in autistic people.
The proposed research is innovative because it takes a CBPR approach and will result in the first community-
based suicide prevention approach developed by and for the autistic community."

The Administrative Core is led by Center Director Ramnik Xavier and Associate Directors Atul Bhan, Andrew
Chan, and Mark Daly. The activities of the Administrative Core serve to support the Center’s goals of promoting
interactions among scientists exploring diverse fields that share relevance to IBD, attracting investigators to the
study of IBD, and providing an environment and mechanism to foster development of young investigators
focused on IBD. We believe all these goals are achieved through the seamless coordination of the Center’s
scientific, educational, and technical resources provided via the organizational framework of the Core. The
administrative structure of the Center includes four committees – the Administrative, Executive Steering, External
Advisory, and Institutional Advisory Committees – that facilitate the aims of the CSIBD and provide a mechanism
to respond to Center needs.
The specific aims of the Administrative Core are to (1) grow and diversify the CSIBD research base by actively
engaging new members with methods and specialties relevant to IBD; (2) facilitate and provide oversight of the
Pilot and Feasibility Program; (3) coordinate a multifaceted Enrichment Program; (4) identify, help develop,
disseminate, and promote tools, technologies, and collaborations; (5) convene the associated committees to
support the director in general, administrative, and scientific decisions concerning the CSIBD; and (6)
communicate activities, news, and opportunities through many venues, including the website, within the Center
and to other Digestive Diseases Research Core Centers, NIDDK, and appropriate individuals, groups, and/or
organizations to facilitate collaboration and cross-learnings. The Administrative Core also manages the
collaborative program between the CSIBD and the Broad Institute, which includes Core Enhancement grants
that enable access to Broad Institute-based platforms."
10828803,"HUMAN GENETICS AND MICROBIOME CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Human Genetics and Microbiome Core will be co-directed by Mark Daly and Curtis Huttenhower. Core
services range from routine and heavily used molecular biology services (e.g., whole plasmid DNA sequencing,
siRNA/shRNA and CRISPR screens) to tools for data generation and analysis of genetics and the microbiome
in IBD (e.g., high-throughput nucleotide extraction, gene profiling, 16S rRNA sequencing, deep shotgun
sequencing, and metabolite profiling). The Core’s continuing focus on methods optimization and development
provides cost-effective access to cutting-edge techniques and analysis tools, ensuring that investigators remain
at the forefront of digestive disease research. For genetics studies, investigators benefit from the expansion of
tools for genetic manipulation, including new CRISPR reagents, and access to emerging results and techniques
from ongoing sequencing projects. The recent addition of a state-of-the-art gnotobiotic facility and a
comprehensive open-access biobank of human gut bacteria will aid investigators studying the impact of the
microbiome on host physiology and metabolism. The Core offers bioinformatics support for all studies, with an
emphasis on development of novel computational methods and pipelines. Additionally, the IBD Data Science
Commons will address growing data integration and analysis needs, serving as both a repository for multi’omic
data and a space for analysis and visualizations that enable scientific discovery. Education and training services
include end-to-end consultations and instruction on experimental design, data generation, and bioinformatics
analysis.
Operating at the intersection between patient samples and basic research techniques, the Core will be a major
connection point for clinicians and basic researchers. The specific aims of the Human Genetics and
Microbiome Core are divided according to its two themes. For genetics services, the Core will (1) facilitate the
application of advanced experimental platforms for genetics, genomics, and high-throughput data analysis to
discovery efforts relevant to IBD; (2) provide a centralized facility and personnel for performing state-of-the-art
recombinant and PCR-based DNA procedures and RNA interference and provide cost-effective and high-quality

biology, genetic, and bioinformatics technologies. For microbiome services, the Core will (1) provide an end-to-
end sampling and multi’omic profiling system for the host and microbiota in IBD and gastrointestinal disease; (2)
provide computational resources to analyze and interpret the microbiome; and (3) develop cutting-edge solutions
in microbiome research that will drive therapeutic discovery."
10828805,"CELLULAR AND IN VIVO MODELS CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Cellular and In Vivo Models (CIVM) Core will be co-directed by Atul Bhan and Dennis Brown. Core
services fall into four categories: imaging technology; organoid biology applications in IBD; advice on in vivo
models; and education and training. Two major additions to imaging technology services are a Zeiss LSM800
confocal system with Airyscan technology, which doubles the resolution of conventional confocal microscopes
and greatly increases sensitivity, and a Nikon STORM super-resolution system that enables the visualization of
nanoscopic interactions, such as between proteins or between proteins and nucleic acids. In response to CSIBD
member feedback, the CIVM Core now facilitates organoid biology applications in IBD by providing access to a
bank of genotyped mouse- and human-derived intestinal organoids as well as tools, technologies, and protocols
for manipulation of these systems. The Core offers expert advice on in vivo model development, implementation,
and analysis. Histopathological analysis, immunohistochemical and special stains for tissue sections, scoring
systems for evaluating intestinal inflammation, and morphological interpretations of phenotypes observed in
genetic mouse models are also provided. Education and training services include consultation, short-term and
intensive technical training, and long-term guidance on project development.
The CIVM Core aims to advance and improve the level of support for research programs of CSIBD investigators
and the wider digestive disease research community. To this end, the Core provides Center investigators with
technical support, expertise, and access to high-end instrumentation necessary for cell biology studies as well
as advice on in vitro and in vivo models relevant to IBD. The specific aims of the Cellular and In Vivo Models
Core are to (1) provide investigators working in digestive disease- and IBD-targeted research areas with access
to sophisticated cellular imaging approaches at a time when few or no isolated laboratories can develop the
highest level of technical competence in the specialized areas served by the Core; (2) enable transformative

systems, access to a genotyped organoid bank, resources for manipulating organoids and primary epithelial
cells, and histopathological analysis; (3) provide an environment for the training of key personnel from
participating laboratories; (4) evolve to meet the changing needs of the research community by introducing new
equipment and techniques; (5) maintain the highest level of integrity in generating, analyzing and reporting data
by focusing on quality control, rigor and reproducibility parameters in research, and data management; and (6)
provide a central location for imaging activities in which different investigators can interact and share ideas for
pushing IBD research forward."
10828811,"CELL CIRCUITS AND IMMUNOLOGY CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Cell Circuits and Immunology Core will be co-directed by Andrew Luster and Shiv Pillai. Core services
are comprised of routine immunology tools, specialized immunology services, and education and training
designed to facilitate studies of the human immune system. The Core maintains a commitment to the
development and implementation of methods to facilitate immune monitoring and define laboratory correlates of
clinical observations. Routine immunological tools offered by the Core include flow cytometry, high-speed cell
sorting, Luminex bead assays, and multiplex cytokine and chemokine arrays. The Core strives to provide access
to cutting edge tools to drive progress in digestive disease and mucosal immunology research. To this end, a
number of specialized services are offered to Center members, including generation of MHC I and II tetramers
and novel pathway-based computational approaches combined with CRISPR screens. As a result of
development and implementation of groundbreaking methods for single cell genomic profiling (e.g., single
nucleus RNA-seq and Perturb-Seq) as well as the recent establishment of a single cell facility, investigators have
access to the tools necessary for profiling immune cells across tissues at high resolution. Recently developed
high-definition spatial transcriptomics and multiplexed RNA FISH techniques allow investigators to analyze the
spatial distribution of transcriptomic data. As part of its commitment to education and training, the Core provides
consultations and instruction on experimental design of immunological assays, method implementation, and
bioinformatics analysis.
The CCI Core strives to enhance cohesion between basic immunology, translational and clinical aspects of IBD
towards the goal of understanding the basic mechanisms underlying inflammation and autoimmunity. The
specific aims of the Cell Circuits and Immunology Core are to (1) provide CSIBD members with access to
immunological resources that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive to individual researchers; (2) offer CSIBD
investigators access to cutting-edge immunological techniques that are at the forefront of immunology research;
and (3) promote the development of junior investigators and foster collaborations by providing a connection point
between investigators of varying research approaches."
10828817,"CLINICAL CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Clinical Core will be led by Ramnik Xavier (Director), Andrew Chan (Co-Director), and Ashwin
Ananthakrishnan (Technical Director). Core services are organized into (1) consultation, training, and
education, including advice on research study design, execution, and analysis as well as education and training
of junior investigators, residents, and fellows; (2) biospecimen services, including clinical database and patient
identification, biospecimen collection and processing, and serum, stool, and tissue biorepository services; (3)
data collection and analysis, including regulatory services, a genotype and microbiome library, RNA-sequencing
from colonic biopsies, and bioinformatics support; and (4) access to a clinical and translational database,
including detailed phenotyping and clinical data linked to each patient’s genotype and microbiome features.
Central components of the Clinical Core are two patient cohorts: the Prospective Registry in IBD Study at MGH
(PRISM) and the GI Disease and Endoscopy Registry (GIDER). By obtaining pre- and post-event samples, these
cohorts are anchored around disease extension, new diagnosis, and institution of specific biologic treatments
that provide evolving clinical metadata and serial biospecimens. With more than 3,200 patients enrolled, PRISM
now collects biospecimens for metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic analyses as well as
information on early life environmental exposures, fatigue, depression, and diet. The Core recently introduced
GIDER, a longitudinal colonoscopy-based cohort with 800 healthy individuals enrolled to date that will enhance
our understanding of genetic, microbial, and environmental determinants across a spectrum of gastrointestinal
diseases.
This core serves as a hub for interactions between clinicians and basic researchers, allowing scientists to test
hypotheses in human samples and clinicians to gain valuable insight into disease states. The specific aims of
the Clinical Core are to (1) build a biorepository of patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis with
accurate phenotyping of disease as well as sampling of blood, stool, urine, and tissue in various disease states
(active/inactive disease) and related to various therapeutic and environmental perturbations; (2) develop and
expand longitudinal cohorts of health and disease anchored around disease diagnosis, prediction of relapse,
and response to specific therapies in patients with IBD; (3) define the phenotypic implications of genetic loci and
microbial perturbations with regard to clinical manifestations, response to therapy, and to examine the interaction
with the environment; (4) facilitate education and training in research by providing consultations regarding study

10828823,"PILOT AND FEASIBILITY PROGRAM: PROJECT SUMMARY
Dr. Atul Bhan, Pilot and Feasibility Program Director, will evaluate letters of intent for suitability, assist the
Center Director with identification of appropriate reviewers, and examine reviews received. Dr. Bhan is charged
specifically with reviewing these initial funding proposals in the context of the overall programmatic goals of the
Center in fostering new digestive disease investigators and advancing understanding of IBD. He will also chair
the meeting of the CSIBD Executive Steering Committee that decides the ranking of proposals for funding. Dr.
Kate Jeffrey will serve as the Associate Director of the Pilot and Feasibility Program.
The overall goal of the CSIBD Pilot and Feasibility Program is to provide initial support for laboratory,
translational, and clinical research relevant to IBD and to stimulate innovative research relevant to IBD. These
goals unfold along the P and F Program’s specific aims: 1) Recruit new investigators into digestive disease
research by providing funding for IBD-related nascent research programs; and 2) Generate new ideas related
to IBD research by providing funding for innovative high-risk high-payoff lines of investigation.
All CSIBD members are eligible to receive funding through the Pilot and Feasibility program. In addition, other
investigators within MGH, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Broad Institute, Harvard Medical School,
MIT, Tufts, the University of Massachusetts Medical School, and the Harvard School of Public Health may
apply for support through this program. Awardees are expected to attend CSIBD seminars and workshops,
interact with other Center investigators, and present their findings to the CSIBD members, in addition to formal
reporting to the Executive Steering Committee. Over the past 10 years, 71% of Pilot and Feasibility
Program awards have been for young investigators without current or past independent NIH support
(Type N proposals), 21% have been for Type EN, and 8% have been for Type E. This ongoing priority in
funding is reflected in the representative projects funded in the last four years which are included with this
renewal application."
10808923,"Tuberculosis kills nearly 2 million people globally every year. Over the years, we have determined that the
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteasome is essential to allow the tubercle bacilli to persist in animals.
Proteasomes are multi-subunit, barrel shaped proteases that degrade proteins in a highly regulated manner.
We are currently examining how proteolysis is regulated, from how proteins are tagged with the only known
bacterial protein-on-protein post-translational modification to how those tagged proteins are then delivered into
the proteasome core protease. Secondly, this proposal will seek to understand the functions of an essential
protein quality control system that is regulated by proteasomal degradation. Identifying how this system
contributes to Mtb physiology may identify new ways to combat tuberculosis infections. Thus, these studies will
reveal how a proteasome senses extracellular signals to optimize bacterial growth required for lethal infections."
10805529,"Recently, Single Nucleotide Variants (SNV) detection from single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
experiments have started to emerge. These studies have demonstrated the utility of scRNA-seq SNV
assessments to characterize intra-tumoral heterogeneity, define mutation-associated expression signatures,
identify tumor cells displaying lineage infidelity, and evaluate the tumor differentiation state. However, currently,
most of the SNV data from scRNA-seq cancer datasets (10x Genomics) is not obtained at cell-level and
therefore lacks information on SNV-associated cell phenotypes.
 SNV assessments from scRNA-seq data can complement DNA-based SNV-studies and maximize the
potential of scRNA-seq datasets. Importantly, they can provide crucial information on the SNV functionality
through studying the variant allele specific dynamics and its correlation to phenotype. Given this wide
application range, the knowledge on cell-level SNV expression and dynamics can be instrumental for
any cancer scRNA-seq study.
 In the last year we have developed tools for assessment of Single Cell-specific Expressed SNVs
(sceSNVs). SCExecute executes a user-provided command on barcode-stratified, extracted on-the-fly
individual cell alignments. We apply scExecute in conjunction with variant callers to detect sceSNVs. For
estimation of allele specific sceSNVs expression we apply SCReadCounts, which generates cell-SNV matrices
with cell-level expressed variant allele frequency (VAFRNA). These cell-SNV matrices can be used as inputs for
our other tools scReQTL, scRsQTL, and scSNPair, to correlate variant expression to gene expression,
splicing, and other SNV's expression, respectively. The expression of sceSNVs of interest can be projected in
two-dimensional projection space across all cells in a sample using scSNVis.
 Here, we propose to employ the above-described approaches on cancer scRNA-seq datasets
with the aim to assess sceSNVs and to initiate a public Pan-Cancer scVariome catalogue (Aim 1). We
will integrate new and existing (SCReadCounts, scReQTL, scRsQTL, scSNPair and scSNVis) tools for
the discovery and analysis of sceSNVs from scRNA-Seq data in an end-to-end, integrated, containerized,
publicly available pipeline. New tools will incorporate velocity and pseudotime inference analyses to
study sceSNV associations with cell dynamics. Using this pipeline, we will supply functional sceSNV
annotations to the catalogue (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will develop and incorporate a new tool that cross-
references locally observed (by different teams) sceSNVs, indexing by loci, study, sample, and cellular
barcode, providing the additional context of cell-type, study meta-data, and other annotation and
summary results from the catalog, with the overarching goal to facilitate community annotation of
sceSNVs in scRNA-Seq data (Aim 3)."
10816517,"PROJECT SUMMARY (Abstract)
Microglia were once thought derived exclusively from the early yolk sac progenitors, but recent studies raised
the possibility of monocyte-derived microglia in normal development and particularly after neonatal brain injury,
including stroke, hypoxia-ischemia (HI), and inflammation/LPS-sensitized HI (LPS/HI). However, the extent of
monocyte-derived microglia in normal development is unknown, and the roles of monocyte-derived pathologic
microglia partially defined. Better understanding of these issues may shed mechanistic insights and suggest
potential treatments of neonatal brain injury. We will address these issues in three specific aims.
In Aim 1, we will use CCR2-Cre mice crossed with R26R-EGFP mice to determine the extent and distributions
of CCR2+ monocyte-derived microglia in the brain.
In Aim 2, we will use PF-04136309 (IP) to inhibit the MCP1/CCR2-mediated chemoattraction or clodronate
liposomes (IV) to ablate the blood-borne monocytes to assess their potential benefits against the neonatal
LPS/HI brain injury.
In Aim 3, we will use tamoxifen-dosed CCR2-CreER; R26R-EGFP mice to isolate monocyte-derived microglia-
like cells in LPS/HI-injured brains for single-cell RNA-Seq to search for the potential effectors responsible for
delayed neurotoxicity and damage to the synaptic network."

10806961,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Essential tremor (ET) is among the most prevalent neurological disorders in the world. In addition to the
hallmark feature of bilateral kinetic tremor, individuals with essential tremor often present with mild cognitive
changes that have been primarily characterized as dysexecutive and viewed as being related to abnormalities
in cerebello-cortical networks. However, growing evidence suggests that cognitive difficulties can extend
beyond the frontal-executive domain, and epidemiological research has shown that individuals with ET are at
an increased risk for developing dementia compared to age-matched peers. Prior research conducted by the
applicant identified a subgroup of ET patients who had broader cognitive deficits, including poor memory. This
gives rise to the question of whether there may be more widespread neural changes occurring outside
cerebellar networks in at least a subset of individuals with ET. Indeed, preliminary findings from neuroimaging
and neuropathological studies have suggested that there may be a link between ET and Alzheimer’s disease.
Further research is warranted to explore this link, including examining biomarkers associated with cognitive
decline. The overall goal of the current study is to better understand the neural correlates of cognition in ET.
The proposed study aims to 1) identify cognitive phenotypes in ET using a data-driven (cluster analytic)
approach and comprehensive neurocognitive assessment, 2) determine whether different cognitive profiles in
ET vary in structural brain changes (i.e., free-water, volume), and 3) to explore whether plasma-acquired
biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease are elevated in individuals with ET who have memory-related
changes relative to those who do not. Innovative features of the proposed study include determining
neuroanatomical correlates of cognition in individuals with ET who have different types of cognitive deficits and
use of free-water imaging and plasma biomarkers as sensitive and powerful in vivo markers of early
neurodegeneration. Findings from this study may increase current understanding about the nature and
heterogeneity of cognitive changes in ET, with the potential to provide further information on the link between
ET and dementia. The proposed project will also provide the applicant with additional training beyond that
included in her Ph.D. program. Specifically, training goals will include 1) hands-on training in magnetic
resonance imaging data processing and analysis with emphasis on structural (T1) and free-water imaging, 2)
coursework in neural bases and mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction in age-related neurological
disorders, 3) didactics in plasma biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, 4) training in
using programming languages for statistical computing and neuroimaging processing, 5) development of
professional and career skills. The applicant is supported by a strong research environment with the necessary
resources and infrastructure for completion of the proposed project, as well as a productive mentoring team
with specific expertise in the proposed areas of study."
10833000,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomach of about 50% of the world’s population and is the strongest known risk
factor for developing gastric cancer, the fourth most common cause of cancer related deaths. Failure of the host
response to control the infection leads to persistent inflammation, which initiates disease progression from
chronic gastritis through a histological “Correa Cascade” that results in gastric carcinoma in 1-3% of all those
infected. Due to antibiotic resistance, and the fact that antibiotic treatment may not be effective in reducing cancer
risk once precancerous lesions are present, we need to develop new therapeutic strategies to limit progression
to dysplasia and carcinoma. Our lab investigates the role of the polyamines, putrescine, spermidine, and
spermine in gastric inflammation and carcinogenesis. Putrescine is sequentially converted to spermidine and
spermine, which is back-converted to spermidine by spermine oxidase (SMOX). We have shown that SMOX
expression is elevated in human and mouse gastric tissues infected with H. pylori. Furthermore, infected
C57BL/6 Smox–/– mice exhibit depleted spermidine levels, and a decrease in gastritis and carcinogenic signaling
compared to wild-type mice. Using FVB/N INS-GAS mice prone to developing gastric dysplasia and intramucosal
carcinoma with H. pylori infection, we have seen that Smox–/– mice infected with H. pylori exhibit a significant
reduction in gastric intramucosal carcinoma and extent of dysplasia. Spermine catabolism by SMOX generates
3-aminopropanol, which can spontaneously form acrolein, a reactive electrophilic aldehyde that has the potential
to damage DNA and proteins. Our preliminary findings demonstrate that acrolein is produced in gastric tissues
of H. pylori-infected FVB/N INS-GAS mice and is significantly reduced in Smox–/– FVB/N INS-GAS mice.
Additionally, spermidine is an essential substrate for the synthesis of hypusine, a unique amino acid that is only
found in the protein eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (EIF5A) by the action of the enzyme deoxyhypusine
synthase (DHPS). Our recent work with human gastric organoids has revealed induction of hypusinated EIF5A
levels with H. pylori infection, which was ablated with the chemical inhibitor of the pathway. Proteomic analysis
on these organoids implicated hypusination as a critical pathway for oncogenesis. Taken together, we
hypothesize that polyamine dysregulation due to SMOX activity in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells leads
to the generation of spermidine and acrolein, and upregulation of the hypusination pathway resulting in increased
risk for gastric cancer development. Our specific aims are to determine: 1) the role of SMOX activity in gastric
carcinogenesis, including effects of spermidine, spermine and acrolein in FVB/N INS-GAS mice. 2) if spermidine
generated by SMOX contributes to gastric cancer development through hypusination using studies in human
gastric organoids and mice with an epithelial-specific deletion of Dhps. This proposal seeks to elucidate the
mechanisms by which SMOX induces gastric disease progression, thus identifying novel pathways to be targeted
for therapeutic benefit, while providing the ideal training for my future career as a principal investigator."
10833003,"ABSTRACT
Series of disappointing clinical trial outcomes have ushered the Alzheimer's field (AD) into an era of preventive
interventions. Researchers now recognize that AD is a continuum and that interventions should start in the
pre-symptomatic phase. To that end, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a promising non-
invasive approach, as its mechanisms have been attributed to the brain system that is initially affected by AD
pathology, the norepinephrine locus coeruleus (LC) system. Animal and preliminary studies in patients and
healthy individuals from our group and others demonstrated that tVNS alters locus coeruleus (LC) and nucleus
tractus solitarius (NTS) functioning and enhances memory. This indicates that tVNS targets the site of initial
AD pathology and might have the potential to delay AD-related cognitive impairment. Thus, tVNS could
address an important challenge in the field: non-invasively delaying disease progression prior to onset of
cognitive decline or significant accumulation of pathology. The overarching goal of this proposal is to apply
single and repeated tVNS in pre-symptomatic older individuals with varying degrees of AD pathology, with the
aim to determine the extent of the cognitive effects of tVNS in domains and time, and to relate tVNS outcome
to demographics, neurophysiological properties of the LC and NTS as well as burden of AD biomarkers. Our
accomplishments in optimizing tVNS and sensitive cognitive measures, ultra-high field brainstem imaging and
blood-based biomarkers allow us to examine our central hypothesis: that serial tVNS enhances memory
functioning more than single, and in particular in at-risk individuals, in whom AD pathology burden is low to
moderate and the NTS-LC system is still responsive to stimulation. To that end, 140 pre-symptomatic older
individuals (APOE-E4 enriched) will be enrolled to a double-blind randomized cross-over design of stimulation
versus sham tVNS during 7T imaging and blood sampling. This will be followed by randomized allocation to
repeated tVNS or sham for 2 weeks and a follow-up cognitive assessment after 2 months. The results of this
study will yield important information for future trials assessing tVNS in three important ways: 1) through
investigating which cognitive domains are modulated by tVNS on the short and long-term, important for
monitoring and determining outcome measures, 2) through identifying demographic characteristics, functional
brain and AD-related markers that predict beneficial responses to tVNS, which will be important to identify
trial eligibility (Aim 1 and 2) and 3) understanding biological pathways contributing to RAVANS success to
confirm target engagement, aid in biomarker stratification or enrichment of the population, and which could
serve to monitor progression (Aim 2 and 3). The research proposed is innovative because it aims to define the
target population in whom tVNS can be efficacious, based on the known underlying biological pathways of both
tVNS and AD. Refining the target population is critical as it is expected to inform eligibility criteria of large-
scale randomized clinical trials, which in turn will contribute to their success in delaying disease progression."

Silencing RNA (siRNA) is of considerable current interest in medicine because it can elicit potent, target
specific knockdown of virtually any mRNA, creating a useful and proven genetic surrogate tool. Three siRNA-
based therapies have been FDA-approved, while another seven candidates are in phase 3 trials. A key
obstacle limiting the scope of siRNA clinical uses, however, is in vivo targeted delivery, a `chronic' problem that
has plagued the development of virtually all antisense therapies. Recent advances in nanotechnology have
produced many nanocarriers such as cationic lipids, polymers, inorganic nanoparticles, and peptides. Although
the cationic charge is important for siRNA condensation and endosomal escape, it interferes with specific
targeting by non-specifically binding to most proteins and cells. To address this fundamental and chronic
problem, here we propose to further develop a one-of-its-kind RNA nanocarrier for delivery of siRNA cocktails
building on a recent breakthrough we made on human RNA-binding proteins (Corey & Gao Nature BME, PCT
filed, US phase granted). Optimized through millions of years of evolution, these proteins are neutral or slightly
negatively charged yet still binding to cargo RNA tightly and with a very high payload. The absence of
excessive cationic charges is in direct contrast to conventional delivery technologies. Through orientation
controlled self-assembly with siRNA-targeting ligand chimeras, the complex simultaneously achieves all the
desired properties for efficient siRNA delivery and cancer treatment."

10849627,"Project Summary/Abstract
The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is a gatekeeper that balances anabolic and
catabolic processes through sensing nutrients. Dysregulations of this pathway lead to debilitating diseases such
as cancer. One of the most abundant essential amino acids in cancer cells is leucine. However, the process of
leucine sensing and transport to activate mTORC1 pathway is not clear. The lysosomal associated
transmembrane protein (LAPTM4b) is an oncoprotein that is involved in localizing leucine transporter to the
lysosomal surface to activate mTORC1 pathway. LAPTM4b also functions as a ceramide transporter and
compartmentalizes ceramide to help cancer cells evade apoptosis. Currently, there is no high-resolution
structure of this protein to elucidate its mechanism of ceramide transport and complex formation with the leucine
transporter. It is paramount to explore the structure and functions of LAPTM4b in detail since more than ~70%
of cancers have LAPTM4b upregulation and LAPTM4b has been linked to poor prognosis.
This proposal focuses on understanding the structure and functions of LAPTM4b and its protein complexes to
lay the foundation on mTORC1 activation through leucine. The structures will be solved using state-of-the-art
cryogenic electron microscopy techniques including Microcrystal Electron Diffraction (MicroED) and Single
Particle Analysis (SPA). In Aim 1, the mechanism of ceramide binding in LAPTM4b will be elucidated by high
resolution structures of LAPTM4b in complex with ceramide using MicroED. The structures solved in this aim
will provide insights on the effect of ceramide to the global confirmation of LAPTM4b and provide basis on
structure guided drug development. Functional studies of LAPTM4b in complex with the leucine transporter in
liposome assays will be investigated in Aim 2. Kinetics of leucine transporter will be evaluated in vitro to provide
insights into how LAPTM4b, ceramide, and ceramide analogues affect leucine transport. In Aim 3, the structure
of the protein complex of LAPTM4b and the leucine transporter will be solved to understand their interactions
and guide drug development to disrupt this complex for mTORC1 inactivation.
The applicant’s career goal is to use tools in structural biology combined with biochemistry experiments to answer
scientific questions on disease-related proteins. Since there is an urgent public health need to alleviate cancer,
the applicant aims to study challenging membrane proteins involved in the mTORC1 pathway. The structure-
function relationship of these proteins will guide future research on designing effective cancer therapeutics to
disrupt this pathway. The proposed research is an integral step of the applicant’s career path. The applicant will
receive intensive training and constructive guidance under a leading researcher in the structural biology field."
10800669,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The national opioid crisis continues to progress in the United States. Few effective treatments for opioid
use disorder (OUD) exist and there is a need for new medications to treat OUD. Treatment for OUD is
complicated by the co-use of alcohol. Chronic opioid and alcohol use, separately, are known to disrupt dopamine
and glutamate homeostasis in the nucleus accumbens; a brain region that mediates the seeking of addictive
drugs. In considering treatments for opioid-alcohol polysubstance use, a therapeutic with the ability to act upon
these common mechanisms, through restoration of nucleus accumbens dopamine and glutamate, may be
advantageous. Oxytocin effectively reduces alcohol and opioid intake and relapse in pre-clinical models
employing the use of only one drug (monosubstance use) and is known to act on dopamine and glutamate
systems. Clinical trials show efficacy for intranasal oxytocin as a treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Based
on the clinical and pre-clinical evidence, we posit that oxytocin may be a viable therapeutic in the treatment of
opioid-alcohol polysubstance use. The experiments outlined in this proposal will investigate oxytocin’s
therapeutic potential in opioid-alcohol polysubstance use. Based on our previous findings that 1) alcohol alters
demand for oxycodone and 2) that oxytocin reduces demand for oxycodone in a monosubstance model, here
we will test the dose-dependent effects of oxytocin on oxycodone demand in male and female oxycodone-only
and oxycodone+alcoholpolysubstance rats using our established oxycodone+alcoholpolysubstance use model.
Based on our prior work showing that oxytocin increases nucleus accumbens dopamine and glutamate efflux in
the nucleus accumbens of cocaine-experienced rats, here we will investigate the effects of oxytocin
administration on dopamine and glutamate efflux in oxycodone and oxycodone+alcohol-experienced rats. The
proposed work will provide important data regarding oxytocin’s therapeutic potential to reduce oxycodone
monosubstance use and oxycodone+alcohol polysubstance use, illuminate potential sex differences in these
effects, and elucidate the role of nucleus accumbens dopamine and glutamate efflux in the effects of oxytocin."

ischemic stroke. Despite the efficacy of ET, 50% of the patients remain disabled at 3 months. Adjunctive
therapies to thrombolysis and ET are needed that provide “bridging neuroprotection” and improve collateral blood
flow. Since presence of collaterals is a major predictor of outcome with ET, a promising new therapeutic avenue
is development of “collateral therapeutics. Translation from the bench (rodent stroke models) to the bedside has
been plagued by failure. The NINDS Stroke Preclinical Assessment Network (SPAN) has been an attempt to
bridge this translational chasm using a multi-site preclinical randomized clinical trial (pRCT) network modeled
after human clinical trials.
The Medical College of Georgia/Augusta University was one of the 6 testing centers in SPAN 1. We were a high
performing center as demonstrated by our consistent infarct size in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion
model. SPAN 1 was successful and demonstrated feasibility with excellent protocol adherence, excellent data
completion and low rates of animal loss in a large, multi-site preclinical network
The Specific Aims for SPAN 2 include:
Aim 1. Test up to 8 selected drugs/interventions in parallel, in collaboration with the Coordinating Center, NINDS
and the other testing laboratories in the SPAN Network, in a multisite pRCT design to select the best
cerebroprotective agent(s) for clinical trial in acute stroke.
Aim 2. Assess short and long-term functional outcomes after experimental stroke, with a specific emphasis on
neuroimaging and behavioral testing.
Aim 3. As part of the SPAN Network, propose new ideas for sub-studies and manuscripts and develop a training
pipeline for the next generation of preclinical stroke investigators.
Expected impact: We will advance the most effective drug/intervention(s) into human clinical trial."
10829368,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes conditions such as emphysema, is the fourth
leading cause of death in the United States. Although progression of COPD can be slowed through lifestyle
changes, the disease is incurable. New treatment/management options emerged recently when the FDA
approved endobronchial valves (EBV) as a Breakthrough Device for the treatment of severe COPD. EBVs
provide a new treatment pathway but their implantation is associated with morbidity and mortality risks. In
addition, not every patient who undergoes implantation has demonstrated the expected benefits from the device.
Trial data indicate that imaging data can be used to help identify patients in whom an EBV will be effective,
showing specifically that effectiveness increases in patients with heterogeneous COPD with complete fissures
in the targeted lobes. The EBV is officially indicated for “severe emphysema in regions of the lung that have little
to no collateral ventilation,” but interpretation of these criteria is imprecise and qualitative. The goal of this
proposal is to develop more unified, robust, and quantitative criteria that will more successfully identify
patients that are likely to respond to EBV implantation. The three most predictive variables identified by
clinical trials to date have been the degree of severity of COPD, the heterogeneity of COPD between adjacent
lobes and fissure completeness, all of which can be assessed by CT imaging. However, quantification of COPD
severity can be confounded by the CT acquisition and reconstruction parameter selections used in the imaging
protocol. These can also affect the ability to assess fissure completeness. In addition, traditional measures of
COPD severity (i.e. Emphysema score) do not distinguish lung destruction from airtrapping, which may be
important in assessing whether a patient is a good candidate for an EBV. In this proposal, we will investigate
methods to standardize CT imaging data that would allow for more robust quantitative image analysis and apply
the resulting methods to develop a more robust criteria for patient selection for the application of EBV devices.
Therefore, our Specific Aims are: (1) To develop methods for robust, quantitative CT estimates of lung
density and the Fissure Integrity Score (FIS). This will involve the application of methods to account for
differences in CT scanners and acquisition/reconstruction parameters as well as machine learning methods to
more accurately assess lung fissure integrity; (2) To develop and test an EBV predictive model using
improved measures. Using the improved estimates of lung density and FIS from aim 1, we will develop and
test a predictive model that distinguishes EBV responders from non-responders; and (3) To extend the EBV
Prediction Model to incorporate additional biomarkers. We will extend the EBV scoring model by
investigating other biomarkers that may provide complementary information, such as distinguishing airtrapping
from COPD and an assessment of lung vascularity. We evaluate the ability of this extended model to improve
our ability to distinguish EBV responders from non-responders."
10815848,"Project Summary
The development of distant metastases accounts for a significant proportion of breast cancer mortality; as many
as 30% of patients initially diagnosed at an early stage will eventually progress to metastatic disease. A key early
step in metastatic progression is an increase in cellular plasticity that enables a subset of tumor cells to lose
residual epithelial features and gain migratory and invasive behavior, molecularly reflected in the epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT). Considerable evidence now points to cancer-associated EMT as a highly
dynamic and reversible process with disseminated cancer cells exhibiting many hybrid intermediate states
(partial-EMT) proposed to possess the greatest potential for aggressive, stem-like, behavior. However, the
epigenetic mechanisms that control such phenotypic plasticity and the role of this process in early invasion
remain incompletely understood. Recently we discovered that the local regulation of RNA polymerase (Pol II)
pause release by the histone methyltransferase SUV420H2 plays an important role in stabilizing the epithelial
‘identity’ of luminal breast cancer cells and in so doing, suppresses breast cancer cell invasion. Specifically, we
find that the local conversion of H4K20me1 to me3 by SUV420H2 enforces RNA polymerase pausing by blocking
recruitment of the MOF/MSL complex, which is in turn necessary for the acetylation of H4K16, recruitment of
pTEFb and Pol II pause release. We further find that SUV420H2-mediated repression constrains the
mesenchymal program in luminal breast epithelial cells, yet is directed to new sites upon TGF-β induced EMT.
SUV420H2 is downregulated in triple negative/basal subtype of breast cancers, and its forced downregulation
or inhibition promotes collective invasion in breast cell spheroids grown in 3D. These and other findings lead us
to propose that the relaxation of SUV420H2-mediated Pol II pausing control is one source of the epigenetic
plasticity and transcriptional heterogeneity that underlies breast cancer cell adaptation and the emergence of
tumor cells with invasive properties. Using a combination of precision run-on sequencing (Pro-seq) and native
chromatin analyses via CUT&Tag technology, we will determine the how the SUV420H2 mediated pause
constraints enforces phenotypic stability and how loss of these constraints allows for transcriptional promiscuity.
We will explore the role of the HEXIM1 / 7SK snRNP complex as a novel ‘reader’ of histone H4 modifications
and its role in SUV420H2-mediated pause control. Lastly, we will determine the impact of dysregulated Pol II
pausing dynamics on transcriptional diversity and the emergence of breast cells with invasive “leader” potential
in a 3D spheroid model of collective invasion. Over the long term, the results of our studies will provide important
insight into the mechanisms underlying epigenetic plasticity and its role in tumor cell adaptation, and a framework
for the development of novel reprogramming strategies to block breast cancer metastatic progression."
10814406,"Uncoordinated or unwanted generation of nerve impulses is a major disabling factor in many medical
conditions. These can affect motor, sensory, and autonomic nerves. Many of these pathological conditions
could be ameliorated by interrupting these abnormal impulses in the periphery. The accepted methods of
inhibiting neural activity are typically pharmacological (local anesthetics, oral medication, channel blockers,
etc.) or surgical (denervation). Electrical nerve block has been proposed and evaluated as a means of
providing real-time rapidly acting and rapidly reversing nerve block and is a potential candidate for inducing
a reliable, rapid, gradable and reversible nerve block.
 Spasticity, or abnormally increased muscle tone, is a significant complication of stroke, cerebral palsy,
spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury. Spasticity causes significant disability including loss of movement,
contractures and chronic pain. Electrical nerve block in the form of a non-invasive direct current block has
been recently shown to produce motor block, when applied through the skin. This block has the properties
of rapidity, reversibility and gradability, and repeatability. We propose an innovative direct current muscle
block strategy delivered through the skin that will reduce spasticity and will aid in the rehabilitation of limb
movement by reducing spasticity. The proposal focuses on development and testing of commercial and newly
designed surface electrodes to show the efficacy of motor nerve block and investigate the parameters that
deliver the direct current safely to both the skin and the target nerve."

Solid tumors are often palpably stiff and more constrained in 3D growth than ‘liquid’ hematopoietic tumors.
Extensive sequencing of dozens of cancer types further indicates that solid tumors within stiff tissues exhibit
many more genetic changes than liquid and soft-tissue tumors [Pfeifer 2017]. Our first hypothesis is a
mechano-genetics hypothesis, namely genetic changes are caused in part by the mechanics of the tumor or
tissue micro-environment. A key limitation of current sequencing methods is that they require killing cells to
isolate the DNA, which prevents tracking a cell before, during, and after a genetic change. A new method is
needed to track genetic changes in living cells under diverse biophysical stresses. Our second hypothesis is
that gene editing can be used to enable tracking some changes in the genetics of single cells in real-time.
 Preliminary results from a new approach already support both hypotheses. RFP (red fluorescent
protein) is fused to a single allele of an abundant constitutive gene in cancer cells or normal cells. For
appropriate genes, we find that RFP-neg cells have lost all or part of the edited chromosome, using methods
that range from single cell DNA-seq to allele-specific PCR. For the one edited chromosome that has been
studied most deeply (of three), the RFP-neg cells divide and pass on the genetic change, and they also exhibit
a ‘go-and-grow’ phenotype consistent with partial loss of a key tumor suppressor. In solid tumor xenografts that
start with freshly sorted RFP-pos cells, the fraction of RFP-neg cells scales strongly with the number of cell
divisions, unlike 2D cultures, and 3D imaging further shows that (i) dividing cells are flattened in vivo, and (ii)
interphase nuclei with high curvature tend to rupture and exhibit high DNA damage. In reductionist 3D culture
studies, confinement and constriction likewise increase GFP-neg cell numbers. The preliminary results directly
support our mechano-genetics hypothesis.
 We will replicate and extend our preliminary results both in vitro and in vivo with the ultimate goals of
identifying mechanically modulated pathways of chromosome loss and consequences for phenotype. For
relevance to patients, the in vivo studies will include liver cancer patient derived xenografts (PDX) that are
gene edited and grown in liver as well as softer and stiffer sites."

 Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are globally distributed fungal pathogens that cause
>220,000 life-threatening infections each year in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients, leading
to >180,000 deaths, >15% of all HIV/AIDS-related deaths, and >70% mortality in low-income countries. In studies
supported by this award, the scope and functions of a- and - sexual reproduction on the evolution and
pathogenesis of Cryptococcus were defined. Sexual reproduction governs population structure, enabling genetic
exchange and promoting clonality, and results in the production of infectious spores.
 During this sustained funding period, significant advances were achieved characterizing the mechanisms
and impact of sexual reproduction on these pathogens and their virulence: 1) discovery of roles of RNAi in
controlling transposon movement and transgene silencing during mitosis and meiosis and characterization of
the consequences of RNAi loss on genome structure and stability; 2) studies on generation and affect of
aneuploidy on drug resistance, pathogenicity, and development, and engineering of a ploidy sensor to analyze
genetic factors contributing to endoreplication during unisexual reproduction; 3) delineation of isolates causing
the C. gattii outbreak in the Pacific Northwest and closely aligned hypermutator lineages, and 4) demonstration
that unisexual reproduction generates genetic diversity de novo and enhances competitiveness for nutrients and
mating partners. In the current proposal, we hypothesize 1) RNAi has been retained and lost in unique isolates
and species, influencing genomic stability and driving evolution of drug resistance and pathogenesis, and 2)
unisexual reproduction is a major force in evolution, global distribution, and impact of Cryptococcus pathogens.
 Our studies reveal unique facets of RNAi and sexual reproduction enabling us to propose new aims to test
these hypotheses. Aim 1 focuses on RNAi in genome stability, elucidating components and mechanisms by
which RNAi controls transposons and silences repetitive DNA sequences, and studying the short-term and long-
term consequences of RNAi loss on drug resistance and pathogenesis in C. neoformans hypermutator clinical
isolates and the RNAi-deficient C. deuterogattii outbreak species. Aim 2 will elucidate unisexual reproduction
pathways and mechanisms involving 1) unisexual reproduction occurring in mixed mating-type populations
and in strains with rearranged genomes as a model of speciation, 2) genetic and environmental factors that
promote unisexual reproduction of global serotype A lineages and analysis of infectious spores in animal models,
and 3) overcoming the Hill-Robertson effect to enable linkage of beneficial mutations and separation of
detrimental and beneficial mutations to enhance fitness and pathogenesis. These studies will advance the
understanding of how genome stability and unisexual reproduction drive pathogen evolution and population
structure, development of drug resistance, and infectious spore production and virulence, with direct implications
for infectious disease evolution, treatment, and prevention."

The major limiting factors to clinical applications of blood-contacting materials, ranging from small catheters to
large extracorporeal circulation (ECC) devices, include platelet activation leading to thrombosis and infection.
Thrombus formation can further lead to obstruction of blood vessels, device malfunction, or even life-threatening
situations such as embolism. Systemic anticoagulation is required to prevent clotting in the devices; however,
one of the resulting major complications of this is bleeding. During the COVID-19 pandemic, extracorporeal
membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has received critical attention as a therapy for patients where mechanical
ventilation alone is ineffective. Significant challenges remain due to the increased risks of thrombosis in the
circuitry that can be further exacerbated by hypercoagulable blood exhibited by COVID-19 patients. Therefore,
there is an urgent necessity and opportunity to combine strategies for preventing thrombosis and infection into
multifunctional device coatings for enhanced patency and safety.
Our work and others have demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) release from polymers prevent platelets activation
and infection. This technology mimics the vascular endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, as well as other
cells in our bodies, producing NO locally to prevent clotting and bacterial biofilm and subsequent infections.
Recently we discovered that all of the positive effects can be achieved from polymers physically blended with
the NO donor molecule S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), which is nontoxic, inexpensive, and easy to
synthesize. Active NO release from the NO donor functionalities in the polymer reduces thrombosis and bacterial
infection polymer-blood interface; however, the NO-release strategy alone is limited by the finite reservoir of NO
donor functionalities within the polymer that limit the duration of the NO availability at the polymer-blood interface.
Our recent work has shown the potential of combining active NO-release with catalytic NO-generating
mechanism in a single polymer. The goal of this proposal is to develop a polymer comprised of a NO donor
covalently bonded to the polymer to provide active NO-release (without leaching) in combination with
immobilized selenocystamine moieties to provide long-term NO-generation. This polymer will combine
NO-release and NO-generating strategies for the first time, resulting in a new generation of polymers
that possess potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and reduce thrombosis by inhibiting
platelet adhesion/activation. The new polymers will be applicable to any blood-contacting device; however,
this proposal will focus on studying the combined NO-releasing/NO-generating strategy in vitro for antimicrobial
properties and in a rabbit extracorporeal circulation model for prevention of thrombosis. Successful completion
of this project will allow progression to early clinical trials and development of a new generation of extracorporeal
circuits that can reduce complications while improving the success of patient care."

Over 50,000 implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are implanted annually in patients ≥65 years old at an
estimated cost of >$2 billion. ICD guidelines draw upon trials enrolling few older patients, yet half of these patients
will either be dead or enrolled in hospice within 5 years of implantation. Though Medicare now mandates shared
decision-making (SDM) for ICDs, few studies have investigated questions vital for older patients, including health
status trajectories and quality of life. Improved SDM for older patients requires moving beyond average treatment
effect estimates to incorporate precision modeling of these outcomes. There is therefore a pressing need for
longitudinal data to support patient-centered SDM for older adults. To extend our prior work and further
improve SDM for older adults considering an ICD, we propose the TRAjectories and Clinical ExpeRiences
of ICD Therapy (TRACER-ICD) Study, a multi-center prospective cohort with the goal of better defining
patient-centered goals and experiences in older patients undergoing ICD implantation. We will
prospectively collect data on geriatric conditions and quality of life from patients at 5 sites, enriched with remote
monitoring data on arrhythmias and physical activity, to evaluate their clinical and functional trajectories (Aim 1).
This cohort will support further refinement of our statistical model to personalize prediction of treatment outcomes
(Aim 2). Lastly, we will use mixed methods to identify optimal implementation strategies for translating these
individualized prediction profiles into SDM for ICDs (Aim 3).This proposal is led by an Early Stage Investigator
whose expertise in cardiac electrophysiology, geriatric medicine, and outcomes research will be complemented
by an experienced research team with a strong record of collaboration.
IMPACT: As the first comprehensive, prospective study of older ICD patients, TRACER-ICD will generate
unique patient-centered and personalized data essential for characterizing outcomes of this common procedure
in a vulnerable population. Much like other large cohort studies in older persons, we anticipate the robust data
emerging from TRACER-ICD will serve as a rich resource that will improve care for millions of patients
considering ICD implantation, and provide essential, evidence-based guidance for translating personalized
outcome profiling into the SDM experience."

 The overall vision of our proposed research is to understand the structural, molecular, and cellular
mechanisms by which germline mutations in protein kinase C gamma (PKCg) drive the neuro-
degenerative disease Spinocerebellar Ataxia 14 (SCA14). PKCg is a Ca2+/diacylglycerol-regulated kinase
expressed only in neurons, including Purkinje cells whose degeneration is a hallmark of the almost 50
subtypes of SCA. We have assembled a team with extensive and complementary expertise in structural
biology of kinases and in PKC mechanisms to understand how these mutations alter the structure and
function of PKCg to contribute to the disease phenotype. The hypothesis driving this proposal is that
mutations are concentrated at specific regions of PKCg that break autoinhibitory contacts to enhance its
activity by a novel mechanism that evades normal quality control degradation. This evasion of
degradation may be a unique feature of the Ataxia mutations as cancer-associated mutations that break
autoinhibitory contacts destabilize PKC and shunt it to degradation. Such evasion of normal quality
control allows aberrantly active PKCg to enhance its signaling output, which in Purkinje cells in the
cerebellum leads to degeneration. Furthermore, we hypothesize that enhanced signaling by PKCg may
underlie the pathology of SCA, in general, as a large fraction of SCAs are caused by mutations in proteins
that control Ca2+ homeostasis or signaling. We aim to combine computational, structural, biochemical,
live-cell imaging, and phosphoproteomics approaches to understand the molecular details of how
disease-associated mutations in PKCg impact function, with the long-term future goal of using this
knowledge to treat this devastating disease."

Mechanoregulation is a fundamental mechanism for the control of dynamic and multiscale biological systems.
A mechanoregulatory network is responsible for the motility of cilia by converting the action of thousands of
individual dynein motors bound to doublet microtubules in the cilium into a single waveform. This waveform
has evolved to efficiently displace fluid, allowing either cell self-propulsion
or the transport of extracellular liquid
over epithelial surfaces. Ciliary motility in humans is therefore essential for the movement of sperm cells, the
removal of bacteria and viruses from the respiratory tract, and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.
Cilia are also used by protozoan pathogens for movement, contributing to their pathogenicity.
The biflagellate
alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, has become the model system for studying the relationship between cilia
ultrastructure and ciliary motilty. Using this organism, we have determined single-particle electron
cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the bases of dyneins and mechanoregulatory complexes natively
bound to doublet microtubules. These structures map the interconnected network of microtubules,
mechanoregulators, and dynein motors in unparalleled atomic detail. The structures reveal the mechanisms
that dock mechanoregulators to doublet microtubules and generate new hypotheses for how they control
dynein behavior. These preliminary structural studies provide a unique opportunity to better understand the
structure, function and assembly pathway of the largest mechanoregulator, the radial spoke. In aim 1, I
propose to elucidate the complete structure of a native radial spoke using cryo-EM and cross-linking mass
spectrometry. Structural information will resolve how its 20+ unique subunits interact and function together to
respond to both mechanical and chemical signals. Due to the high conservation of radial-spoke subunits
among organisms, our structure will provide insights into the etiology of ciliopathy-causing mutations in
humans. In aim 2, I propose to test hypotheses that have arisen from our “on-doublet” structures using an
interdisciplinary combination of structure-guided mutagenesis, waveform analysis by high-speed
microcinematography, and structural characterization using electron cryotomography. This work will provide
experimental evidence for the fundamental molecular mechanisms that control ciliary motility. In aim 3, I
propose to use a proteomic and structural approach to determine the mechanisms of radial-spoke assembly.
This work will test our current structure-based model of assembly and has the potential to identify the first
radial-spoke biogenesis factors. Collectively, these studies will provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into
the mechanoregulatory pathways that control ciliary motility and promises to open new avenues for the
treatment of ciliopathies."

Allergic airway diseases (AAD) such as asthma require ongoing medical management and currently have no
cure. IL-9 and IL-13 are cytokines previously reported to be essential to the pathology of AAD and are largely
produced by CD4+ helper T cell subsets. IL-9 is primarily secreted by Th9 cells whereas IL-13 is classically
associated with Th2 cells. There is additionally a subset of Th9 cells reported to produce Th2 cytokines such
as IL-13. These multi-cytokine producing Th9 cells have demonstrated increased pathogenicity in an allergic
disease context as compared to conventional Th9 cells. Our preliminary data shows that the cytokine TL1A is
sufficient to increase IL-9 expression and induce robust IL-13 expression in Th9 cells in vitro. Also, we show
that blockage of TL1A in a chronic model of AAD significantly decreases the multi-cytokine Th9 compartment.
We hypothesize that TL1A is a critical factor in promoting IL-13 production by Th9 cells which increases their
pathogenic potential in AAD. To test this hypothesis, we propose two aims. In the first aim, we will clarify how
TL1A enhances production of IL-9 and IL-13 in Th9 cells through two sub-aims. The first sub-aim focuses on
identifying TL1A-induced histone modifications associated with heterochromatin or euchromatin at the Il9 and
Il13 loci using ChIP and discerning physical interactions between promoters and enhancers of the Il9 and Il13
loci through Hi-C (high-throughput chromatin conformation capture). In the second sub-aim, we will focus on
assessing the importance of Nfkb2 and Stat5a in the TL1A-mediated increase in multi-cytokine Th9 cells. We
will perform ChIP against Nfkb2 and Stat5a to assess for binding at the Il9 and Il13 loci and will also perform
siRNA knockdown of Nfkb2 and Stat5a and assess whether TL1A is able to enhance development of the multi-
cytokine Th9 compartment in the absence of either Nfkb2 or Stat5a. Completing this first aim will give us
insight into how TL1A signaling impinges on the chromatin landscape of multi-cytokine Th9 cells and the
relative contributions of Nfkb2 and Stat5a in their development. In the second aim of our proposal, we want to
address the pathogenicity aspect of our hypothesis. To do this, we will assess how TL1A-primed Th9 cells
affect disease severity relative to conventionally primed Th9 cells in an OVA-challenge model of murine AAD.
Completion of this second aim will provide much needed information regarding the pathogenicity of TL1A-
induced multi-cytokine Th9 cells. Together, the aims outlined in the following proposal will clarify the
mechanism by which TL1A enhances development and pathogenicity of the multi-cytokine Th9 compartment.
This will provide insight into novel therapeutic targets in the treatment of allergic airway diseases."

 Kidney stones are prevalent and one of the costliest urologic diseases. The available treatment options
such as ureteroscopy or shockwave wave lithotripsy break the stone into small fragments that can lead to future
growth and recurrence of symptoms. This proposal investigates the underlying mechanisms to use acoustic
radiation force produced by an ultrasound multi-element array that can trap a stone, steer it out of the kidney
collecting space, and deposit it in the renal pelvis or UPJ to facilitate its natural clearance. The project seeks to
answer the fundamental scientific hurdles to target and maneuver the stone toward passage.
 Aim 1 develops the analytical framework to optimize pulsing mechanisms to trap and manipulate natural
stones. A proposed semi-analytical approach approximates the scattering with spherical functions to calculate
the forces on natural stones. Predictions will be combined with the investigation of pulsing parameters to optimize
trap robustness and achieve stable trapping of natural stones. Pulsing parameters such as pulse length,
repetition rate, frequency, and phase excitation that control beam shape and uniformity will be adjusted to
eliminate instabilities from rotation and asymmetric forces to achieve stable trapping of natural stones. The aim
success is measured by performing manipulation maneuver natural stones along predetermined paths.
 In Aim 2, the stone acts as a target that can reflect and scatter ultrasound waves which are received back
by the multi-element array. Correction algorithms use the received signal to calculate the element excitations
necessary to correct for beam aberrations from the tissue heterogeneity. Hydrophone measurements will
compare the beams before and after corrections with the unaberrated beam. Finally, manipulation of stones in
kidney phantoms and ex vivo are performed to mimic in vivo conditions.
 In Aim 3, the safety and efficacy of acoustic forceps manipulation will be evaluated. First, different
acoustic intensity exposures will be investigated in ex vivo porcine kidneys for thermal and mechanical injury.
Afterward, natural stones of various sizes will be implemented in the kidney collecting space of live pigs. The
stone will be targeted, trapped, and steered from the kidney collecting space toward the kidney exit using the
acoustic forceps. The treated group will be evaluated against an untreated control group to evaluate efficacy.
Tissue injury mechanisms will be assessed through histological analysis.
 In addition to my research, I will also pursue other activities guided by my mentors toward my career goal
of becoming an independent investigator. These activities include interacting with researchers, industry partners,
and clinicians through seminars and conferences; and participating in workshops on the responsible conduct of
research, and grant proposals and management so that I will be able to pursue independent R-level funding
toward the end of the K25 award. The Applied Physics Laboratory offers the facilities and inter-departmental
collaboration necessary for successful career development in translational research."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects all populations with a penetrance of 50-100% and is kept latent by
innate and adaptive surveillance. However, it is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in conditions of
immune reconstitution and suppression, such as in neonates and recipients of solid organ or hematopoietic cell
transplants. The T cell response to HCMV through classical HCMV peptide-specific αβ cytotoxic T lymphocytes
has been well-studied, and the development of NKG2C+ natural killer cells in response to HCMV infection and
reactivation is under active investigation. In addition to these lymphocytes, however, large populations of αβ-
TCR CD8 T cells that express NKG2C and other NK-associated receptors have also been observed in HCMV-
seropositive healthy donors and patients. These innate-like NKG2C+ CD8 T cells appear to have broad activity
against AML and HCMV-infected cells, no activity against uninfected allogeneic fibroblasts, and reduced
expression of PD-1 in response to CD3 stimulation. RNAseq analysis has revealed that NKG2C+ CD8 T cells
have reduced expression of the transcription factor Bcl11b, critical for cutting off alternative innate fates during
the early thymic development of T cells. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that HCMV exposure induces
an NKG2C+ CD8 T cell population by diverting clonotypic T cells toward an innate fate through the
downregulation of Bcl11b, which alters TCR signaling and promotes alternative recognition pathways beneficial
to leukemia patients. The first aim of the proposal is to evaluate the T cell identity of members of the NKG2C+
CD8 T cell population (clonality, TCR specificity and signaling) and how their transcriptional and epigenetic
programs are altered from other CD8 T cells by Bcl11b loss. The second aim will assess the function of the NK-
associated activating and inhibitory receptors on the NKG2C+ CD8 T cells, with the goal of identifying the
mechanism behind their anti-tumor and anti-HCMV activity. Finally, in a collaboration with the Center for
International Blood and Marrow Transplantation, an extensive hematopoietic cell transplantation patient sample
bank and clinical database will be utilized to determine whether the post-transplantation emergence of an
NKG2C+ CD8 T cell population impacts the risk of leukemia relapse and overall survival. Together, the results
of these studies will elucidate not only the therapeutic potentials of this innate-like T cell population but also how
adaptive and innate fates can be bridged."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that results in persistent and chronic lung infections which
reduce lung function over time. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), an opportunistic bacterial
pathogen that infects patients lungs at a young age and persists throughout life, is a major
contributing factor. Aggressive antibiotic regimes have significantly prolonged the lives of CF
patients, yet Pa populations still dominate during end stage lung disease. Why antibiotic
treatments against Pa ultimately fail remains unclear, but one plausible explanation is that Pa
populations in the CF lung gain higher levels of AMR collectively as they become more
phenotypically and genetically diverse over time. Understanding how Pa population heterogeneity
contributes to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and how Pa population diversity contributes to the
organism’s survival, are important considerations for the future development of effective
diagnostic and treatment strategies. Understanding of in vivo AMR is limited by a lack of empirical
studies focused on how factors such as evolutionary trade-offs and social interactions between
Pa isolates affect heterogeneity and influence AMR. This study will focus on the impact of intra-
species diversity on AMR using a unique set of Pa strain populations already collected from 50
sputum samples. The main goals are to (i) reveal how the level of heterogeneity in Pa populations
in CF patients determines the extent of AMR; (ii) ascertain evolutionary factors that leads to AMR
heterogeneity; (iii) identify in vivo genomic signatures of AMR using Genome Wide Association
Studies (GWAS). The research described in this project will provide valuable insights into
antimicrobial resistance in chronic CF infection, because it will introduce novel methodology for
antimicrobial susceptibility testing in clinics by taking population dynamics into account. Outcomes
could also lead to new models and platforms for studying the evolution of virulence and AMR in
populations. In the future, the ideas presented here can be further expanded to include studies
on other species important in CF and other polymicrobial communities."
10841396,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a highly aggressive brain tumor associated with extremely poor prognosis
and survival. Although relatively rare in the US general population, GBM is the third most common cause of
cancer death in the US active-duty military. The relatively transient nature of clinical responses to currently
available therapies underlines the urgency for the development of additional therapeutic strategies. Multiple
studies have demonstrated the existence of aggressive cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulations in GBM and
characterized their contribution to GBM progression, therapeutic resistance and recurrence; however, efforts to
eliminate or functionally modulate these therapy-refractory subpopulations have thus far met with limited
success. ATP-binding cassette, sub-family B (MDR/TAP), member 5 (ABCB5), an integral plasma membrane
protein first cloned and characterized by the applicant (Frank et al. J Biol Chem. 2003), is highly expressed by
normal tissue-specific stem cells and CSCs in several malignancies, including GBM. ABCB5 is expressed in
primary GBM tumors, in which its expression is significantly correlated with the CSC marker CD133 and with
overall poor survival (Lee et al. J Biol Chem. 2020). In GBM-CSCs, ABCB5 has been shown to mediate
clinically relevant drug resistance to temozolomide (TMZ). ABCB5 blockade inhibited CD133-positive GBM-
CSC self-renewal and abrogated TMZ-induced G2/M arrest. Recently, the applicant identified a novel critical
anti-apoptotic function of ABCB5 required for normal stem cell maintenance (Ksander et al. Nature 2014) and,
as a corollary, for CSC-driven tumor growth, invasion and therapeutic resistance, involving, in part, ABCB5-
dependent regulation of signal transduction of the RTK AXL (Guo et al., J Biol Chem. 2018). Importantly, the
applicant’s most recent preliminary studies further revealed that ABCB5 serves as a novel receptor for
Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), with ABCB5/PIP2 binding shown to be required for PIP3
phosphorylation. PIP2-derived PIP3 serves as a critical mediator of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling,
and hence activation of the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling cascade. Remarkably, inhibition of ABCB5-PIP2
binding through ABCB5 monoclonal antibody blockade or ABCB5 gene knockout (KO) inhibits PIP2
phosphorylation, blocks PIP3 production and interrupts down-stream pAKT activation of the PI3K/pAKT
signaling pathway, impairing RTK signal transduction on ABCB5-positive GBM-CSC. Based on this newly
identified central mechanism, we hypothesize that ABCB5 is critically required for multiple RTK-dependent
functions in human GBM, including stem cell-intrinsic self-renewal, anti-apoptotic, pro-angiogenic and invasive
capacities, and stem cell-driven epigenetic evolution and therapeutic resistance associated cell cycle arrest
(Lee et al. J Biol Chem. 2020). The proposed studies will further support the development of ABCB5 as a novel
therapeutic target in GBM and should pave the way to successful eradication of ABCB5_positive GBM stem
cells in human patients for improved clinical therapy."
10844378,"Gulf War Illness (GWI) is estimated to affect 25-32% of the over 700,000 coalition troops deployed to the
Persian Gulf as part of the First Gulf War. GWI causes a wide array of pain, fatigue, gastrointestinal, skin,
neurologic, and respiratory symptoms. Longitudinal studies have shown little to no overall improvement in
symptoms over time. There is thus a critical need to development new treatments to reduce GWI-associated
morbidity.
The role of the gut microbiome in overall health has been a focus in recent years. The gut microbiome plays
critical roles in metabolism and immunity. Gut microbiota ferment dietary fibers to product short-chain fatty
acids (SCFAs), which play roles in host energy production, appetite, and are thought to play important roles
in the gut-brain axis. SCFAs have also been shown to protect the gastrointestinal (GI) barrier from
proinflammatory cytokines. Preliminary research suggests that the gut microbiome and SCFAs may play a
role in GWI symptoms.
Our overall goal is to better understand the role that SCFAs and the microbiota involved in gut homeostasis
have in causing gut dysfunction and inflammation in Veterans with GWI – the critical next step in developing
potential treatment targets. Our central hypothesis is GWI Veterans experiencing gut dysfunction will have
lower abundances of SCFAs and their associated microbiota than those without gut symptoms and that
those consuming diets higher in dietary fiber will report fewer GI symptoms. We plan to evaluate this
hypothesis using both an existing, longitudinal cohort of 36 GWI Veterans and 33 controls as well as
enrolling a new cohort of 48 GWI Veterans with GI symptoms to investigate the following specific aims:
 Aim 1: To assess the relationship between GWI, gut permeability, and the functional potential of the gut
 microbiome in Veterans with and without GWI using whole metagenome sequencing of previously
 collected stool specimens.
 Aim 2: To examine the relationship between low-grade inflammation measured and the presence of
 short-chain fatty acids and other predicted metabolites identified using the gut metagenomic data in
 Veterans with GWI compared to those without GWI using pre-existing serum and stool samples.
 Aim 3: Implementation of a resistant potato starch intervention to alleviate symptoms associated with
 GWI and improve Veterans’ quality of life.
The proposed research is a direct continuation of pilot funding we received to assess the microbiomes of
Veterans with GWI. Through the proposed research, we will build on the GWI knowledge base through
developing a better understanding of the role of metabolites and the microbiota involved in gut homeostasis in
causing gut dysfunction and inflammation in GWI Veterans – the critical next step in developing potential
treatment targets. We will also conduct an intervention study to evaluate the role of a low-cost, low-risk dietary
fiber intervention (resistant potato starch prebiotic) in alleviating GWI-related symptoms, particularly GI
symptoms. The work proposed here has the potential to not only improve the lives of Veterans with GWI, but
may also help develop treatments for other combat and non-combat related functional GI diseases."

 As a major limitation in contrast enhanced MRI studies is that current MRI methods lack the combination of
accuracy, precision, and temporal resolution to quantitatively measure contrast agents in vivo. We have
addressed this problem by developing dynamic Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) methods that can
rapidly measure T1 or T2 relaxation times with outstanding accuracy and precision (Radiology, 2021). Our key
MRF innovations include a combination of highly undersampled spiral trajectories, low flip angles and multiple
magnetization preparations to avoid errors from B1 inhomogeneities and limited T2 sensitivity. Our MRF methods
can also be adapted to simultaneously detect one or two MRI contrast agents.
 We have recently demonstrated that a new T1-MRF method can be used to dynamically generate
quantitative T1 maps with very fast temporal resolution (~2.5 seconds) during an in vivo Dynamic Contrast
Enhanced (DCE) – MRF experiment. In Aim 1, we will first optimize a new 3D T1-MRF method to evaluate tumor
vascular perfusion (ktrans) with high accuracy and precision in mouse cancer models. We will then evaluate this
Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) – MRF method by measuring changes in vascular perfusion in mouse cancer
models treated with either a vascular disrupting agent or radiotherapy. Our objective is to demonstrate that DCE-
MRF provides superior precision in comparison to standard DCE-MRI methods providing the opportunity to more
sensitively detect the early response to treatment, which can then be translated to the clinic.
 We have also demonstrated that a similar dynamic MRF method can be used to simultaneously measure the
concentration of a T1 contrast agent and a T2 contrast agent within an in vivo tumor model with outstanding
accuracy and precision (Scientific Reports 2017 and 2019). In Aim 2, we will develop a similar two-agent MRF
method to simultaneously detect a pH-dependent T1 contrast agent and a pH-independent T2 contrast agent to
measure extracellular pH (pHe) in tumor models. We will apply our pHe-MRF approach to monitor changes in
tumor pHe after administering treatments that raise and lower tumor acidosis to validate our methodology.
 Our deliverable for this project is a new adaptable, dynamic 3D MRF approach to quantitative measure one
or two MRI contrast agents in vivo. These new 3D DCE-MRF and pHe-MRF methods are the key innovation of
our research. We have developed a rigorous research approach with an emphasis on quantitative evaluations
and validations using multiple established mouse cancer models and therapeutic strategies. We have also
assembled a team of strong and highly experienced investigators, and we have an exceptional research
environment for our studies. Importantly, this successful preclinical imaging project will immediately lead to
clinical translation of the DCE-MRF method for use in cancer patients and will provide the opportunity for effective
pHe assessments in animal models and eventually in patients."

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) represents a significant burden on human health and society. Existing
medications to treat AUD (acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone) have modest efficacy and thus there is
continued emphasis on developing novel and effective drugs. The cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor represents
a promising AUD treatment target with a clearly demonstrated role in modulating many alcohol-related behaviors
and having contributions to the motivational and reinforcing properties of ethanol. The CB1 antagonist/inverse
agonist rimonabant effectively reduces alcohol consumption/self-administration, withdrawal severity, and cue-
induced relapse. Unfortunately, rimonabant was withdrawn in Europe after its initial approval for obesity
treatment because of untoward side effects in humans including anxiety and depression, and development of
other CB1 antagonists/inverse agonists has also been halted. As an alternative strategy, our team has
synthesized and characterized a library of CB1 receptor negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), ligands that bind
to a distinct site than the orthosteric site(s) and modulate the effects of the orthosteric ligands. CB1 NAMs have
been shown to effectively block agonist signaling in multiple in vitro assays, similar to rimonabant. Our studies
demonstrated that RTICBM-74, a CB1 NAM developed by our team, dose-dependently reduced alcohol
consumption without affecting sucrose intake in rats. Importantly, RTICBM-74 showed no anxiety-like behavior
at the same dose in an elevated plus maze (EPM) and an open field, whereas rimonabant displayed anxiety-like
behavior with decreased time in the open arm in EPM. The goal of this proposal is to further optimize these
promising CB1 NAMs to improve the overall properties, particularly increasing solubility and decreasing
lipophilicity (Aims 1-2), and evaluate their effects on alcohol self-administration, relapse-like behavior, anxiety-
related behavior and anhedonia in rats (Aim 3). Together, these studies have the potential to identify novel CB1
NAMs as a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AUD."
10816566,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease in Western
countries. ALD is associated with increased mortality due to a broad spectrum of hepatic pathologies ranging
from simple steatosis to alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), alcoholic hepatitis (AH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular
carcinoma. Recent studies have drawn attention to other factors contributing to ALD, including alterations in
the vasculature, portal tract inflammation and peribiliary fibrosis, and ductular reaction (i.e., activation of the
neuroendocrine phenotype of cholangiocytes). However, very little information is known about the effects of
alcohol on biliary epithelial cells (i.e., cholangiocytes). Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide secreted
predominantly from sensory neurons and is known to play a key role in neuroinflammation via the recruitment
and activation of immune cells. Previous studies have shown an upregulation of the SP/NK1R axis in
cholangiocytes in response to liver injury due to cholestasis and that SP regulates cholangiocyte proliferation
via cAMP/PKA signaling. SP has been shown to increase hepatic fibrosis via differential changes in
cholangiocytes and hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) senescence. However, the SP/NK1R axis's role in ALD has not
been explored. Based on novel preliminary data, the central hypothesis is that ALD-induced ductular reaction
triggers a neuroendocrine phenotype in cholangiocytes whereby secretion of SP stimulates hepatic steatosis
and fibrosis and increases infiltration and activation of immune cells occurs during the progression of ALD in
proposed. To address the central hypothesis, two specific aims are proposed: 1) determine the expression and
distribution of SP/NK1R axis during the progression of ALD in human samples and a mouse model of alcohol-
induced liver injury; and 2) determine the therapeutic potential of the knockdown and/or pharmacological
inhibition of the SP/NK1R axis in a mouse model of ALD and human ALD-derived liver organoids. The
expected outcome of this work is an understanding of the role of the SP/NK1 axis and downstream signaling
mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALD. The successful completion of the proposed studies will have a
significant positive impact on the knowledge of factors regulating ductular reaction observed in ALD and lay the
groundwork for developing novel therapeutic approaches for ALD."

 2 There is growing evidence that canine coronaviruses (CCoVs) can infect humans and be associated with
 3 clinical (mostly acute respiratory) illness in children and adults. Human infections with CCoVs with recombinant
 4 canine-feline-porcine spike proteins (hCFPL-CoVs) have been confirmed in several countries including Haiti
 5 (2017), Malaysia (2018), the USA (2014) and Thailand (2003). The high sequence identity (SI, 99.4%) observed
6 between hCFPL-CoVs from geographically distant Malaysia (CCoV-HuPn-2018) and Haiti (HuCCoV-Z19)
 7 suggests that they may be capable of human-to-human transmission or represents temporal clustering. CCoVs
 8 have not been recognized previously as human pathogens, and the threat they pose to public health is unknown
 9 and may be underappreciated. While complete genome sequencing demonstrated hCFPL-CoVs are canine-
10 feline recombinant alphacoronaviruses, it failed to identify potential ancestral strains likely due to scarcity of
11 CCoV genomic data (only 17 complete genome sequences are available in the GenBank). To address that, we
12 will conduct complete genomic sequencing of up to 200 new CCoVs (from Dr. Decaro) and additional hCFPL-
13 CoVs (if identified in Dr. Gray’s ongoing study).
14 A unique 36 nt (12-aa) deletion identified in the N protein in the SR-rich domain (ΔSR-N) of CCoV-HuPn-
15 2018 may be associated with a recent zoonotic transmission of CCoV-HuPn-2018 and certain biological
16 functions acquired or lost by the virus. While such deletions in the SR-rich region of the N-protein were not
17 previously found in CCoVs, presence of a similar deletion was demonstrated in severe acute respiratory
18 syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) strains early following their emergence into human population but not in
19 SARS-CoV-like bat strains. This deletion was shown to be associated with the altered cellular localization of the
20 N-protein and increased pathogenicity of the SARS-CoV strains bearing them. Because SARS-CoV N-protein
21 plays an important role in inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) production, deletions in it may alter innate immune
22 responses against SARS-CoV as well as other CoVs including CCoV-HuPn-2018. Using reverse genetics, we
23 will evaluate the biological function of this mutation. We propose the following Specific Aims to study the
24 genomics, evolution and human emergence mechanisms of hCFPL-CoVs. Aim 1. Conduct genome-wide
25 analysis of historic and current CCoV strains a) to determine the evolutionary relationship between hCFPL-CoVs
26 and their potentially ancestral strains and b) to identify genetic features associated with CCoV-HuPn-2018
27 infectivity or pathogenicity to human host. Aim 2. To generate and use CCoV-HuPn-2018 infectious clone to
28 investigate the effect of the identified N- deletion (ΔSR-N) on CCoV-HuPn-2018 cellular localization, replication
29 dynamics and the host transcriptome response. These studies will identify the genomic features associated with
30 hCFPL-CoV/CCoV infectivity to humans and generate essential fundamental knowledge regarding the common
31 mechanisms regulating zoonotic transmission of CoVs."
10764934,"This application proposes continued study of a large and unique inner-city cohort of adolescent / young-adult
women (AYA) conducted at Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center (MSAHC) approximately 95% of whom are
Black or Hispanic. We have shown the early quadrivalent (4v) HPV vaccine to be effective, despite some
breakthrough infections by 4vHPV types. However, there remains a paucity of clinical study endpoints such as
“breakthrough infections” of vaccine-HPV types, rates of non-vaccine high-risk HPV (hrHPV) types, and long-
term HPV vaccine antibody titers. These data are important for determining whether HPV booster shots using
the newer nonavalent (9v) HPV vaccine may be warranted for AYAs who received the 4v vaccine (in use from
2007-2016). Only now is there sufficient time-since-vaccination data to conduct the necessary long-term follow-
up studies. Further, data from our group and others show that non-vaccine hrHPV infections in 4v vaccine
recipients are increasing (raising concerns of “viral type replacement”). Moreover, this project will assess
molecular risk factors for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which are at historic levels in
minority AYAs, with a prevalence >30% in MSAHC women. The MSAHC cohort has been unique in providing
data on the strong associations of both chlamydia and hrHPV with the cervicovaginal microbiome (CVM; a
targetable exposure) in women of color. Most recently, we showed that these associations may be due in part
to the effects of the CVM on other aspects of the cervicovaginal milieu, using a novel molecular Next-
Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay (molBV) developed this past funding period. Herein, we will study
combined CVM / cytokine data in inner-city African American and Hispanic AYA women, using the MSAHC
cohort. We will enroll additional women 13-19yo who have received the 9v vaccine. To our knowledge, this will
also be the 1st longitudinal study of the real-world effectiveness of the 9v in minority groups. We will follow-up
all participants (including existing 4v vaccinees 21-25yo in the cohort, up to age 30) using our well-established
protocol of q6mo collection of cervical, anal, and oral exfoliated cell samples, as well as serum, screening for
STIs, detailed risk behavior data, and now also including cervicovaginal wick specimens for measuring local
cytokine levels. The proposed comprehensive design will allow us to address the following Specific Aims: (1)
the real-world, long-term effectiveness of the quadrivalent (4v) and nonavalent (9v) HPV vaccines; (2) factors
that impact HPV vaccine effectiveness such as HPV antibody titers, HPV L1 capsid protein escape mutations,
and possible “viral type replacement”; and (3) the impact of the CVM and local cytokines on HPV and other
STIs. This important epidemiological study of a population difficult to recruit and follow will provide prospective
data on the long-term impact of HPV vaccination, whether a booster shot will be required, and the biological
underpinnings of the cervicovaginal microenvironment on the natural history of HPV and risk of STIs."

 The ultimate goal of this proposal renewal entitled, “New antifungals targeting the synthesis of fungal sphingolipids”, is
to continue the optimization of our 3rd generation compounds that we generated using the previous funding cycle, with the
ultimate goal to subject 1-5 compounds at the end of the renewal to preclinical studies and file an Investigational New Drug
(IND) with the Food Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFI). IFIs are increasingly
responsible for serious life-threatening conditions, particularly in individuals with compromised immunity. For the past 10 years,
we have been working on the research and development of a new class of antifungal agents directed against the synthesis of
fungal but not mammalian sphingolipids. The initial discovery of N’-(3-bromo-6-hydroxybenzylidene)-2-methylbenzohydrazide
(BHBM) as the hit compound from library screening lead us to initiate an intensive research program involving the
combinatorial/parallel synthesis of BHBM derivatives and the assessment of a structure-activity relationship. This program
allowed us to synthesize a 3rd-generation compounds more efficacious than the antifungals currently used in the clinic.
 Our 3rd-generation compounds have secured intellectual property (IP) and a start-up company (MicroRid Technologies
Inc.) with licensing options was co-funded, bringing the necessary expertise to further develop these potent antifungal
compounds. We now seek to optimize pharmacokinetics, toxicology properties without losing antifungal activity. We initiated
the synthesis of several hundred compounds to create a 3rd generation compounds based on D13 (Aim 1) that will be assessed
for antifungal activity and mechanism of action (Aim 2). A few selected compounds will be subjected to toxicology and intensive
PK studies (Aim 3), and, finally, one compound will ultimately be selected for IND filing. Our experience, expertise, and ongoing
effort in this area of antifungal research and the partnership between Stony Brook University, the Long Island High Tech
Incubator, and MicroRid Technologies Inc. place us in a very unique position to achieve these goals."
10837713,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
No one should die from cervical cancer—a preventable disease. Up to 93% of invasive cervical cancer cases
are preventable through human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and early detection, yet over 4,300 individuals
die from cervical cancer annually in the United States. HPV vaccines and cervical cancer screening have yielded
declining incidence over the past several decades but these advances have not improved survival across all
groups. Racial and ethnic minority and low-income women are less likely to receive guideline-concordant cervical
cancer treatment, which is associated with increased cervical cancer-specific mortality. Recent research,
including ours, indicate a need to examine influences beyond individual-level factors, to better understand social,
structural, and health system-level influences on treatment and survivorship outcomes among underserved
women. Our prior work (which demonstrates successful recruitment and follow-up of cases through cancer
registries, linkage with administrative datasets, and multi-modal data collection), and data from others show that
healthcare system characteristics contribute to inequitable access to timely and high-quality care delivery across
the cervical cancer care continuum. To address critical gaps in knowledge, the proposed study seeks to examine
upstream indicators of structural racism as contributors to inequities in receipt of guideline-concordant cervical
cancer treatment and survival in a diverse study sample drawn from population-based cancer registries. Guided
by the NIMHD research framework and socio-structural models, this mixed-methods study will leverage two
National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program registries (New
Jersey State Cancer Registry and Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program), to prospectively examine the
impact of micro- mezzo-, and macro-level factors on receipt of guideline-concordant treatment for and survival
from cervical cancer. We will assemble a multiethnic cohort of individuals diagnosed with cervical cancer
between 2021-2024 and obtain retrospective and prospective data (collected 12 months after baseline) from
cancer registry records, self-reported questionnaires, medical records, and publicly available datasets to address
these specific aims: 1.) Evaluate the association of social and structural factors on receipt of guideline-
concordant care for invasive cervical cancer, 2.) Evaluate the association of social and structural factors on
cervical cancer outcomes, and 3.) Identify actionable strategies for addressing social and structural risks and
health system-level factors to optimize delivery of equitable cervical cancer care through one-on-one depth
interviews with key stakeholders. This study will elucidate the multilevel causes of suboptimal cervical cancer
treatment and poorer survival outcomes among marginalized groups to develop actionable system-level practice
and policy change to address the persistent inequities cervical cancer outcomes."
10841554,"We propose a graduate research training program in Interdisciplinary Biomedical Science and Technology
(I-BioSTeP) at the University of California Merced, a Hispanic-serving institution that opened in 2005. The
major objective of this program is the establishment of the first doctoral level graduate training program at UC
Merced in the biomedical sciences to train diverse cohorts of students to identify and solve pressing
biological problems using quantitative interdisciplinary approaches that prepare them for competitive
careers in the biomedical field. Transformative advances in the biomedical research arena increasingly
require contributions from many different fields and I-BioSTeP leverages the uniquely interdisciplinary
structure at UCM, to join faculty from six different departments forming a diverse, interdisciplinary
research community with a common vision for research and education. Because UCM is still in its
developmental stages, an initiative like I-BioSTeP can have truly transformative impact by establishing a
nucleus of high quality training and research on campus. As part of the program we will establish an I-
BioSTeP designated emphasis (a graduate minor) open to all graduate students in science and engineering
who participate in the new coursework we are developing, thus enhancing the overall graduate training
offerings on campus. Opening a training program for the highly skilled biomedical research workforce
of tomorrow at UC Merced will also have an enormous impact on the region, producing a diverse cohort of
trained professionals that will raise the economic and educational standards of the surrounding educationally
and economically disadvantaged communities.
The specific objectives of our program are (i) to increase the diversity of our trainee cohorts (ii) to ensure
retention and speed up the time to degree (iii) to produce graduates with a broad training in an
interdisciplinary curriculum for biomedical sciences and (iv) to inculcate a sense of belonging and
teamwork skills and (v) to ensure successful transition into the biomedical research workforce. There are
many unique aspects of our proposed program that specifically address these objectives including the
diversity of our current graduate student body and applicant pool that we target, a core interdisciplinary
curriculum of courses with lab components, a summer bridge program that addresses retention by
bringing students out two months before classes and immersing them in hands-on training, mentoring
and professional development such as fellowship proposal writing, an interdisciplinary multiple mentor
structure and a unique career development program that focuses on specific skills that are important in the
biomedical research workforce but are commonly not addressed in such training programs -
business/entrepreneurial skills and science communication skills."

 2 Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycemia (IAH) in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated
 3 with defects in physiological counterregulatory and symptom responses to hypoglycemia as
 4 leading to increased risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH). Education and technologies such as
 5 hybrid closed loop (HCL) insulin delivery reduce hypoglycemia exposure, but restoration of
 6 awareness is variable. Existing tools for screening and measuring awareness, such as Clarke
 7 and Gold scores lack sensitivity to detect changes in hypoglycemia awareness in the CGM
 8 era of “electronic awareness”. Therefore, we need to construct and validate more advanced
 9 tools that can objectively assess IAH. This project seeks to understand the factors that
10 contribute to the successful restoration of awareness of hypoglycemia using HCL in
11 those with T1D and IAH and validate the tools required to assess changes in awareness
12 status. To address the specific questions in the call, we propose 5 sub-studies.
13 1. Study 1: To understand the physiological responses to experimental hypoglycemia in T1D
14 with NAH and the impact of a switch to hybrid closed loop on these responses over time.
15 2. Study 2: To determine if reducing exposure to biochemical hypoglycemia by switching to
16 state of the art hybrid closed loop technology can restore physiological responses to
17 experimental hypoglycemia over time in individuals with T1D and IAH
18 3. Study 3: To determine if hypoglycaemia specific education (HARPdoc) that addresses
19 cognitions and beliefs associated with IAH that are possible barriers to hypoglycemia
20 avoidance (even with technology) leads to further reductions in hypoglycemia exposure
21 and improved physiological responses to hypoglycemia in individuals with T1D and IAH
22 4. Study 4: To determine the factors associated with restoration of physiological responses
23 to hypoglycemia. We will categorise participants into Restored (R-IAH), Partial ( P-IAH) or
24 Sustained (S-IAH) impaired awareness of hypoglycemia based on changes in physiological
25 (epinephrine and symptom) responses to experimental hypoglycemia in clamp studies and
26 investigate demographic, glycemic and behavioural factors associated with each category.
27 5. Study 5: To determine diagnostic cut-offs for Normal, P-IAH and S-IAH responses to
28 experimental hypoglycemia for current self-report questionnaires and a novel tool named
29 the HypoMETRICS app. We will also use the HypoMETRICS app to explore differences
30 between “physiological” and “technological” awareness of hypoglycemia."
10817719,"Every year in the United States automobiles kill about 6,000 pedestrians and injure another 70,000, a significant
health burden, especially for cities where pedestrian deaths and injuries are most common. Over 35% of all
fatally struck pedestrians are under the influence of alcohol at the time they are killed. Many cities are developing
and promoting nightlife districts, prominently featuring alcohol-serving establishments, as part of economic
development plans to revitalize urban spaces. By clustering alcohol outlets, these urban initiatives may also
cluster intoxicated pedestrians near intoxicated or distracted drivers. Currently, research and public policies
focused on preventing pedestrian fatalities fail to account for the built environments pedestrians walk into when
they leave alcohol-serving establishments, despite the risks these environments pose for pedestrian injuries and
fatalities. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that homeless individuals are at particular risk for pedestrian
injury, and they make up a significant percentage (~25%) of the pedestrians killed while under the influence of
alcohol. Cities across the U.S. are developing plans to prevent all pedestrian fatalities, yet none of these city
plans even mention the role of alcohol use by pedestrians or have action items to address this modifiable risk
factor. The broad objective of this proposal is to conduct a nationwide geographic case-control study of
pedestrian fatalities to identify modifiable retail, built, economic and social environment risk factors within cities,
especially risk factors related to alcohol sales and consumption. Case locations will be urban street segments or
intersections where pedestrians were fatally struck from 2017-2018 and two control locations, street segments
or intersections where fatalities did not occur, will be matched to the case locations. The presence of alcohol
retail establishments (e.g. bars, clubs, liquor stores), nightlife districts, services for the homeless and
encampments and informal sheltering locations (e.g. bridges and overpasses) will serve as the key independent
variables of interest. We hypothesize that alcohol-involved pedestrian fatalities are a distinct subtype of
pedestrian fatality and have different built environment risk factor profiles from pedestrian fatalities that do not
involve alcohol. Neighborhood-, street- and intersection-level features for case and control locations will be
measured via GIS analyses and via neighborhood audits conducted using Google Street View and our online
research tool, the Computer Assisted Neighborhood Visual Assessment System (CANVAS). As part of this
proposal we will expand the capabilities of CANVAS for conducting nationwide virtual neighborhood audits via
Google Street View. We will also test whether proximity to retail alcohol outlets, nightlife districts or services for
the homeless increases risk for pedestrian fatality and whether this risk is heightened by built environments that:
encourage pedestrian activity; place pedestrians near road traffic; or cause distractions to pedestrians or drivers.
This project will be highly innovative as the first national study to identify modifiable environmental characteristics
related to alcohol as potential solutions to reduce pedestrian injury risk within cities."

A central goal for the second half of the BRAIN Initiative is to develop new circuit-based treatments for
brain diseases. However, improving care for neuropsychiatric illness will require not only discovering
interventions, but also ensuring that research products meet patients’ needs and are accessible to
underserved groups. While neuroethics to date has largely examined individualistic concerns (such as
privacy, consent and identity), this application uses closed-loop neuromodulation as a circuit-based
treatment paradigm for examining neuroethical challenges at a societal level such as equity/access and
the democratization of research methods. To address challenging topics including socioeconomic,
racial/ethnic, and geographic disparities will require special expertise in rigorous social science and in
community engagement, to include perspectives missing in academic neuroethical discourse. Applying
principles of community-engaged research, a Community Advisory Board will be recruited to meet
quarterly with project leaders and advise on preliminary findings, research methods and the
dissemination of results. Nationwide collaborations have been developed to facilitate research pursuing
three specific aims: 1) Compare ethical concerns about novel neurotechnology among diverse groups;
2) Examine practice and patient factors in access to closed-loop neuromodulation in varied clinical
settings; and 3) Investigate ethical and practical challenges in reducing barriers to closed-loop
neuromodulation research. Aim 1 will address the views of prospective patients/users about
neurotechnology in a nationally-representative sample with a focus on underserved groups. Aim 2 will
examine the clinic setting via comparative ethnographic research in epilepsy centers using NeuroPace
RNS treatment, which is currently the only FDA-approved and commercially available closed-loop brain
implant, and therefore can be used to anticipate broader challenges in psychiatry and neurology with
future applications of closed-loop approaches. Aim 3 will utilize a novel opportunity for studying ethical
concerns in research through a new NIH-funded international collaboration to disseminate expertise and
best practices in closed-loop neuromodulation. The approach is innovative, in the applicants’ view,
addressing societal-level neuroethical concerns with advanced social scientific and community
engagement methods not widely applied in neuroethics. The proposed research is significant because it
addresses considerations of equity and democratization that are critical to future neurotechnology and
neuroscience. Ultimately, this work will broaden the scope of normative issues addressed in
neuroethics, such as distributive justice and tensions in broadening research. In neurotechnology, the
work will contribute to fuller engagement with ethical challenges in the adoption of new techniques and
the early integration of neuroethics in efforts to lower research barriers."

A major goal of cancer research is to define the composition of the tumor micro-environment (TME) across
individuals. Once measured, differences in TME composition can be correlated with prognosis, targeted by
therapy, and used to test or generate novel therapeutic hypotheses. Our appreciation of TME complexity was
significantly advanced with the development of single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq). But scRNA-Seq
remains expensive, noisy at the level of single cells, and has a slow turn-around time (typically weeks). scRNA-
Seq also typically analyzes only 1000s of cells per sample. As a result, scRNA-Seq is not practical for deep
profiling of large patient or animal cohorts, or for routine hypothesis-testing in cancer research. Faster and
more scalable alternatives to scRNA-Seq are flow cytometry (FC) and Cytometry by Time of Flight (CyToF) but
these methods do not resolve the complexity seen in the TME by scRNA-Seq. Thus, there is an unmet need
for rapid, sensitive, highly-multiplexed TME profiling.
The focus of this grant is to address this unmet need by advancing a versatile and novel `micro-capsule'
technology. Capsules represent an evolution of droplet microfluidics, which is a mature technology for carrying
out single cell genomic assays in nanoliter-scale compartments, isolated by oil. Capsules overcome severe
technical limitations of water-in-oil droplets: their fragility to handling, and their complete isolation by immiscible
oil. By contrast, capsules are resilient, semi-permeable compartments that can be dispersed and processed in
any aqueous biological buffer. Prior to this proposal, we optimized capsules to retain cellular mRNA and DNA,
while simultaneously enabling rapid exchange of salts, enzymes, primers and probes with the surrounding
medium. We have now shown that capsules enable multi-step reactions and serial analyses on single cells and
specifically on surface proteins and mRNA molecules. This in turn enables rapid, versatile, highly-multiplexed
cytometry.
In this R33 we will benchmark and optimize two related capsule-derived methods: the first, “CapFlow”,
implements robust multiplexed mRNA flow cytometry with rapid capsule-based signal amplification. The
second, “CapCycle”, extends CapFlow to quantifying the abundance of ≥50 gene transcripts and cell surface
proteins, by replacing flow cytometry with cyclic imaging of immobilized capsules. With these methods,
capsules will enable sensitive, versatile, rapid, low-cost, highly-multiplexed phenotyping of tumor
heterogeneity. Thus, this proposal fills an important analytical gap, and develops a versatile microfluidic
technology with long-term potential to improve biological assays on single biomolecules and cells."
10824427,"Project Summary
 Our laboratory has a long standing interest in understanding the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of
the proton pumping vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase, V1Vo-ATPase), a dynamic multisubunit membrane integral
rotary motor enzyme found in all eukaryotic cells. The V-ATPase acidifies the lumen of organelles and, in
professional acid secreting cells, the extracellular space. Enzyme function is required for fundamental cellular
processes such as endocytosis, bone remodeling, protein trafficking, acid-base balance, sperm maturation,
and neurotransmitter release. While complete loss of V-ATPase function is embryonic lethal, partial loss or
hyperactivity is associated with numerous human diseases such as osteopetrosis, diabetes, male infertility,
neurodegeneration, and cancer. Moreover, some viruses such as influenza rely on the acidic environment
created by the V-ATPase for infection. Fighting these diseases on a molecular level will require a detailed
understanding of the structure, catalytic mechanism and regulation of the eukaryotic V-ATPase. In cells, V-
ATPase activity is regulated by a unique mechanism referred to as “reversible disassembly”, wherein the
complex reversibly dissociates into V1-ATPase and Vo proton channel, with both sub-complexes becoming
autoinhibited. Despite its important role in V-ATPase physiology, the molecular mechanism of reversible
disassembly is poorly understood. This gap in knowledge is largely due to a lack of both high-resolution
structural information and an in vitro model system to study the process under defined conditions, aspects that
we are working to address. An interesting, and technically challenging feature of the mammalian V-ATPase is
that most of its subunits are expressed as multiple isoforms. However, as such isoforms display differential
tissue enrichment, they may provide opportunities for targeted therapeutics. Indeed, several diseases have
been linked to malfunction or upregulation of specific isoform containing V-ATPase. However, how different
isoform combinations determine tissue localization, and whether these isoform specific complexes have unique
biochemical or regulatory properties, is currently unknown. We have started to develop a system to purify wild
type and mutant forms of human V-ATPase in an isoform specific fashion for biochemical and structural
analyses. Further, we are developing single-domain antibodies (Nanobodies) against specific subunit isoforms
to serve as research tools, and to explore isoform specific modulation of V-ATPase activity in disease. Our
research program employs the tools of structural biology, cell biology, biochemistry and biophysics to address
broad questions of V-ATPase catalytic and regulatory mechanisms. For some fundamental aspects of V-
ATPase structure and regulation, we study the enzyme from yeast, a well documented model system for the
human V-ATPase. We use human tissue culture for questions that cannot be addressed in yeast, such as
structure and biochemical properties of specific isoform containing enzymes. The long term goal of our
research is to find ways to modulate the activity of disease causing V-ATPases in an isoform specific way."

Infertility is a common condition that affects over one-tenth of couples attempting to conceive, and the costs of
managing infertility exceed 18 billion US dollars worldwide. There are significant gaps in our knowledge of the
underlying mechanisms and risk factors for infertility, and these gaps impede the development of targeted
treatments that address the root causes of infertility. Project 2 will fill these gaps by conducting human genetic
studies of unprecedented scale to study infertility, and related reproductive traits. Through collaborations with
large biobanks worldwide, we will access data from over 18 million individuals to identify genetic variants
associated with risk for female and male infertility as well as those associated with a number of fertility-related
traits, including sex-hormone concentrations, pubertal onset, and pituitary gland and olfactory bulb size (Aim 1).
We will then use state-of-the-art computational approaches to pinpoint the specific variants, genes, pathways,
and cell types that influence these conditions and traits (Aim 2). These approaches include fine-mapping,
pathway analyses, and intersection of genetic association data across studies, and they will be fueled by data
from Project 2, Aim 1, as well as data on genetic variants associated with rare infertility conditions identified in
Project 1, data on gene expression generated by the Core, as well as extensive publicly available data on genetic
linkage patterns, gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and other experimental findings. We will then
integrate all these findings to understand how infertility and the reproductive traits studied in Aim 1 relate to each
other, with the rare infertility conditions in Project 1, and with general reproductive and non-reproductive health
(Aim 3). Phenome-wide association studies will analyze a large number of phenotypes to reveal novel phenotypic
associations for the genetic variants studied, investigations of pleiotropy will determine the extent to which the
genetic causes of these conditions and traits overlap, and the technique of Mendelian randomization will be used
to infer causal relationships. By leveraging the power of large-scale human genetics, this project will lead to a
comprehensive understanding of the biology of fertility and infertility, identify targets for fertility treatments, and
reveal the pathways by which reproductive health influences overall health."

The Center for Reproductive Medicine (CRM) represents a multi-disciplinary program to explore the genetic
architecture of infertility. The CRM Genomics Core (GC) described herein envisages providing a centralized and
catalytic resource for genomic variation, statistical association, and functional perturbations for all components
of this overarching CRM program. This genomics hub will specifically catalyze discoveries by providing expertise
in the data and methods that will be leveraged for deeper insights into rare and common forms of infertility in
Projects 1 and 2, respectively. The GC will also serve as the focal point for cross-fertilization of data, analyses,
and functional modeling across the program. Over the last several years, we have developed a compendium of
computational tools, statistical approaches, and functional genomics methods to interrogate the mutational
spectrum of variation in human diseases. Our methods incorporate joint analyses of short variants (SNVs, indels)
and structural variants (SVs), including canonical balanced SVs and copy number variants (CNVs), as well as a
diverse catalog of complex SVs that are surprisingly abundant and associated with an array of human disease.
These studies have required methods to uniformly generate, process, and rigorously analyze genomics datasets
for association studies. In the GC, we will discover and annotate variation, interpret association against
population-scale datasets in excess of 1,000,000 genomes from our related studies, and perform scalable
engineering to generate an allelic series of perturbations in genes associated with rare and common forms of
infertility using human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived GnRH models. Overall, we will support the
CRM by completing three objectives related to providing datasets, methods, and functional resources.
Objective 1 will develop a comprehensive genomics resource from exome, genome and long-read
sequencing, and uniform data processing of the CRM cohorts. Objective 2 will perform integrated rare variant
association and interpretation of these datasets by jointly analyzing CRM cohorts with population-scale
datasets generated in our genome aggregation database (gnomAD) project and complex disease consortia
studies. Objective 3 will then perform scalable CRISPR perturbation of infertility genes in GnRH neuronal
models by engineering loss-of-function mutations and an allelic series for select infertility genes.
Transcriptional profiling in the genomics core will identify signatures associated with perturbation of these
infertility genes, and will seek convergence of these signatures on a small number of infertility relevant pathways.
All CRISPR-engineered models will be distributed relevant projects for further functional assays, and all data
and models will be made openly available for distribution to the community. These objectives in the genomics
hub of the CRM will thus provide datasets, gene discoveries, and CRISPR-engineered isogenic models to
facilitate new insights into infertility within the CRM and the broader research community."
10808161,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Black women in the US are twice as likely to experience a preterm birth (PTB), a low birth weight (LBW) infant, or the
death of a child before age one compared to white women. This profoundly disturbing racialized pattern of adverse
reproductive outcomes has endured for as long as data have been available. Decades of medical and public health research
have documented the magnitude of racial inequity in maternal and child health, and it persists although the total infant
mortality rate has declined and despite efforts aimed at improving access to prenatal care and early childhood initiatives.
The intractability of this problem suggests structural racism—the ways in which societies foster discrimination by
reinforcing inequitable systems that in turn reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values, and distribution of resources—as a
root cause of these racial health inequities. The overall objective of the proposed project is to understand the degree to
which acts of police violence—a pervasive form of structural racism—negatively impact reproductive health outcomes
among black women and exacerbate inequities in adverse birth outcomes at the population level. This project will test the
hypothesis that incidences of racialized police violence have both a direct and an indirect link to negative birth outcomes
among black women compared to white women. Understanding the mechanisms through which racialized police violence
is a source of psychosocial stress for black women will lead to novel intervention targets that may reduce racial inequities
in birth outcomes. The project has three specific aims. Aim 1: Quantify the risk of PTB and LBW related to spatial and
social proximity to the killing of a black man by police and the ensuing civil unrest. This population-based cohort study
leverages vital records from the Minnesota Department of Health to assess if black women experienced worse birth
outcomes following the killing of Philando Castile by police and the subsequent civil unrest. It will also assess if spatial
proximity to the site of the incident and civil unrest increased risk for worse birth outcomes among all women. Aim 2:
Quantify the impact of police violence on PTB and LBW risk among black women. Using a quasi-experimental causal
framework and leveraging 13 years of birth records available from every county in the US, this aim assesses if incidents
of police violence across the US are associated with greater risk for PTB and LBW among black women. Aim 3:
Illuminate the lived experience of how racialized police violence impacts black women during pregnancy. An online
survey administered to black women (n=200) who were pregnant and living in two communities with incidents of high-
profile police violence (Twin Cities, MN, and Baton Rouge, LA) will assess psychosocial stress related to police violence,
followed by 50 in-depth interviews in each city with women to characterize the impact of police violence on birth
outcomes and to identify patterns and mechanisms. The long-term goal of this project is to eliminate inequities in birth
outcomes for black women. This timely and urgent project not only aligns with NICHD’s goal of preventing pregnancy-
related complications and reducing maternal and infant death, but it will further underscore the negative impact of
racialized police violence on society, bolstering arguments for large-scale change in police-community interactions."

This proposal will investigate the role of small non‐coding RNAs, termed microRNAs (miRs), in the regulation
of sodium (Na+) transport in the distal kidney nephron. We will investigate the hypothesis that the
mineralocorticoid hormone, aldosterone regulates the expression of specific miR clusters in the distal kidney
nephron cortical collecting duct (CCD). These miRs target mRNAs to alter Na+ transport. Expended up-
regulation of the aldosterone-induced miRs then feedback to reduce the aldosterone response (negative
feedback regulation). We propose to test this novel role of miRs in Na+ homeostasis but using a miR cluster
KO mouse line. The miR-17~92 cluster will be deleted from the kidney nephron using a conditional, inducible
KO line and the impact on long-term aldosterone signaling will be investigated. In the second part of the
proposal, the mechanism the aldosterone-regulated miRs use to alter Na+ transport will be investigated in
primary kidney cells."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease worldwide; progression to
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis occurs in a subset of patients and is the second leading indication
for liver transplantation in the United States. The factors leading to the development of NAFLD and progression
to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), including inflammation and fibrosis, are poorly understood. Moreover,
there is a lack of effective therapies for these disorders. Studies in animals and humans suggest that estrogen
deficiency may be an important mechanism underlying the development of NAFLD and progression to NASH.
However, no prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled studies have examined the impact of estrogen
administration on steatosis, inflammation or fibrosis in postmenopausal women with NASH. Our overall
hypothesis is that low-dose, transdermal estrogen administration will decrease hepatic fat, inflammation and
fibrosis in women with biopsy-proven NASH. Further, we will explore estrogen’s immune and metabolic effects
in the liver, including changes at the single-cell level. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that estradiol administration
will decrease fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis in women with biopsy-proven NASH. Aim 2 will determine the
impact of estrogen on intrahepatic metabolic pathways and on the transcriptional landscape of intrahepatic
immune cells. We hypothesize that estrogen will decrease fibrogenesis, decrease hepatic de novo lipogenesis,
and increase lipid beta oxidation. These hypotheses will be tested with a rigorously designed, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study of the effects of low-dose transdermal estrogen replacement therapy in
postmenopausal women with NASH. State-of-the-art liver imaging, liver biopsies, whole liver transcriptomics and
unbiased single cell RNAseq by SeqWell will be leveraged to investigate these hypotheses. We have assembled
a team of investigators with extensive research experience in endocrinology (Dr. Miller), NAFLD (Dr. Corey),
liver imaging (Dr. Bredella), and hepatic immunology (Dr. Lauer), which is uniquely positioned to carry out this
multi-disciplinary proposal. Elucidating the effects of low-dose, transdermal estrogen administration on liver
fibrosis, inflammation and steatosis has the potential to further our understanding of this disease process and
identify new therapeutic targets where few currently exist."

Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease. However,
improvements in long-term allograft survival have not matched the observed improvements in the management
of rejection. Progressive allograft dysfunction is frequently encountered clinically. The final common pathway of
cumulative and incremental renal damage from several etiologies identified by histopathology is interstitial
fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), which is associated with progression of renal dysfunction and reduced allograft
survival. Histopathologic assessment and staging of IFTA requires tissue sampling, which is limited due to its
invasive nature, risk of complications, inter-individual variability and sampling error.
In this proposal, we will test a non-contrast advanced multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol comprised of
advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) as
noninvasive markers of renal allograft fibrosis. This is motivated by our preliminary data demonstrating that
mpMRI yields highly repeatable parameter measurements that capture allograft fibrosis. Our preliminary
experience correlating mpMRI with IFTA is valuable, as confounding physiologic and pathophysiologic
variables such as vascular flow, edema and other Banff phenotypes commonly co-exist. The multiparametric
approach allows us to simultaneously capture and characterize these concurrent physiologic and
pathophysiologic processes. As a secondary objective, we will assess the value of urinary RNA level based
biomarkers, which have been previously validated for the diagnosis of IFTA.
In this proposal, we aim to: 1) acquire data in patients undergoing indication and surveillance biopsy, using a
non-contrast mpMRI protocol comprised of advanced diffusion weighted and relaxometry methods in order to
accurately detect and stage allograft IFTA, and 2) other histopathological Banff measures of inflammation. We
will build and validate diagnostic models using advanced statistical methods including machine learning in
independent model-building and validation sets of renal transplant patients for detection and staging of each
Banff measure, and assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of fibrosis. 3) We will evaluate the
performance of mpMRI and urinary biomarkers to predict renal outcomes in a longitudinal study for the entire
patient cohort up to 24 months.
Our long-term objective is to validate a robust quantitative advanced mpMRI approach and develop models
that accurately and non-invasively measure renal allograft fibrosis and clinical outcome, which may potentially
impact the care of renal transplant patients by enabling early detection, the non-invasive longitudinal
monitoring of disease, therapeutic efficacy of new drugs and for prognostication."

Meiotic recombination is necessary for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis, and in creating
genetic diversity in populations through the shuffling of alleles. Changes in the number of recombination events,
or recombination rate, can thus have impacts on individual organismal health via meiotic failure, and on
population fitness by influencing the efficacy of selection. And yet, variation in recombination rate has been
documented across the genome, and among populations and species. Despite progress in cataloguing
recombination rate variation, how and why recombination rate changes remains largely unknown. The goal of
my research program is to investigate the genetic and environmental causes of recombination rate variation, and
the consequences of recombination rate variation on genome evolution. Over the next five years, my lab will use
experimental evolution and genomics in Saccharomyces yeast to explore three main questions. First, how does
the recombination landscape change over short time scales? We are using whole genome sequencing to
construct genome wide recombination rates in multiple populations of Saccharomyces uvarum. We seek to
identify how the double strand breaks that initiate recombination are repaired as crossover or non-crossover
gene conversion events, and how these two types of events are conserved or divergent between populations.
This will be the first study to examine evolution in both types of recombination events in multiple populations,
offering an unprecedented view of the mechanism underlying recombination rate variation. Second, we are
investigating how adaptation to a new environment alters recombination rate. Recombination rate plasticity
has been linked to changes in temperature and other environmental factors for many years, but explicit tests of
environmental adaptation influencing recombination rate evolution (or vice versa) are missing. We will evolve
cold tolerant S. uvarum populations in the lab for increased thermotolerance, and use whole genome sequencing
to identify any shifts in recombination rate or the distribution of crossover and non-crossover gene conversion
events that occur as a result of adaptation to temperature. Finally, we’re exploring how recombination rate
influences the distribution and persistence of introgression in the genome following hybridization. We
are evolving admixed strains from 2 diverging populations of S. uvarum with partial reproductive isolation to test
the hypothesis that introgression is reduced in regions of low recombination due to selection against weak,
negative epistatic interactions. We’ll compare the distribution of introgression in evolved populations to
recombination maps to better understand what forces shape genomes in the generations after hybridization.
Overall, my research will leverage the benefits of working with the tractable Saccharomyces system to empirically
test longstanding hypotheses of how and why recombination changes over time."

 Transfer-RNAs (tRNA) are key molecules of translation, and their ability to accurately and
efficiently decode genetic information is dependent on post-transcriptional modification of
nucleotides, particularly in the critical anticodon stem loop (ASL). Deficiencies in these
modifications can be lethal, and have been linked to a variety of pleiotropic phenotypes and
human disease states. The long-term goals of this research program are to develop a detailed
understanding of the biosynthetic pathways to complex tRNA modifications, the roles these
modifications play in cellular physiology, and to identify novel targets in their pathways for
therapeutic intervention.
 This application specifically focuses on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of formation
and specificity of the universal ASL modification threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A) in bacteria,
and elucidating the regulatory pathways that link it to bacterial cell wall synthesis. t6A is a complex
modification found in the ASLs of tRNAs decoding ANN codons, and is critical for tRNA function
by preventing ribosomal frameshifting, promoting cognate codon recognition, facilitating tRNA
translocation, and serving as a recognition determinant for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.
 In the previous funding period we arrived at the first mechanistic proposal for the t6A
biosynthesis cycle in which the proteins TsaC2, TsaB and TsaD function together to install
threonylcarbamoyl on A37 of substrate tRNA, while TsaE provides an unexpected ATPase activity
required for turnover of the cycle. We also discovered that TsaE is a novel bacterial S/T/Y kinase,
and our bioinformatic analyses suggested a linkage of t6A biosynthesis to cell wall metabolism,
which raises new questions about the widely reported cell wall synthesis phenotypes associated
with t6A deficiency.
 In the current application we propose 4 specific aims that will allow us to elucidate 1) the
tRNA specificity of the bacterial t6A system, 2) the mechanism of TC-AMP transfer in t6A
biosynthesis, 3) the mechanism of ATP-hydrolysis driven turnover of the t6A cycle, and 4) the links
between TsaE and cell-wall synthesis and/or cell division. This work will be accomplished through
a combination of biochemical, structural, genetic, and physiologic approaches."

Dopamine (DA) is important for many behaviors such as motivation, learning, and movement. Malfunction of
DA signaling is related to various psychiatric and motor symptoms, and DA-related drugs are commonly used
to treat schizophrenia, ADHD, OCD, autism, personality disorders, and mood disorders. Although DA regulates
various behaviors, it had been believed that the role of DA neurons is uniform: to signal ""reward prediction
error"" (RPE), the discrepancy between actual and predicted reward value. Recently however, we and others
showed that DA neurons projecting to different regions in the striatum exhibit distinct properties and serve
distinct functions. We found that DA in the anterior striatum (AS), central and posterior striatum (CS/PS), and
`tail' of the striatum (TS) signal canonical RPE, regulate the execution of skills, or signal threat prediction error,
respectively. Therefore, dopaminergic projections from the midbrain to the AS, CS/PS, and TS must be
differentially and precisely established for them to regulate our brain functions properly. However, the manner
and molecular mechanisms by which specific dopaminergic connections are established in the striatum are
unknown. To address this question, we have searched for synaptic, homophilic cell-adhesion molecules that
are differentially expressed in the AS, CS/PS, and TS. We identified that three Protocadherins (PCDHs),
PCDH17, PCDH10, and PCDH19, are selectively expressed in the AS, CS/PS, or TS, respectively, during
development and in adults. Furthermore, in the midbrain, PCDH17, 10, and 19 are expressed by DA neurons
projecting to the AS, CS/PS, or TS, respectively. Based on these expression patterns, we hypothesize that
PCDH17, 10, and 19 are the molecular codes for the AS-, CS/PS-, and TS-projecting DA neurons, respectively,
and that they play critical roles for the establishment of functionally segregated DA circuits. To test these ideas
we have generated novel mouse lines in which Cre is expressed under the Pcdh promoters, and constitutive
(null) and conditional knockout (KO) mice for each of the three PCDHs. Using these mouse lines, we propose
to: Aim 1: Determine whether PCDH17, 10, and 19 are the molecular codes for functionally segregated DA
neurons in adults. Aim 2: Investigate the effects of inactivation and activation of PCDH-expressing DA neurons
during various stages of development. Aim 3: Examine the role of PCDH proteins in the establishment of
specific DA connections. We will use interdisciplinary approaches with molecular/cell biological, histological,
mouse genetic, electron microscopic, electrophysiological, in vivo recording/imaging, and behavioral
techniques to address these aims. Our work will molecularly define functionally distinct DA circuits and reveal
how specific DA circuits establish in the mammalian brain. PCDH17/10/19 are implicated in different disorders:
PCDH17 in mood disorders and schizophrenia, PCDH10 in autism and OCD, and PCDH19 in epilepsy and
personality disorders. Thus, our study may also provide a link between specific DA circuits to certain disorders
and suggest novel strategies to treat these devastating disorders."
10841517,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human infertility is a global problem and failure of embryo implantation accounts for a significant
percentage of pregnancy failure during both natural pregnancy and in vitro fertilization procedures.
Implantation is an extremely complicated process requiring precisely controlled hormone signaling,
growth factor signaling, and cell-cell interactions. Decidualization is a required step in the implantation
process. It involves the rapid proliferation and differentiation of fibroblast-like endometrial stromal cells
into epitheloid-like decidual cells. These cells become part of the decidual tissue that surrounds the
implanting conceptus. Decidualization defects can directly lead to implantation failure. Moreover, early
decidualization defects can cause other adverse pregnancy outcomes including abnormal placentation,
restricted intrauterine fetal growth, and early parturition. Understanding decidualization is crucial for
improving IVF success rates, developing novel contraceptives, and discovering new treatments for
endometriosis. Despite its significance in reproduction, the genetic framework of decidualization had
never been systematically studied until our recent development of a suitable high throughput screening
tool, immortalized human endometrial stromal cells that carry the yellow fluorescent protein gene under
the control of the progesterone-sensitive prolactin promoter (PRL-Y cells). We recently used PRL-Y
cells to perform a whole genome siRNA functional screen to uncover novel regulatory genes for human
decidualization. One major signaling pathway uncovered by the screen is the retinoic acid (RA)
signaling pathway. Contrary to the current dogma that RA suppresses decidualization, we propose a
paradigm-shifting hypothesis that RA signaling is absolutely required to initiate and promote
decidualization, and is therefore required for female fertility. In this proposal, we will follow up on our
exciting preliminary findings and study the function of RA signaling during decidualization through
careful mapping of its downstream signaling pathways. In Aim I we will determine which RAR or
combination of RARs is required during decidualization, and we will clarify the tissue-specific
requirements for RA signaling during peri-implantation. In Aim II, we will identify RA downstream targets
during decidualization in mouse and human. Finally in Aim III, we will investigate the interplay between
RA and FGF signaling, and between RA and homeodomain proteins during decidualization. Successful
completion of this project will dramatically increase our understanding of RA signaling during
implantation/decidualization and will have an enduring impact on implantation biology and drug
discovery."

Our current bedside tests for urinary tract infections (UTI) are not sufficiently accurate. The best available test 
for UTI, the leukocyte esterase (LE) test, has a sensitivity of only 79%, meaning that 21% of children with a 
true UTI are missed, placing them at increased risk for permanent renal scarring. The 87% specificity of the LE

treatment. Accordingly, development of more sensitive and specific tests for the diagnosis of UTI, which is our 
first aim, represents an important contribution. We will collect urine specimens from 3,334 consecutive febrile 
children aged 1 month to 3 years with presumed UTI and, in a sample of cases and controls from this larger 
population, we will perform transcriptomics (mRNA) and multiplex inflammatory protein analysis to identify 
urinary markers that distinguish children with UTI from febrile children without UTI. Promising markers will be 
validated in a sample selected from 3,334 children from a second site. A second limitation in the current clinical 
approach to UTI stems from the lack of reliable markers to distinguish children with bladder infection from 
children with kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Because accurate markers for pyelonephritis have not been 
identified, all febrile children with UTI are generally assumed to have pyelonephritis (i.e., treated with antibiotics 
for 10 days and undergo renal ultrasonography) even though approximately only 40% have pyelonephritis. To 
identify accurate markers for pyelonephritis, which is our second aim, we will enroll 100 febrile children with 
UTI and perform transcriptomics and multiplex inflammatory protein analysis on their urine samples. 
Pyelonephritis will be confirmed using Tc99m-­dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. We will validate

Pregnancy marks a time of increased challenges among families that may be exacerbated by conditions
known to enhance stress reactivity and disrupt emotion regulation, such as posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD). For this already vulnerable population, the 2020 pandemic may constitute a trifecta of calamities, with
currently unknown, but likely deleterious effects on the caregiving environment and infant outcomes. In the first
three-month period, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals, families, and
communities across the world, with preliminary evidence for an increase in the prevalence and severity of
mental health problems. As such, understanding the impact of PTSD and pandemic-related stress on families
with children born during the pandemic is critical for identifying and driving novel approaches to prevention and
intervention, especially during similar crises. The current study seeks to recruit a diverse cohort of women and
their partners who were in the final two trimesters of pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Phase 1 of the
study will involve a large-scale survey (N=2,000) of these individuals to assess perinatal stress exposure
occurring in the context of the pandemic. Phase 2 will involve selecting individuals from the Phase 1 survey to
establish two subgroups with high (n=200) and low (n=200) perinatal pandemic-related stress exposure to
participate in a comprehensive and longitudinal assessment protocol, including interviews, parent-child
interactions, an infant stress paradigm, and biological sample collection. Aims are to: (1) use person-centered
latent class analysis of perinatal pandemic-related experiences to identify unique profiles that vary on the types
and quantity of stress exposure and differentially associate with race/ethnicity, caregiver-reported perceived
stress, emotion dysregulation, PTSD, parenting, and infant dysregulation (stress-reactivity and
emotional/behavioral problems) in the large Phase 1 survey cohort (N=2,000); (2) Compare infants with high
and low perinatal pandemic-related stress and examine caregiver emotion dysregulation, PTSD, and
responsive parenting as potential mediators of this relationship in the longitudinal Phase 2 cohort (N=400); and
(3) identify differentially methylated regions of DNA and differences in telomere length and changes over time
in infants in high v. low perinatal stress groups. Assessment procedures will integrate the experiences and
functioning of both the mother and partner when considering implications for offspring. This work will yield
mechanistic insight on how pandemic-related stress, caregiver emotion dysregulation, and PTSD influence
multiple aspects of the caregiving environment and infant outcomes and is expected to directly inform perinatal
public health interventions as the COVID-19 pandemic continues and its sequelae unfold."

 To develop multi-faceted interventions for Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders (ADRD) prevention, it
is key to quantify joint effects of environmental exposures throughout the life-span as well as the mechanisms
through which the exposures operate, which involve dynamic disease processes. These causal investigations
in observational studies face methodological challenges. This application, in response to PAR-22-093, will
accomplish the following goals: (1) develop robust Bayesian machine learning methods for causal mediation
analyses in life-course observational studies of ADRD; (2) apply these approaches in the analysis of two 30+
year cohort studies of Native Americans (Strong Heart Study) and of the Greater Boston area (Normative
Aging Study) to determine whether and to what extent the onset and severity of hypertension and
cardiovascular disease mediate the harmful effects of air pollution and heavy metals on ADRD; (3) develop
and disseminate computationally efficient and user-friendly software for widespread application of the methods.
The proposed work will address methodologic gaps in the causal investigation of health effects. First, no
mediation analyses approaches are available that simultaneously allow for multiple exposures and multiple
time-to-event and longitudinal mediators. Investigators can currently only build models that do not reflect real-
life conditions, considering a single exposure, or a single mediator producing segmented results, limited in
informing prevention. Second, most of observational studies in ADRD research are plagued by selection bias.
Participants may die before an ADRD diagnosis (attrition due to death) or may drop-out due to cognitive
impairment. Third, multicollinearity, skewness of exposures, complex exposure-response relationships and
time dependent confounding challenge valid estimation and inference. Fourth, no statistical approaches are
available to evaluate the generalizability of findings on determinants of and mechanisms leading to ADRD. We
propose to fill these gaps by developing and applying Bayesian machine learning approaches for quantifying
the total, direct and indirect effects of environmental and health factors on ADRD outcomes under the
counterfactual framework. We will develop and apply the new methods to estimate complex exposure-
response relationships of pollutants with time-to-event or longitudinal outcome potentially mediated by a single
time-to-event or longitudinal mediator (Aim 1), and mechanisms through multiple longitudinal and time-to-event
mediators (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will develop Bayesian data fusion algorithms to evaluate unmeasured
confounding bias and to generalize evidence from the study sample to the target population (Aim 3). In the
SHS and NAS we will investigate the role of hypertension and CVD trajectory, onset, and severity in mid and
late life as mediators of the neurotoxic effects of AP and metals. We will develop user-friendly and efficient R
packages that implement the proposed new methods. Our work has great potential to have broad impact on
life-course epidemiology research and prevention for ADRD and other chronic health outcomes."

The bone marrow in mammals house both hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells that are responsible for
sustaining blood and bone cell production, respectively, throughout adult life. Although the hematopoietic
system is well understood, the molecular identities, hierarchy of the marrow mesenchymal cells and their
respective contribution to bone homeostasis are just beginning to be unraveled. Elucidation of the organization
and functions of the bone marrow mesenchymal cells is fundamental to understanding the pathogenesis of
both myeloid and bone diseases. By employing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, we have
discovered a subset of bone marrow mesenchymal cells co-expressing adiponectin (Adipoq) and osterix (Osx)
which are traditionally considered adipocyte or osteoblast markers, respectively. Trajectory analyses predict
the Adipoq+Osx+ bi-marker cells to be common progenitors for osteoblasts and marrow adipogenic lineage
cells. Lineage tracing with Osx-CreERT2 or Adipoq-CreERT2 supports that the bi-marker cells give rise to both
osteoblasts and adipocytes in vivo. Imaging studies localize the bi-marker cells to the endosteal bone niche.
The data therefore support the hypothesis that Adipoq+Osx+ bi-marker cells are adipo-osteoprogenitors attuned
to the physiological milieu in the bone marrow. To test the hypothesis, we will first determine the number and
fate of the bi-marker cells in young, mature and aged mice to uncover potential age-dependent changes (aim
1). We will then investigate the functional contribution of the bi-marker progenitors to bone formation both
under basal conditions and in response to the main bone anabolic drug teriparatide in mature adult mice
(aim2). We will finally examine the effect of diabetes on the fate of the bi-marker cells in an experimentally
induced type II diabetes mouse model. The studies are expected to shed light on the role of the adipo-
osteoprogenitors in bone physiology and pathophysiology."
10773123,"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe type of congenital heart defects, which is characterized
by the underdevelopment of left side of the heart. The clinical presentation of HLHS includes hypoplasia of the
left ventricle and structural defects in mitral valves, aortic valve, and ascending aorta. HLHS newborns usually
die within a week without surgical treatment. We and others have linked the pathogenic NOTCH1 mutations to
HLHS and calcific aortic valve disease. It appears that abnormal NOTCH signaling interrupts the communication
between myocardium and endocardium thus leads to incomplete growth of ventricular chamber. However, the
mechanisms by which NOTCH1 mutations results in hypoplasia of the left ventricle are largely unknown due to
limited models for studying HLHS. Genetically engineered animals are not capable of reproducing the clinical
phenotypes in HLHS patients. Previous studies have focused on the structural and electrophysiological defects
in cardiomyocytes from HLHS patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which may not recapitulate
the underlying non-cell autonomous scenarios in the hypoplastic ventricles. In this proposal, we hypothesize that
NOTCH1-mediated myocardial-endocardial crosstalk is required for normal human ventricular cardiomyocyte
differentiation, and NOTCH1 mutations leads to abnormal myocardial-endocardial interactions which cause the
hypoplasia of ventricular cardiomyocytes in HLHS. We will employ an integrated stem cell model using HLHS
and CRISPR genome-edited iPSCs to investigate how NOTCH1 mutations lead to abnormal myocardial-
endocardial interactions in HLHS. We will design a novel co-culture platform using human iPSC-derived
cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) with distinct NOTCH1 genetic composition to
study the intercellular communication between endocardium and myocardium in both healthy and diseased
conditions. In Specific Aim 1, we will investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which endothelial
NOTCH1 deficiency suppresses human ventricular cardiomyocyte differentiation and proliferation. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine how the crosstalk between myocardium and endocardium affects ventricular
cardiomyocyte differentiation and proliferation by co-culture of human iPSC-CMs and iPSC-ECs. In Specific
Aim 3, we will decipher the mechanisms by which NOTCH1 mutations results in the dysfunctional myocardial-
endocardial interactions and contribute to hypoplasis of the left ventricle using genome-edited HLHS-iPSCs. The
completion of this R01 project will have a major impact on the understanding of HLHS through interactions
between endocardium and myocardium using clinically relevant and patient-derived cardiomyocytes and

Periodontal disease is associated with an increase in Porphyromonas gingivalis, dysbiosis of the commensal
microbiota in the subgingival crevice, and chronic inflammation resulting in bone resorption, and ultimately tooth
loss. Vitamin D is best known as a principal factor that maintains calcium homeostasis and is required for bone
development and homeostasis. However, it is becoming clear that vitamin D has profound actions in immunity
and inflammation as well. Both the chronic and aggressive forms of periodontal disease have been associated
with vitamin D deficiency in numerous populations. Our recently published data show that the active form of
vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, promotes anti-bacterial activity against P. gingivalis by gingival epithelial cells (GEC),
and inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Experimental vitamin D deficiency in mice leads to gingival
inflammation and bone loss. However, clinical trials examining the effect of oral vitamin D supplementation on
periodontal disease have led to conflicting results, likely due to natural feedback mechanisms. We therefore
hypothesized that topical administration of vitamin D to the gingiva could circumvent this problem. Our
preliminary results indicate that when inactive vitamin D is delivered directly to the surface of the gingival
epithelium, both in vitro and in mice, we observe a rapid induction of vitamin D-mediated genes, as well as an
inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, without cytotoxicity. We also observed that the epithelial cells convert
inactive vitamin D3 to both the inactive intermediate (25OHD3), and to active 1,25(OH)2D3 through epithelial cell-
expressed hydroxylases, and that this conversion resulted in increased production of the host defense peptide,
LL-37. Thus, our overarching hypothesis is that that the gingival epithelium maintains its own intrinsic regulation
of vitamin D status, and that topical delivery of vitamin D to the oral epithelium allows direct introduction of high
concentrations of active vitamin D to the tissue. This delivery can lead to regulation of vitamin D-regulated genes
that can downregulate inflammation and prevent the growth of periopathogenic bacteria, and the resulting bone
loss. To address this, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Quantify the relationship between vitamin D
and periodontal disease in a mouse model. 2) Define the shifts in the oral microbiome regulated by
vitamin D. 3) Characterize the mechanism of vitamin D-mediated induction of innate immunity in cultured
human GEC. Together, these aims will support our hypothesis that vitamin D is essential for periodontal health,
will help define the mechanism by which this occurs, and will provide a proof of principle that topical
administration of vitamin D in the oral cavity can maintain this health status. Vitamin D’s actions are complex and
multifaceted, but harnessing its beneficial activities has the potential to change periodontal practice replacing
expensive mechanical and surgical procedures with well-reasoned, safe and reliable topical treatments with no
toxicity."

 Biomolecular condensates are emerging as central to cellular functions in a wide variety of con-
texts. These condensates often have liquid properties and are assembled from multivalent, polymer-like
molecules. Together, these observations suggest a disordered network of interactions stabilizing the
condensate. Liquid systems are inherently disordered, which would seem to preclude the level of order
necessary for structure-function properties to emerge. However, preliminary results have shown that,
hidden within the liquid disorder, is a hierarchy of molecular assemblies that give structure to the uid.
Furthermore, this structure within the contacts stabilizing the liquid confers crucial functional features
to the condensates. This means that in order to understand how these condensates function, it is
necessary to identify structure in disordered systems. This poses a challenge to the eld of structural
biology because this hierarchical structure cannot be resolved by workhorse techniques like X-ray, NMR,
and cryo-EM. The proposed research will establish methods to identify and characterize structure within
liquid condensates. These methods are based on theoretical modeling using an iterative re nement
procedure analogous to structure determination by NMR. This will be done in two systems that are each
featured in a speci c aim. The rst system is a model system for phase separation that removes com-
plications with identifying and quantifying interaction sites. In determining the microscopic structure
of this \sticker and spacer"" binding system, which is thought to be a common motif in liquid conden-
sates, this aim will establish basic principles of how molecular structure can dictate spatial organization
on lengthscales ranging from the recruitment molecular clients to organelle segregation/colocalization.
The second aim will develop the structural modeling techniques on the nucleolus. This nuclear organelle
serves as the assembly site for ribosomes. The proposed research will use in vitro phase separation data
to understand the primary molecular interactions within the granular component (GC) where rRNAs
and protein assemble into ribosomal subunits. The interactions in the GC are primarily electrostatic,
which is di erent than the sticker and spacer motif that is the focus of Aim 1. Next, these interactions
will be used to build a kinetic theory of ribosome subunit assembly. This model will establish how the
molecular structure of GC components facilitates ribosome assembly. The theories for generated in both
aims will be analytic, meaning that they will allow for a thorough exploration of parameter space and
can be readily applied to other systems."

Artificial intelligence (AI) and other computationally intensive methods have the potential to
revolutionize cancer imaging research and patient care. The broad adoption of these
technologies depends on the availability development of imaging informatics tools to assist
users in managing massive data sets, generating well-curated annotations, and accessing
scalable computing resources. The Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research (I3CR)
Center has played a lead role in implementing cancer imaging informatics technology, with a
focus on expanding the widely used open source XNAT informatics platform to better support
computational workflows in cancer imaging. I3CR has also developed knowledge management
tools to better track data processing and analysis, including tools for orchestrating and tracking
container-based computing pipelines. As result of this work, XNAT has emerged as the most
widely used imaging informatics platform in cancer research. It is deployed in over 200
organizations across academia and industry and has been adopted across a wide range of
research contexts, including preclinical imaging, multi-site clinical trials, and clinical translation.
As the I3CR informatics platform has matured and been widely adopted, the Center is now
evolving to the next phase of development to more broadly sustain the platform. In the work
proposed here, we will sustain the I3CR’s ongoing engineering initiatives and expand its
outreach efforts. The Center’s sustainment activities will build on and extend the I3CR
platform’s expansive set of data and knowledge management capabilities, with a focus on
addressing key emergent needs within our user base. In Aim 1, we will continue to develop the
XNAT-based data management platform, including adding standards-based clinical interfaces,
developing a cohort discovery service with natural language processing support, implementing a
task automation service, and extending its container-based computing service to support high
performance computing and cloud computing environments. In Aim 2, we will implement a suite
of integrations with complementary image analysis and data sharing platforms, including The
Cancer Image Archive and the NCI Imaging Data Commons. In Aim 3, we will expand the
I3CR’s outreach initiatives to ensure broad and effective adoption of the I3CR informatics
platforms. The Center’s training program will utilize the XNAT Academy education platform to
host a series of online training programs directed at specific audiences including developers,
data scientists, integrators, and system administrators. A suite of supporting cloud services will
be implemented assist the community in adopting and developing on the I3CR platform."
10834097,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of this project is to develop small molecule mitochondrial uncouplers for the treatment of non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an advanced form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Approximately
26 million people (~6-8% of US population) are affected by NASH, and more than 30% of patients with NASH-
related cirrhosis will die from liver failure or hepatocellular cancer. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs
to treat NASH and the top drugs in clinical trials suffer from ineffectiveness or have unwanted side effects. NASH
is characterized by fat accumulation in the liver, inflammation, and tissue remodeling. Mitochondrial uncouplers
have strong potential as NASH therapeutics by the nature of their mode of action targeting fat accumulation and
oxidative stress. Mitochondrial uncouplers transport protons from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into
the matrix bypassing ATP synthase. This process increases fat oxidation and decreases mitochondrial reactive
oxygen species production; thereby, directly targeting two pathways that underlie NASH pathophysiology that
drive inflammation and the fibrogenic response. Our laboratories have recently discovered mitochondria-
selective, safe, and orally bioavailable mitochondrial uncouplers that have wide therapeutic window. Proof-of-
principle studies in an accelerated mouse model of NASH (STAM model) achieved the FDA benchmark for
approval of a NASH therapeutic by decreasing the NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) by 2 points, with at least one
point coming from two different NAS criteria, and with no worsening of fibrosis. These strong preliminary data
support a medicinal chemistry program to improve the drug-like properties of the molecules (Aim 1) and validate
molecules in a more physiologically and clinically relevant mouse model of NASH involving Amylin diet (Aim 2).
The major innovation of our program is the discovery of novel chemical scaffolds that have different levels of
mitochondrial uncoupling capacity that are safe and self-limiting. As there are currently no drugs with a
mitochondrial uncoupling as the primary mode of action in the clinic, our program could be the first to deliver
mitochondrial uncouplers for the treatment of NASH. Indeed, this project addresses a critical need and will make
significant contribution to data supporting the validity of modulating mitochondrial uncoupling for safe and
efficacious treatment of NASH."

Chronic disability due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects 2% of the total population, and neuronal loss is
generally considered permanent, owing to limited capacity for neuroregeneration in the adult mammalian brain.
There are currently no approved treatments for improving recovery after TBI, and innovative approaches to
enhance neuroregeneration are desperately needed. Intriguingly, new neurons are generated in the
subventricular zone (SVZ) and then guided to the olfactory bulb/tract (and possibly striatum) via the rostral
migratory stream (RMS) for integration into existing circuitry. Recent publications have demonstrated that SVZ
neuroblasts can be redirected into lesions, differentiate into region-specific neuronal cell types, integrate into
circuitry, and improve functional recovery in adult rodents, but a translational strategy to direct and enhance
neuroblast migration into lesions has yet to be established. To address this challenge, we have assembled a
multi-disciplinary team of stem cell specialists, neurobiologists, clinicians, and tissue engineers to develop the
first anatomically-inspired microtissue designed to structurally and functionally emulate the glial tube of the
RMS. In an exciting breakthrough, our team developed novel microtissue engineering techniques that promote
the self-assembly of astrocytes into longitudinally aligned bundles that recapitulate the organization of the glial
tube of the RMS. To date, we have biofabricated this Tissue Engineered Rostral Migratory Stream (TE-RMS)
using rodent derived astrocytes as well as human stem cell derived astrocytes and, importantly, we have
shown that the TE-RMS directly facilitates the alignment and migration of immature neurons in vitro and in
vivo. In the current proposal, we will first validate the TE-RMS as an in vitro test bed to elucidate mechanisms
of neuronal progenitor migration and cell fate determination (Aim 1). We will then test the ability of the TE-RMS
to divert endogenous neuronal progenitors in vivo and repair damaged cerebral cortex following experimental
TBI in rats (Aim 2). In this Aim, the TE-RMS will be stereotaxically microinjected after the acute injury period to
span from the SVZ into lesioned tissue, and the redirection of migrating neurons to repopulate cortical areas,
functional integration with residual circuitry, and facilitation of behavioral recovery will be assessed. Finally, as
a first step towards clinical translation, we will perform in vitro and in vivo studies to validate the TE-RMS built
using astrocytes derived from stem cells harvested from adult human gingiva to develop methods for the
eventual creation of autologous, patient-derived implants from an easily accessible cell source (Aim 3). The
TE-RMS recapitulates the brain's own method for delivery and integration of new neurons. Thus, the execution
of these Aims will significantly advance a translational bioengineering approach capable of providing targeted
and sustained cell replacement following neurotrauma and/or degeneration. Our team is uniquely positioned to
provide a feasible, yet highly innovative neuroregenerative approach that can have a significant impact on
patients suffering from the otherwise intractable consequences of TBI."

10833556,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Antibiotic resistant bacteria pose a global threat to human health and wellbeing. New strategies for
combating resistance are urgently needed because current drug development pipelines are not keeping up
with the dwindling supply of effective antibiotics. I propose to investigate and manipulate the ecology of
antibiotic resistance acquisition and host-to-host transmission. Specifically, I will determine how the physical
structure of bacterial communities within the intestine—which is a major reservoir of antibiotic resistant
bacteria—affects the evolution of resistance traits and transmission of resistant cells. A motivation for this
research direction is that antibiotic resistance fundamentally dependends on the spatial and temporal
organization of host–microbe systems. For example, the sharing of resistance genes between bacteria
through lateral gene transfer often requires cells to be in close proximity to one another. In addition, the
transmission of resistant bacteria between hosts requires that they are physically displaced and expelled into
the environment. Thus, altering the spatiotemporal organization of gut bacterial communities could be used
to prevent and contain resistant bacteria before they become agents of infection. However, dissecting the
spatially and temporally complex mechanisms governing antibiotic resistance is a significant challenge using
current approaches. My solution to overcome this limitation is to combine synthetic biology, genetically
engineered bacterial communities, and live imaging to track and control bacterial behavior inside the
intestines of living animals. I will employ larval zebrafish as a vertebrate host model because they enable
studies of host–microbe systems across scales of complexity, space, and time that are difficult to perform in
mice or humans. Using this experimental approach, I previously discovered that intestinal flow, bacterial
swimming motility, and sublethal antibiotics represent host, bacterial, and environmental factors, respectively,
that can modulate the spatiotemporal organization and physiological landscape of gut bacteria. I will harness
these factors and my experimental approach to address the following three hypotheses. First, I will test the
hypothesis that the spatiotemporal organization of gut bacteria controls the acquisition and persistence of
resistance traits within the intestine. Second, I will test the hypothesis that the spatiotemporal organization of
gut bacteria regulates the transmission of antibiotic resistant cells between hosts. And third, I will test the
hypothesis that bacteria coordinate both the acquisition of resistance traits and host-to-host transmission
through specific genetic pathways. My proposed research has the potential to inspire ecology-based
strategies for curtailing antibiotic resistance through the therapeutic manipulation of the intestinal
microbiome’s physical structure. Such ecology-informed and antibiotic-free strategies would preserve the
potency of current antibiotics for when they are needed most and avoid the unintended side effects of
antibiotics on beneficial resident bacteria."

Although cure rates for childhood cancer have increased over several decades, cancer remains the leading
cause of non-accidental death in children. Yet, there are no existing quality measures to define optimal end-of-
life care (EOLC) for children with cancer. A lack of standards for EOLC contributes to high healthcare utilization
for children with advanced, incurable cancer, as well as widely variable palliative care provision. For adults with
cancer, high quality EOLC is defined at least in part by measures to reduce use of intensive healthcare
resources, such as avoidance of hospital stays in the last weeks of life and prompt referral to hospice. In
contrast, attributes of high quality EOLC for children with cancer have not been previously elucidated. To
address this gap in knowledge, the overall objectives of this proposal are to prioritize family-centered quality
measures for EOLC and to pioneer complementary approaches to assess care quality for children with
advanced cancer. Specific aims are to: (1) establish a priority list of EOLC quality measures, from the
perspective of parents of children with cancer; (2) characterize EOLC process measures for children who died
of cancer, using natural language processing in electronic health records; and (3) develop and pilot the
“Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience” (PACE) questionnaire to prospectively appraise care quality for
children with advanced cancer. Completion of these aims will lay the foundation for the first multi-center, multi-
modal evaluation of end-of-life care quality in children with cancer. The long term goal of Dr. Ananth’s research
program is to build a platform for systematically measuring, reporting, and incentivizing high quality EOLC in
children with cancer, facilitating goal-concordant care delivery. Through the proposed research, Dr. Ananth
seeks to advance the science of measuring EOLC quality in childhood cancer. Dr. Ananth is supported by an
outstanding mentorship team and scientific advisory committee, with substantial expertise spanning patient-
reported outcomes, artificial intelligence-based techniques for research, and pediatric palliative care
investigation. Dr. Ananth will pursue formal training in patient-centered quality measurement, natural language
processing, and questionnaire design and validation, concurrently building skills in leadership of a multi-center
consortium. Collectively, the research in this proposal and career development plan will amply prepare her for
an independent career focused on enhancing quality of care for children with advanced, incurable cancer."

The goal of this Mentored Career Development Award is to prepare Dr. Lauren Gerlach for a career as an
independent investigator focused on measuring and improving the quality of end-of-life care for older adults
with psychiatric disorders and dementia. Dr. Gerlach’s long-term career goal is to establish herself as an
independent investigator in geriatric mental health services and mixed methods research. Behavioral
symptoms in advanced dementia are common, and despite limited evidence to support their use, the mainstay
of such symptom management in hospice is off-label use of psychotropic medications such as antipsychotics.
However, recent clinical trial evidence suggests that use of antipsychotics at end of life may be associated with
worse outcomes for patients—raising concerns that the very medications prescribed to alleviate distress in fact
exacerbate it. Little is known about how widely psychotropics are prescribed during end-of-life care for
dementia, the factors that influence this prescribing, or the outcomes of such use. These critical knowledge
gaps—including which patients are at greatest risk of potential harm—limit the ability to develop a consensus
on best practices to address distressing behavioral symptoms in hospice care for dementia. Dr. Gerlach’s
clinical training as a geriatric psychiatrist and prior research in pharmacoepidemiology provide the critical
foundation for this work, but her transition to independence requires new skills and knowledge that will be
gained through a coordinated program of research, mentorship, and coursework during the 5-year award
period. This will include training in: 1) hospice-based dementia care, 2) use of Medicare and Minimum Data Set
(MDS) data to examine end-of-life care, 3) advanced statistical methods for pharmacoepidemiology research,
and 4) qualitative research methods. The proposed study will use Medicare data for all older adults with
dementia enrolled in hospice in 2015 to determine the array of patient, provider, and hospice characteristics
that influence psychotropic prescribing (Aim 1). In partnership with a local hospice organization, an exploratory
sub-aim will examine the indications for psychotropic prescribing at end of life—information not available in
claims data. Aim 2 will use linked Medicare and MDS data to examine outcomes associated with psychotropic
prescribing (e.g., functional impairment, behavioral symptoms, mortality). Finally, Aim 3 will include interviews
with patients with early-stage dementia, caregivers, and hospice providers to elicit stakeholder perspectives on
the goals of hospice care. Study findings will inform how to best manage behavioral symptoms at the end of
life. Given that not all patients with dementia utilize hospice, this K23 is designed to lay the foundation for a
subsequent R01 to examine broader end-of-life care among all patients with dementia and to determine how
hospice enrollment impacts outcomes. The R01 study will use Medicare and linked survey data to determine
factors that impact the care patients receive in the last year of life and to identify the extent of potentially
inappropriate treatments and impact on caregiver outcomes to better inform hospice care models for dementia."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes motor neuron
degeneration, muscle weakness, paralysis, and death. The mechanism of motor neuron degeneration is
incompletely understood, and currently, no therapy can arrest or reverse the disease progression. To
understand the disease and open new avenues for therapy, exploring new mechanisms of the disease is
needed. To this end, the Xu and Thompson labs have joined forces to investigate the role of protein
citrullination, which is catalyzed by Protein Arginine Deiminases (PADs), in ALS. Citrullination removes positive
charges from proteins. Therefore, this modification can alter the protein function and its interaction with other
proteins, membranes, and nucleic acids. Mammals have five PADs: PADs 1–4 and PAD6. PAD2 is the
dominant form in the central nervous system (CNS). Previous studies have shown that PAD2 and protein
citrullination are increased in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Prion disease.
However, no studies have linked PADs and protein citrullination with ALS. Furthermore, no studies have
investigated the functional role of PAD2 and protein citrullination in neurodegeneration. To fill these knowledge
gaps, the Xu and Thompson labs have applied their combined expertise in ALS and protein citrullination and
initiated this investigation. Our preliminary studies show unequivocal evidence that PAD2 expression (but not
PAD3, 4) and protein citrullination are spatially and temporally altered in two ALS mouse models, one
expressing mutant SOD1G93A and the other expressing mutant PFN1C71G. While PAD2 expression is increased
in astrocytes, its expression is decreased in neurons during the disease progression. By proteomics, we
identified several hundred citrullinated proteins in the spinal cord. In ALS mice, the early disease stage is
dominated by decreased protein citrullination. In contrast, the late disease stage shows increased citrullination
in one-half of the proteins and decreased citrullination in the other half. Intriguingly, the highly citrullinated
proteins are enriched in the insoluble fractions in the late stage. We propose to further our investigation by
answering the following seven questions: (1) How is protein citrullination altered in ALS? (2) What are the
citrullinated proteins in the spinal cord, and how is citrullination altered in these proteins in ALS? (3) What are
the sites of citrullination on ALS-associated proteins? (4) Is PAD2 responsible for the altered protein
citrullination in ALS? (5) How does protein citrullination impact protein aggregation? (6) How does the
citrullination of ALS-associated targets impact their protein function? (7) How is protein citrullination altered in
human ALS? By answering these questions, we will enter and investigate a hitherto unexplored research area
in ALS, thereby opening a new dimension in understanding the mechanism of neurodegeneration in ALS.
Because PAD inhibitors have already been developed in the Thompson lab, this new dimension may lead to
new therapeutic avenues targeting PAD2 activity. Because of the significant changes in protein citrullination,
this research may also identify novel biomarkers of early-stage ALS.

Hyaluronic acid (HA) is the most abundant component of the human brain, where it serves essential structural,
mechanical, and cell-instructive functions. Adhesion between HA and its receptor CD44 critically regulates
development and homeostasis, and dysregulation of HA and/or CD44 causally drives many brain pathologies,
including invasion of the deadly brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). Despite the clear biological significance of
HA-CD44 adhesion, comparatively little is known about either the biophysical mechanisms through which HA-
CD44 interactions drive cell adhesion, migration, or matrix remodeling or how HA composition (e.g. molecular
weight) influences adhesion and migration. Over the past decade, our team has made seminal contributions to
addressing these questions, including introducing and refining synthetic 3D HA matrices as a culture model for
studying GBM invasion. We also discovered that CD44 transduces HA-based mechanical signals to regulate
cell shape, cytoskeletal assembly, and motility. Most recently, we discovered that GBM cells engage HA using
“microtentacles” (McTNs), CD44-dependenent processes that extend tens of microns from the cell body, are
associated with HA digestion, and mechanically couple to the cytoskeleton through a complex that includes
IQGAP1 and CLIP170. McTNs bear important similarities to structures that have been observed in invasive
GBMs in vivo, and overexpression of McTN components is predictive of with aggressive progression and poor
survival in GBM. In this R01 application, we will leverage these discoveries and biomaterial platforms to
advance the field’s understanding of how HA and CD44 contribute to cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. In
our first aim, we will investigate how McTNs facilitate adhesion, invasion, and matrix remodeling. In our
second aim, we will determine how biophysical features of the HA network in brain tissue contributes to 3D
migration, using GBM as a model system. Our approach is distinguished by tight integration of engineered
biomaterial culture models, mouse models featuring human GBM stem/initiating cells, and analysis of biopsies
obtained from specific anatomic regions of human GBMs. Our multi-institutional team also uniquely combines
expertise in biomaterials, mechanobiology, neurosurgery, and cancer biology. Successful completion of these
studies will yield unprecedented insight into the biophysical basis through which HA and CD44 contribute to
adhesion and invasion, a problem of high fundamental interest that may lead to novel therapeutic targets in
GBM."

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP) are two genetic diseases
characterized by protoporphyrin IX (PPIX)-mediated phototoxicity and hepatotoxicity, and there is no cure.
The objective of this project is to develop a mechanism-based strategy to manage PPIX-mediated
toxicities. Our preliminary studies found that ABCG2, the efflux transporter of PPIX, plays an essential
role in PPIX-mediated toxicities, and deficiency of ABCG2 abolishes such toxicities. Our further studies
found that ABCG2 deficiency modulates PPIX distribution and metabolism. Based on these results, we
hypothesize that suppression of ABCG2 will attenuate PPIX-mediated toxicities by modulating PPIX
disposition. To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: (1) to develop ABCG2
inhibitors for the management of PPIX-mediated toxicities; (2) to determine the efficacy, safety, and
mechanisms of action of these novel ABCG2 inhibitors for the prevention of PPIX-mediated phototoxicity;
and (3) to determine the efficacy, safety, and mechanisms of action of ABCG2 inhibitors for the treatment
of PPIX-mediated hepatotoxicity. We have successfully synthesized 28 ABCG2 inhibitors, and our
preliminary data are promising because several of the tested candidates showed strong ABCG2 inhibitory
activity and great efficacy against PPIX-mediated toxicities. In summary, this project will explore the
therapeutic potential of ABCG2 inhibitors for the management of PPIX-mediated phototoxicity and
hepatotoxicity. We will also illustrate the mechanisms by which suppression of ABCG2 attenuates PPIX-
mediated toxicities. Genetically engineered ABCG2 and EPP mouse models together with ABCG2
inhibitors will be used in our proposed work. The results from this project will provide a novel strategy for
the management of EPP and XLP."

The overall goals of our Childhood Asthma in Urban Settings (CAUSE)-Leadership Center proposal are to
provide administrative leadership and support to develop and conduct collaborative research to address high
priority unmet needs for childhood asthma in urban communities, including: a) developing strategies to prevent
asthma, b) improving treatment and inhibiting progression, c) reducing severe exacerbations, and d) defining
endotypes of respiratory health and disease. Four hypotheses are proposed to accomplish these goals. First,
supplementation with immune modulating bacteria in infancy will prevent the early life perturbations in the gut
microbiome that have been associated with risk for the development of allergic sensitization and asthma, and
will promote airway mucosal immune development. Second, given the importance of cockroach (CR) allergy
and exposure to asthma morbidity in urban children, CR immunotherapy will improve asthma control and
reduce disease progression. Third, we propose that transcriptional analysis of airway cells will define T2-low
mechanisms that contribute to both non-atopic and atopic asthma and provide new insights into treatment.
Finally, multi-omics evaluation of airway cells and secretions obtained during severe exacerbations leading to
ED visits and hospitalizations will reveal novel mechanistic pathways to inform improved treatment and
prevention. We propose five protocols to test these hypotheses:
 1. Urban Environment and Childhood Asthma study (URECA)
 2. Effects of a Microbial Supplement (STMC-103H) on Microbial Colonization and Immune Development
 3. Cockroach (CR) Immunotherapy (IT) in Urban Children with Moderate-Severe Asthma Protected by
Omalizumab
 4. Pathogenesis and Mechanisms of T2-low (Non-Atopic) Asthma
 5. Severe Asthma Exacerbations in the Emergency Department (ED) and Hospital: Identifying Targets for
 Prevention and Treatment
It is our expectation that our proposed CAUSE research program will provide critical information needed to
recognize asthma phenotypes and endotypes in urban children, improve treatment of asthma and establish
direction for prevention. Collectively, these studies will continue the rigorous programmatic approach of the
NIAID Asthma Networks towards achieving the long-term goals of disease modification and prevention of
disease in high-risk children of low-income families living in urban communities."

This application is for a competitive renewal of R25 NS076445 to fund “Summer Program for Under-
represented Students (SPURS)”, to be renamed “Summer Program for Undergraduate Rising Stars
(SPURS)”, through the RFA-HL-21-168 mechanism. 100% of the proposed funding will be used to support
SPURS students working on neuroscience projects central to the mission of NINDS. SPURS will provide an
intensive, undergraduate biomedical research experience for talented African-American/Black, Hispanic
Latino(a), Native American/Alaska Native, Pacific Islander, first-generation, and economically disadvantaged
students in the neurosciences at Columbia University. SPURS will train 14 outstanding students each year
who are undergraduates majoring in areas relevant to neuroscience and biomedical research.Columbia
University's SPURS Program provides an intense undergraduate research experience on the campus of
Columbia's College of Physicians & Surgeons (P&S) for talented students from backgrounds that are
under-represented in biomedical research. SPURS participants are accepted from the City University of New
York (CUNY) senior colleges, including Hunter, Brooklyn, Queens, and City Colleges, as well as universities
and colleges nationwide. SPURS provides extensive training in basic and translational neuroscience
research, and enhances the likelihood that the students will achieve a career in science by pursuing an
advanced degree (M.D. and/or Ph.D.). To expand opportunities for under-represented minority undergraduate
students to participate in high quality, focused and sustained research experiences in the neurosciences, the
SPURS program leverages outstanding resources and faculty mentors in the neurosciences. Over the last
funding period, applications have soared and in the upcoming period, we propose to continue training highly
qualified minority student participants. Students perform hands-on research for nine summer weeks under the
mentorship of NINDS-supported Columbia University neuroscientists (currently 89 Columbia University
researchers receive NINDS support). In addition to specific training in neuroscience, the students have
received in-depth training in research methodology including: (a) the design and analysis of experiments; (b)
critical reading of scientific literature through journal clubs and discussions of ethics in science; (c) the
presentation of scientific results at laboratory meetings; (d) presentation of their research at poster sessions;
(e) an oral presentation of their research to an audience of scientists; and (f) career counseling. Finally, the
research training will be provided in a uniquely enriching setting that includes weekly meetings with under-
represented minority role models in biomedical research. The SPURS program addresses the critical need to
increase the pipeline of highly qualified minority trainees into neuroscience."

The mission of this application is to develop a structured, on-site summer environmental health sciences
research program for high school teachers and students from three rural, Indigenous communities in the
Northern Plains. The proposed program is a collaboration between the Columbia University Mailman School of
Public Health (MSPH) Department of Environmental Health Sciences (EHS) and Missouri Breaks Industries
Research Inc. (MBIRI), an American Indian-owned research center serving these Indigenous communities and
others in the Northern Plains. We propose the EARTH program (Environmental HeAlth Sciences Research for
Teachers and High School Students), to establish a structured summer environmental health sciences (EHS)
research program for high school teachers and students in these three communities. Research projects will be
locally relevant and reflect the priorities and values of the communities, leveraging EHS research that is already
taking place in these communities through collaboration with Columbia University and MBIRI researchers. One
teacher-student group from each community, comprised of one science teacher and 2-4 highly motivated high
school students, will be actively mentored through an EHS summer research project with support from expert
research mentors from both Columbia University and MBIRI. Research mentor teams will provide structured
workshops and educational training to teachers and students, and assist teams in developing and executing the
research project over the course of the summer through structured meetings. EARTH teacher-student teams
from all three communities will meet with the Program Directors and research mentors three times a week for
educational seminars relevant to conducting EHS research, science communication, and research translation,
and to share research progress updates in collaborative workshops. By the end of the summer period, teacher-
student teams will have prepared formal scientific presentations and infographics of their projects to be presented
at the EARTH Mini Symposium. Teams will also present their findings to the community advisory group at MBIRI,
to their classrooms during the following school year, and at MBIRI’s annual Research Symposium in the following
spring. Teachers will present their findings in virtual academic seminars at Columbia University. In addition to
these research and communication experiences, students will receive substantial mentorship and support in
preparing applications for undergraduate/training school programs and employment opportunities in EHS/STEM.
Teachers will also receive support to develop curriculum programs that they can implement in their classrooms.
By engaging high school students early in their training and exposing them to the broad range of environmental
health disciplines, we seek to support students from Indigenous communities to pursue careers and further
education in environmental health sciences."
10738783,"Anhedonia and amotivation are common in depressive presentations, and putatively thought to be
caused by alterations in the ways in which the brain anticipates, evaluates, and adaptively uses reward-related
information. However, reward processing is a complex, multi-circuit phenomenon, and the precise neural
mechanisms that contribute to the absence or reduction of typical hedonic and motivational outputs seen in
the clinic are still being elucidated. Heterogeneity in the clinical presentation of depression has long been a
rule rather than an exception, including individual variation in symptoms, severity, and treatment response.
This heterogeneity complicates understanding of depressive pathophysiology and thwarts progress toward
personalized disease classification and treatment planning. If the goal of personalized medicine in psychiatric
care is to be realized, biomarkers that account for the full range of depressive presentations need to be
developed (and ultimately validated). Discovery of biomarkers that go beyond the level of aggregate disease
definitions to account for neurobiological variation that presumably underlies distinct clinical manifestations
is critical to this larger effort.
 The proposed work combines clinically motivated questions with in-depth study of neurobiological
mechanisms to evaluate how reward system neurobiology contributes to expression of reward-related deficits,
such as anhedonia and amotivation in major depressive disorder (MDD), with a particular emphasis on
understanding depressive heterogeneity. Conceptually, we will use a multi-measure approach, by studying
Veterans with i) a passive slot machine reward task to isolate brain responses to reward anticipation and
receipt in the absence of confounding higher-order cognitive demands, and ii) a delay-discounting task to
assess higher-order aspects of reward processing necessary for reward valuation and decision-making.
Methodologically, we will use a multi-modality approach by combining fMRI, EEG, and behavioral
assessment, to more fully characterize reward-related brain functions and their clinical correlates. In addition
to evaluating reward effects between Veterans with MDD and healthy controls (HC), and examining
depressive heterogeneity within a large (n=150) MDD group, we will also focus on understanding the
relationship between reward processing and clinical features of high relevance to depression, with an
emphasis on suicidality. Specific Aim 1 will establish MDD deficits in reward processing at the level of
group averages (i.e., case-control comparisons of MDD vs. HC). Specific Aim 2 will examine the extent to
which data-driven subtyping of MDD can derive “biotypes” in Veterans, based on our EEG and fMRI reward
processing metrics, that segregate clinically relevant features. Specific Aim 3 will compare subgroups of
MDD with varying levels of suicidality."
10754848,"Project Summary/Abstract
There are approximately 5 million school-aged bilinguals in the United States, and 75% of these bilinguals
speak Spanish at home (National Center for Education Statistics, 2018). Despite this prevalence, there is a
lack of language assessment tools for children who speak more than one language. This lack of tools results in
incomplete assessment protocols that do not characterize children’s language abilities in their home language.
Thus, bilingual children do not receive appropriate intervention for communication disorders like developmental
language disorder (DLD), which affects their long-term quality of life (Conti-Ramsden et al., 2013). One
potential solution is the involvement of caregivers in the assessment process, who provide unique insights into
children’s language in a variety of contexts and may provide much needed information in the home language
(Restrepo, 1998). However, these assessment protocols have focused on accuracy-based measures, which
may not capture young children’s emerging morphosyntactic development (Rispoli et al., 2009). One promising
language assessment tool is grammatical productivity, which assesses children’s breadth and depth of
grammatical structures during language sampling to derive a productivity score (Hadley & Short, 2005). This
measure has been shown to differentiate typically developing English-speaking monolingual children from their
peers with DLD (Gladfelter & Leonard, 2013). The limited research available on productivity in Spanish-English
bilingual children has shown that the productivity of English grammatical structures yield group differences
between typically developing peers and those with low language abilities (Potapova et al., 2018). However,
children’s grammatical productivity has not yet been examined in Spanish, and this is necessary to fully
characterize Spanish-English bilingual children’s language ability. To address this gap, this project will develop
a Spanish grammatical productivity measure from the language samples of Spanish-English bilingual children
(Aim 1) and evaluate the use of Spanish grammatical productivity in caregiver reports through a culturally
adaptive framework (Aim 2). We will accomplish this by first determining which Spanish grammatical structures
would best contribute to a productivity measure from the language samples of Spanish-English bilingual
children, a subset of which have DLD. Mirroring similar strategies employed in the development of English
productivity (Hadley & Short, 2005), we will compare typically developing children’s productive use of Spanish
grammatical structures to that of children with DLD, and compare children’s Spanish productivity across ages.
Critically, we will also examine how our Spanish productivity measure may be adapted for use by Spanish-
speaking caregivers of bilingual children through a culturally adaptive framework, thus assessing the cultural
validity of this process. In sum, this work—grounded in a disorder within diversity framework (Oetting, 2018)—
will assess approaches to measuring bilinguals’ home language and ultimately reduce health disparities in this
population."

In the past 20 years, neuroscientists have focused on circuit-specific manipulations of the brain to identify
neuronal pathways controlling nicotine dependence and relapse using bioengineering approaches, such as
optogenetics and calcium imaging. These approaches have determined a causal relationship between
activation of localized neurons by nicotine and specific nicotine-related behaviors. However, we still have very
little understanding of how the brain, as a whole, processes this information because of a technical gap making
it difficult to image the whole brain at single-cell resolution. This is a critical problem for the field, as nicotine,
pharmacological and behavioral treatments affect the brain as a whole and not just specific circuits. The recent
development of single-cell whole-brain imaging of immediate-early genes using light-sheet microscopy on
cleared brains (iDisco+) has made the study of brain-wide functional networks at single-cell resolution possible.
The overarching hypothesis is that coordinated activation of long-range cholinergic neurons is associated with
decreased whole-brain modularity and withdrawal-related behaviors that can be partially normalized using
FDA-approved medications. The first goal of this proposal is to identify brain-wide functional networks at
single-cell resolution associated with acute nicotine intoxication, chronic nicotine dependence, withdrawal, and
protracted abstinence using iDisco+ imaging of immediate-early genes. The second goal is to identify the brain
activity patterns that control these states and predict the acute and long-term physiological and behavioral
response to nicotine using advanced neural network analyses. The third goal is to test the hypothesis that
FDA-approved medications will normalize these network changes. This project will lead to four outcomes that
will likely produce a long-lasting impact on the field: 1) Identification of the functional brain networks of acute
nicotine, nicotine dependence, acute withdrawal, and protracted abstinence. 2) Molecular phenotyping of the
functional network. 3) Identification of the major hub regions that predict withdrawal-related behaviors. 4)
Characterization of the brainprints of FDA-approved medications for tobacco use disorder. 5) Testing the
theory that coordinated activation of long-range cholinergic neurons is associated with decreased whole-brain
modularity and withdrawal-related behaviors."

Primary cilia, or non-motile cilia, are present in almost every mammalian cell. Ciliopathies cause a
spectrum of diseases in multiple organs, including the brain, kidney and liver. The most debilitating,
however, are sensory neuropathies leading to deafness and blindness. Retinal ciliopathies account for
one third of all inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), and are a major cause of visual impairment and
blindness in the pediatric population. Usher syndrome is the most common retinal ciliopathy and
presents a tremendous health burden due to congenital hearing impairment and progressive decline in
vision. Usher type 2 (USH2) is the most common subtype with the USH2A gene accounting for the
majority of cases. USH2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner; however, in approximately 20%
of patients with clinical features typical for USH2, only one mutation of USH2A has been identified by
exome sequencing, thereby precluding a definitive diagnosis. The second disease variant may reside in
non-coding regions of the USH2A gene. Whereas the protein coding variants of IRDs have been
studied in human and other model systems, the role of non-protein coding variants contributing to
monoallelic disease is much less understood. Non-coding variants are difficult to classify, especially in
gene products as large and complex as USH2A (spans 800 kilobases and contains 72 exons), and thus
remain under-diagnosed. Genome sequencing of IRD patients can identify pathogenic non-coding
variations in regulatory regions to explain causative changes and is increasingly being used to
genetically diagnose patients suffering from suspected monogenic disease. Phasing genetic variation is
also critical for human disease studies. We hypothesize that genomic sequencing and haplotype
phasing of the USH2A locus and its surrounding regulatory regions will provide a more accurate
detection of pathogenic variants in monoallelic patients. This will be accomplished by combining the
base-level accuracy of Illumina short-read sequencing with the longer read lengths obtained from
Nanopore based amplification-free targeted sequencing. Identification of non-coding variants and their
phase information are essential first steps towards understanding their pathogenic effects in patient-
derived stem cells. The pathogenicity of non-coding variants will be explored using luciferase knock-in
cell culture systems as well as patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated in
vitro to form retinal organoids (ROs). Use of ROs will provide clinically relevant tissue from patients that
can be edited using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to determine variant pathogenicity and mutational
burden. This proposal has tremendous therapeutic potential as non-coding deep-intronic variants have
been the focus of gene targeting and gene editing technologies in various IRDs."

 Coxiella burnetii is the highly infectious causative agent of Q fever, which can manifest as an acute or debil-
itating chronic disease. This naturally obligate intracellular bacterium infects alveolar macrophages, replicating
within a compartment that resembles a mature phagolysosome. A distinguishing characteristic of C. burnetii is
its ability to enter these cells without activating detectable innate immune defenses or polarizing the cell to a
proinflammatory phenotype. The virulence factors credited with this pathogenic paradigm are its unique anti-
inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the effectors secreted by its Type IVb Secretion system (T4SS). To
identify unappreciated virulence factors unrelated to LPS or T4SS of C. burnetii, a genetic screen employing
TnSeq compared the replication of Coxiella transposon mutants in Vero cells to that in primary macrophages.
The screen identified a series of mutants in genes related to cell wall function were required for replication only
in the context of the primary macrophages. These data suggested that bacterial cell wall components may belong
to an unappreciated class of Coxiella virulence factors. The long-term goal of this project is to describe the
molecular mechanism(s) by which the identified cell wall components contribute to the intracellular pathogenesis
of Coxiella. The central hypothesis is that the C. burnetii cell wall is specifically adapted to resist or evade the
innate defenses that are present in its preferred cellular host, macrophages. The objectives of this application
are to determine the 1) molecular functions and 2) virulence contributions of individual cell wall components that
are required for Coxiella’s survival and proliferation within primary macrophages. The role(s) of cell wall compo-
nents in Coxiella pathogenesis will be defined by pursuing the following specific aims: 1) determine the func-
tions of the candidate cell wall-related virulence genes, and 2) determine the effect of these cell wall
mutants on C. burnetii-host interactions. Specific aim 1 will focus on the molecular contribution of these
candidate virulence genes to survival and resistance to stresses specifically encountered within macrophages.
We will use multiple experimental approaches including complementation assays, biochemical analyses of pep-
tidoglycan and lipids, developmental and morphological analyses, and in vitro functional assays to define the
contribution of these cell wall components to Coxiella survival. Specific aim 2 will investigate the response of
macrophages to infection with these interesting cell wall mutants. By employing RNAseq, enzymatic activity
assays, and secretion assays, we will build a holistic view of the host response to these mutants. We anticipate
that the proposed series of experiments will lay the foundation for a strong, long-lived research program that
links cell wall integrity to Coxiella burnetii’s distinguishing environmental stability and incomparable ability to
survive in a microbicidal niche."

Although adolescents (ages 11 to 17) make treatment gains (e.g., reduced internalizing or externalizing
behaviors) in psychiatric residential treatment (RT), they experience significant difficulty adapting to the
community and often do not sustain treatment gains long term. After RT, 70% of adolescents discharge to their
family of origin. However, parents are not provided with the necessary support or behavior management
skillset to bridge the gap between RT and home. A new federal mandate will soon require parent training, an
evidence-based behavior management intervention, in the RT setting. Parents with adolescents admitted to RT
are a difficult-to-reach population, and technology may increase access and uptake of parent training.
Parenting Wisely (PW) is a web-based parent training with demonstrated efficacy in increasing effective
parenting practices to reduce adolescent behavior problems. We previously found that PW was highly feasible
for parents and the skills were perceived as useful. However, parents reported two unmet needs: (1) skill
individualization to apply the PW skills and (2) enhanced community to reduce isolation. In collaboration with
an advisory board (a partner in the proposed study), we augmented PW with clinician facilitated discussion
groups (referred to as PWRT). The discussion groups in PWRT supports program completion and parent
engagement, provides a venue to discuss individualizing PW strategies, reduces isolation, and support parents
by engaging in conversation about parenting in the RT context. The proposed study aims to: (1) establish
feasibility and acceptability of PWRT, (2) evaluate whether PWRT engages target mechanisms (parental self-
efficacy, parenting behaviors, social support, family function), and (3) determine the effects of PWRT on
adolescent outcomes (internalizing and externalizing behaviors, placement restrictiveness). Sixty parents (30
per condition) will be randomly assigned to PWRT or treatment-as-usual (TAU). Each week for six weeks,
parents will complete two PW modules (20 minutes each) and attend one discussion group via Zoom (90-
minutes). PWRT will be initiated towards the end of the RT admission and continue post-discharge to bridge the
transition from RT to the community. Adolescents (n=60) will not receive intervention; however, we will
evaluate the feasibility of adolescent data collection for future studies. Data from parents and adolescents will
be collected at baseline, 6-weeks, and 6-months post-baseline to allow for a robust understanding of the
longer-term effects of PWRT on treatment gain maintenance. Consistent with PAR-21-211, our team of
researchers and community partners is collecting the requisite data for a larger-scale effectiveness trial by
testing the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effects of PWRT vs. TAU. PWRT is among the first web-
based parent training augmented with supportive elements designed to engage parents with adolescents in
RT. By providing parents with tailored education and support in PWRT, parents will be equipped with the
behavior management skillset to provide structure in the home and ultimately maintain RT treatment gains."
10767357,"Project Summary/Abstract
Approximately half the human genome is comprised of repetitive DNA sequences that are thought to control a
wide range of cellular functions. DNA repeats are found throughout the genome, and are polymorphic in length
due to their genetic instability. Mutation rates of repeat elements are 101-105 fold higher than in other parts of
the genome, and is triggered by the formation of transient unusual DNA structures (extrahelical extrusions)
during DNA metabolic processes. The detrimental consequences of repeat instability are exemplified by triplet
repeat expansions that cause a number of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s disease,
Friedreich’s ataxia and Fragile X related disorders. The rate of expansion of triplet repeats is proportional to
repeat length and sequence homogeneity. DNA repair mechanisms have evolved to maintain genomic stability,
and protect the DNA from damage caused by environmental agents. One such process is DNA mismatch repair
(MMR), a highly conserved antimutagenic pathway that maintains the stability of the human genome by
correcting replication errors and preventing chromosomal rearrangements. Unexpectedly, a mutagenic non-
canonical function of MMR has been implicated as the cause of triplet repeat expansions. Loss of MMR function
attenuates triplet repeat expansion, although the molecular mechanisms of this non-canonical MMR activity are
poorly understood. However, this mutagenic action of MMR requires the proteins MutSb and MutLa (and possibly
MutLg). FAN1 is a deoxyribonuclease that was originally identified as a factor involved in the repair of DNA
interstrand crosslinks. Loss of FAN1 function exacerbates repeat expansion, suggesting a role for FAN1 in
suppression of triplet repeat expansion by mechanisms that are not understood. We are interested in the
molecular mechanisms responsible for the crosstalk between these opposing effects of MMR and FAN1 in the
control of mutation production within triplet repeats. We have discovered a novel activator of the FAN1 nuclease
on triplet repeat extrusions, a finding that represents the first step not only in our understanding of the mechanism
of FAN1 action, but also in our quest to develop a unified understanding of the mechanism of triplet repeat
expansion by integrating biochemical, cellular, and genetic studies. In Aim 1, we will elucidate the molecular
features of FAN1 nuclease function by evaluating the modulatory effects of DNA sequence/structure and protein
co-factors. In Aim 2, we will dissect the role of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions in the repair of triplet
repeat extrusions by FAN1. In Aim 3, we will use unbiased proteomic approaches to identify co-factors that
facilitate FAN1 nuclease function in a cellular milieu. Completion of these studies will shed light on the pathways
that modulate triplet repeat expansion, and will have implications more broadly for the mechanisms of genome
instability."
10792589,"Arrhythmias refer to the disruption of the natural heart rhythm. This irregular heart
rhythm causes the heart to suddenly stop pumping blood. Arrhythmias increase the risk
of heart attack, cardiac arrest and stroke. Atrial pathologies are the most common
arrhythmias with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter being the most prevalent. The number
of individuals with atrial fibrillation in the United States is expected to reach 12 million by
2050 since the prevalence increases with aging. Atrial flutter, often a result of ablative
treatment, is also expected to rise as more of these treatments are administered. On the
other hand, ventricular arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular
fibrillation denote extremely fast and chaotic rhythms, respectively, and can cause
sudden cardiac death. This is partly because there is currently no noninvasive diagnostic
imaging of arrhythmias. On the therapeutic front, in addition to pharmacological
treatment, the first line of treatment of most arrhythmias is direct current cardioversion
(DCCV), which denotes electrical defibrillation of the heart to reinstate its sinus rhythm.
Despite the fact that DCCV remains highly successful in the short-term, it remains very
difficult to determine which subjects will revert to their arrhythmias within the first 24
hours of treatment and will have to return to the healthcare premises for additional
cardioversions that, apart from the inconvenience to the patient, result in major life
disruption, pain and distress. When pharmacological treatment or cardioversion fail,
radiofrequency (RF) ablation (RFA) is warranted, which currently constitutes a lengthy
procedure (2-4 h/session) with a 55% success rate and thus often leading to repeated
treatments to typically correct prior, incomplete ablations. An imaging technique to better
inform on treatment response is thus warranted. To address the urgent need for
noninvasive arrhythmia mapping, our group has pioneered Electromechanical Wave
Imaging (EWI) that characterizes the electromechanical function throughout the four
cardiac chambers to both identify the arrhythmic source (if applicable) but also inform
treatment response. Should the findings of the proposed study indicate high reliability in
guidance of clinical procedures, this novel imaging technology could be readily
implemented in a clinical setting as part of a standard echocardiogram in order to
increase the currently low time- and cost-efficiency as well as success rates of
arrhythmia treatment."

One-third of U.S. adults have prediabetes and are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its devastating
health consequences. The landmark Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) trial demonstrated that a resource-
intensive, one-on-one program combining diet and physical activity changes, could reduce the 3-year risk of
type 2 diabetes by 58% compared with usual care. Consequently, the DPP is considered one of the best
examples of how a nutritional program can prevent disease, and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and others recommend the DPP as a first-line treatment for adults with prediabetes. The
CDC’s National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) is an adaptation of the DPP trial curriculum, using
group-based delivery. It teaches participants to follow a low-fat, calorie-restricted diet, as this was the
prevailing dietary advice when the DPP trial was designed over 30 years ago. The NDPP is now available at
>1,500 sites throughout the United States and reimbursed by Medicare and other payors. Yet, despite
widespread availability, only 36% of participants achieve the program goal of ≥5% body weight loss and, when
measured, HbA1c reduces on average less than 0.1%. We hypothesize that adapting the NDPP to teach a
different dietary strategy—a very-low-carbohydrate diet (VLCD)—will increase the effectiveness of the NDPP
as a tool for type 2 diabetes risk reduction. Carbohydrate intake is the strongest factor impacting post-prandial
glycemia, and a VLCD—due to its ability to reduce glycemia, weight, and the need for anti-hyperglycemic
medications—is now recommended by the American Diabetes Association for treatment of type 2 diabetes. To
date, there are neither high-quality, randomized controlled trials testing how effective a VLCD is at reducing the
risk of type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes, nor randomized trials of VLCD versions of any DPP. To
begin to fill this critical gap, our team has developed and pilot tested a VLCD version of the NDPP (VLC-
NDPP), delivered by our CDC-recognized community partner, the National Kidney Foundation of Michigan.
Our findings demonstrate that a VLC-NDPP is feasible and acceptable. We now propose to conduct a 12-
month, 1:1, randomized trial that will assign 300 overweight or obese adults with prediabetes to either the
standard NDPP or the VLC-NDPP. The primary outcome is glycemic control (measured by HbA1c), with
secondary outcomes including body weight, body fat percentage, glycemic variability, and inflammation. We
will also explore the barriers to and facilitators of glycemic control and dietary adherence using mixed methods.
As the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the understanding of personalized interventions continue to increase,
there is a critical need to provide additional effective options for population-level type 2 diabetes prevention
strategies. If the VLC-DPP shows promise, this trial would be a precursor to a multi-site trial with incidence of
type 2 diabetes as the primary outcome."
10825517,"Dementia caused by Alzheimer’s disease affects approximately 5.6M adults over age 65, with costs expected
to rise from $307B to $1.5T over the next 30 years. Behavioral interventions have shown promise for mitigating
neurodegeneration and cognitive impairments. Sleep is a modifiable health behavior that is critical for cognition
and deteriorates with advancing age and Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, it is a priority to examine whether
improving sleep modifies Alzheimer’s disease pathophysiology and cognitive function. Our research suggests
that deeper, more consolidated sleep is positively associated with memory and executive functions and
networks that underlie these processes. Our preliminary studies confirm that time-in-bed restriction
interventions increase sleep efficiency and non-rapid eye movement slow-wave activity (SWA) and suggest
that increases in SWA are associated with improved cognitive function. SWA reflects synaptic downscaling
predominantly among prefrontal connections. Downscaling of prefrontal connections with the hippocampus
during sleep may help to preserve the long-range connections that support memory and cognitive function. In
pre-clinical Alzheimer’s disease, hyperactivation of the hippocampus is thought to be excitotoxic and is shown
to leave neurons vulnerable to further Aβ deposition. Synaptic downscaling through SWA may mitigate the
progression of Alzheimer’s disease through these pathways. The proposed study will behaviorally increase
sleep depth (SWA) through four weeks of time-in-bed restriction in older adults characterized on Aβ deposition
and multiple factors associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk. We will examine whether behaviorally enhanced
SWA reduces hippocampal hyperactivation, leading to improved task-related prefrontal-hippocampal
connectivity, plasma Aβ levels, and cognitive function. This research addresses whether a simple, feasible,
and scalable behavioral sleep intervention improves functional neuroimaging indices of excitotoxicity,
Alzheimer’s pathophysiology, and cognitive performance."

Ischemic retinopathies, such as diabetic retinopathy and retinal vein occlusion, are the leading cause
of blindness in the United States. Common features are leaky vessels, swelling, capillary drop out,
aberrant vessel growth and retinal detachment. Current treatments include laser ablation, anti-VEGFs
and steroids. All are sub-optimal and only serve to slow disease progression and vision loss, and do
not repair or regenerate the damaged vessels. Laser treatment is used to ablate avascular/ischemic
regions of the retina to reduce the hypoxic drive which causes the abnormal vascular permeability,
exudation and neovascularization. Anti-VEGFs and steroids transiently reduce vascular permeability
but do not aid in normal retinal blood vessel repair or regeneration. However, the current product,
Noregen (a norrin derived growth factor) restores vessel integrity and regenerates new non-
fenestrated capillaries. Proof of principal was established in the most widely employed animal model
for ischemic retinopathies, the mouse Oxygen Induced Retinopathy (OIR) model. In this Phase II
project, we will optimize dosing of intravitreal injections, create and qualify analytical methods that will
be used to establish product release criteria, and run preliminary pharmacokinetics studies to support
an FDA IND submission. The long term goal of this project is to create a novel therapy for ischemic
retinopathies that will restore the retina rather than simply slow pathology and vision loss."
10837643,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of renal cell carcinoma. Although
outcomes are favorable with early detection and surgery, approximately 30% of patients present with
metastatic disease. This highlights the need for an improved biochemical understanding of and targeted
therapeutic options for ccRCC. ccRCC is a uniquely vascular cancer due to mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau
(VHL) gene, which encodes the substrate recognition subunit of a ubiquitin ligase that degrades hypoxia-
inducible factor-α (HIF-α) transcription factors in normoxia. VHL loss results in nuclear HIF-α accumulation and
aberrant expression of downstream pro-angiogenic gene targets in a likely HIF-2α-biased manner. Thus,
ccRCC tumors are uniquely susceptible to anti-angiogenic therapies, which though effective, are associated
with substantial undesirable toxicities for patients. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that mutations in
Polybromo-1 (PBRM1), an epigenetic acetyl-lysine reader protein commonly mutated in ccRCC, correlate with
improved outcomes for anti-angiogenic therapies. However, these studies presume that all PBRM1 mutations
are loss-of-function and neglect to consider that ~15% of ccRCC-related PBRM1 mutations are missense
mutations, generating full-length proteins with a spectrum of undetermined structural and functional impacts.
ccRCC-associated PBRM1 missense mutations cluster in bromodomains (BDs), the functional domains of
PBRM1 that bind acetyl-lysine residues in histones and other nuclear proteins and nucleic acids. Therefore, a
better knowledge of the biochemical impacts of PBRM1 BD missense mutations in ccRCC is critical to promote
PBRM1 as a predictive biomarker for patient response to anti-antiangiogenic therapies, so that non-responding
patients can avoid unnecessary therapeutic toxicity and seek alternative treatments. This fellowship will
elucidate the biochemical impacts of ccRCC-associated PBRM1 BD missense mutations on protein stability
and acetylated histone binding function and determine the role of PBRM1 in the regulation of the HIF-2α and
angiogenesis pathways. Aim 1 will identify which PBRM1 BD missense mutations are biochemically benign or
deleterious for protein structure and function by integrating computational prediction with biophysical assay
validation. Aim 2 will determine the effects of PBRM1 BD missense mutations on HIF-2α and angiogenesis
pathway regulation by assessing HIF-2α transcriptional output, HIF-2α promoter accessibility, and angiogenic
potential in ccRCC cellular assays. This fellowship addresses knowledge gaps in the biochemical basis of
ccRCC pathogenesis with the overall goal to promote the most effective use of standard ccRCC treatment
modalities. Successful completion of this fellowship will further precision medicine approaches for the
treatment of ccRCC by advancing PBRM1 mutational status as a nuanced and predictive biomarker to prevent
unnecessary patient drug exposures."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and obesity is one of the
highest risk factors for CVD. Our lab has shown that restricting intake of high fat diet (HFD) to the 12-hour active
period for the last 2 weeks in a 20-week diet induced obesity (DIO) model significantly reduces aortic wall
thickness and fibrosis and restores aortic endothelial function. We also found that DIO significantly increases
aortic Th17 cells, which are an inflammatory CD4+ T cell subset that are known to drive progression of
autoimmunity and organ damage. Interestingly, time restricted feeding (TRF) in the final 2 weeks of the DIO
protocol reduced aortic Th17 cells. Th17 cells are the main producer of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-17A. IL-
17A has been known to drive CVD risk factors, however, it is unclear if TRF reduces aortic damage via the IL-
17A pathway. Furthermore, we have preliminary data that TRF in DIO is associated with greater circulating
propionate and butyrate, which are two important microbial-derived short chain fatty acids (SCFA). SCFA are
important for regulating hypertension and promoting anti-inflammatory T cell subsets, however, their role in DIO
induced tissue damage is unclear. DIO is associated with decreased SCFA production, which could indicate that
propionate and butyrate are necessary for protection against DIO damage. This led us to hypothesize that
reduction of IL-17A and increased SCFA with TRF drive aortic protection and improved endothelial function in
DIO. We will use C57Bl6/J mice for our 20-week DIO model with TRF intervention in the final two weeks of
feeding. During those 2 weeks, mice will receive anti-mouse IL-17A or IgG antibody daily at Zeitgeber Time (ZT)
0, the start of the inactive period. Using these groups, we will assess aortic damage via pulse wave velocity
(PWV) and histology. We will also assess endothelial function via vascular reactivity by stimulating the aorta with
acetylcholine to assess endothelial dependent vasorelaxation. Sodium nitroprusside is used to assess
endothelial independent vasorelaxation. Furthermore, we will use our TRF intervention in DIO to assess
pathogenicity of Th17 cells in the aorta via single cell RNA sequencing. Th17 cells that upregulate the IL-23
receptor (IL-23R) are known to have greater pathogenic capabilities. In aim 2, we will use our 20-week DIO
model with C57Bl6/J mice. During the final two weeks, the diet will be supplemented with 5% butyrate and
propionate by weight in the inactive period as that is where we see increase of circulating SCFA. We will assess
how dietary SCFA affects aortic Th17 cells via flow cytometry. Flow cytometry will allow us to immunophenotype
the cells to identify if SCFA have an effect specifically on Th17 cells. We will also assess aortic damage and
function via histology and PWV measurements at the conclusion of the 20-week DIO protocol. Endothelial
function will also be assessed via vascular reactivity experiments. The main goal of this proposal is to identify
how TRF in DIO improves aortic damage and endothelial function through regulation of Th17 cell pathogenicity."

Metals are found in almost every protein that serves a biological function, and understanding their role in
the chemical reactions that guide metabolism and respiration is critical to improving outcomes for a number of
genetic diseases and for identifying new therapeutic drug targets. These metal-containing proteins (metalloen-
zymes) are amenable to study via x-ray spectroscopy, which can elucidate the behavior of electrons during
metal-catalyzed chemical reactions and, when paired with quantum chemistry calculations, a deep under-
standing of the reaction pathways. Quantum chemistry provides the most nuanced and detailed picture of the
chemistry of electrons in all of science, allowing for models of unparalleled insight to be constructed. While ad-
vances in synchrotron light sources have pushed experimental x-ray spectroscopy into the future, methods for
computational x-ray spectroscopy have not yet achieved a sufﬁcient balance of efﬁciency and accuracy for the
study of metalloenzymes. The work proposed herein will pursue a suite of accurate and efﬁcient computational
x-ray spectroscopy methods based on quantum chemistry. Recent developments in time-dependent density
functional theory will be extended to properly deal with the unpaired electrons that typify the metal centers
within metalloenzymes. This approach will then be used alongside cutting-edge wave function analysis meth-
ods in quantum chemistry to determine whether copper atoms ever adopt a 3+ oxidation state in the reaction
mechanism of tyrosinase. The existence, or lack thereof, of Cu(III) in vivo is critical to guiding our chemical un-
derstanding of metalloenzyme reactivity, but its presence has yet to be directly identiﬁed in biological systems.
To carefully address this question, additional methods will be designed using more theoretically rigorous wave
function theory (WFT), thus avoiding potential errors imposed by approximations inherent to density functional
theory and giving access to the L-edge part of the x-ray spectrum. Combined, these methods will achieve
the most comprehensive computational characterization of copper intermediates in metalloenzyme reaction
pathways reported to date. This computational analysis will simulate the x-ray, resonance Raman, and opti-
cal absorption spectra that will be collected by experimental collaborator, Ed Solomon (ES). After addressing
the question of Cu(III), additional investigations into iron(IV)-oxo intermediates will be pursued with a similar
protocol. With the combined insights of quantum chemistry and empirical data, the identity of the chemical
intermediates in metalloenzyme catalysis will ﬁnally be revealed. A highly collaborative environment at Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley (UCB) will allow for frequent interactions with world-class researchers. The
proposed research will be carried out under the guidance of Martin Head-Gordon and with the assistance of
ES at Stanford University. The career training plan includes mentoring graduate students, teaching courses,
attending workshops on accessibility in research environments and grant-writing, networking, and performing
community outreach. This training plan will build a strong foundation for a career in health-related research."
10848212,"Myelin is the multilamellar membrane generated by glial cells that insulates, nourishes and protects axons
in the vertebrate nervous system. In the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocytes (OLs) form the
myelin sheath. OL follow an orderly and distinct developmental pattern with stage-specific functions. OL
precursor cell (OPC) proliferate. Pre-myelinating OL (pmOL) mediate initial axon ensheathment and
myelinating OL (mOL) carry out iterative axon wraps. Our published work demonstrates that G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR56 regulates OPC proliferation by mediating a tripartite signaling between
OPC GPR56, microglia-derived tissue transglutaminase, and matrix protein laminin-111. Intriguingly, single
cell RNAseq data reveals that, within the OL lineage, GPR56 is expressed highest at the pmOL stage. Our
unpublished data provide tantalizing evidence that (1) pmOL GPR56 is required for F-actin formation;
(2) deleting Gpr56specifically in pmOLs results in reduced myelination of the corpus callosum (CC); and (3)
pmOLs lacking Gpr56 were unable to form myelin in co-cultured Shiverer cerebellar slices. Taking these
data all together, we hypothesize that GPR56 functions in pmOLs to regulate actin organization of the pre-myelinating OL process. This proposal is designed to test this hypothesis, thus establishing novel GPCR
signaling pathway in pmOL F-actin polymerization and axon ensheathment. Our data will enhance the
understanding of the basic biology of myelination and will potentially reveal a new target for therapeutics to
promote repair in the wide spectrum of neurological diseases that implicate myelin damage."

 Despite the great progress in recent decades, many types of cancer remain almost fatal. Pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a remarkable example. One of the challenges is that the vast majority (95%)
of PDACs are driven by mutations within a gene called KRAS, and these KRAS mutations are notoriously difficult
to target with conventional drugs. The first generation of cancer drugs are based on small molecules, the second
generation biologics (large biomolecules such as antibodies that specifically bind to cancer cells), and the latest
generation cells (engineered to recognize and ablate cancer cells). Here our long-term goal is to demonstrate a
new generation of therapeutics, using “circuits” as medicine. Circuits metaphorically refer to collections of
biomolecules engineered to regulate each other and process information inside living cells. While conventional
analyses output metrics to inform physicians, who then make therapeutic decisions, our circuits close the loop,
and will serve as both the analytic and the therapeutic tools. It is a molecular and cellular analysis technology
that queries living cells and actuates therapeutic outputs in real time without human intervention.
 Specifically, we will create circuits to program the immune system and emulate the “abscopal effect”, the
occasional observation that distant tumors shrink when local tumors are treated, most likely due to the immune
system learning the “signature” of the treated tumors and then extrapolating. We will first create the building
blocks for such circuits: sensors that can interrogate whether a cell is in a cancerous state, actuators that can
control the signals sent by cells to engage the immune system, and processors that connect the sensors and
the actuators. These efforts will benefit from our experience of building circuits exclusively using proteins, which
features technical advantages, such as ease of delivery and robustness of functionality in different cellular
contexts, compared to more conventional ways of building circuits based on protein-DNA interactions. We will
then assemble these building blocks into circuits, and quantify and optimize their operation in cultured cells.
Leveraging our expertise in mouse models of PDACs, we will finally test these circuits’ efficacy in vivo. The
premise is to program the outputs specifically from cancer cells to mobilize the immune system and then lyse
these cells to grant the immune system access to all protein sequences that are uniquely present in cancer.
These dead cancer cells will serve essentially as vaccines against other cells that exhibit similar protein
sequence profiles. We will achieve this vaccination effect by either mimicking a specific type of cell death known
to mobilize the immune system, or program the cancer cells to directly and artificially activate T cells – immune
cells responsible for recognizing and ablating cancer cells.
 The expected outcomes of this proposal are not only preclinical evidence supporting a novel, powerful
therapy for KRAS-driven PDAC, but also a proof of principle for the biomedical promise of synthetic biomolecular
circuits for other recalcitrant types of cancer and beyond."

Prion proteins are notorious in biology for causing deadly, infectious brain diseases.
Beyond disease, however, prions completely altered our understanding of heredity, and
contrary to their reputation, they are not only disease-causing agents. Instead, they are
found across kingdoms of life, and are an epigenetic mechanism that affects a panoply
of cellular processes, also producing biologically beneficial traits. In this proposal we
focus on prions that regulate RNA, specifically, prionogenic conformations of RNA-
modifying enzymes. These highly conserved enzymes catalyze numerous chemical
modifications on RNA that are critical for their structure and function. The goal of our
research is to understand how prion-like forms of these enzymes may alter their activities
on RNA, producing changes to gene expression, and ultimately, leading to long-lasting,
heritable growth phenotypes, such as resistance to environmental stress. One recent
such example that we have detailed is a prionogenic form of a pseudouridine synthase,
which affects cell proliferation, aging, and protein synthesis. This work led us to
investigate the capacity for other RNA-modifying enzymes to have prion-like behavior,
and we now have several new examples for study. In this proposal, we will investigate
whether RNA modifications are changed when the enzymes that make them adopt prion-
like conformations, the effects these changes have on gene expression, the role for
enzyme catalysis, the structure of the infectious prion protein, and whether the prion-
based behavior that we have observed in budding yeast is conserved in human cells. We
approach these questions using a combination of genetics, high-throughput sequencing,
classical biochemical methods, and fluorescence microscopy. In summary, this work aims
to uncover the molecular details of epigenetic, prion-based regulation of RNA that affects
cell growth and survival."

Understanding how evolutionary forces shape genetic variation for quantitative traits is crucial
for determining the prevalence of genetic disease in human populations. Despite numerous
examples that genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE) are important for the maintenance of
variation for biologically and medically important traits, we lack a clear understanding of the role
that GxE plays in shaping genetic variation and of the evolutionary processes that shape GxE.
In particular two broad processes could contribute to GxE: local adaptation for plastic responses
and variation in selective constraint across environments.
The proposed work evaluates the importance of these two evolutionary processes in shaping
GxE in natural populations. We will leverage large genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic
datasets in systems where identical genotypes can be phenotyped across multiple
biologically-realistic environments. First, we will use an extension of a test previously developed
by the PI to look for evidence of local adaptation shaping genetic variation for plastic responses,
contributing to GxE. Next, we will develop a new analysis looking for a covariance between
allele frequency and environment-specific effect sizes, consistent with the hypothesis that
variation in selective constraint shapes GxE. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that relaxed
selective constraint on rarely-expressed plastic responses limits the evolution of adaptive
plasticity by testing for evidence of reduced negative selection on genes that are only expressed
in specific environments.
Overall, this work will determine the evolutionary processes that shape GxE, filling a crucial gap
in our understanding of the maintenance of variation for quantitative traits and providing
methods that will be useful to researchers in a variety of systems."
10837896,"Rapid advances in genomics have ushered in new opportunities for Mendelian disease discovery and
diagnosis. In the last decade, exome and genome sequencing have moved from the research domain to
clinical practice. These approaches have identified new disease genes and causative variants for ~30% of
individuals suffering from a rare genetic disease. We believe that the systematic application of promising new
genomics assays coupled with innovative computational approaches will foster discovery benefitting the 70%
of symptomatic individuals without a genetic diagnosis. To this end we will apply long-read whole genome
sequencing, RNA-sequencing, epigenomics assays, metabolomics and targeted in vitro and in vivo assays to
evaluate a cohort of undiagnosed individuals suspected to have a Mendelian disorder. Our approach will be
augmented through the development and application of computational strategies enabling improved gene and
phenotype matching, integrative multi-omics analysis, and variant interpretation. This work is expected to
establish a new frontier in Mendelian disease discovery. Our Mendelian Genomics Research Center (MRGC)
team has developed key prior expertise and leadership in the use of diverse state-of-the-art experimental and
computational methods for the diagnosis and discovery of Mendelian disorders. We hypothesize that the next
phase of Mendelian genomics research will be defined by assessing and deploying the most effective ‘omics’
strategies. We propose that ongoing and iterative integration of functional genomics data into the translational
genomics toolkit will significantly increase discovery of new gene and variant disease associations beyond the
capabilities of DNA-sequencing assays alone. To facilitate this, we will comprehensively study 400 individuals
and their immediate family members (N= 900 total) with Mendelian disease where exome sequencing has not
yielded a genetic diagnosis. These represent a select cohort of hard to solve cases intractable to DNA
sequencing to date. In Aim 1, individuals recruited into the study will undergo short-read and long-read whole
genome sequencing, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq and MethylC-seq across multiple commonly used cell/tissue types
as well as metabolomics and lipidomics assays. This dataset will define a holistic view of emerging genomics
approaches for Mendelian disease diagnosis and facilitate evaluation of the relative merits of each approach.
In Aim 2, we focus on computational innovations that will improve integration of these multi-omics data in gene
and variant interpretation by integrating functional genomics outliers and advanced statistical learning
approaches. These methods will be applicable broadly across the MGRC and the world. In Aim 3, we apply
state-of-the-art targeted approaches including massively-parallel reporter assays, induced-pluripotent stem cell
functional genomics, CRISPR screens for modifier genes and engineered mouse models to detect and validate
novel causal variants and genes. Work at our site will potentiate the broad impact of the MGRC by providing a
platform for functional genomics research, validation and diagnosis in Mendelian disease."

10910986,"Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are a proven β-lactam drug target, yet resistance to β-lactam
antibiotics, such as carbapenems and cephalosporins, has resulted in a global health problem. There are a
number of resistance mechanisms of which β-lactam degrading β-lactamases is one of the main culprits.
 Our goal is to overcome the resistance mechanisms often associated with β-lactams by studying and
developing a different type of PBP inhibitor, the pyrazolidinone. The pyrazolidinones YU253434 and
YU253911 contain a siderophore moiety to facilitate iron-mediated uptake. We have found that these two
pyrazolidinones cannot be hydrolyzed by Classes A, C, and D β-lactamases and are only slowly hydrolyzed
by (Class B) metallo β-lactamases. YU253434 and YU253911 also compared favorably to aztreonam,
ceftazidime, meropenem, ceftolozane/tazobactam, and ceftazidime/avibactam when microbiologically
tested against panels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and
Acinetobacter baumannii (all four are ESKAPE pathogens). YU253911 also significantly lowered colony-
forming units in a mouse thigh-infection model with an MDR P. aeruginosa strain. The pyrazolidinones target
and inhibit PBP3, and we have delineated their binding modes to P. aeruginosa PBP3 crystallographically.
 Overall, we found that these pyrazolidinones have several favorable attributes, yet further improvements
are needed in terms of PBP3 IC50, uptake, and ability to overcome the known PBP3 F533L resistance
mutation. We propose these improvements in the following two specific Aims.
Specific Aim 1. To improve the pyrazolidinone affinity via structure-based modifications targeting the R2
group. Based on the crystal structure, we hypothesize that hydrophobic substituents added to
pyrazolidinones in the siderophore-linker will interact with the hydrophobic bridge residues F533 and V333
in PBP3 and thereby improve affinity. Additionally, these hydrophobic interactions are designed to
counteract the F533L resistance mutation. We will test the compounds microbiologically against panels of
well-studied K. pneumoniae, A. baumannii, Escherichia coli, and P. aeruginosa, measure PBP inhibition
both wt and F533L P. aeruginosa PBP3, and probe their binding mode crystallographically, biophysically,
and using molecular dynamics simulations.
Specific Aim 2. To improve the iron–independent and iron-mediated uptake of pyrazolidinones via adding
an amine-containing moiety to the siderophore-linker (Aim 2a) and by incorporating a siderophore with an
electron-withdrawing –Cl group adjacent to the hydroxyl groups to improve iron affinity (Aim 2b).
This high-risk, high-reward proposal aims to develop a more potent non-β-lactam PBP-targeting
pyrazolidinone that could lead to a novel therapeutic strategy to combat antibiotic resistance."

10823940,"Abstract: Transcription is one of the first steps in gene expression, and the many protein factors involved must
be tightly regulated to correctly carry out cellular processes. The Integrator complex, a 15-subunit metazoan-
specific complex, was initially discovered to be crucial for the proper transcription of certain non-coding RNAs.
Recently, it has been found that Integrator is a broad transcriptional regulator with roles at many protein-coding
and non-coding genes. Integrator acts as a negative regulator of RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription
through promoter-proximal termination and can alter its functionality in response to stress, such as DNA damage
or reactive oxygen species. Despite its critical role in fine-tuning transcriptional regulation, it is not yet understood
how Integrator is assembled and regulated, presenting a knowledge gap in the field.
 Our preliminary experiments strikingly revealed that a key factor involved in DNA damage repair (DDR)
associates with a global regulator of RNAPII activity, thus providing a previously unknown connection between
these two processes. Specifically, the BRCA1-ATM activator 1 (BRAT1) associates with Integrator subunit 11
(INTS11), the endonuclease-containing subunit within the Integrator complex. BRAT1 is a cytoplasmic protein
that re-localizes to the nucleus upon DNA damage to act as a scaffold between the site of damage and repair
proteins. Our cryo-EM analysis of the INTS11-BRAT1 heterodimer reveals that BRAT1 forms a circular structure
around INTS11 and uses three conserved C-terminal residues to bind to the INTS11 active site, preventing its
cleavage of RNA. Additionally, the cryo-EM analysis showed that INTS9 can bind to form an INTS11-INTS9-
BRAT1 heterotrimer, suggesting interplay between BRAT1 as an inhibitor of INTS11 and other members of the
Integrator complex. The goal of this proposal is to examine the function and mechanism of action of these two
unique complexes. To examine the function, our lab generated BRAT1 null cell lines and a rapid depletion system
using the auxin-inducible degron (AID) tag to allow quick depletion of INTS11. Initial studies of these lines show
that BRAT1 loss results in an INTS11 depletion phenotype, presenting upregulation of genes negatively
regulated by Integrator. Overall, these data present a model where BRAT1 could regulate Integrator activity
through its association with INTS9/11. The hypothesis is that BRAT1 acts as a licensing factor, facilitating the
assembly of the Integrator complex and providing precise regulation, which is especially important during cellular
stress such as DNA damage. To test this hypothesis, three aims are proposed. First, the interaction between
BRAT1 and INTS9/11 will be biochemically defined to further probe the structure. Next, the impact of BRAT1 on
the canonical Integrator complex function will be determined. Finally, the impact of INTS11-INTS9-BRAT1 during
DNA damage repair will be elucidated. Successful completion of these aims will provide a more thorough
understanding of the regulation and assembly of the Integrator complex."
10929538,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Growing evidence reports that women show a more aggressive profile of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) than men with greater pathological tau burden and steeper cognitive decline; yet the
reasons for these sex differences are poorly understood. Sex differences in AD point to sex-disparate causal
pathways as well as sex-specific therapeutic targets. Neuroinflammation (N-Inf) is one candidate casual pathway
that shows sex disparities and plays a central role in AD pathogenesis with close ties to both tau and cognitive
decline. Women tend to have a more robust immune/inflammatory response and comprise 80% of autoimmune
disease cases. Moreover, our own preliminary work in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative indicated
that women may be more susceptible than men to the adverse effect of N-Inf, particularly the markers of TNFα,
IL6 and their receptors on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) and cognitive function.
There are also lifestyle factors such as physical activity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) known to influence N-
Inf and relate to tau and cognitive decline and to do so differently in women versus men. Our own preliminary data
highlight sedentary behavior and obstructive sleep apnea as two modifiable risk factors that show strong
associations with N-Inf, tau and/or cognitive function in older women, and thus stress the need to further
understand how and to what degree these lifestyle interventions could reduce AD risk. Together, these findings
led us to this proposed observational study that will examine how N-Inf markers (specifically TNFα, TNFR2, IL6
and IL6R) and the modifiable risk factors that influence N-Inf relate to tau accumulation and cognitive decline in
older women at-risk for AD by way of mild cognitive deficits and genetic risk. Moreover, we will explore how sex
hormones, particularly testosterone, contribute to these relationships given their anti-inflammatory and central
nervous system effects and often contributing role to sex differences. To achieve this, we propose to measure
CSF N-Inf markers, physical activity, OSA, and circulating sex hormones in a sample of 100 older women at-risk
for AD and relate these measures to changes in cognitive function and accumulation of tau, measured via
positron emission tomography (PET), over a two-year period. This study will build upon a state-funded, pilot
study by increasing the sample size and adding longitudinal assessments in order to conduct a rigorous
examination of our hypotheses. In keeping with NIH research priorities, after 5 years of potential funding, this
project will help to close critical gaps in our understanding of sex differences in AD by examining under-explored
yet highly-relevant mechanisms that may contribute to the greater pathology and steeper cognitive decline in
women on the AD trajectory. Furthermore, our findings will inform risk reduction strategies that influence these
mechanisms – an important focus given current the lack of disease-modifying treatments."

of the McDonnell Genome Institute here at Washington University and substantial institutional strengths in
neurobiology of pain, axon degeneration and regeneration, and genetics in a coordinated program to develop
foundational new knowledge regarding the transcriptional and functional properties of tissues and cells involved
in pain transduction, transmission and modulation in humans. We will provide a comprehensive atlas of cellular
gene expression in human peripheral nerve using single nuclei RNAseq, spatial transcriptomics and multiplex
proteomics, and leverage this to understand the distribution of genes involved in traumatic (neuromas) and
idiopathic (hereditary) painful neuropathies. We will also provide expanded single-nucleus sequencing atlases
of dorsal root ganglia, including DRG from donors without and with a recent history of pain. We will generate a
spatial atlas of hDRG using imaging mass cytometry, and optimize computational approaches for integrated IMC
and single cell transcriptomic analysis of hDRG. Finally, we will combine analysis of electrophysiological,
transcriptional, and morphological data from hDRG and human spinal cord dorsal horn neurons. We will work
with other centers to optimize protocols and data collection to allow integrated analysis across multiple centers,
in collaboration with the U24 DCIC and HEAL data ecosystem. These goals will be accomplished through the
coordinated activity of 3 scientific projects, led by international leaders in the fields of pain neurobiology, genetics,
and mechanisms of axon degeneration and regeneration. The project titles are as follows:
Project 1: Multi-omics peripheral nerve atlas enables fine-mapping of pain molecular phenotypes.
Project 2: Characterization of the human dorsal root ganglia at the single cell level via integrated transcriptomics

Despite great strides in achieving short-term weight loss success, long-term weight loss maintenance (WLM)
remains a challenge. Time-restricted eating (TRE), a form of intermittent fasting, is an untested bio-behavioral
strategy for WLM. The goal of this Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) is to accelerate the candidate's
transition to an independent investigator with focused expertise in the development and evaluation of weight
management strategies during WLM. In the K99 phase of this award, the candidate will obtain training in
expertise in behavior maintenance theories and methods, mixed methods and qualitative analyses and appetite
physiology, and conduct pilot studies to develop and test the intervention approach. The candidate will conduct
a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=40 total; 20/arm) to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence of two
TRE interventions (≤6 h and ≤10h eating windows). Participants will include adults (25–65y, BMI>20.5 kg/m2)
recruited from 2 nonsurgical weight loss programs who successfully attained a weight loss of ≥5% initial body
weight. Prior to randomization, participants will undergo a run-in phase that includes a 4-week weight stabilization
period. The candidate will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability in terms of recruitment, retention, and
adherence to the eating window using a mixed-methods design (Aim 1). The candidate will perform qualitative
interviews (n=12/arm) following completion of the TRE to capture participants' experience with TRE and
determine individual-, family-, and neighborhood/community-level barriers and facilitators to each TRE
intervention, such as motivation, cultural factors, occupation, and family structure (Sub-aim 1) that will be used
to strengthen the intervention. In the R00 phase, the candidate will use acquired skills and training to test the
optimum TRE intervention identified from the K99 phase. In a randomized controlled trial, the candidate will
assess the efficacy of the selected TRE on body weight regain (Aim 2a), and fat mass regain (Aim 2b) at 12
months. The candidate will recruit adults with recent non-surgical weight loss and weight stabilization (similar to
K99 phase). Participants will be randomized to one of 2 arms (n=72 total; n=36/arm): 1) TRE (selected from the
K99 phase) or 2) baseline advice control (CON). Both the TRE and CON groups will be provided with baseline
written materials and strategies that promote successful WLM. Participants in the TRE group will be instructed
to self-monitor dietary intake and body weight in a smartphone application and receive behavioral counseling.
Measurements will be obtained at baseline (0), 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome is body weight regain
at 12 months. The candidate will explore the effects of randomization assignment and WLM on appetite
biomarkers and subjective appetite via a visual analog scale at 6 mos and 12 mos (Exploratory Aim). Ultimately,
this will establish the candidate as an independent investigator conducting interdisciplinary bio-behavioral
research using lifestyle interventions to become a leader in WLM."

HLA-E restricted CD8 T cells specific to a diverse repertoire of viral and bacterial peptides have been reported
indicating their role in adaptive immunity. Due to their limited polymorphism, peptide presentation through HLA-
E can be considered advantageous for vaccine design. In SIV/macaque studies, protection from pathogenic SIV
challenge was observed in 50% rhesus macaques vaccinated with an RhCMV based vector. This unprecedented
protection was independent of antibodies and attributed in part to an induction of MHC-E restricted CD8 T cells.
Despite promising findings from several viral infections, role of HLA-E specific CD8 T cells in HIV has been
grossly understudied. In fact, no study to date has examined the role of HLA-E restricted CD8 T cells (E-CD8s)
in HIV infection and vaccination. The only published data to suggest the presence of HLA-E restricted HIV-
specific CD8 T cells are experiments demonstrating that HIV peptides can bind to HLA-E. Since HLA-Ia and E
are ubiquitously co-expressed, a significant gap in our knowledge has largely been due to absence of biological
reagents to delineate the contribution of HLA-Ia vs. HLA-E alleles in HIV. Our group has generated HLA-E
specific reagents to address the missing gaps in information on the relevance of HLA-E restricted CD8 T cells
targeting HIV. Our preliminary data shows that HLA-E restricted CD8 T cell responses specific for 2 epitopes in
Gag can be detected in chronic HIV infection. In many cases, these responses were not only restricted by E
allele but also by classical HLA-Ia alleles. Furthermore, in small subset of HIV infected individuals, we observed
that in individuals who control virus, without any ART i.e. controllers mounted HLA-E restricted CD8 T cell
responses that were polyfunctional and higher in magnitude. In comparison, viremic individuals on ART mounted
lower magnitude of HLA-E restricted CD8 T cell responses that mainly induced IFN-γ and CD107 expression.
We also show that Gag epitopes are presented by HLA-E in an HIV infected cell. Finally, our pilot data shows
priming of HLA-E restricted CD8 T cell responses in HIV seronegative donors. The latter underscores the need
to see if these responses are induced by preventative vaccines and if not how can these be optimized and
harnessed for effective HIV vaccines. Our strong preliminary findings are foundational for the work proposed in
the current grant. Our overarching goal is to address the central question of whether HIV is impacted by the
frequency, breadth, and functionality of HLA-E restricted CD8 T cells. Based on our data, we hypothesize that
dually restricted CD8 T cells will be associated with a broader response which would be useful for a preventative
vaccine and make HIV escape more difficult. Aim 1, determines the relevance of HLA-E restricted CD8 T cells
in HIV infection and vaccination. We will use samples from acute/chronic infection and 2 prior CTL based HIV
vaccines. Aim 2 uses single cell based analyses to determine αβTCR repertoire and gene expression patterns
of HIV specific CD8 T cells restricted by HLA-E and how these molecular signatures relate to viral control."

The purpose of this project is to examine social factors in the long-term mental health of young adults.
Depression, anxiety, and loneliness have steeply risen among college and university students in the last
decades, creating an enormous public health burden. Mental health difficulties promise to intensify during and
after the COVID-19 pandemic, making it especially urgent to examine and amplify sources of resilience among
young adults. Decades of evidence demonstrate that social connectedness, in the form of subjective
belonging, objective social ties, and supportive interpersonal interactions, bolster mental health in several key
ways. We propose that connectedness early in college, and students’ ability to regulate their emotions through
social interactions, could play a pivotal role in encouraging long-term mental health. Though foundational, past
work is limited in its ability to test these predictions because it typically examines (i) dyadic relationships rather
than broader networks, (ii) the effect of small numbers of social factors, independently, and (iii) short time
spans. These limitations are especially relevant to undergraduate settings, as student social life is centered in
broad communities on which individuals depend for social support. This project will merge tools from social
psychology, network analysis, and neuroscience to provide a rich, precise, and longitudinal account of
how social connectedness supports young adult mental health over time. Our team has mapped the
social networks formed by a large (n > 850) cohort of incoming university students, and combined this with
ecological momentary assessment of students’ interactions and indices of mental health. We have found novel
evidence that (i) “social microclimates,” such as the empathy of a student’s neighbors, affect individual well
being, (ii) students search their social networks for supportive peers when under stress, (iii) peer interactions
mitigate stress over time, and (iv) lonely students under-perceive close social ties, and under-utilize social
resources. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will incorporate a longitudinal
approach: measuring students’ connectedness and well being over their college career. We will combine
these data with cutting-edge predictive modeling to quantify how social ties formed early in college relate to
well being in later years, as well as students’ subsequent “mental health trajectories.” Second, we will recruit
a longitudinal replication cohort to establish the robustness of our effects. Third, we will build on previous
neuroimaging work of our team to probe neural “signatures” of social connectedness and examine their
relationship to other measures of connection, and to well being, over time. At the level of basic science, this
project will represent a novel, naturalistic approach to the study of social factors in mental health, and produce
a large-scale, multifaceted dataset, which will be made publicly available to facilitate the collaborative and
cumulative study of social connection. At a translational level, the resulting data can pave the way for policies
aimed at fostering stronger social ties—and mental health—among a broad swath of the population."

Enterococcus faecalis is a hospital-associated opportunistic pathogen that causes infections with high
morbidity and mortality. An increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant enterococci has driven the
need for alternative treatment strategies to combat these pathogens. In this proposal, we describe the
isolation and characterization of an unusual gentamicin hypersusceptible E. faecalis strain that was
cultured from a patient with infective endocarditis. We performed an in vitro resistance selection with
this E. faecalis strain to generate one-step (i.e. single mutation) mutants that displayed wild type
gentamicin susceptibility levels. Whole-genome sequencing of the one-step mutants showed that
gentamicin hypersusceptibility in the parent strain was caused by a mutation that disrupted the E.
faecalis alpha-carbonic anhydrase. Separately, we observed that the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
acetazolamide and gentamicin together displayed synergistic activity at inhibiting the growth of wild
type E. faecalis strains. This finding has led us to hypothesize that disruption of carbonic anhydrases
can sensitize E. faecalis to killing with aminoglycosides. To determine the mechanistic basis of this
synergy, we will examine whether disruption of the E. faecalis alpha-carbonic anhydrase causes
increased gentamicin uptake via proton motive force-dependent transport and/or increased membrane
permeability (Aim 1). In addition, we will investigate differential synergy between aminoglycosides and
chemically diverse carbonic anhydrase inhibitors against isogenic E. faecalis strains expressing
different carbonic anhydrase genotypes (Aim 2). This is the first time that a connection between
carbonic anhydrase disruption and bacterial membrane energization or permeability will be
investigated. Successful completion of this project will increase our understanding of E. faecalis biology,
while also providing important pilot data toward the development of a promising new combination
therapy for patients with enterococcal infections."
