11173920,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease and chronic kidney disease, affecting tens of millions of people in the US alone, exhibit pathological dysregulation of lipid metabolism, which is heavily dependent on the pivotal cofactor CoA. Yet, we do not fully understand how cells and tissues regulate and coordinate the biosynthesis of CoA with the demands of CoA-dependent metabolism, biosynthesis, and homeostasis (e.g. of lipids); nor how CoA synthesis dysregulation and disease progression are related in the kidney and liver. As the major carrier of activated acyl groups, CoA is required for the TCA cycle, lipid synthesis, and fatty acid oxidation among other core metabolic processes. It is synthesized from the essential nutrient vitamin B5 (pantothenate), and a family of pantothenate kinases (PANK1-3 in vertebrates) are rate-determining for the pathway. We have discovered that the highly-conserved PANK4, which has metabolite phosphatase activity, is a rate-limiting suppressor of CoA synthesis, and that PI3K-AKT signaling stimulates CoA synthesis (partially by inhibiting PANK4), thus linking insulin signaling to control of CoA supplies. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that additional regulatory mechanisms for CoA synthesis remain to be characterized. The goal of this proposal is to identify new regulatory inputs that control CoA synthesis in response to the metabolic state of cells and tissues, especially the kidney and liver which play central metabolic roles in humans. To meet this goal, we will leverage the unique and combined advantages of fly and mouse models, mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and lipidomics, metabolic flux analyses through isotope tracing, and protein biochemistry. Completion of our aims will reveal new regulatory inputs for CoA synthesis, advance our mechanistic understanding of the in vivo roles of CoA synthesis enzymes, establish novel animal models, and develop new tools in the CoA metabolism field. Ultimately, our results will provide foundational knowledge for understanding kidney and liver physiology and pathophysiology, and for potentially manipulating CoA synthesis as a new therapeutic strategy."

The proposed Immune Monitoring Core (IMC; Core 2) has been designed to provide a unified, comprehensive,
and centralized service to provide the U54 investigators with efficient and reproducible high-throughput analysis
of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2, including binding, functional characterization, and neutralization activity
(both retained clinical specimens and prospectively collected blood samples from Core 1) in support of the
studies described in Projects 1-3. The IMC is an outgrowth of CLIA certified diagnostic assay platforms
developed by IMC investigators and now in use in the Emory Medical Laboratories (EML), as well as a result of
development of relevant assays in the Translational Research laboratory in the Dept. of Pathology and other
Emory sites. IMC activities will be performed by experimental investigators from oncology, pathology, and
infectious diseases, clinical pathologists, and trained technicians. This group’s efforts will be coordinated through
regular meetings between leadership of the three Projects, Core 1, and the Administrative Core. The IMC
activities will achieve the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. Employ the high-throughput automated RBD ELISA to perform serosurveillance of cancer and
rheumatology patients treated within Emory Healthcare. The Core will utilize anti-RBD ELISA test
(developed by IMC investigators) now in clinical use, as well variants of this test for detection of IgM and IgA
responses. These assays will be used both for sero-surveillance on retained clinical samples from the target
patient groups, and also on prospectively collected samples, as described in Core 1.
Aim 2. Perform detailed evaluations of antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 infected patients.
While the automated ELISA will be used to screen all samples for anti-RBD antibodies, prospectively collected
samples from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients will also be tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S),
nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E) and membrane (M) proteins. Additionally, functional characterization of SARS-
CoV-2 antibodies will include assays of antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).
Aim 3. Measuring the neutralization activity in COVID-19 infected patients. Prospectively collected samples
from designated patient groups which have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by ELISA will be tested in the pseudovirus
neutralization assay under BSL2+ conditions. Subsequently, those samples that are positive will be confirmed
using a recently developed focus reduction neutralization titer (FRNT)-mNG assay.
Overall, this Core allows U54 investigators to take advantage of state-of-the-art and diagnostic quality immune
monitoring to achieve Project goals."
11171025,"Abstract
COVID-19 infection is greatly heterogenous. Individuals with underlying immune dysregulation,
will have abnormal responses to COVID-19, thereby accounting for different short-term outcomes
and memory formation. Specifically, emerging evidence indicates poor outcomes in autoimmune
and cancer patients. We propose that autoimmune patients and severe COVID-19 infection will
share an exacerbated pathological response while cancer patients with disease-associated or
treatment-induced immune deficiency, will fail to mount a protective anti-viral response. Here, we
shall interrogate the effector B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 to identify determinants of protective
and pathogenic responses in HC and autoimmune subjects."

11170833,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Overall, the world population is aging and in the era of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) people living with HIV
(PLWH) live longer. ART has converted HIV infection into a survivable chronic infection; however,
comorbidities are a mounting clinical reality, likely related to accelerated immunosenescence. It is well
documented that HIV infection leads to accelerated aging, and HIV-1 chronic infection is considered a good
model for studying immunosenescence. The impact of aging on increased susceptibility to infections and
reduced responsiveness to vaccines is a well-known clinical problem. Antibodies are one of the first and most
important responses against pathogens and the reason for this dampened immune response with aging may
be due to age-related reduced humoral immunity (B cell immunosenescence). Humoral immunity has been
understudied in humans, particularly in lymphoid tissue, due to the difficulty of sample availability. It is not clear
how accurately changes observed in blood reflect immunosenescence processes in tissues, especially the
gastrointestinal mucosa which contains most of the body’s lymphocytes (~60%) and it is a region of high
antigen exposure. Therefore, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) represents a good model to study
lymphoid tissue in humans that is highly exposed to antigen stimulation. A growing body of literature has begun
to reveal the pathophysiological processes driving immune dysfunction of T cells, including work by our team,
which has studied the human mucosal immune compartment. It is not well understood how aging depresses
humoral immunity and there are little or no studies on humoral immunity in the mucosal immune compartment.
Compared to blood, gut mucosa contains fewer naïve cells, more activated memory cell, and more antibody
secreting cells, consistent with the high level of antigen exposure. Therefore, in this study, we propose to
analyze the individual and combined impact of age and HIV-1 on immunosenescence of humoral
immunity, especially in the highly immune active gastrointestinal tract, by quantifying B-cell immune
aging in GALT and peripheral blood in PLWH, as a model of accelerated aging, and in people without
HIV (PWOH). Our hypothesis is that natural aging and HIV-1-induced-accelerated aging diminishes the
capacity of the immune system to produce efficient antibody responses in the periphery and GALT; this will be
a result of inappropriate accumulation of memory-effector T-cells fueled by chronic persistent viral infections,
causing ineffective follicular helper T-cells, inefficient recall of cytotoxic responses, and a generalized,
persistent low-level inflammatory state. The Specific Aims to test this hypothesis are: Aim 1: To determine
age-related B cell lymphocyte senescence in the GALT versus peripheral blood compartments of PWOH and
PLWH ranging in age from 18 to ≥60-65 years. We will also study the functional aspects of B cells in terms of
antibody production and B cell receptor repertoire. Aim 2: To determine if the accelerated B lymphocyte
senescence seen in GALT affects humoral responses, using SARS-CoV-2 as a neoantigen challenge model."
11171076,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pregnancies among women with developmental disabilities that affect cognition (DD-C) are often unplanned,
which may contribute to the poor pregnancy outcomes that have been observed in this population. Existing
research indicates that women with DD-C have limited reproductive knowledge, face substantial barriers to
comprehensive preconception care, are rarely engaged as active participants in reproductive decision-making,
and are frequently discouraged from considering pregnancy or motherhood. This combination of disadvantages
leaves women with DD-C ill-prepared to make informed decisions about pregnancy planning and places them
at risk of unintended pregnancies and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Currently, there are no resources tailored
to the needs of women with DD-C to help them make informed, evidence-based decisions about attempting or
preventing pregnancy. Data are lacking on the specific information women with DD-C need for making
pregnancy planning decisions and the optimal approaches for presenting relevant information in a way that
women with DD-C will understand, relate to, and trust. The long-term goal of this work is to promote informed,
engaged pregnancy decision-making among women with DD-C to improve maternal and child health
outcomes. In this project, the overall objective is to assess needs and determinants of pregnancy planning
decisions among women with DD-C and develop an accessible pregnancy decision support tool. Specifically,
we aim to: 1) Identify the information needs, factors influencing pregnancy decision-making, and priority setting
processes regarding pregnancy in women with DD-C; 2) Characterize current pregnancy knowledge and
comprehension of different methods of presenting information in a multi-state sample of women with DD-C;
and 3) Design a patient-friendly interactive decision aid to promote evidence-based pregnancy decision-
making by women with DD-C. The research proposed in this application is innovative because the project is
conducted in collaboration with women with DD-C and because it is the first to investigate relationships
between framing of information and the extent to which women with DD-C understand and trust that
information. The expected outcome from this project is a novel, intellectually appropriate tool to optimize
pregnancy timing and outcomes for women with DD-C. The tool will have established usability and
acceptability within our target population and will be ready for future efficacy testing in a clinical trial. The
proposed research is significant because it will determine which methods are most effective for communicating
medical information to women with DD-C – a positive impact of this project that extends beyond pregnancy
decision-making."

11172341,"Rapid Diagnostic Assays for Self-Monitoring of Acute or Rebound HIV-1 Infection: The goal of this program is to develop low-cost, rapid diagnostic assays needed to enable untrained individuals to test for HIV-1 infection during the earliest stages of initial infection or during loss of viral suppression in chronic treated infection – times when antibody responses are not an accurate surrogate for viral load. Assays will be designed for self-testing at home (or in other locations), so that individuals collect their own samples, perform the test, and read the results without the need to send a sample to a laboratory. The assay should be easy to be carried out and designed for use by individuals who are at risk of HIV infection, including those taking pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), who wish to detect HIV infection as early as possible, as well as people living with HIV (PLWH) who wish to detect viral spikes or rebound either while on antiretroviral therapy or during treatment interruption. The goal of this contract is to develop a home-based HIV-1 viral load detection assay using microfluidics-based electrochemical sensing of two biomarkers: viral HIV-1 RNA and MS2 bacteriophage RNA."

There is considerable societal need to better understand neurobiological mechanisms, psychosocial processes,
treatments, preventions, and policy in child and maternal pain. This application seeks funding for a T90/R90
institutional postdoctoral training program in clinical pain research, with a focus on maternal and childhood pain,
at Stanford University. Our proposal describes a collaborative, interdisciplinary postdoctoral training program to
bolster the clinical pain research workforce as outlined through the NIH HEAL Initiative Partnership to Advance
Interdisciplinary (PAIN) Training in Clinical Pain Research. We venture to join with other T90/R90 postdoctoral
training programs in clinical pain research to foster a diverse cohort experience through the HEAL PURPOSE
network (R24 Coordinating Center for National Pain Scientists). This T90/R90 will reside within the Department
of Anesthesiology, Perioperative, and Pain Medicine and be in partnership with the Maternal and Child Health
Research Institute, the Department of Pediatrics, Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and Biomedical Data
Science at Stanford University School of Medicine. This program will provide mentorship to diverse trainees to
launch and maintain productive careers in the clinical pain research workforce. We propose training offive fellows
per year who will spend 2-3 years cumulative time in research. Research opportunities are offered by the NIHfunded
faculty mentors with proven records of success in the training of postdoctoral fellows, with diverse
research programs ranging from data science, translational, clinical, and health services research. Core faculty
research leaders will help match trainees to mentors within the HEAL clinical pain research content areas of: (1)
bioinformatics, (2) pain across the lifespan, specifically child and maternal pain, (3) nonpharmacological
(behavioral) interventions for pain, (4) prevention of the transition from acute to chronic pain and (5) advancing
health equity in the field of pain. Program mentors will provide training in clinical pain research, neuroscience,
biomedical data science, behavioral health, epidemiology, maternal health, and health in children and
adolescents. The training will (1) integrate the biopsychosocial model of pain, (2) use a team science approach
through partnerships with psychiatry, pediatrics and biomedical data science, (3) center on whole person health
to reduce stigma and bias, (4) incorporate patient participatory research methods to ensure lived experiences of
pain inform the clinical research outputs, (5) provide advanced statistics and research methods, (6) involve
grantsmanship skills, and (7) prepare for applying for and securing academic positions in clinical pain research.
Lastly, the program will coordinate monthly webinars related to HEAL priority areas to be shared on the
PURPOSE website, an annual Maternal and Child Pain School open to all cohort participants, and a robust
didactic program to provide career development skills with seminars in stated training areas. Trainee progress
will be monitored by the Assessment and Evaluation Team. The long-term goal of this T90/R90 is to train the
next generation of interdisciplinary and diverse scientific leaders in maternal and/or child pain."

The active participation of the brain’s astrocytes in normal and pathological brain function is now well
established. Astrocytes adjust synaptic strength, mediate synaptogenesis, and participate directly in neural
signaling on a breadth of timescales that would be otherwise inaccessible with neuron-centric signaling.
Gaining a better understanding of astrocyte function will have wide-ranging implications for human health. The
technologies for visualizing and manipulating astrocytes generally, and neuron-to-astrocyte interactions in
particular, are limited, especially in comparison to the repertoire of strategies for visualizing neuron anatomy
and physiology. By bridging the fields of chemistry and neuroscience, we have designed a chemical strategy
that will enable the direct visualization and manipulation of astrocytes globally, and, potentially, neural-
astrocyte connectivity specifically.
 Our strategy for chemical imaging of astrocytes and neuron-astrocyte interactions employs a chemical tag
that, when appended to structurally diverse chemical scaffolds, targets molecules to astrocytes when delivered
systemically to an organism. Here, we will further evaluate the properties of this astrocyte targeting tags and
expand on their capabilities, for example, delivering fluorescent reporters of cell physiology, drugs for
modulating astrocyte function, or transcription activators to control gene expression, directly to astrocytes.
Further, in preliminary experiments, we found that when fluorescent molecules with the astrocyte targeting tag
are introduced directly into neurons of larval zebrafish, they specifically label astrocytes proximal to the
neuron’s axonal projections, potentially serving as a marker for the population of astrocytes that interact with a
given neuron. In preliminary results, we have chemically synthesized an array of candidate neuron-astrocyte
probes and characterized the specificity and mechanism of their labeling in larval zebrafish and mammalian
astrocytes. In this application, we describe projects that will broaden the reach of the described probes for
systemic astrocyte imaging and manipulation. We describe alterations to the neuron-glia label’s chemical
structure in order to explore possibilities for astrocyte specific drug delivery, cell-type specific labeling, and
transgene expression in labeled astrocyte populations. Ultimately, the ability to interrogate astrocytes with
tunable chemical scaffolds, and, specifically, to visualize select neuron-astrocyte interactions, will be a
valuable tool for understanding the brain."

Diseases such as osteoporosis and periodontal disease affect millions of individuals annually in the United
States and cost billions in treatment. Osteoclasts are large, multinucleated cells that secrete acid and
proteases to resorb bone. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate osteoclast differentiation
and activity will provide insight as to how the hyper-active osteoclasts causing pathological bone loss,
contributes to osteoporosis and periodontal disease. Reversible modifications to DNA such as histone
acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitylation alter the access of transcriptional machinery to
DNA and regulate gene expression. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), also known as KDM1A, is the first
identified histone demethylase capable of specially demethylating mono- and di-methylated lysine 4 of histone
3 (H3K4me1/2) or lysine 9 of histone 3 (H3K9me1/2). LSD1 confers transcriptional repression by
demethylating H3K4 or activating transcription by demethylating H3K9. The mechanism by which LSD1
regulates osteoclast gene expression and differentiation is currently unknown. Preliminary data presented in
this proposal demonstrate inhibition of LSD1 activity or expression leads to an increase in mono-methylation of
H3K4me1 and an increase in osteoclast differentiation. These preliminary data suggest LSD1 is a repressor of
osteoclast gene expression. This proposal aims to characterize the role of LSD1 in regulating osteoclast
differentiation in both an animal model and as well as in an in vitro cell culture model (Aim 1) and identifying
the osteoclast genes that are regulated by LSD1 (Aim 2). These research goals will be enhanced by the
training goals of the application. These training goals include learning techniques such as micro-CT, RNA-SEQ
and ChIP-SEQ as well as participation in journal clubs and local and national scientific meetings. Training
takes place at the University of Minnesota which offers an outstanding environment for both research and
clinical dental training."

Brain Healthy builds upon the success of BrainWaves, a prior NIH Science Education Partnership Award
(SEPA)-supported program, which has been successfully implemented in 25 public New York City
schools, reaching over 600 students. Our new proposed program, Brain Healthy, is responsive to one of
the new areas of high SEPA programmatic interest: providing students with access to research-generated
data to prepare students for data science careers. Brain Healthy will be designed by a multidisciplinary
team across the University of Connecticut and New York University in partnership with public school
teachers in Connecticut and New York City that primarily serve students from underrepresented
racial/ethnic groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). It will be
implemented as a month-long unit within a 9th/10th grade core biology course. Students in the program
will first participate in a large-scale “citizen science” research project by taking a comprehensive survey
(partially developed by students themselves) about their health and lifestyle practices. Students will also
measure their heart rate with fitness trackers and complete a computerized cognitive (Stroop) task and
mood survey. They will learn about brain plasticity and how positive (e.g., physical exercise) and negative
(e.g., stress) life experiences impact our brain. With support from near-peer mentors (NPMs), students
will then design data-driven investigations utilizing the entire de-identified citizen science database
collected across all the participating schools, exploring questions, such as how sleep quality relates to
mood and how fitness level associates with ability to focus. The Brain Healthy platform will guide students
through these investigations by providing scaffolding in critical steps of the process. The program will
culminate in a school-wide science fair, where students will share their findings with the wider school
community. The program will be accompanied by professional development (PD) courses for teachers
and NPMs prior to school implementation with additional just-in-time support.
The main educational research questions are how does participation in a “citizen science” brain health
and wellness program impact: 1) Students’ conceptual understanding of data analysis and brain plasticity,
and their attitudes toward STEM; 2) Teachers’ self-efficacy in facilitating data-driven student
investigations; 3) NPMs’ mentoring ability and intent to persist in STEM.
Three cohorts of 10 teachers will be recruited, each participating for three years, with the first year
occurring prior to the Brain Healthy PD course (serving as a well-matched comparison). Across the 5-
year project, ~1500 students are expected to participate in Brain Healthy. Project evaluation will utilize
pre- and post-program surveys, semi-structured interviews, and classroom observations."

The Cancer Population Sciences (CPS) Program brings together 40 faculty, representing 12 departments at 
Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine (Geisel), Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DH) and the White 
River Junction VT Veterans Administration Medical Center (VA), with research interests relevant to the three 
central CPS Program themes: 1) Life course cancer epidemiology, 2) Translational population science, and 3) 
Health care delivery science. The shared goals of the CPS Program are to: 1) conduct population-based 
studies to understand the molecular, behavioral and environmental basis of cancer occurrence and outcomes 
across the life course; 2) establish a scientific basis for policies and practices that improve cancer screening, 
quality of care delivery, and health outcomes across the cancer continuum, from prevention to survivorship; 
and 3) design and test interventions and promote policies that reduce cancer risk and cancer burden in our 
catchment area, nationally and beyond. Peer-reviewed cancer-related research direct cost support currently 
totals $8.7M, with NCI funding representing 32% ($2.8M) and total direct costs summing to $9.6M. Sixteen (16) 
CPS Program Members currently have a total of 17 CCSG-defined R01-equivalent awards. Using the same 
NCI definition of cancer-related direct costs in 2014, peer-reviewed cancer-related research direct costs are 78 
% compared to 2014, but per Member funding is up 6% ($216,234 for 40 Members vs. 204,161 for 57

9% (93) inter-programmatic, and 75% (743) with investigators from other institutions. Based on 926 with impact 
data, 20% (181) were high impact journals (i.e., impact factor >8). Compared to 2014, intra-programmatic 
publications have increased, to 31% from 29%, and high impact has increased, to 20% from 16%. Prior to the 
2018 Program reorganization, our two population science programs had inter-programmatic publication rates 
of 13% and 19%, which matched the range (13-19%) they reported in 2014. The CPS program leaders have 
defined program-level and theme-specific plans for future growth. These include enhanced, trans-disciplinary 
mentorship of junior investigators by senior faculty in multiple disciplines; the development and support of 
subject workgroups (e.g. obesity, microbiome, breast cancer, tobacco regulatory and geospatial research) to 
build collaborations that cross the disciplines of population science and beyond; and continued growth of 
training programs."

The Dartmouth-Hitchcock Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC) is unique among NCI-designated Cancer 
Centers as the only one in Northern New England (VT, NH, ME), the one located in the smallest town, and as 
one of the few whose catchment area has a population that is almost half rural (48%), does not contain a major 
urban core, and has nine of 24 counties classified as 7, 8, or 9 (isolated rural) according to the Rural Urban 
Continuum Codes (RUCCs). While the population within our catchment area is not as racially/ethnically 
heterogeneous as some, social determinants in our largely rural communities – particularly age, income, and 
education play an important role in cancer-related health behaviors, risk, early detection, treatment, and 
survivorship. Disparities along the cancer control continuum between our rural and non-rural populations have 
been documented, spurring distinct research and intervention needs. Our catchment area carries a 
disproportionate burden in cancer incidence, leading to both cancer-related mortality, and a growing population 
of cancer survivors. NCCC plays a unique and substantive role in our communities—engaging the populations 
within our catchment area and focusing research on locally-relevant issues to translate evidence into impactful 
benefits for individuals and communities, with research that is often generalizable to other populations. While 
NCCC has served this overarching mission for decades, the recent formalization of the Community Outreach 
and Engagement (COE) component of the CCSG will catalyze NCCC to identify and address the needs of our 
catchment area in a more comprehensive, cohesive, nimble and timely way as we work in concert with 
NCCC’s Research Programs to accomplish three aims. These are: 1) To identify, measure, and monitor the 
cancer control needs and cancer health equity issues throughout the catchment area through engagement of a 
Community Advisory Board, observational studies and surveillance of health system, state, and national data; 
2) To address the cancer control needs and cancer health equity issues of our catchment area through 
community-engaged interventions, increased participation in clinical trials, and regional collaborations, with an 
emphasis on rural and underserved populations; and 3) To promote cancer research findings from the four 
NCCC scientific programs across the cancer control continuum for translation into sustainable policy, program, 
and health system enhancements. We will apply metrics to track relevance and impact of research related to 
cancer biology, clinical research, cancer-related health equity, prevention, and control within our catchment 
area (surveillance and community metrics) and what are we doing about it (engagement, collaboration, and 
research metrics). The COE initiative will build upon a strong existing base of community and regional 
partnerships. By achieving the COE aims, we will ensure that we are having the most meaningful impact on 
how cancer affects the lives of those in our region, and we will develop a solid infrastructure for sustaining 
those positive impacts and strengthening translation of NCCC research."
11171118,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Infants born to HIV-infected mothers are at high risk for HIV acquisition. Additionally, HIV-exposed yet
uninfected infants display reduced vaccine responses and increased disease susceptibility compared to
unexposed infants. The development of certain T cell subsets, both in the mucosa and systemically, is
determined by the presence of specific microbes in the gut and may be important in determining adaptive
immunity. However, the gut microbiota of HIV-exposed uninfected (iHEU) infants differs from that of HIV-
unexposed (iHU) infants, since their mothers have altered gut microbiota. The gut virome also plays a central
role in modulating both the bacterial microbiota and immune response of adults, yet the association between
the infant enteric virome and cellular responses to vaccination has not yet been explored. This study proposes
that the enteric virome is one of the factors influencing the morbidity of HIV-exposed infants, either by directly
altering mucosal immunity or by altering the composition of enteric bacterial communities, as a consequence of
bacteriophage or other viral dynamics. This proposal will utilize an already funded, ongoing cohort to
longitudinally identify interactions between viruses, bacterial microbiota, and cellular responses to vaccination
in 40 iHEU and 40 iHU (Aim 1). Viral metagenome data will be integrated with bacterial community datasets
and T cell cytokine responses to BCG vaccination to identify viral and bacterial taxa correlated with BCG
responses. The effect of the expanded virome on bacterial microbiota and responses to BCG vaccination will
then be assessed for causality in gnotobiotic mouse models (Aim 2). The effect of the expanded iHEU viroem
on mucosa and peripheral gene expression will be assayed using single cell RNA sequencing in Aim 3.
Integrative analyses will be used to identify interactions between specific bacterial and viral taxa, as well as
their associated with BCG responses. Together, these Aims will identify mechanisms of gut dysbiosis in iHEU
and reveal potential therapeutics to restore health to this group. Collectively, this proposal will reveal how
maternal HIV infection shapes the enteric microbiome and immunity of associated infants."
11171124,"Project Summary/Abstract
Much of the youth resilience literature to date has focused on resilience to family adversity, with far less
examining resilience to neighborhood adversity. This is a key gap in the literature because neighborhood
disadvantage is a robust indicator of poor outcomes throughout the lifespan. The focus on only one type of
resilience (psychiatric) to the exclusion of others (social, emotional, and academic) and the inconsistent
evidence of stability in resilience across development further exacerbate this gap. The transitions from middle
childhood to adolescence and adolescence to emerging adulthood are important developmental periods
marked by agency, cognitive, and self-regulation gains. The proposed research aims to examine not only how
resilience can change from middle childhood to adolescence and to later emerging adulthood, but whether
these developmental changes vary by type of resilience (psychiatric, social, emotional, academic), and finally,
how those changes might differ with protective factors (i.e., warm and involved parenting, structural
neighborhood protective features). During the K99 phase, Specific Aim 1 will investigate trajectories of the
multifaceted conceptualization of resilience from middle childhood to adolescence and Specific Aim 2 will
examine how these resilience trajectories may change when considering the protective factor of warm and
involved parenting. During the R00 phase, Specific Aim 3 will investigate how a comprehensive set of positive
structural neighborhood features (previously linked to resident well-being) promote youth resilience during the
critical transitions between middle childhood and emerging adulthood. Dr. Elizabeth Shewark’s background in
developmental psychology, family systems, advanced methods, and neighborhood effects uniquely positions
her to carry out this line of research. Dr. Shewark’s long-term career goal is to lead an interdisciplinary
research team that investigates how and by what mechanism(s) the contexts in which youth are developing
impact their resilience. To independently lead this future research team, the goal of this Pathway to
Independence Award is to build expertise in youth resilience to neighborhood adversity, and gain further
training in cutting edge longitudinal analytic techniques, the assessment of positive structural neighborhood
features, and conducting research in vulnerable at-risk populations. The proposal includes a highly established
group of researchers who will strengthen the interdisciplinary impact of Dr. Shewark’s work and her
development into an independent researcher. The theoretical knowledge and methodological skills gained
during this project will allow Dr. Shewark to produce a rich body of research on how warm and involved
parenting and structural neighborhood protective factors shape the development of youth resilience, facilitating
the identification of modifiable targets for intervention programs to promote healthy youth development."

11144800,"ABSTRACT
Acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are “interconnected” syndromes in
which each influences the other. CKD is a risk factor for AKI and AKI contributes to the
development or progression of CKD, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular symptoms,
and death, not to mention recurrent AKI episodes and impaired health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). Processes of care after AKI hospitalization have been found to be suboptimal, with
lack of continuity of care, delayed follow-up and suboptimal medication management
exacerbating the risks of adverse outcomes. In addition, optimal pharmacologic therapy, such as
blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) or sodium-glucose cotransporter
type 2 (SGLT2), has not been defined. The Caring for OutPatiEnts after Acute Kidney Injury
(COPE-AKI) Consortium will address these important gaps in knowledge of optimal
management of patients surviving an episode of moderate (stage 2) or severe (stage 3) AKI. The
goal of the COPE-AKI Consortium will be to develop and test interventions to optimize
processes of care and identify key pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions to
reduce morbidity among these high-risk patients. The Center for Clinical Trials & Data
Coordination (CCDC) at the University of Pittsburgh is well poised to serve as the Scientific and
Data Research Center (SDRC) for the COPE-AKI Consortium. Our multidisciplinary
investigative team has a history of collaboration, wealth of experience and expertise, including
expertise in acute and chronic kidney disease, critical and translational care, medication
management, design of clinical trials, telehealth, clinical and data coordination, project
administration support, biostatistics, measurement of patient-reported outcomes, health
services research and patient engagement. Our goal is to serve as the Scientific and Data
Research Center for the COPE-AKI Consortium. Specifically, we will 1) establish an efficient and
rigorous process for designing the Consortium study, including protocol development and
adaptation of an existing web-based data collection system; 2) provide comprehensive expertise
for data management and analysis within the Consortium; and 3) provide program coordination
and administrative support throughout all phases of the study."

11082769,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Cognitive maps allow humans to mentally represent their spatial environments and are thus essential for
navigation and memory in everyday life. Humans use different types of cognitive maps to guide their 
behavior: egocentric cognitive maps, in which spatial information such as locations and directions is 
encoded relative to the subject, and allocentric cognitive maps, in which spatial information is encoded 
relative to the external world.
This project will use computational modeling and human single-neuron recordings in epilepsy 
patients during a virtual-reality task to demonstrate the neural circuits that underlie egocentric and 
allocentric cognitive maps in humans (Aim 1), guided by extensive research on spatial cells in animals. 
Combining predictions from our computational models of navigation and memory with our prior discovery of 
egocentric cells in the human medial temporal lobe, we will test for neurons that are egocentrically tuned to 
boundaries, objects, and reference points and thus underlie egocentric cognitive maps. Going beyond our 
description of human grid and place cells, we will also identify neurons that are allocentrically tuned to 
boundaries, objects, and locations as the neural basis of allocentric cognitive maps. In tight feedback loops, 
we will extend our computational models to integrate the empirical observations. Beyond navigation, we will 
analyze and simulate how egocentric and allocentric spatial cells reactivate when humans use 
cognitive maps to recall spatial memories (Aim 2). To show how cognitive maps become populated with 
non-spatial information to generate complex memories, we will identify how spatial cells become linked 
to neurons that represent non-spatial features to encode object location memories (Aim 3). We will 
test empirically and investigate computationally whether sharp wave ripples play a role in the encoding and 
retrieval of such complex memories by triggering synchronous activity in spatial and non-spatial cells. 
Applying confined and diffuse neuron loss to our models, we will mimic memory disorders and examine 
their effects on behavior.
Overall, this project will lead to new insights into the cellular mechanisms of spatial navigation and memory, 
helping us to identify the working principles of the human brain. Our discoveries will be instrumental in 
understanding the cognitive effects of mental illnesses, and they will provide the ground for developing
treatment options of memory disorders such as electrical brain stimulation to restore cognitive functioning."
11083182,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Neurotransmitter receptors, varying in distribution across the neocortex, play a crucial role in modulating
neural excitability and neural network communication. The relationship between receptor architecture and
brain function, particularly considering the origin and evolution of the complex structure-function interplay
across species, remains largely unexplored. The overarching goal of the proposed project is to bridge this
gap through integration of 3D neurotransmitter receptor autoradiography with multimodal MRI across four
species (humans, macaques, marmosets, rats). Towards this goal, we will reconstruct high-resolution
receptor maps in rats and marmosets using a transfer-learning neural network (human and macaque data
were completed). In Aim 1, we will innovate multimodal cross-species brain alignment by using graphmatching
and joint-embedding algorithms to extract homologous multimodal features (i.e. receptor
architecture, fMRI functional connectivity) and improve interspecies brain alignment across four species.
Such alignment will provide a cross-species transformation for future translation studies using animal
models. Following optimal brain alignment, Aim 2 will focus on structure-function coupling by comparing
receptor and function connectivity gradients across neocortex, as well as the regional similarity between
receptor lamination covariance and functional connectivity within and across species. This will uncover the
common and species-specific relationship between microscale receptor architecture and macroscale
functional connectivity. Finally, Aim 3 aims to link brain spatiotemporal dynamic signatures (i.e.,
coactivation patterns, traveling waves) with receptor architecture within and across species - providing an
evolutionary perspective of the neurochemical basis for brain dynamics. The outcomes, including fMRI
derivatives, 3D receptor atlases, and cross-species transformation will be shared via the PRIMatE Data
Resource Exchange and the EBRAI NS platform to foster further basic and translational research in the
neuroscience community."

10741764,"We have been at the forefront in elucidating the mechanisms and physiology of Coat Protein I (COPI)
transport. We are proposing four lines of future investigation to maintain this track record of achievement.
First, following up on our recent discovery that COPI generates not only vesicles but also tubules, and the
small GTPase Cdc42 promotes COPI tubule formation through an intrinsic ability to bend membrane, we
will elucidate how Cdc42 achieves this remarkable feat. In addition, as Cdc42 belongs to the Rho family of
small GTPases, and we have found that other Rho members also affect COPI transport, we will elucidate
how they could affect COPI vesicle and tubule formation. Second, we will address a current controversy
regarding how COPI bends membrane. Whereas coat proteins are predicted to assemble into protein
lattices with regular geometry in bending membrane, COPI has been found recently to assemble into
lattices with irregular geometry. We will examine whether this apparent exception is due to the
reconstitution of COPI vesicles that has thus far not accounted for all the factors needed for a physiology
reconstitution of COPI vesicles. Third, we will follow up on our recent discovery that has identified a novel
role for a ciliary protein, known as IFT20. We have found that IFT20 exists at the Golgi, where it promotes
COPI tubular transport. Thus, we will elucidate how IFT20 exerts this novel role. Fourth, we will elucidate
how a point mutation in a core component of the COPI complex, known as yl-COP, leads to
immunodeficiency in affected individuals. We have already elucidated one explanation, which involves
defect in COPI binding to the KDEL receptor, leading to stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to impair
the function of T and B cells. However, because COPI binds to other cargo proteins, including a large
family of proteins that promote exit from the ER, known as ER cargo receptors, we will identify those ER
cargo receptors affected by the yl-COP mutation and then elucidate how their defective binding by COPI
 leads to altered cellular functions. In addition, as we have found that the y l -COP mutation also impairs
COPI tubular transport, we will elucidate a mechanistic explanation for this additional effect of the mutation.
We anticipate that the completion of these four aims will advance a basic understanding of how COPI acts
to generate transport carriers, as well shed physiologic insights into cellular processes that requires this
transport."

This application is in response to PA-20-272: Administrative Supplements to Existing NIH Grants and
Cooperative Agreements (Parent Admin Supp Clinical Trial Optional). Summary of parent-award
Specific Aims. The Symptoms of Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network (LURN) was
assembled in 2012 to increase the understanding of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Related to this
goal was the improvement of patient-centered assessment of LUTS. This work involves improving the
self-report measurement of LUTS using new, high-quality items to be used in questionnaire assessments.
These items were created with qualitative input from patients, community participants, internists,
urologists, urogynecologists, and clinical researchers. This set of items is referred to as the
Comprehensive Assessment of Self-Reported Urinary Symptoms (CASUS). The original aims of the
grant were Aim 1: To refine and expand a clinically-relevant cluster model across a cohort of patients
with LUTS. Relative to LURN I, participants will have a wider range of symptom severity and be
characterized using novel measures of bladder and urethral function; Aim 2: To identify protein
biomarker signatures contained within plasma of specific subgroups of men and women with LUTS;
Aim 3: To determine phenotypic characteristics of women with LUTS by measuring the functional
components of the lower urinary tract; Aim 4 To validate comprehensive outcome tools for men and
women with LUTS; and Aim 5: To determine influences of stress and mental health on LUTS. In this
supplement, we will focus on the following additional activities: Aim 5.1. Determine the relationship
between level of cognitive function and LUTS. LUTS increase with age and are associated with greater
impairment in performing activities of daily living, lower mood, and poorer overall health quality. More
recently, LUTS have been associated with increased risk of cognitive impairment and dementia. The
LURN II data present a unique opportunity to further elucidate the relationship between cognition and
LUTS. Within Aim 5.1, our hypothesis is: Cognitive function, measured by BrainTest, which is based on
the electronic version of the self-administered gerocognitive examination (eSAGE), will be related to
LUTS; Aim 5.2. Determine baseline predictors of LUTS trajectories in a sample of men and women
with urinary urgency. We will conduct separate analyses in men and women who have urinary urgency
and other LUTS. We propose to create models of the trajectory of LUTS for each participant, and then
relating these trajectories to patient health variables. We will explore baselines symptoms, combined with
other health variables that have been explored in LURN I such as BMI, depression, anxiety, and sleep
disturbance. We also plan to explore psychosocial variables that have not been explored with respect to
urgency: intolerance of uncertainty, catastrophizing, and adverse childhood experiences."
11142260,"Role of immune system in prophylaxis antibiotic’s surgical site infection control
Despite many advances in infection control practices – including improved operating room ventilation, barriers,
sterilization methods, improved surgical techniques, surgical site infection (SSI) remains a significant cause of
morbidity, prolonged hospitalization, and death with an estimated annual cost of $3.5 to $10 billion in
healthcare expenditures in the US alone. Administration of prophylaxis antibiotics in the perioperative period
(~1h prior to surgery) is the standard of care for most surgical procedures. However, even short-term antibiotic
use is associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance, as well as, increased risk for Clostridium difficile
infection, and immunological and neurological diseases, many of which have been attributed to dysbiosis in the
gut flora due to antibiotics. Novel approaches (preferably antibiotic-free) are urgently needed to address SSI.
Surgical site infection is considerably worse in immunocompromised patients where prophylaxis antibiotics are
considerably much less effective, even in the case where the infective pathogen is sensitive to the
administered antibiotics. Whether or not immune system plays a direct role in boosting prophylaxis antibiotics
effectiveness or prophylaxis antibiotics functioning in heightening immune system has not been studied.
Rather, reduced antibiotic effectiveness in immunocompromised patients has been blamed on factors, such as
therapy-induced neutropenia, or disregulated innate immune responses, and/or impaired neutrophil functions.
Driven by our preliminary data, we hypothesize that bacterial killing by prophylaxis antibiotics at the site of
infection results in immune system activation which in turn directly boosts the effectiveness of antibiotics by
mobilizing immune leukocytes to the site of infection. In aim 1 of this proposal, we will assess the molecular
mechanism(s) that couple innate immune system with prophylaxis antibiotics. In aim 2, we will test our
hypothesis that immunomodulators -- that can mobilize and activate immune system at the site of infection --
will be effective in controlling surgical site infections even in the absence of prophylaxis antibiotics. We will use
an implant and a wound animal models for surgical site infection to evaluate the effectiveness of
immunomodulator-based therapies (single vs. in combination with antibiotics) as compared to prophylaxis
antibiotics alone in controlling local and systemic infections. We will also assess the possible deleterious side-
effects of immunomodulator-based approaches on animal health and normal physiological processes.
These comprehensive studies will tackle surgical site infection which is an important public health concern.
They will address critical knowledge gaps in our understanding of the direct role that immune system plays in
boosting infection control by prophylaxis antibiotics. And they will lay the groundwork for the development of
novel immunomodulator-based approaches to control surgical site infections."
11142115,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Description: RNA-guided, or ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP), enzymes comprise an emerging class of
molecules that function in a wide range of biological pathways. Unlike most of the protein-based enzymes,
RNP enzymes rely on the guide RNA to secure the substrates and on the partner proteins to catalyze the
chemical reactions. The RNA-guided targeting mechanism has created unprecedented opportunities in
genome manipulation, gene regulation and nucleic acid detection. Research in the Li laboratory employs
structural biology and complementary methods to uncover the theoretical basis for their biological function and
effective use as research, diagnostic and therapeutic tools. In the proposed funding period, the Li laboratory
will tackle the mechanisms of the RNP enzymes to enable their applications. These include the methylation-
sensitive Clustered, Regularly Interspaced, Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9, the multi-functional
Type III CRISPR effectors and their associated signaling processes, and the small nucleolar RNPs (snoRNPs)
responsible for chemical modifications of ribosomal RNA. Though unrelated in enzyme composition or
biological pathway, these RNP enzymes are governed by a similar set of physicochemical principles and share
the great potential in therapeutic and diagnostic innovations by reprogramming the chemistry of cellular nucleic
acids. The proposed research will assess the feasibility of engineering and applying the epigenetic DNA-
specific Cas9, the utility of rapid virus detection with the CRISPR Type III effectors, and the possibility of
tunning cellular functions through chemical modifications of RNA. The Li laboratory has assembled a team of
scientists with complementary expertise in microbiology, mammalian genome biology, yeast genetics, single
molecule biophysics, virology, virus detection, X-ray crystallography, and high-throughput cryogenic electron
microscopy to maximize the impact while mitigating the risks of the research. The goal of this transformative
proposal is to demonstrate and enable the applicability of the RNA-mediated enzymes in a wide range of
biomedical fields.

11142233,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Vibrations from sound and mechanical stimuli from head movements are transformed into electrochemical
signals for brain processing by inner-ear hair-cell mechanoreceptors mediating our senses of hearing and
balance. Essential to hair-cell function are the proteins that form its mechanotransduction apparatus comprised
of a fine tip-link filament that pulls on an ion channel complex to trigger sensory perception. The tip-link
filament is formed by cadherin-23 (CDH23) and protocadherin-15 (PCDH15) proteins while the ion channel
complex is thought to be formed by members of the transmembrane channel-like protein family TMC1 and
TMC2, the transmembrane inner ear protein TMIE, and the tetraspan membrane protein of hair-cell stereocilia
TMHS (also known as LHFPL5). In addition, the calcium and integrin binding protein CIB2 binds to TMC
channels to regulate mechanotransduction. All these proteins are important for hearing and balance and are
involved in inherited deafness, yet their molecular structures and the functional architecture of the transduction
complex they form are poorly understood. The overall long-term goal of this project is to reveal the
structural determinants of function for the proteins forming the inner-ear tip link and transduction ion
channel complex. In Aim 1, we will use cryo-electron microscopy, high-speed atomic force microscopy, and
molecular dynamics simulations to study the full-length extracellular domains of CDH23 and PCDH15 and
thereby establish the structural determinants of tip-link function in inner ear mechanotransduction. In Aim 2, we
will generate testable predictions using microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations with biasing
membrane potentials to characterize permeation of ions and ototoxic aminoglycosides through experimentally
validated structural models of TMC protein pores. In Aim 3, we will use various computational and biophysical
techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance and native mass spectrometry, to explore regulatory
mechanisms of transduction by CIB proteins. Results obtained from the proposed experiments and simulations
will provide an initial and dynamic molecular view of the protein components of the inner ear
mechanotransduction apparatus as we advance to understand its architecture and function in normal and
impaired hearing and balance."

11143638,"Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Health: The availability of VHA ED care has expanded rapidly over the past
decade. VHA Emergency Department (ED) often serves as a first stop for Veterans who are experiencing
acute problems related to hazardous alcohol use and mental health problems. Many Veterans seen in VHA
EDs report hazardous drinking that is either tied directly to their presenting problem or complicates the care of
medical and/or psychiatric symptoms. Hazardous drinking is directly related to high volume and high morbidity
problems in Veterans, including PTSD, suicidality and homelessness. Providing alcohol brief interventions in
this fast-paced environment can be difficult due to competing staff time demands. Expanding the role of peer
mentors used in the VHA to providing brief alcohol advice in the ED combined with post-ED continuing support
designed to reduce hazardous drinking and help Veterans engage in care has the potential to fill this gap in ED
care and improve outcomes for a vulnerable population. Project Background: Research indicates that a high
proportion of patients seen in EDs have hazardous or harmful alcohol use. Due to limited provider time to
screen for alcohol and deliver alcohol-related services in EDs, few individuals currently receive the needed
assistance to cut-back, stop drinking, and/or link to needed services following an ED visit. Single-session
alcohol brief interventions (BIs) alone are only modestly effective in the ED and thus more intensive, but
sustainable, interventions are needed to facilitate engagement to the most appropriate VHA resource (e.g.,
substance abuse treatment, homeless program case management, embedded mental health in primary care,
etc.). The VHA nationally has implemented the use of trained peer specialists in a number of areas. VHA EDs
have the opportunity to use peer specialists to conduct standardized alcohol brief interventions, provide
continuing support, and link Veterans to needed services. The widespread availability of peers within health
care teams provides a potential method to overcome barriers for connecting Veterans with hazardous/harmful
alcohol use to needed VHA services. Project Objectives: The objective of this proposed study is to conduct a
hybrid randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of an intervention starting in the ED with peer-
delivered brief alcohol advice (including a 6-session program of post-ED strengths-based peer mentorship)
compared to clinician-delivered brief advice in the ED only to facilitate reductions in hazardous drinking, and
linkage and engagement in primary and/or specialty care. Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of the ED Alcohol
Peer Mentor (APM) intervention compared to Clinical Brief Advice (CBA) on subsequent AUDIT scores,
including quantity/frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, and alcohol consequences at 3-, 6-, and 12-months
post-baseline. Aim 2: Determine the impact of the APM intervention on linkage to primary and specialty alcohol
treatment services care, mental health symptoms and functioning at 3-, 6-, and 12-months post-baseline.
Project Methods: The proposed study will screen VA ED patients for hazardous drinking. Those screening
positive and who enroll in the study will be randomized to one of two conditions: 1) APM intervention (n=225),
and 2) CBA (n=225) comparison condition. All participants will receive written community resource information.
All individuals in the APM condition will receive peer support to reduce hazardous drinking, and those who
meet alcohol use disorder criteria will be coached by the peer and will assist in a warm handoff to addiction
treatment. Qualitative interviews with a subset of Veterans, peers, clinicians, and clinical leaders will assess
potential barriers and facilitators to the implementation of this approach in the VHA. Because the VHA ED is an
important portal for entry into the VA health care system, particularly for Veterans who are experiencing
hazardous or harmful drinking, the delivery of an efficacious alcohol peer-mentor intervention with minimal use
of staff resources could have a major public health impact."

Our multidisciplinary and highly collaborative consortium has been identifying gene variants that are associated
with increased vulnerability to compulsive oxycodone use, tolerance to the analgesic effects of oxycodone, and
development of withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia by performing the first GWAS using an advanced model of
chronic intravenous oxycodone self-administration. We have also created the first preclinical oxycodone biobank
which enables researchers who do not have the resources to perform chronic intravenous self-administration or
next-generation genome sequencing to perform advanced genetic, molecular, and cellular studies to further our
understanding of the biological changes underlying addiction-like behaviors. However, we are facing significant
challenges that threaten the viability of this project due to rising labor and supply costs and the need for additional
data curation efforts due to equipment/software failures. The overall goal of the following two aims for this 12-
month supplement is to ensure the viability of the oxycodone biobank and provide an in-depth analysis and
curation of oxycodone addiction-like behaviors. This will address the increased costs of maintaining the
repository and the need for accurate and reliable data processing. In Specific Aim 1, we will ensure the continued
viability and expansion of the Oxycodone Biobank, which has become an invaluable resource for addiction
research. The rising costs of supplies, labor, and equipment maintenance threaten the sustainability of the
biobank, and this aim will focus on repairing and updating critical equipment, procuring essential supplies, and
covering the increased costs associated with maintaining the repository, including accommodating the increased

it into our database. We will employ rigorous data curation protocols to ensure the integrity and accuracy of our
findings. This process will include systematic error-checking, data validation, and meticulous integration of
corrected data. By maintaining high standards of data curation, we will guarantee the reliability of our analysis
and interpretation, providing robust insights into oxycodone addiction-like behaviors. Integrating these curated
data with existing behavioral and genetic data, we aim to uncover novel insights into the mechanisms underlying
oxycodone addiction and develop more targeted interventions."
11083186,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Intricate cellular morphology is essential for neuron function. Axons in particular form thin and extremely
long cables with synaptic contacts along their length to communicate with their target neurons. This cable
property of the axons allows rapid conduction of electrical signals, or action potentials, to activate synaptic
communication. Traditionally, axon diameter is thought to be relatively uniform. However, recent studies
suggest that axon diameter is highly dynamic and can be controlled by neuronal firing. Our preliminary
data further the view of dynamic axon morphology by revealing that axons are not simple cylindrical tubes,
but rather exhibit peals-on-a-string morphology between synaptic varicosities. This structure is
reminiscent of lipid bilayer pearling, generated through a tension-driven instability. In support of this, in
silico modeling suggests that axon pearling depends on membrane mechanics such as bending modulus
and tension. In fact, axon pearling is lost when hyperosmotic solution is applied, while it is exacerbated in
hypoosmotic conditions. Thus, pearled axon morphology is tightly coupled to the biophysical properties of
membranes. Two of the major determinants of membrane mechanics are lipid composition and
cytoskeletal structure. Importantly, lipid composition and cytoskeletal structure also control the localization
of transmembrane proteins such as voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels, essential for action
potential firing. Therefore, membrane properties likely regulate both axon morphology and function. In this
proposal, we will test this hypothesis by 1) determining the contribution of lipid composition and
cytoskeletal structure to the axon morphology, channel localization, and action potential firing, and 2)
determining how these factors change with plasticity induced by repetitive neuronal firing. Since many
factors controlling membrane mechanics are implicated in neurological disorders such as epilepsy and
depression, this study will potentially reveal the underling mechanisms by which misregulation of
biophysical factors leads to pathophysiological conditions. We will achieve these goals with the expertise
in theoretical modeling by Pl Rangamani and the expertise in ultrastructural analysis of neurons by co-Pl
Watanabe. Together, we will elucidate the fundamental biophysical principles governing axon morphology
and function."
11083199,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Virtually every aspect of human behavior is governed by beliefs about ourselves and the world around us. 
These beliefs are continuously updated in response to the deluge of information we encounter in everyday 
life. The mechanisms that underlie belief updating may hold the key to understanding neuropsychiatric 
conditions involving abnormal belief updating, such as delusions in psychosis or cognitive distortions in 
depression. Despite active research, progress in our understanding of the neural mechanisms of normal 
and abnormal belief updating has been limited, owing in part to i) a focus on individual tasks rather than 
cross-domain constructs, ii) oversimplified models that cannot scale to real world behavior, and iii) a
failure to link computational descriptions to the neural circuitry that performs them. Here, we propose to 
bridge these gaps by implementing our recently developed computational framework of belief updating 
across tasks from different neuroscience domains. We recently established a belief updating framework 
based on contextual inference, which embraces the complexity of real-world belief updating, and can, in 
principle, be applied broadly to tasks of different neuroscience domains. Contextual inference assumes 
that belief updating includes two components: 1) learning what to expect in a given context, and 2)
figuring out which context you are actually in. We have developed a biological instantiation of this model, 
based on cortico-striato-thalamic loops that can perform this contextual inference, capture belief updating 
behavior in canonical tasks, and shed light on pathological belief updating behaviors observed in 
schizophrenia. In our model, individual and clinical differences in belief updating could emerge through 
differences in the stability of context representations, which are stored in cortical attractor networks that 
are sensitive to both stable structural features, such as the ratio of excitation to inhibition within the 
network, as well as dynamic interactions with thalamic inputs. Applying lessons from our model to 
schizophrenia, where prefrontal inhibition is impaired, cortical attractors would be expected to be less 
stable, promoting spurious attractor switches and state transitions. We will extend our contextual
inference model to measure the degree to which it can generalize behavioral tendencies of belief updating 
across neuroscience domains. We will examine how these tendencies relate to real-world behavior and 
mental health traits. We will then test the model’s core predictions regarding the biological origins of"

DdmABC+PirA anti-phage system which we call the Cell Density-dependent Death or CDD system. We plan 
to define the precise mechanism of CDD by address several key questions: Is this DdmA nuclease activated 
in the cytosol of cells that are exposed to DNA palindromic hairpins or the whole VIBO4 phage genome at 
high MOI? Is the host chromosome degraded DdmA nuclease in the presence of palindromic DNA? Answers 
to these questions will guide in vitro biochemistry that will seek to reconstitute the signalling complex (e.g., 
DdnABC +/- PirA +/- palindromic DNA hairpin). Such a complex might trigger DdnA nuclease activity. We 
already have active Hexa-His versions of these proteins for purification or doing pull down experiments to 
define stable complexes. We plan to work with our colleagee Dr. Philip Kranzusch to obtain a cryo- EM 
structure of the complexes in active and inactive biochemical states. We successfully did this with Dr. 
Kranzusch with two other CBASS nucleases as well as the DNA bound version of eukaryotic cGAS.
2. Understanding the host range of V. cholerae phage and antiphage systems. While the genes that 
trigger CDD can block some phage infections, many phages are immune to the system. We will determine 
if these are devoid of palindromic sequences by phage genome sequencing and analysis. If they do have 
palindromes, we will clone them and confirm they are actively recognized by the CDD system. A positive 
result would suggest that these phages likely encode anti-CDD proteins. Thus, we will attempt to clone these 
anti-CDD genes as trans-suppressors for palindromic hairpin-induced CDD.
3. Using CRISPRi to understand more about phage resistance phenotypes in V. cholerae. Our 
computational pipeline called PCOVA has identified many new anti-phage systems based solely on their covariance with other anti-phage systems. We will use our new genome-wide CRISPRi system to ask whether 
these are functional. For example, PCOVA has identfied a new anti-phage gene called VC0812 which is not 
associated with chromosomal islands, and which likely encodes a nuclease. Knockout of VC0812 sensitize 
V. cholerae to unique phages. We will further characterize VC0812 because this gene correlates highly with 
pandemic lineages of V. cholerae that include both Classical and El Tor biotypes. We also plan to use 
CRISPRi to identify essential genes involved in CDD as these are impossible to inactivate. For example, if 
DNA synthesis is required for a step in the CDD pathway, then gwCRISPi might uncover essential genes like 
polA and gyrAB that are involved in DNA replication as being needed for efficient CDD. Knocking down their 
transcription with CRISPRi would be picked up as enrichment of sgRNA against these targets in cells that 
survive brief exposure to CDD conditions. Of course genes like DdmABC would serve as positive controls 
since we know the level of transcription of these genes is controled by quorum sensing and thus their 
knockdown should block CDD. Pair-wise pwCRISPRi willl be imployed to provide information about the CDD 
components that become most critical when a particular CDD component such as PriA is knocked down.
4. Exploring Biological Signal Amplifiers (BSA) in vivo during V. cholerae infection. We've shown that 
T6SS killing of commensal E. coli greatly enhances mucosal colonization of V. cholerae. As a way to explore 
the effects of bacterial cell death on mucosal biology, we've developed two potential BSA systems that cause 
V. cholerae to lyse during infection -- 1) by using CRISPRi to knockdown essential genes (e.g., cell wall 
biosynthesis gene murG), and 2) by expressing various cell wall hydrolytic enzymes. We plan to monitor the 
transcription of bacteria and host animals that are infected with BSA strains plus or minus a coninfecting WT. 
In parallel, we will prepare cell-free supernatant fluids from V. cholerae that have undergone lysis due to BSA 
expression. These will be tested for their ability to signal host cells and trigger cytokine responses consistent 
with activation of innate immune pathways. We will define which PAMPs are released by different BSAs. 
Preliminary results suggest that muramyl di-peptide (MDP) is indeed one PAMP that can enhance V. cholerae 
colonization. Phage infection in vitro and in vivo will also be used to generate phage-induced PAMPs that 
will be studied the same way. Given that phages do grow on V. cholerae during human infection, this could 
be another way phages influence V. cholerae virulence and pathogenesis. Thus, phage infection of a fraction 
of the in vivo V. cholerae might act as a BSA as well.
5. Exploring the mechanism of how Aeromonas A603 specifically targets V. cholerae for killing with 
its T6SS and phenazine natural product. We plan to wrap up our work on A603 with experiments focused 
on the activity of two T6SS effectors (TseBC) that may permeabilize Vibrio cells to phenazine uptake. The 
structure of the A603 phenazine and the identity and mechanism of resistance proteins will be determined. 
We also plan to study whether A603 can interupt transmission of V. cholerae from one linfected animal to 
another. This would suggest A603 could be used to control cholera outbreaks."
11134069,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite the availability of biomedical prevention tools to end the HIV epidemic, incidence of HIV and other STIs
in Alabama remain high, while uptake of prevention such as PrEP remains low. Sex workers and people who
use drugs represent vulnerable groups who face unique barriers to HIV prevention including PrEP. However,
HIV services for sex workers in Alabama are limited, and no evidence-based interventions in the CDC’s
Compendium have been tailored for sex workers. To assess syndemics trends among sex workers in
Birmingham, in Year 1 of this study we analyzed 16 years of data from nearly 25,000 visits and over 17,000
individuals accessing services at Birmingham AIDS Outreach (community partner) and 1,185 individuals
reporting sex work, finding elevated HIV and syphilis prevalence among sex workers of color and elevated
HCV prevalence among non-Hispanic white sex workers. In our qualitative interviews with 12 people engaged
in sex work and five key informants from BAO and other organizations, we contextualized sex workers’
experiences, finding that sex work in Birmingham varies in terms of social and structural vulnerabilities and
HIV/STI risk. However, most programs offer tailored services to specific populations, and gaps in care remain.
Thus, using syndemic theory, we will develop an intervention for people engaging in sex work in Alabama in
the proposed Year 2 of this study that builds on mixed methods data obtained in Year 1. The Specific Aims are
to: (1) Identify and characterize geographic clustering of sex work and related outcomes among BAO clients,
(2) Develop a harm reduction intervention for people engaging in sex work, and (3) Assess preliminary
acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the intervention to increase PrEP uptake that responds to the
syndemics of sex work, drug use, HIV, and STIs. In Aim 1, we will apply spatial epidemiologic methods to
identify geographic clustering of sex work among BAO clients; characterize cluster-level differences in clinical
and behavioral outcomes; and assess the relationship between neighborhood-level factors (e.g., structural
racism) and cluster- and individual-level clinical and behavioral outcomes. In Aim 2, the study team and Health
Equity Research Assembly (HERA) will develop the intervention using the principles of co-design, while in Year
3 we will evaluate the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the intervention using validated
measures through web-based surveys and qualitative interviews with sex workers (n=5) and stakeholder
interviews with providers and other key informants (n=5). This work will be guided by the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), RE-AIM framework, and ERIC strategies. The project will
inform a subsequent R-level proposal to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of this novel intervention co-
developed with community members."
10732815,"During the MERIT period we will continue to build on the progress made (see progress report) in the current
grant cycle in these three areas:
1) Methods for HIV prevention and treatment trials
We will continue to investigate clinical trial designs that enable efficient and effective evaluation of interventions for treatment and prevention of HIV, including i) further development of platform trial designs that are
particularly efficient when multiple interventions can be assessed, ii) master protocol designs that can be used
in diverse and international clinical settings; iii) designs for active control PrEP trials that leverage additional
information to infer HIV incidence in the absence of intervention (“counterfactual placebo incidence”), including
noninferiority trials augmented with HIV exposure biomarkers and recency assay data.
We will develop methods for the design and analysis of stepped wedge designs, including i) using the
theory of Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMM) (Robins, 1994) to develop robust and efficient intervention
effect estimates for stepped wedge designs, including methods that provide consistent estimates when the
treatment effect is not constant and incorporating both design-based and asymptotic inference methods; ii) formulating the log hazard ratio for the treatment effect on the clinical outcome as a continuous, piecewise linear
function of time elapsed since the initiation of the treatment. Statistical inference will be based on partial likelihood, with a sandwich variance estimator to account for intra-cluster correlation. Interval-censored outcomes
will be accomodated; iii) updating our R software tools to incorporate the methodology developed.
We will develop new statistical methods for HIV/AIDS studies in which HIV infection is an intermediate event
whose effect on another outcome (e.g., stroke) is of interest. Since HIV infection is only known to occur in a
time interval induced by periodic blood tests, we will formulate the effects of covariates on time to HIV infection
through the familiar Cox proportional hazards model and adopt nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation
with interval-censored observations.
We will develop new, highly efficient estimators of an optimal joint dynamic treatment and screening strategy
that exploit the no direct effect (NDE) assumption that screening has no effect on a patient’s clinical outcome of
interest except through the effect of the screening results on the choice of treatment. For the management of
HIV+ individuals, our methods will provide practical guidance on cost-effective strategies that determine at each
clinic visit (1) whether to order viral load and/or CD4 count tests (at some cost and burden to the patient) and
(2) whether to start or switch anti-retroviral treatment.
2) Charactizing the HIV epidemic
To estimate yearly, subnational variation in HIV indicators using household survey data one must account
for the complex design. Inference is required at the geographic admin2 level (which is two below the national)
but design-based estimators are unstable at this level due to data sparsity. However, at the admin-1 level such
estimators can be used and we desire estimates at admin-2 that are consistent with these. We will develop
model-based methods for admin-2 level data, but benchmarking to the design-based estimates at admin-1.
3) Analysis of HIV cure and vaccine studies
We will continue developing statistical models and computational tools to analyze complex high-dimensional
data produced by bioassays used in HIV vaccine studies. In particular, we will focus on methodologies to support
the design and evaluation of novel germline-targeting vaccines that seek to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies
through a series of vaccine immunogens. First, we will use our modeling framework that describes evolution
of the B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire (using a multitype age-dependent branching stochastic processes) to
improve our understanding of affinity maturation. Second, we will develop machine learning approaches using
ensembles of deep neural networks to predict the impact of the accumulation of somatic hypermutations on the
binding affinity of BCR. Third, we will develop a novel class of computational tools to more robustly preprocess
and annotate BCR sequencing data and genotype the immunoglobulin genes of study volunteers by integrating
biological knowledge on somatic recombination into the design of the algorithms.
We will develop an extension of the serial limiting dilution assay methods developed in Trumble et al. (2017)
to accommodate information about the number of distinct viral lineages obtained from viral deep sequencing as
described by Lee et al. (2017). In the context of HIV cure research, these methods will provide a point estimate
and confidence interval for the size of the latent HIV reservoir.
Deep sequencing (as in Lee et al. (2017)) of viruses such as HIV permits examination of genetically diverse
populations of viruses, and in particular can lead to the identification of variants which may be of interest.
Unfortunately deep sequencing utilizes next gen sequencing platforms which are error prone, which requires
particular attention when trying to identify minority variants. We will develop methods to would identify sequence
base pairs which exhibit variation across reads beyond what would be expected solely due to sequencing error,
while controlling the false discovery rate."

Abstract
CTN-0109 Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of extended-release naltrexone and monthly extended-
 release buprenorphine for cocaine use disorder (CURB-2)
This is an 8-week, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of a combination
of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) and extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP) compared to
placebo injections (PBO-Inje) for the treatment of cocaine use disorder (CUD). The primary objective is to
evaluate whether assignment of 8 weeks of outpatient XR-NTX + XR-BUP compared to PBO-Inje reduces
urine-verified cocaine use in study Weeks 5 through 8. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of
cocaine-negative urine drug screens (UDS) obtained during Weeks 5 through 8 as measured for the XR-NTX +
XR-BUP and PBO-Inj conditions. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of assignment to 8 weeks of
XR-NTX + XR-BUP compared to PBO-Inj on self-report days of cocaine use, cocaine craving, safety, and
treatment effectiveness. The secondary outcome measures are 1) Self-reported days of cocaine use and
cocaine craving effects (Visual Analog Scale (VAS)) during Weeks 0-8; 2) Measures of adverse events during
Weeks 0-8: number and severity of adverse events; number and outcomes (fatal/non-fatal) of overdose events
reported; 3) Measures of Treatment Effectiveness Assessment (TEA) at Week 8.

Extraction of SDOH elements from multisite EHR for endorsed CDE mapping and analysis:
HeartShare
Project Summary:
Heart failure with preserved ejection (HFpEF) is a highly prevalent and complex disorder that
confers a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality. In contrast with the many evidence-based
therapeutic options available for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), progress for
disease-modifying therapies for HFpEF has been limited and five-year survival rates following
hospitalization have remained stagnant at approximately 50%. A major barrier in identifying
effective treatments for HFpEF (identified by the NHLBI HFpEF Working Group convened in 2020) is
the “one size fits all” approach to what is a heterogeneous syndrome that comprises many
different subtypes.1 Therefore, the primary goals of HeartShare are to classify heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) into distinct phenotypes, characterize disease mechanisms,
and identify therapeutic targets for each HFpEF subtype. The study includes three overlapping
components; a prospective, observational study of patients with HFpEF and controls that begins
with an intensive in-person assessment, a low-touch longitudinal registry and a HeartShare EHR
Study. In the EHR study, a multi-center retrospective cohort of patients with heart failure is being
created to better understand the epidemiology and health care patterns of a large, diverse
population of patients with HFpEF across seven health systems.
A supplement focusing on extraction of SDOH information with mapping to established CDE in
HeartShare accomplishes numerous objectives; 1) raising the awareness of CDE in the Heart
Failure advocacy and research communities (who are highly integrated in the program) promote
collection of high quality interoperable data in future trials and studies 2) generation of high-quality
individual-level SDOH data from a large EHR dataset—which would be expected to contain more
diversity in SDOH than many trials and studies which often disproportionately enroll individuals of
higher SES and 3) integration of individual-level SDOH into numerous HeartShare datasets
facilitating numerous analyses investigating the critical role of SDOH as exposures, covariates,
and mediators for key Heart Failure outcomes.
Over the past several years, many health systems have begun to systematically collect individual-
level, health-related social risk data; the collection of this data was motivated both by internal
interest to implement programs to advance health equity as well as evolving external incentives
and requirements focused on this type of data collection. Although several groups, such as the HL7
Gravity Project and PhenX, have sought to develop consensus-driven standards for health-related
social risk data from research participants and patients, these standards have not been widely
adopted by individual health systems or EHR vendors and the result is a wide variety of data
collection methods—many different structured instruments and sometimes SDOH data captured
in EHR notes. To generate high-quality research data from this current messy reality, we will
perform a landscape analysis of the individual-level health-related social risk factor data being
collected in any structured form at each of the 7 HeartShare Clinical Centers. We will also
Inventory of SDOH elements often captured in cardiology, primary care, and social work notes at
Northwestern Medicine using open-source, natural language processing tools.2 Once the
inventories are completed, we will create publicly available algorithms to extract and clean this
data from EHR databases (taking into account the ever-present issues of repeated and often
incomplete data collection inherent in EHR platforms). Then, in partnership with NCI CDE
Repository (caDSR) and using their already developing tools, we will map these extracted elements
to endorsed NIH CDE, which may include a subset of the ScHARe CDE. As part of this process, we
will also map SDOH information collected in the HeartShare registry and deep phenotyping studies
(via Eureka) to endorsed CDE. This will give us a unique opportunity to examine correlation
between SDOH collected via research survey and EHR in a subset of HeartShare participants.
As part of the parent HeartShare study, each site has been mapping its electronic health record
data to a common data model called the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP),3,4
a data model used widely worldwide, including by other NIH-funded studies, such as All of Us and
eMERGE.5 The OMOP data model includes key information about all patients with HFpEF, such as
demographics, blood pressure measurements, medications, co-morbidities, diagnostic testing,
procedures, ambulatory encounters, hospitalizations, and deaths within each health system. As
part of continuing HeartShare work, sites are already adding detailed echocardiographic data and
zip codes for linkage to social determinants of health (SDOH), such as area deprivation index.6,7
Once extracted elements of SDOH are mapped to endorsed CDE, Northwestern Medicine and at
least one additional HeartShare site will place them in OMOP, facilitating analysis investigating the
critical role of SDOH as exposures, covariates, and mediators for key Heart Failure outcomes.
Data from HeartShare will be deposited into BioData Catalyst, and we will work with that team to
ensure these data, including the SDOH, are deposited in an interoperable format, such as FHIR.
Expected Outcomes:
1) Mapping of SDOH instruments used in HeartShare Registry and Deep Phenotyping (via
 Eureka) to existing NIH endorsed CDE in partnership with caDSR
2) Outreach about the importance of endorsed CDE use in trials and observations studies to
 the broad Heart Failure advocacy community
3) Inventory of structured SDOH questions posed at clinics throughout 7 major health
systems
4) Inventory of SDOH elements often captured in cardiology and primary care notes at a major
 integrated health system using open-source, natural language processing tools
5) Publicly available algorithms to extract, consolidate, and clean SDOH questions and
 elements from raw EHR databases across multiple clinical centers (in preparation for CDE
 mapping) and load into OMOP
6) Mapping of SDOH elements captured via structured/unstructured EHR data to endorsed
 CDE in partnership with caDSR
7) Collection of SDOH (mapped to established CDE) into existing HeartShare OMOP instance
 at 2 HeartShare sites
8) Analysis of the distribution of health-related social risk factors across different HFpEF sub
 phenotypes identified by the HeartShare team
9) Deposition of SDOH data from HeartShare into BioData Catalyst in FHIR format"
11142896,"Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) often endure multiple acute pain crises throughout their lives. The cumulative impact of these crises and physical complications contribute to the emergence of chronic pain syndromes, mental health conditions, and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in early adolescence that persist through adulthood. In their 2020 pain management guidelines for SCD, the American Society of Hematology acknowledged the limited effectiveness of pharmacologic approaches and the potential benefits of nonpharmacologic integrative approaches such as music therapy (MT). These guidelines identified research priorities including determining which nonpharmacologic therapies are most acceptable and developing manualized, accessible, and developmentally appropriate interventions for chronic SCD pain. In our prior single-site feasibility study, 24 adults with SCD and chronic pain were randomized to receive either an in-person 6-session MT intervention (n = 12) or waitlist control (WLC) (n = 12). We developed procedures for screening, recruitment, retention, and electronic data collection within this randomized controlled trial (RCT). The enrollment rate was 89%, all study measures were completed, and MT participants demonstrated 100% attendance as well as improvements in self-efficacy and HRQoL compared to WLC participants. While results from this pilot RCT are promising, to scale an intervention in preparation for a future, multi-site, pragmatic, definitive RCT, further steps are needed. Furthermore, with MT being increasingly adapted for virtual delivery, including among adults with SCD, trials are needed to investigate the feasibility of hybrid (i.e., one in-person and five virtual sessions) approaches to MT delivery. In this R01, we propose to examine the feasibility of a multi-site study enrolling (1) in-person MT (n=30), (2) hybrid MT (n=30), and (3) hybrid Health Education (HealthEd) (n=30). Our proposal includes the MULTI-MUSIQOLS Data Coordinating Center at University of California Irvine and two recruiting sites: University Hospitals/Case Western Reserve University and Prisma Health/University of South Carolina. A total of 90 subjects will be randomized to either in-person MT, hybrid MT, or hybrid Health Education (HealthED) (1:1:1 allocation) with a focus on feasibility of data collection, participant recruitment, delivery of interventions, and home practice. Our Specific Aims are: AIM 1) conduct a feasibility RCT to examine the data collection processes and intervention (in-person MT, hybrid MT, and hybrid HealthED) implementation overall and across 2 sites; and AIM 2) evaluate the implementation of the in-person MT, hybrid MT, and hybrid HealthED interventions using both quantitative data (study records, stakeholder surveys) and qualitative data (interviews). Successful conduct of the proposed, feasibility RCT will provide the necessary framework for conducting a future, multi-site, pragmatic, RCT of MT compared with HealthED. Completion of the proposed R01 and the subsequent RCT (UG3/UH3) could provide critical evidence to support inclusion of MT as a chronic pain intervention for individuals with SCD and other similar populations."

 This application is being submitted in response to Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified
as NOT-CA-24-029.
High-grade Spinal Cord Glioma (SCG) is an orphan disease that results in significant morbidity
and mortality, with no effective treatment options available. Despite significant advances in our
knowledge of the disease process, there have unfortunately been limited changes to the clinical
outcomes. In part, this represents the malignant nature of a disease that is refractory to the
standard of care. On the other hand, this raises the question of the translational value of existing
preclinical animal models, especially from a surgical standpoint – where widely scalable large
animal models of SCG were previously unavailable. To this end, we have begun to address this
gap in the field by developing a minipig SCG model. Through lentiviral targeting of the well
implicated RTK/RAS/PI3K and p53 pathways, our preliminary data demonstrates the induction of
high-grade astrocytoma with histopathologic, radiologic, and transcriptomic characterization in
100% of minipigs. Consequently, we posit that the next steps to advancement of this model
system are to modulate tumor phenotype and to demonstrate its utility in a directly translatable
surgical application. In the Parent Award, we will begin by evaluating the induction of SCG by
targeting common genetic lesions implicated in the human disease including PDGFB, P53,
CDKN2A, EGFR, and PTEN (AIM 1). In parallel, we will apply our existing minipig SCG model
(AIM 2) to perform the first intra-tumoral convection enhanced delivery (CED) study for SCG in a
large animal. In this Supplement, we plan to establish a low-grade glioma minipig model with the
IDH mutation for potential therapeutic application, followed by the characterization of the tumor
microenvironment. The outcome of our study will yield preliminary data for establishing a new
LGG minipig model in the brain that characterizes the spread and evolution of IDH-relevant
tumors, offering robust representations of human biology in a system that mimics the lifespan and
anatomy of human disease."

The over-65 population is growing, and over 1/3 of aged people will experience a fall. Falls in
the elderly often result from frailty caused by muscle weakness, balance deficits, and gait
instability. Previously, these deficits were ascribed to declining muscle mass (sarcopenia),
however, simply increasing muscle mass does not necessarily rescue age-induced functional
deficits. The term dynapenia has been introduced to denote aging-induced loss of muscle
strength, which includes deficits in motoneuron excitability, motor unit recruitment, transmitter
release at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), and muscle mass and function. As such, it is
critical to fully understand the changes that occur within NMJs to identity new targets for therapy
development. Here, we propose to define heterogeneous changes that occur within the
transmitter release sites (active zones; AZs) within NMJs that underlying dynapenia in an aged
mouse model. Specifically, we will (1) use a combination of electrophysiology and a new optical
quantal analysis approach we developed to study changes in the control of transmitter release
within single identified NMJs during aging, (2) use a new super-resolution imaging approach of
the density and distribution of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels within single AZs and
compare these results with our single AZ optical measurements of transmitter release in
identified NMJs over the aging time course, and (3) use a realistic computer simulation to test
the hypothesis that age-induced changes in AZ voltage-gated calcium channel density and
distribution predict single AZ and whole synapse function at the aging NMJ. The results from
these aims will elucidate the detailed structural and functional changes that occur within
transmitter release sites (AZs) of aging NMJs over the time course of the dynamic alterations
that occur as dynapenia develops. This information will guide future studies aimed at targeting
these specific aging-induced changes with the goal of treating dynapenia."

11169278,"ABSTRACT
It is well known that cancer metabolism is highly dynamic and context- and oncogene-dependent. However,
the underlying mechanism, particularly that of interorganelle communication in oncogene-dependent metabolic
reprogramming, is largely unknown. Our preliminary studies establish that oncogenic MYC regulates
Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)-localized transmembrane sensor IRE1a and its substrate XBP1 via multiple
mechanisms. Importantly, our pilot studies suggest the increased susceptibility of MYC-overexpressing triple
negative breast cancer (TNBC) to IRE1a/XBP1 inhibition, possibly mediated via altered interorganelle
communication and metabolic reprogramming to fatty acid oxidation (FAO). These findings provide a
framework to seek biological insight into this altered communication between the ER, mitochondria, and
nucleus in MYC-overexpressing TNBC cells, and to further explore the effects of pharmacological inhibition of
IRE1a as an anti-tumor approach for MYC-driven TNBC by disrupting the interorganelle communication. We
hypothesize that oncogenic MYC hijacks the ER stress sensor IRE1a, and its substrate XBP1, to promote
mitochondrial FAO and sustain TNBC tumorigenesis and resistance to chemotherapy. This proposal will
elucidate the function and mechanism of the ER in regulating MYC-driven oncogenic stress and mitochondrial
metabolic reprogramming in TNBC. In Aim 1, we will investigate the biological significance of IRE1a/XBP1
mediated ER-nucleus communication in MYC-driven TNBC. Aim 2 will determine the role of mitochondrial FAO
activation by the IRE1α/XBP1 pathway in MYC-driven TNBC. Lastly, Aim 3 will investigate the in vivo efficacy
and mechanisms of combination therapy with IRE1a inhibitor and docetaxel in treating MYC-driven TNBC. The
updated Aims for the 2-year extension period are based on the data generated from the original aims and
represent a logical extension of the original aims to study the IRE1-mediated metabolic reprogramming and
organelle dysfunction in regulating immunogenic cell death of MYC-driven TNBC. The resulting data from this
proposal will be significant as they will promote the development of novel, mechanism-based therapeutic
approaches to disrupt these altered metabolic pathways and improve the treatment of MYC-driven TNBC."

Pathology expertise and services in low and middle income countries (LMIC) are severely inadequate and
limited. One area in which pathology is especially critical for diagnosis and clinical decision making is thyroid
related disease and cancers. The incidences of thyroid nodules and cancers have increased worldwide. A
fundamental part of the clinical assessment for thyroid nodules is ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy
(FNAB). Unfortunately, this cytopathology expertise is scarce in LMIC and many nodules are surgically removed
for diagnosis. Since 90-95% of these nodules are without malignancy, many patients undergo unnecessary
surgery with the associated risks, financial costs, and stressing already limited resources. What is critically
needed is a means to provide cytopathology expertise to interpret thyroid FNAB in LMIC.
The overall goal of this proposal is to implement our ML approach into low resource settings to provide
accurate and timely cytopathology analysis of FNAB specimens. This R21/33 proposal focuses on MLA
adaptation using smartphones for LMIC (R21) and subsequent capacity building and implementation (R33)
through well-established LMIC research partnerships in tertiary centers in Tanzania and Vietnam. We
hypothesize that our MLA can use smartphone captured images to assess probability of malignancy in thyroid
FNAB that is comparable to trained cytopathologists.
Our Aims are: R21: Adaptation of a smartphone approach to capture cytopathology images for MLA analysis.
Archived FNAB samples used at different international institutions will be used to train and adapt the MLA with
these images. Furthermore, we would train local personnel in LMIC to image capture using this new setup. The
results from this phase will be an adapted MLA using smartphone images that has comparable sensitivity and
specificity to the original MLA. R33: Implementation of the smartphone MLA approach into LMIC clinical settings.
A prospective implementation of this approach in tertiary centers in Tanzania and Vietnam will be conducted.
FNAB samples obtained would undergo standard of care pathology assessment as well as be analyzed with the
MLA protocol. Local cytopathologist assessment will be compared with the MLA analysis. Outcome measures
include MLA assessment of slides, technical slide review and image capture, concordance with pathology
between MLA and expertise both in US and LMIC.
The expected outcome will lead to a cost-effective method to implement MLA for thyroid FNAB that can be used
in LMIC. This approach will not only assist in early diagnosis of thyroid cancers but also improve the utilization
of limited resources through effectively identifying those that need surgery from those that do not."
11166813,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of disability and death in the United
States; and the risks for disease are greatest among older adults. For more than half a century, CVD risk
calculators have been used to estimate a person’s risk of developing CVD and to guide treatment strategies to
prevent disease. Unfortunately, the tool recommended by current guidelines performs poorly in older adults and
among dis/advantaged population groups. The proposed reasons for these shortcomings are twofold. First, the
existing model does not account for changes in risk factors—e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure (BP), etc.—that
occur with age-related declines in vascular function and/or the use of preventive therapies. Second, the existing
model does not account for social determinants of health (SDOH) and other non-clinical factors that have been
shown to improve risk prediction across diverse population groups. Without addressing these issues, a vital
tool for CVD prevention will remain suboptimal and opportunities to reduce the development of CVD in adults
who are at greatest risk of disease will remain urgent and unmet. Our central hypothesis is that CVD risk
prediction and its translation to disease prevention can be greatly improved in older adults by synchronizing
age-related changes among multiple established risk factors while accounting for SDOH and other factors that
contribute to CVD risks. Using nationally-representative data (Health and Retirement Study [HRS]) and pooled
community-based cohorts (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC], Cardiovascular Health Study [CHS],
Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis [MESA], Framingham [FHS] Original, and FHS Offspring), our aims are
threefold: First, we will use group-based trajectory models to classify age-related changes within and among
the major risk factors for CVD in a nationally-representative sample of older adults (65+). Results will then be
validated with external (pooled cohort) data to identify the most efficient and robust classifications of age-related
changes among the multiple established risk factors. Second, we will predict the onset of CVD based on the
multi-trajectory profiles of risk factors. By accounting for changes in risk factors and trajectory group-membership
with advancing age, this approach will mirror a real-world clinical setting where follow-up measures become
available during routine care and a patient’s changes in risk factors translate into greater (or lesser) risks for a
CVD event. Third, we will examine a wide array of socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors to
identify SDOH and other key factors related to individual risk profiles and CVD outcomes. The major aims of
this proposal are highly aligned with the National Institutes of Health’s (NIH) mission to better understand the
interdisciplinary dynamics of aging to prevent disease in older adults. Our study responds to this call by using
multiple datasets and innovative methods to optimize CVD risk assessment in older adults. With this integrated
new knowledge, our study will have significant potential to better inform the design, targeting, and timing of
clinical interventions to improve the primary prevention of CVD in a diverse and aging U.S. population."

Meiosis is a specialized set of cell divisions that produce haploid gametes. During meiosis I (MI) in females,
bipolar spindle formation and positioning within the oocyte must be regulated tightly to ensure faithful
chromosome segregation and proper genome inheritance. In somatic mitotic cells, bipolar spindle formation
and positioning rely on a centrosome pair, each of which contains two centrioles. Interestingly, meiotic oocytes
lack centrioles and, hence, lack classic centrosomes. Meiotic oocytes, instead, contain numerous microtubule
(MT) organizing centers (MTOCs) that are organized, by largely unknown mechanisms, to establish two
spindle poles (polar MTOCs). The traditional view was that, in mammalian oocytes, MTs (and their associated
proteins) are the only cytoskeletal components responsible for organizing such MTOC spindles. However,
recent data suggest that F-actin is also involved in spindle bipolarity regulation. How F-actin interacts with MTs
to regulate polar MTOC organization during MI represents a critical gap in our understanding of how the
meiotic spindle is built. We recently identified a novel, functionally different, class of MTOCs (mcMTOCs) and
found that spindle maintenance at the oocyte center is regulated by two opposing forces (mcMTOC-mediated
MTs vs. F-actin). We also recently observed that ~50% of spindles are not assembled centrally. To date, such
peripheral spindle assembly was unobservable owing to technical limitations associated with spindle
fluorescence (i.e. live imaging). To circumvent this, we generated a Cep192-eGfp reporter mouse model
enabling spindle tracking wherever it is assembled. Strikingly, peripheral spindle formation is typically followed
by spindle migration towards the center – a previously undocumented phenomenon. Understanding the
molecular mechanisms regulating this corrective developmental event represents a major gap in our
knowledge of meiotic spindle spatiotemporal regulation during MI. This proposal lays the foundations for our
long-term goal: To understand how two critical events during MI — bipolar spindle assembly and positioning —
are regulated, in the absence of centrioles, to ensure faithful chromosome segregation. To do so, we will utilize
state-of-the-art approaches, including transgenic mouse models, genetic constructs, laser ablation, and
cutting-edge imaging, to tackle three critical goals: (i) determine how F-actin interacts with MTs to organize
polar MTOCs during bipolar spindle building, (ii) establish the mechanism(s) by which the peripheral
acentriolar spindle migrates to the oocyte center, and (iii) determine whether differences in biochemical
compositions of mcMTOCs vs. polar MTOCs underlie their functional differences. Given that chromosome
segregation errors (very common during MI) lead to aneuploidy, the leading genetic cause of developmental
disorders and miscarriage, these studies have the potential to significantly advance our basic understanding of
two fundamental processes — spindle formation and positioning — during MI whilst simultaneously shedding
light on why MI is notoriously error prone."

11166891,"Abstract:
It has been well documented that disease activity in inflammatory mucosal diseases including inflammatory
bowel disease is linked to the transepithelial migration of neutrophils through the mucosal epithelium and
ultimately into the intestinal lumen. Co-incident with massive luminal influx of neutrophils is uncontrolled release
of toxic tissue damaging metabolites that contribute to mucosal and/or transmural injury including edema, loss
of goblet cells, decreased mucus production, crypt cell hyperplasia, ulceration and crypt abscess formation. The
complex signaling mechanisms that regulate neutrophil transepithelial migration and inflammatory function in
mucosal tissues have not been fully elucidated even though excessive neutrophil activation is heavily implicated
in disease pathology of IBD and other inflammatory disorders. Preliminary data identifies the tyrosine
phosphatase CD45 as an important regulator of neutrophil intestinal infiltration and inflammatory function. This
proposal will determine effects of neutrophil specific loss of CD45 on intestinal inflammation and repair using
novel neutrophil specific CD45 deficient mice. We will also determine how CD45 phosphatase activity regulates
neutrophil intracellular signaling pathways and inflammatory effector functions including migration,
degranulation, and superoxide release. Finally using specific antibodies and glycan binding proteins we will
determine how specific CD45 isoforms and glycoforms can be targeted to regulate neutrophil activation and
inflammatory responses. Elucidating beneficial effects of targeting neutrophil CD45 phosphatase activity during
colitis will help to develop novel strategies to ameliorate pathological intestinal inflammation."

The goal of the KIDney Single cell and Spatial Molecular Atlas Project (KIDSSMAP) is to create an anatomical
and molecular “metaverse” of the human kidney. KIDSSMAP will accomplish this by generating multiscalar,
multidimensional and multimodal maps of the adult non-diseased human kidney at a single cell resolution. This
work will build on and extend the existing efforts of the investigative team through the first phase of HuBMAP.
We will specifically focus on micro functional tissue units (FTUs) and structures that are along the cortico-
medullary axis of the kidney. The technologies generating data include paired single nucleus chromatin
accessibility and RNA expression (snRNA/ATAC-seq -cell type and state diversity), smFISH and DART-FISH
(targeted high resolution spatial interrogation of 30-1000 transcripts), spatial transcriptomics (untargeted
genome wide spatial mapping of dissociative technologies), CODEX (multiplexed spatial protein interrogation
to bridge with RNA technologies and 3D IF technologies), 3D multiplexed immunofluorescence (3D IF-
subcellular resolution to define neighborhoods in microFTUs), lightsheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM-
anatomical maps at mesoscale of key and 3D maps of neurovascular associations with FTUs) and Scattering
Raman Spectroscopy (SRS-2D, 3D label free volumetric mapping at subcellular scale). The maps generated
will define quantitative metrics of cell diversity, spatial defined neighborhoods across wide scales for different
types of analytes interrogated by a diverse set of single call based and spatial technologies encompassing
chromatin states, gene expression, protein, extracellular matrix, metabolites and lipids ranging from subcellular
to volumetric meso and anatomic scale. These will be further augmented by characterizing biologically diverse
(sex, age, race) samples. These tasks will be accomplished through a KIDney Organ Specific Project
(KIDOSP) and a KIDney Data Analysis Center (KIDDAC), with their outputs, milestones and delivery to the
HIVE centrally managed. KIDSSMAP is formed by the alliance of investigators who have extensive expertise in
kidney tissue interrogation, spatial mapping and data integration. The investigators have a track record of
contributing to large consortia such as HuBMAP and KPMP through fruitful and collaborative interactions. By
mapping the human kidney with its diverse functional units at high resolution and large scale, KDSSMAP will
generate a valuable resource for the community to understand kidney health and disease."

The Eunice Kennedy Shriver NICHD Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network is a
collaboration between fourteen Clinical Centers, the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and the
NICHD. Each clinical center is led by a Center Principal Investigator who is experienced in
perinatal research and completion of both observational studies and clinical trials. Each clinical
center also has a full-time Research Coordinator dedicated only to MFMU Network studies.
Robust clinical research infrastructure is maintained to ensure successful participation in all
MFMU studies.
The purpose of the Parent And Infant Registry (PAIR) is to collect linked baseline and outcome
data for high-risk preterm pregnant persons and their infants. These data will be collected in a
uniform manner from medical records of pregnant persons and infants admitted to hospitals
participating in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development (NICHD) Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units Network (MFMU) and Neonatal Research
Network (NRN).
The aims of this project are to:
Aim 1: Obtain screening information on all pregnant people hospitalized during periviable
gestations.
Aim 2: Describe outcomes of pregnant persons who deliver during the periviable window with
linked neonatal outcomes.
Aim 3: Capture data on periviable antepartum stillbirths, which are not currently captured in any
Network registry.
Aim 4: Describe the incidence, timing, and outcomes of periviable antenatal counseling.

11138533,"The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is a large surface lined by a single layer epithelium which is exposed
to trillions of microbes and innocuous substances from the diet. The largest collection of immune
cells in the body underlies this single layer epithelium and monitors the luminal contents to
maintain tolerance to dietary and commensal antigens in the steady-state while retaining the
ability to rapidly induce immunity to pathogens during infection. While great progress has been
made in elucidating the role(s) of specific immune cell subsets, cytokines, and other factors
promoting tolerance or immunity, the processes intrinsic to the gut that enable the immune system
to switch from an overwhelmingly tolerogenic tone in the steady-state to inflammatory responses
during infection remains a gap in our understanding. Recently, we have uncovered that inhibiting
goblet cell associated antigen passages (GAPs) in the small intestine (SI) rapidly shifts the
immunologic tone away from tolerance and promotes the rapid induction of inflammatory Th17
responses in the absence of infection or injury. We hypothesize that the inhibition of GAPs is a
physiologic response to enteric infection, which in and of itself, promotes the generation of Th17
cells and inflammatory cytokines and shifts the tone of the immune system away from tolerance
toward immunity. By studying this process in the absence of enteric infection or injury we can
disentangle contributions of the pathogen and injury to the inflammatory response from intrinsic
properties of the gut ecosystem promoting the switch from a tolerogenic to pro-inflammatory state.
Understanding intrinsic properties of the gut that allows the rapid generation of protective
responses could provide new approaches to treat enteric infections and provide insight into the
pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases of the gut. We hypothesize that when SI GAPs
are inhibited, other pathways take over driving the development and/or expansion of Th17 cells
specific for dietary, microbial, and/or self antigens, which shifts the tone of the immune system to
provide enhanced protection during enteric infection and/or injury. To explore this hypothesis we
propose the following specific aims: In aim 1 we will identify the early events resulting in Th17
expansion following SI GAP inhibition, in aim 2 we will define the origins and specificities of the
Th17 cells that expand when SI GAPs are inhibited in aim 3 we will determine if the inhibition of
SI GAPs is protective in models of enteric infection and whether inappropriate inhibition of SI
GAPs potentiates intestinal inflammatory disease."
11159267,"Project Summary
Among neurological disorders, the fastest growing is now Parkinson's disease (PD), surpassing Alzheimer's dis-
ease. PD manifests as a heterogeneous clinical syndrome and this variability in the clinical phenotype highlights
the need to tailor the type and/or the dosage of treatment to the speciﬁc and changing needs of individuals living
with PD. The main goal of individualized, or precision, medicine is to use patient characteristics to determine
an individualized treatment strategy (ITS) to promote wellness. Due to the complex nature of PD coupled with
phenotypic heterogeneity, formulating successful individualized approaches to medical care is a complex prob-
lem that may beneﬁt from a more data-driven approach. One of the challenges in developing reliable ITSs is
that the analyses require studies with fairly large sample sizes and longitudinal assessment of subjects over a
relatively long period of time. The data set must also include various prescribing patterns to allow the analytic
method to learn the effects of different treatment sequences (strategies). These important requirements preclude
investigators from using data from a single clinical study to construct data-driven ITSs.
Existing guidelines for symptomatic drug therapy for PD can best be described as ""permissive"". The relative
lack of comparative evidence for different classes of drugs has created challenges in devising recommendations
to follow any speciﬁc therapeutic strategy. We ﬁll this important gap by proposing a two phase study. The ﬁrst
phase (R61) focuses on creating a harmonized and curated dataset by integrating data from six clinical trials and
the PPMI observational study that, in aggregate, involved 4,705 patients followed from 23.5 to 96 months. To
the best of our knowledge, such comprehensive data harmonization has not been done before in PD and it can
provide an excellent source of information for future studies as well. In the second phase (R33), we will leverage
the harmonized data set to develop high quality ITSs for PD with respect to several clinical outcomes including
UPDRS score, quality of life, and Schwab and England (SE) ADL measured at 24 and 48 months of follow-up.
Speciﬁcally, the goals of the R33 phase are to (Aim 1) compare commonly used sequences of drug classes for
PD; (Aim 2) identify the best individualized treatment strategies to inform optimal sequences of drug classes for
PD. In pursuit of these aims, we will propose robust, rigorous and computationally efﬁcient statistical machine
learning methods for constructing data-driven optimal ITSs for PD. The proposal expands the scope of existing
methods in developing ITSs by relaxing certain unrealistic assumptions and through the use of ﬂexible modeling
techniques (e.g., machine learning methods) while maintaining valid statistical inference. These new methods
will be integrated into easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language (Aim 3). This will maximize
the adoption of the proposed methodology by other investigators and allow researchers to analyze other PD
datasets with a goal of constructing an ITS for PD. Furthermore, because the methods are not disease-speciﬁc,
our methods and software will enable similar exploration for other diseases."

The objective of this proposal is to validate and disseminate realistic anthropomorphic phantoms to strengthen
quantitative imaging for radiopharmaceutical therapies (RPTs). RPTs have shown promise in treating various
cancers, but the need to accurately measure the absorbed dose in radiosensitive organs remains important.
Imaging provides a mechanism to perform such quantification, and given the strong interest, multiple imaging
technologies are being developed for theranostics purposes. However, a key challenge is the validation of these
imaging technologies. Physical phantom-based studies provide a reliable means for conducting such
evaluations. However, current phantoms lack realism, patient anatomy representation, variability in patient sizes,
and sub-system resolution assessment. To overcome these limitations, as part of our parent R01, we are
developing phantoms that use resin-based three-dimensional printing to create anatomically accurate models
based on patient scans. This approach improves the reliability and realism of validation methods for advanced
imaging techniques in RPT, benefiting patient care. Given the strong interest in RPTs across industry, academia,
and clinics, multiple groups would benefit from availability of these phantoms. Thus, in this proposal, our goal is
to validate these phantoms in multi-scanner and multi-center settings, and simultaneously develop robust
protocols for the use of these phantoms, for wider dissemination of this technology. This proposal is thus strongly
aligned with the goals of NOT-EB-24-009. We propose to validate our phantoms across multiple scanners at
Washington University, as well as multiple centers including Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Upstate
Medical Center and M D Anderson Cancer Center and incorporate the feedback received to refine both the
phantoms and our protocols. The resulting library of phantoms and protocols will then be deposited to the
NIST/NIBIB Imaging Phantom Lending Library for wider use by the community. In addition to providing a
mechanism for rigorous validation of imaging methods for theranostics with conventional reconstruction-based
approaches, these phantoms facilitate the quantitative assessment of imaging systems and algorithms at sub-
resolution levels, including the innovative projection domain quantification tools we have implemented via our
parent R01, driving advancements in imaging science. Overall, this project has the potential to impact the fields
of quantitative imaging and theranostics."
11160244,"Optimizing Singlet Oxygen Dosimetry for Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)
Abstract
The overall objective of this project is to optimize clinical singlet oxygen (1O2) dosimetry (SOD) via three
complementary and competing technologies: time-resolved singlet oxygen luminescence dosimetry (TSOLD),
multispectral singlet oxygen luminescence dosimetry (MSOLD), and singlet oxygen explicit dosimetry (SOED).
The TSOLD instrument is optical fiber-based and achieves ultralow noise detection via infrared time-correlated
single-photon counting. It can be used before and after PDT to measure cytotoxic 1O2 concentration ([1O2])
generation in tumor based on its 1270 nm luminescence emission, since it utilizes a short (ns) pulsed laser for
1O2 excitation that is independent of the PDT treatment laser. The recently developed MSOLD instrument
measures the luminescence spectrum of singlet oxygen excited by the treatment light, it is thus capable of
monitoring [1O2] during PDT without interfering with the treatment. However, unlike TSOLD, MSOLD may
introduce additional uncertainty in [1O2] due to a phosphorescence background orders of magnitude larger than
the singlet oxygen signal. The SOED instrument can be used in-vivo during PDT in real-time to measure reacted
1O2 generated by the treatment light based on explicit measurement of the light fluence rate, tissue oxygen
concentration, and photosensitizer concentration. The TSOLD or MSOLD signals will be used as an input to the
SOED system to make it more robust to account for the local oxygen microenvironment. Here, the immediate
clinical translation is to compare and determine the most suitable combination of the three technologies for SOD
by measurements at multiple sites in patients undergoing intrapleural PDT for malignant pleural mesothelioma,
which has shown significant potential in Photofrin-mediated clinical trials at UPenn. In addition, comparison will
be made in photosensitizer solutions, tissue-simulating phantoms, and tumors in vivo under well-controlled
conditions across a wide range of treatment conditions. Correlation of the tumor response with the1O2
measurements will be evaluated for three clinical photosensitizers (Photofrin, BPD, and ALA) in preclinical
models. The SOED instrument will be used at the same time and locations to calculate the “explicit” light-drug-
oxygen dose parameters as well as the tissue optical properties. The latter will be used to correct the measured
1O2 signal for light attenuation in order to calculate, the absolute concentration of the cytotoxic agent. The explicit
dose parameters will be used as inputs for SOED in an established macroscopic biophysical model to predict
the instantaneous and cumulative singlet oxygen concentration ([1O2]) for comparison with TSOLD and MSOLD
results, respectively. The outcome of this project will be the determination of the optimal combination
(TSOLD/MSOLD/SOED) for SOD in an ongoing PDT mesothelioma clinical trial under clinically-relevant
conditions. We hypothesize that quantitative SOD will be significantly more predictive of PDT efficacy than the
explicit or implicit (photobleaching-based) techniques used at present. Moreover, we hypothesize that the
optimized SOD system will give real-time feedback so that treatment can be personalized."
11142677,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this proposal is to identify the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying photoreceptor
degeneration caused by mutations in ADAM9 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 9) in human and canine
patients. Previous work in mouse and canine models has revealed that loss of ADAM9 leads to disruptions in the
interface between the photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Preliminary data
for this proposal reveal a substantial accumulation of extracellular material from the interphotoreceptor matrix at
this interface. Given the well-established roles of ADAM proteins as both proteases and cell adhesion molecules,
this project will explore two not mutually exclusive hypotheses: (1) ADAM9 functions as a protease regulating the
composition of the interphotoreceptor matrix and (2) ADAM9 functions as a cell adhesion molecule forming
contacts between the photoreceptor outer segments and RPE. These hypotheses will be tested using a variety of
genetically modified ADAM9 mouse models. In Aim 1 of the mentored phase, the global ADAM9 knockout mouse
will be comprehensively characterized using a variety of techniques that will provide new training opportunities to
the candidate. In Aim 2 of the mentored phase, the candidate will train in high-end proteomic techniques to
analyze the composition of the interphotoreceptor matrix on both qualitative and quantitative levels.
In the independent phase, this training will be applied to test two complementary hypotheses on the function of
ADAM9 in the retina. Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that ADAM9 proteolyzes interphotoreceptor matrix
components, whereas Aim 4 will explore the hypothesis that ADAM9 functions as a cell adhesion molecule. Given
that ADAM9 is expressed by both photoreceptors and the RPE, the experiments in Aim 5 will identify the cell type
primarily responsible for ADAM9-associated pathology. Taken together, the proposed studies will guide future
therapeutic efforts for cone-rod dystrophy patients bearing ADAM9 mutations. Additionally, given the critical
roles of the interphotoreceptor matrix in supporting the integrity of the outer retina and retinal adhesion to the
RPE, this proposal will provide broader insights into retinal diseases such as retinal detachment and some
forms of retinitis pigmentosa. The training in experimental approaches provided by the proposed research will
be supplemented with career development training at Duke University, including formal coursework, in both
communication skills as well as mentoring and leadership skills. The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Vadim
Arshavsky, a leader in the field of retinal cell biology and a highly accomplished mentor who has successfully
launched the careers of over a dozen faculty members, most of whom are funded by the NIH. Ultimately, this
training will allow the candidate to achieve his long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator
studying the biology of the visual system and pathophysiology of retinal disease."

Early intervention is critical for inhibiting progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related neurodegenerative
disorders. Cis phosphorylated Thr231-Pro tau (cis P-tau) has been implicated as an early and pathogenic tau
conformation driving neurodegeneration in AD, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and vascular dementia (VaD). In this
proposal, I will explore how TBI and cerebral hypoperfusion lead to cis P-tau induction, and how neurons
potentially antagonize cis P-tau and other forms of early tau pathology through a mounted transcriptional
response in the excitatory neurons. From an unbiased genetic screen, JNK3 has emerged as the first kinase
directly phosphorylating cis tau and recognizing the proline in the unusual cis conformation. In addition, single-
cell transcriptomic profile and extensive preliminary data consistently support that a REST driven neuronal
response may antagonize this cis proline directed proteotoxicity during the prodromal period after brain injuries.
The goals of the proposal are to determine the extent to which JNK3 induces cis P-tau and neurodegeneration
in TBI/VaD mice and patients (Aim1, K99 phase), to determine if early induced REST inhibits cis P-tau and/or
confers neuroprotection in culture, TBI/VaD mice and patients (Aim2, K99+R00 phase) and to evaluate the
therapeutic potential of early JNK3 inhibition and rescue of REST expression in the chronic stage in TBI/VaD
mice (Aim3, R00 phase). In the mentored K99 phase, the research goal is to determine the extent of JNK3 and
REST functions in modulating cis P-tau while receiving training. In R00 phase, the research goal is to unbiasedly
and rigorously evaluate the therapeutic potential of modulating cis P-tau by perturbing JNK3 and REST at
different stages of TBI and VaD mouse models. The short-term career goal is to receive multidisciplinary training
from experts in the field, to complete the proposed studies, to apply for the first NIH R01 grant and to establish
a research program to study mechanisms related to the induction and modulation of cis P-tau, a robust, early
and druggable driver of neurodegeneration in TBI, VaD and AD. The long-term career goal is to direct a lab to
discover and study early mechanisms of onset of age-related neurodegenerative disorders. The training-oriented
Yankner lab, multidisciplinary advisory committee team and the highly collaborative and resourceful environment
in the Harvard Medical School Department of Genetics offer the diverse technical and professional training in
line with this goal."

Research and training in organic synthesis impacts all fields of science that require the design and construction
of molecular architecture. This project will advance catalytic methods, including hydroacylation and
hydroamination, as attractive and powerful tools for chemical synthesis. The coupling methods proposed are
modern and innovative because they rely on common functional groups (e.g., aldehydes, amines) to generate
new carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bonds from unsaturated partners (e.g., styrenes, dienes,
cyclopropenes), with high selectivity and atom economy. Through experimental and theoretical studies, this
project will yield fundamental insights into the mechanism of various transition metal catalysts, including rhodium,
cobalt, and copper. Beyond catalysis and mechanistic studies, we plan to build chemical motifs of high
significance to the field of drug discovery. We target privileged motifs (e.g., chiral nitrogen-containing
heterocycles) and explore chemical space (e.g., tricyclic cages bearing high sp3 character). Through
partnerships with experts in other fields, we address exciting challenges in fluorescent microscopy, NMR
spectroscopy, and cancer immunotherapy by designing functional molecules. This project demonstrates
innovation in making molecules at the interface of catalysis, medicinal chemistry, and biology."
11144684,"Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) represent highly understudied conditions, but have tremendous impact on patient morbidity and mortality. Among CAKUT categories, congenital obstructive uropathy (COU) represents a common and severe form of malformation.
Recent technological improvements and advances in clinical testing have resulted in increased detection rates of congenital anomalies during pregnancy, but our ability to provide prognostication and care has lagged behind given limited ability to provide an etiological diagnosis and its associated risk for negative outcome in the postnatal life. In fact, depending on the severity and/or co-occurrence of other perturbations in development, COU can lead to significant morbidity and mortality after birth, and may require early surgical interventions to reduce the risk of progression to kidney failure. Despite medical and surgical management of urinary obstruction after birth, COU patients can rapidly progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring dialysis or transplantation and we are currently very limited in our ability to prognosticate this outcome. Moreover, a significant fraction of COU patients present with extra-urinary disease that is not detectable by standard prenatal imaging or clinical studies, but that impose significant added morbidity and mortality later in life. Our ability to provide adequate prenatal care, risk stratification, counselling and family planning, is again severely inadequate in this respect. Therefore, when facing with prenatal imaging of fetal anomalies, families are presented with limited options, which might include decision regarding termination of pregnancy. This is particularly sensitive because of its legislation, and often families with COU are left with difficult decisions to make.
Genetics has the potential to aid in the ascertainment of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of COU patients. However, genetic discoveries in COU lag behind when compared to other congenital anomalies due to small and heterogeneous cohorts that have been subjected to genetic testing until now. Here we propose a new comprehensive human genetic program designed to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of COU with a major final goal to improve risk stratification for urinary and extra-urinary disease, in order to facilitate family planning and counseling, prognosis, and, eventually, treatment. Specifically for this R56 mechanism, we will conduct the first GWAS for common variants in non-Mendelian COU."

11139765,"Our proposed research focuses on defining factors that limit antibiotic sensitivity of the chronic pathogen Heli-
cobacter pylori. Evidence suggests that chronic H. pylori is difficult to cure with antibiotics because it is in a
slow growth state controlled at least in part by stomach acid. H. pylori treatments rely on removing acid by in-
cluding strong antacids called proton pump inhibitors (PPI). The PPI blocks acid production, raises the stom-
ach pH, and promotes H. pylori growth. Bacterial growth allows standard antibiotics to work better. There is a
gap in our understanding of the exact nature of the H. pylori chronic growth state, e.g. how active its metabo-
lism is, whether acid is the only growth inhibitor, and what type of metabolism H. pylori deploys to grow after
PPI treatment. This information is important because H. pylori infections are treated at the chronic state. Mil-
lions of people worldwide and in the U.S. are infected by H. pylori and suffer from its associated diseases—
ulcers and gastric cancer. Gastric cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. H. pylori is an
on-going problem, as the incidence has stabilized in the developed world. Furthermore, current therapies to
cure H. pylori infection fail with unacceptable frequency: recent estimates in the United States have found that
20-25% of infected individuals are not cured by the current therapeutic regime. The overall objective of this ap-
plication is to understand the H. pylori chronic growth state and use this information to design approaches that
enhance growth and therefore antibiotic sensitivity. Our central hypothesis, based on published and preliminary
data, is that the majority of chronic-state H. pylori are in an extreme slow growth mode, limited by a
combination of acid, translational deficiency, and nutrient restriction. In Aim 1, we will use a combination of H.
pylori mutants and mouse models to fill gaps in our understanding of the H. pylori chronic growth state and
growth rate, how these parameters are affected by PPI, and whether post-PPI multiplication requires lactate
utilization as early stage multiplication does. Additionally, we test whether increasing key carbon sources like
lactate enhances H. pylori chronic state growth and antibiotic cure. In Aim 2, we build on preliminary data
showing slow growth H. pylori display significant translational repression, including by increase in the riboso-
mal silencing factor RsfS. We use molecular biology and biochemistry to fill gaps in our understanding of RsfS
function in general, and to characterize how controlled RsfS expression, as well as other translational inhibi-
tors, controls translation and affect chronic colonization. The proposed research is innovative in its hypothesis
that H. pylori chronic slow growth is promoted by signals in addition to acid, and that knowing and targeting
these will promote better cures. The proposed research is significant because it will provide new insights into
ways that chronic growth is controlled and provide new ways to enhances H. pylori antibiotic sensitivity. The
long-term outcomes generated by this research will provide insights that will lay the groundwork for improved
therapies that push these microbes into an antibiotic-sensitive state."
11139766,"Summary: Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, with
significant morbidity and a median life expectancy in the mid-forties. Although SCD can be cured by allogeneic
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT), this treatment strategy has substantial limitations and is
only available to ~15% of patients. CRISPR/Cas9 based genome-editing strategies for treating SCD have been
developed by either correcting the sickle mutation in β-globin (HBB) gene or disrupting the BCL11A erythroid
enhancer in patients’ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Multiple clinical trials using gene
editing strategies have received FDA approval, and the Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT03745287) by Vertex
Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics has shown promise. We have discovered recently that
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing can induce unintended large gene modifications, such as large deletions,
insertions and complex local rearrangements, at the Cas9 on-target cut-site. Our results show that large
deletions of up to several thousand bases occurred with high frequencies at/near the Cas9 on-target cut-sites
on the HBB (11.7-35.4%), HBG (14.3%), and BCL11A (13.2%) genes respectively in HSPCs from patients with
SCD. However, the persistence and biological consequences of these large gene modifications are largely
unknown, the mechanisms of generating large deletions and insertions remain elusive, and no method is
available to reduce the unwanted large gene modifications. There is an unmet need to determine the clinical
implications of the unintended large gene modifications in gene-edited SCD HSPCs. The central hypothesis of
the proposed research is that a good understanding of the persistence and functional consequences of
unintended large gene modifications and the ability to control them will increase the efficacy and safety of
gene-editing based treatment of SCD. In Aim 1 studies we will determine the ineffective maturation and HbF
induction due to large gene modification in gene edited SCD HSPCs by performing SMRT-seq and single-cell
RNA analysis. In Aim 2 we will determine the persistence of large gene modifications in HBB and BCL11A
alleles after engraftment of gene-edited SCD HSPCs into mice and patients undergoing CRISPR/Cas9 gene-
editing based SCD clinical trials. In Aim 3 we will develop strategies to minimize the detrimental large deletions
by establishing a better understanding of the competition between different DNA damage repair pathways and
designing and optimizing ssODN templates and short gRNAs as blockers. These studies will address an unmet
need in the therapeutic genome editing field and facilitate the translation of genome editing based SCD
treatment into clinical practice."

With the additional funding of this administrative supplement, we will complete projects that
achieve the full extent of the research initially designated for a 5-year period.
Project 1. COVID-19 infection and vaccination in autoimmunity (Sanz and Lee)
We will complete additional single cell analysis of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells and ASC in the
context of booster vaccination and breakthrough infection, to add power to the initial analysis
proposed for 20 total patients. We will analyze an additional 24 patients similarly split between
booster and vaccination in healthy control and SLE (N=6 per group). In this validation cohort, we
will perform single cell ATAC-seq analysis to integrate transcriptional and epigenetic regulatory
programs. We will also analyze the contribution of B cell and ASC to the pathogenesis of long-
COVID using antigen-specific flow cytometry and MENSA assays of the antibodies produced by
contemporaneous antibody-secreting cells derived from a validation cohort of PASC patents and
controls. As before, we will recruit PASC patients at least 90 days after resolution of the acute
infection for both healthy controls and patients with SLE (N=60 each); COVID-19 recovered
patients (N=30 from HC and SLE each); and 30 patients with stable SLE. This design will allow
us to understand the degree of anti-viral reactivity and autoreactivity in the different groups in
order to define the contributions of these features to long-COVID.
Project 3. Regulation of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in cancer patients (Ahmed and Dhodapkar)
We will expand our study on NSCLC patients to determine the impact of PD-1 targeted
immunotherapy on the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses, and we will longitudinally examine the
functionality of SARS-CoV-2 specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in NSCLC patients responding to
antigen re-exposure. We will further characterize the B cell and T cell responses of patients
with different lymphomas and undergoing different treatments to better understand their immune
response to vaccines, and we will evaluate the immune responses to booster vaccines in MM
patients receiving bispecific antibodies."

The erythroid iron restriction response suppresses erythropoiesis during iron deprivation and leads to iron deficiency anemia (IDA), one of the most common nutritional disorders in the world. This response differs among individuals such that a similar degree of iron deficiency can lead to variable degrees of anemia within a population. The heterogeneity of this response has implications for patient management in several settings: phlebotomy for polycythemia vera, intravenous (IV) iron for anemia of renal failure, donation frequency for red cell donors. Factors that contribute to this variability are unknown. Delineating pathways that modulate the erythroid iron restriction response between individuals will enable superior calibration of iron-targeting therapies and guide novel therapeutic strategies. a-Synuclein, outside its neural role, has been known as an erythroid factor; in mature human RBC it represents the 13th most abundant protein. It interacts with iron and regulates iron trafficking proteins. Red cell a-synuclein in normal human donors assumes multiple physical forms and varies markedly in its levels among individuals (>2-fold). A direct modifier of a-synuclein self-assembly consists of dopamine, and loading of dopamine occurs in red cells. Strikingly, no clear function for -synuclein or dopamine has been established in erythropoiesis. We addressed whether -synuclein affects the erythroid iron deprivation response by comparing Snca+/- and +/+ littermates on control vs low iron diets. These experiments model the ~2-fold variation seen in human populations. No hematologic differences existed between +/- and +/+ mice on control diet. However, strong differences occurred with the low iron diet: Snca+/- mice had a blunted iron restriction response reflected in the red cell counts/indices, platelet levels, and serum erythropoietin levels. No differences were seen in serum hepcidin levels at baseline or with iron perturbations. Mining a red cell metabolomic dataset from human blood donors -/+ iron deficiency revealed dopamine as the top metabolite downregulated in red cells in association with iron deficiency anemia. We then found that low-dose dopamine treatment of ex vivo cultured human erythroid progenitors reversed the growth-inhibitory effects of iron deprivation. Our findings thus show: 1) an in vivo influence of -synuclein dosage only in the setting of iron deficiency, 2) an in vivo decrease in erythroid dopamine associated with iron deficiency, and 3) a pro-erythroid influence of dopamine in ex vivo erythroid cultures. We therefore propose a pathway in which iron regulates erythropoiesis via dopamine modulation of -synuclein status. This project will elucidate unexplored features of the iron restriction response, features with potential to guide future treatment approaches."
11142842,"The female reproductive system, the uterus, fallopian tubes and the ovaries, is a complex interrelated set
of organs that is physiologically dynamic and not only important for fertility but critically interrelated with
general health. Single cell studies of the human female reproductive system and related tissues have
been previously studied, but, as of yet, a comprehensive program, aligned with the goals of the
HuBMAP, to define a molecular map of the entire system, integrating multi-modal assays, spatial
diversity, and individual variations has not been established. The Penn Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology performs approximately 3,500 surgical procedures annually, of which many procedures
allow sampling of multiple organs and locations from the same subject under normal conditions. Here,
we propose to leverage the sampling opportunities afforded by the Penn ObGyn group and the single
cell biology expertise of Penn investigators to establish a Penn Center for Multi-scale Molecular Map of
the Female Reproductive System. We will obtain a comprehensive molecular characterization of the
female reproductive system using six different molecular assays for at least ~700 tissue samples in
anatomically indexed samples, creating a key resource for both basic science and women’s health. The
molecular assays include single cell RNAseq, clampFISH spatial transcriptomics, simultaneous single
cell open chromatin and RNA assays, and spatial open chromatin assay, among others. We will also
generate a 3D anatomical model to provide spatial coordinate for our molecular characterization. All
assay data will be registered to our 3D anatomical map that will be integrated with the HIVE Common
Coordinate Framework. All metadata from subject records, clinical procedures, molecular procedures,
and informatics pipelines will be collected, curated, and deposited as structured data. All data, including
an extensive set of metadata, will be made available as a public resource. The completion of this
resource will impact reproductive medicine for women’s health and also inform basic biology of human

The Center for Viral Systems Biology (CViSB) produces vast amounts of rapidly changing, heterogeneous
systems biology data, creating a challenge in managing, tracking, and sharing data. The goal of the Data
Management and Bioinformatics (DMB) Core is to promote the reuse and understanding of the large,
multidisciplinary systems biology data we generate and curate. We aim to release as much of our data
and results as possible, as quickly as possible, by managing, tracking, and monitoring all CViSB activities
and data assets and publishing them on our CViSB Data Portal, data.cvisb.org. To aid in the
understanding of these data, we will develop approaches to improve the accessibility and interpretability
of our data through innovative bioinformatics software and visualization tools. Lastly, we seek to engage
with the community to promote the adoption and adaptation of our data and tools and to proliferate
FAIR-sharing best practices throughout the Systems Biology community.
To accomplish these objectives and support the overall mission of CViSB, we have the following four
aims: (1) Maintain and expand open data platforms for real-time sharing, tracking, and analysis of diverse
host, pathogen, and contextual FAIR data; (2) Harden and extend open bioinformatics pipelines and
computational tools for predictive modeling of diverse systems biological datasets; (3) Develop novel
visualization tools to aid in the interpretation and analysis of complex, multi-dimensional infectious
disease datasets; (4) Promote data management and bioinformatics activities beyond CViSB. Our

Disruption of the central nervous system (CNS) by injury or neural device implantation results in glial cells
deprioritizing neuronal support functions and undergoing an adaptive reprogramming. This adaptive
reprogramming enables the acquisition of new functions by glial cells, allowing them to isolate and protect local,
spared neural tissue. Chronically, isolation of spared neural tissue can be counterproductive, limiting neural
regeneration and device integration. Therefore, it is critical to understand the mechanisms that regulate adaptive
reprogramming and to develop tools to modulate the intensity and duration of the adaptive reprogramming
response. I hypothesize that adaptive glial responses involve coordinated, multicellular, and temporally-
regulated programs that are conserved across injury and foreign body contexts which can be altered by specific
structural, mechanical, and surface chemistry properties of implanted biomaterials. To investigate this
hypothesis, I will develop glycan-derived biomaterials to (1) test the ability of inherently bioactive glycans to
stimulate glia-based repair following stroke, and (2) present unique chemical moieties and mechanical properties
to establish and characterize synthetic glial interfaces. This work will contribute to the development of
biomaterials for the CNS by creating a set of general principles that outline chemical motifs that can be used to
direct glial responses, allowing for enhanced therapeutic outcomes following CNS injury and increased longevity
of implanted neural devices."
11139212,"SenNet 2024 CODCC Supplement Abstract
The purpose of the Supplement is to further the CODCC Administrative Core (Sub-Section
C: Administrative Core: Including Consortium Coordination & Outreach) in three areas:
1. integration and expansion of murine activities and additional awards across the
consortium,
2. management and growth of the comprehensive, nationwide, undergraduate scientific
internship award program in cellular senescence,
3. expanding opportunities to gather, in person, the consortium and pharmaceutical
companies and related biotechnology businesses, focused on cellular senescence drug
discovery and manufacture.
Given the expansion of the consortium focused on murine and additional single cell data
platforms, additional support and coordination will be required to handle the rapid growth in
the development of the broader overall SenNet eco-system. This includes coordination with
other single cell platforms at a larger scale to best serve the expanded SenNet Consortium
adding substantive murine focus, combined murine and human foci, and the broader
research community.
Internships will allow learning valuable new skills across the scientific research spectrum
and gain experience in an educational lab environment. During the internship program,
students will conduct cutting-edge research, greatly expanding their knowledge of biology
and data analysis. Students will develop various skills throughout the summer.
CODCC received significant input in year two in working groups and from NIH regarding the
consortium’s interest in meeting in-person more often, and particularly in focused areas
among awards and outside parties with shared interest. These interests also cover
senescence biology relevant to pharmaceutical development and manufacture. Following
through on this will require additional management of meetings, workshop/panels/working
groups, & data-thons and hackathons. To achieve these aims will also require expansion of
communication and engagement to other common fund consortia, among the vendor
ecosystem, and to the public interested in the science of Cellular Senescence and its human
impact."
10755644,"The broad purpose of the research in this proposal is to understand how microenvironrnents (secondary coordination
spheres) about metal ions control function. A bio-inspired synthetic approach is utilized that incorporates principles of
molecular architecture found in the active sites of metalloproteins into synthetic systems. Multidentate ligands will be
developed that create rigid organic structures around metal ions and place hydrogen bond donors or acceptors proximal
to the metal centers, forming specific microenvironments. One distinguishing attribute of these systems is the ability to
make site-specific modifications to the structure in order to evaluate correlations between the microenvironment and
reactivity. A focus of this research is the examination of transient intermediates that are formed from the activation of
dioxygen and the oxidation of water - processes that are directly linked to the maintenance of human health and aging.
Long-term goals include developing structure-function relationships in metal-assisted oxidative catalysis.
Metalloproteins perform functions not yet achieved in synthetic systems. Our hypothesis is that the lack of control of the
secondary coordination sphere in synthetic compounds is a major obstacle in establishing the desired functions. Results
from structural biology show that hydrogen bonds within the secondary coordination spheres of metalloproteins are
instrumental in regulating function. Therefore, the function and dysfunction of health-related metalloproteins can be
understood in the context of changes in their microenvironrnents. However, it is still unclear, even in biomolecules, how
non-covalent interactions influence metal-mediated processes. Investigations into these effects require fundamental
reactivity and mechanistic studies in which the contributions of single components can be analyzed individually. We
have developed synthetic hydrogen bonding systems in which the molecular components that define the structure
around the metal ion are specifically controlled; in turn, this permits the formation of systems whose activity can be
tailored to a particular function. This ability to regulate the microenvironment allows for systematic studies into structure-
function relationships that lead to fundamental understanding of chemical processes. Ultimately, this research will
provide insights into the properties of biological catalysts and lead to new classes of synthetic catalysts that exhibit the
exquisite control over reactivity that is characteristic of metalloenzymes."

The primary objective of this proposal is to generate a scientific discovery program in pulmonary vascular disease
to ensure a robust pathway for Dr. Woodcock to develop into an independent research scientist. This objective
will be accomplished through a combination of active mentorship, didactic training, enrichment activities, and
research. The core of the research focuses on the role of RNA editing, a post-transcriptional regulation
mechanism, in pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a lethal disease without a cure. Early
apoptosis in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) is a key trigger for the development of PH. However,
there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the mechanisms or key factors controlling PAEC pathophenotypes
that drive this deadly disease, and no effective therapeutics exist for PH that target this key cell type.
Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is a double-stranded RNA editing enzyme that converts
adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) in genome-encoded RNA transcripts and plays a vital role in gene regulation and
cardiac function. However, the roles of ADAR1-mediated RNA editing in the regulation of pulmonary vascular
function are unknown. Our preliminary data indicate that ADAR1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of PAEC
survival and the cytosolic innate immunity response. To identify enriched genes in PAECs that are modified and
regulated by ADAR1 RNA editing activity, we recently performed in vitro RNA sequencing in ADAR1 knockdown
PAECs. From this analysis, we found that the circadian gene nocturnin (NOCT) contains two active ADAR1 RNA
editing sites. Non-edited NOCT transcript is stable and accumulates within PAECs lacking ADAR1 RNA editing.
Forced expression of NOCT upregulated key interferon transcriptional factor IRF7 and promoted apoptosis in
PAECs. NOCT knockout (KO) mice mitigated PH induced by hypoxia and IL6 exposure. Lastly, silenced NOCT
restored PAEC apoptosis and immunity response triggered by ADAR1 deficiency. In our pilot studies, we
explored key elements of this concept by showing that ADAR1 RNA editing can control NOCT expression to
regulate PAEC functions and PH. Given these findings, we hypothesize that ADAR1 RNA editing deficiency
promotes PH development due to induction of pulmonary artery endothelial cell apoptosis via aberrant NOCT-
driven innate immunity activation. This hypothesis will be addressed in the experiments of the following Specific
Aims: (1) to determine the role of NOCT in the innate immunity-dependent PAEC survival response; (2) to
determine the effect of ADAR1-specific RNA editing on NOCT expression and function in PAECs; and (3) to
define the impact of endothelial ADAR1 deficiency on NOCT-IFN signaling in PH in vivo. This novel mechanism
may have important implications for how RNA editing regulates PA endothelial functions related to PH
pathogenesis, and its elucidation will advance our understanding of PH development and ultimately lead to novel
strategies for developing effective therapeutics to treat PH. This project will provide me with advanced expertise
in RNA biology and pulmonary physiology that will strengthen my development into an independent investigator."

Aortopathies, including aneurysms, dissection, and rupture, represent a key challenge in HLBS
research. In the past twenty years of our continuously funded research on aortopathies, we
have contributed to many mechanistic insights into the aortopathy research including a new
concept: There are regional characteristics of the aorta in regard to diverse embryonic origins
and functions of cells. The overall hypothesis of this R35 program is that heterogeneity of
cellular origins imparts functional variances along the length of the aorta, including diversity of
extracellular matrix stability, which in turn contributes to regional specificity of aortopathies.
Regional specificity of aortopathies is present in many mouse models that we have validated
and characterized. Our initial single cell transcriptomic and proteomic data have also implicated
new potential contributors to heterogeneity of the normal aortic biology and aortopathies. Three
major themes are proposed in this program: (1) What are the structural and molecular
mechanisms that contribute to biological and pathophysiological heterogeneity along the length
of the aorta? (2) Are cellular and extracellular heterogeneity a basis for regional specificity of
aortopathies? (3) How do signaling pathways, extracellular matrix, and crosstalk between
resident aortic cells coordinate to promote the heterogeneity of aortopathies? We have robust
tools including a spectrum of reagents, multiple classic and new mouse models,
ultrasonography, MRI, intravital microscopy, proteomics, and single cell RNA sequencing
techniques. In addition to aortopathy research, the PI has more than 30-year expertise in the
fields of lipoprotein metabolism, inflammation, and atherosclerosis research. Aortopathies are
not a sole aortic disease, but is associated with a wide range of diseases or syndromes that
may affect skin, lung, kidney, brain, bone, and other organs. The proposed research program
will benefit from the flexibility to pursue potential contributions of other tissues and organs to
aortopathies, and vice versa the influences of aortopathies on other tissues and organs. This
R35 mechanism will also benefit the PI’s strength in basic research, enhance his interaction with
the translational research in the clinical arena, and train the next generation of scientists."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication that is routinely detected as part of standard
prenatal care. After delivery, women with GDM are 7 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than those
without GDM. National clinical guidelines thus urge completion of a 75-gram, 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test
(OGTT), given its superior sensitivity to detect diabetes, by 12 weeks postpartum. Clinical guidelines also
advise participation in an evidence-based lifestyle program for diabetes prevention. Yet uptake of this
recommended care remains low, and evidence from randomized trials on interventions to increase uptake
remains scarce. Here, we propose to test a novel, multi-component outreach intervention that explicitly targets
as-yet neglected, patient-level motivational and logistical barriers to engaging in preventive care during the
demanding postpartum period. We will leverage the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) to identify, in a
randomized factorial trial, which of four theory-driven components increase actual completion of postpartum
screening and enrollment in lifestyle programs for diabetes prevention: 1) a streamlined values affirmation, 2)
personalized information about diabetes risk, 3) an interactive motivational interviewing-based module, and 4)
an interactive action planning module. Each component is designed to be self-directed and delivered securely
online via existing infrastructure in a health system setting, increasing its future potential for large-scale reach.
In a racially and ethnically diverse sample of women with GDM within the Kaiser Permanente Northern
California (KPNC) health system, our specific aims are as follows. Aim 1: Identify which of four components of
the outreach intervention increase completion of a) a 75-gram, 2-hour OGTT within 4-12 weeks postpartum,
aligned with national clinical guidelines (primary outcome), and b) any postpartum diabetes screening test
(OGTT, fasting plasma glucose, or hemoglobin A1c) by 52 weeks postpartum (secondary outcome). Aim 2:
Identify which of four components of the outreach intervention increase enrollment in a health system- or
community-based lifestyle program for diabetes prevention by 52 weeks postpartum (secondary outcome). Aim
3: Determine whether each intervention component impacts its target mediator, as predicted by its respective
theory. We will efficiently and objectively assess screening outcomes via electronic health records. Results will
yield an optimized intervention ready to be tested in a future pragmatic trial to accelerate uptake of guideline-
recommended postpartum care for women with GDM, with the long-term goal of preventing diabetes in a
diverse and high-risk clinical population."
11159300,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The iron overload disorder hereditary hemochromatosis is an endocrine liver disease that results from an inability
to produce sufficient amounts of hepcidin, the iron-regulatory hormone produced by the liver. In
hemochromatosis, increased absorption of dietary iron leads to the appearance of plasma non-transferrin-bound
iron (NTBI), which is taken up by various tissues and cells leading to tissue iron overload and related pathology.
Plasma NTBI is also commonly seen in the hematologic disease beta-thalassemia major, an inherited blood
disorder that requires regular blood transfusions, which over time result in iron overload. Although NTBI is the
major contributor to tissue iron loading, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that mediate NTBI
uptake is incomplete. The primary long-term objective of this proposal is to define the proteins that transport iron
into various tissues and cells, particularly those affected by iron-overload related pathology. Our central
hypothesis is that the membrane transport proteins SLC39A14 (ZIP14) and (ZIP8) participate in iron homeostasis
and NTBI uptake. In the previous funding period, we generated a variety of conditional and double-knockout
mouse models, which enabled us to find that SLC39A14 is required for iron loading of the heart in a mouse
model of hemochromatosis and that SLC39A8 participates in systemic iron recycling, iron uptake by the lung,
and iron accumulation by the kidney and brain. We also demonstrated that reducing SLC39A14 expression
(pharmacologically or genetically) combined with iron chelation is more effective than iron chelation alone in
decreasing hepatic, cardiac, and total body iron in a mouse model of hemochromatosis. The current project will
investigate the efficacy of pharmacological approaches to reduce tissue-specific SLC39A14 expression in mouse
models of beta thalassemia and hemochromatosis. Another substantial focus will be to characterize the
molecular mechanisms of iron uptake and accumulation by the kidney, as renal iron accumulation and associated
adverse effects have been documented in a variety of disorders, including acute kidney injury, chronic kidney
disease, and diabetic nephropathy."

Persons living with HIV infection (PLWH) have a 2-fold higher risk of myocardial infarction and are twice as
likely to develop cardiovascular disease accounting for a significant global burden of disease. While the
mechanism underlying this excess risk remains poorly understood, studies demonstrate that atherosclerosis in
the setting of HIV is distinct and characterized by heightened arterial inflammation as assessed by FDG-
PET/CT. HIV and antiretroviral medication can worsen cardiometabolic parameters. Thus a therapeutic
strategy that can lower lipids, inflammation, and improve glycemic parameters may be even more
advantageous in HIV. Bempedoic acid (BA, an inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase), is safely tolerated, significantly
lowers LDL-C and inflammatory markers (on top of statin therapy), and is FDA approved for individuals with
heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or with established ASCVD who require additional LDL-C lowering.
Additionally, BA has a protective effect on glycemic parameters and may reduce adiposity. Given the key role
of lipids and inflammation in atherosclerosis in HIV, the purpose of this proof-of-concept mechanistic trial is to
evaluate the impact of BA on the biology of HIV-associated atherosclerosis. We will perform a randomized
placebo controlled study of effectively treated PLWH aged 40 years and older with either known CVD or 1 CVD
risk factor to study the effect of BA on arterial inflammation (assessed by FDG-PET/CT), lipid levels,
biomarkers of inflammatory/immune activation, cardiometabolic indices, and non-calcified plaque in the
coronary arteries (assessed by CCTA). This multicenter trial will include PLWH enrolled at UCSF, UCLA, and
Univ. of Utah. Long term collaborators at MGH will serve as the core facility for the imaging end-points. We
have 3 specific aims for the: Cholesterol and inflammation Lowering via BEmpedoic Acid, an ACL-inhibiting
Regimen in HIV Trial (CLEAR HIV Trial): Aim 1: To determine whether BA can safely reduce arterial
inflammation including carotid plaque as assessed by FDG-PET/CT; Aim 2: To determine whether BA
improves cardiometabolic measures (lipid, inflammatory, glycemic and adipose parameters) among PLWH.
Exploratory objectives will be to assess BA’s effect (vs. placebo) on glycemic as well as adipose tissue
measures (HbA1c, HOMA IR, and adipose tissue volumes); Aim 3: To evaluate the impact of BA on non-
calcified coronary plaque volume as measured by coronary CT angiography (CCTA) and to determine whether
changes in arterial inflammation are correlated with reduction in coronary plaques. This application combines
(1) a successful multidisciplinary team with a strong record of collaboration and expertise in studying
interventions in HIV, (2) the ability to rapidly recruit subjects from existing HIV-infected cohorts, (3) leveraging
of resources including study drug/placebo. Identifying novel therapies to reduce CV risk are essential to
improve mortality among PLWH, and results from this study will form the groundwork for a future trial to
evaluate the impact of additional reduction of LDL-C and inflammation using BA on clinical events in HIV."

Childhood cancer survivors are a high-priority, underserved population for HPV vaccination. They are less
likely to be vaccinated when compared to the general population and are more likely to develop second
cancers caused by HPV as adults. St. Jude Comprehensive Cancer Center (SJCCC) is uniquely positioned to
address observed disparities in HPV vaccination coverage among childhood cancer survivors by leveraging
our unique reach across our catchment area and building on award-winning, state-of-the-art communication
systems with those treated at SJCCC and their families. The purpose of this proposal is, therefore, to further
develop, optimize, and evaluate the Survivor Proud campaign to promote HPV vaccination to childhood cancer
survivors (Track 1: 9-30 years). We will focus specifically on continuous quality improvement of the campaign
through ongoing evaluation activities and successfully sustaining elements of the campaign that are most
effective. We also will focus on important wrap-around activities in support of the communication campaign,
including peer-to-peer efforts for patient families and clinician education and training. We will leverage
established infrastructure and collaborations to achieve the following specific aims: 1) Optimize and expand the
innovative, culturally targeted, multi-channel Survivor Proud communication campaign to enhance health
literacy related to HPV vaccination and to improve HPV vaccination coverage among CCS; and 2) Evaluate the
impact of the campaign to understand its impact on awareness, knowledge, intentions to get HPV vaccination,
and actual HPV vaccination, when data are available. Our approach will be highly iterative and include
engagement of key offices within St. Jude and most importantly, through our continued regular interaction with
patient families and adult childhood cancer survivors. The Survivor Proud campaign focuses on web-based
resources and communities, social media platforms, mobile application (app), traditional print formats,
electronic medical record (EMR) prompted patient education prescriptions, direct e-communication, peer-to-
peer, patient family experiences, and clinician training and education. The Survivor Proud HPV vaccination
campaign has first been developed in English (and will be developed in Spanish) will be evaluated across
these communication channels. A focus of the campaign is to build confidence in HPV vaccination leveraging
the trusted relationship patient families have with St. Jude. Project activities are documented and monitored
through a comprehensive process evaluation. Preliminary impact of our efforts will also be measured using
qualitative, quantitative, and analytical data, including assessment of aggregated HPV vaccination rates before
and after campaign implementation. Our efforts will be aligned with existing St. Jude resources from the
beginning to optimize sustainability. We will openly share our findings with other cancer centers and
organizations serving CCS and continue to refine and test our approaches to ensure we are achieving impact

11143477,"MoTrPAC Project Summary
The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is designed to discover and
characterize the range of molecular transducers underlying the effects of exercise in humans. MoTrPAC
was launched in 2016 with six adult clinical centers and a pediatric center that have collaborated to
generate extensive Manual of Operations to guide research protocols involving all aspects of the clinical
operations (Phase I). Phase II began in the fall of 2019 with all human clinical centers showing excellent
progress towards initial recruitment goals and implementation of the protocol. The initial goal set forth by
NIH was to recruit 270 children (10-17 years of age) and 1980 sedentary adults (age 18 years or greater)
randomized to endurance training (170 youth, 840 adults), resistance training (840 adults), or non-exercise
controls (50 youth, 300 adults). An additional group of highly active endurance (50 youth, 150 adults) and
resistance (150 adults) trained individuals serve as comparators, not participating in the MoTrPAC exercise
training programs. The recruitment and enrollment approach are sex-balanced, with participants across a
wide range of ages (10-17, 18-39, 40-59 and >60-year age groups) and of different races. Due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in March 2020, MoTrPAC activities were suspended for over a year with
continued constraints through 2022. Despite the numerous challenges encountered as a result of the
pandemic, the human clinical centers have successfully enrolled ~80% (adult) and 95% (pediatric) of the
highly active cohort, ~93% of cross-sectional (pediatric), and ~60% (adult) and ~50% (pediatric) of the
current target enrollment numbers in the randomized control trial portion of the study. This led to the NIH
Common Fund to release the current NOFO (RFA-RM-23-010) to provide MoTrPAC with funding to
complete recruitment and follow-up for the clinical studies, including finishing mechanistic randomized
controlled trials of sedentary adults and children, and observational studies of highly active adults and
children. This will enrich the participant cohorts that are critical to the understanding of exercise adaptations
and heterogeneity across age, gender, and minority groups. Altogether, this extension will allow MoTrPAC
to complete the intended goals as originally envisioned, will provide a more complete public database of
the health benefits of exercise, and will provide insight into how physical activity mitigates disease risk."
10744199,"Abstract 
The goal of this R37-supported research program is to obtain a fundamental understanding of how myosin 
motors function and interact with proteins, lipid membranes, and other biomolecules to power structural 
arrangements and motile events that are crucial for eukaryotic life. Our strategy has been to define the physical 
properties of the myosin family to better model and test function. To this end, we made fundamental discoveries 
into the mechanisms of chemomechanical coupling of all myosins and provided new insights into the mechanical 
attachments of membrane interactions. We will continue along the lines of the original specific aims, and we will 
build from our discoveries to address new and exciting questions related to these Aims. 
Aim 1: Determine the structural origin of myosin force sensing. Our focus is to determine how myosins 
sense and respond to mechanical load. Recent progress has given us an unprecedented look into the myosin-I 
structural states that span the force-sensing transition that control exit from force-bearing states. Using our new 
structural ""know-how,"" we engineered Myo1b tension-sensing properties into mechanically divergent Myo1c, and 
we were able to engineer a low duty ratio myo1b into a high duty ratio motor. Our newest work has resulted in 
specific predictions regarding the roles of key residues conserved in most members of the myosin superfamily 
in tuning tension sensitivity. Chemomechanical tuning via these allosteric connections will be tested, which will 
allow us to (1) understand the basic molecular biophysics of energy transduction (the holy grail of myosin 
biophysics), (2) understand the effect of disease causing mutations that are on this allosteric path that impact 
tension sensing, and (3) design, engineer, and express myosins of altered mechanosensitivity for cell biological 
experiments to probe the molecular functions of myosin. Our development of a high-speed optical trapping 
system (µs time resolution, Woody et al, 2018), will allow us to probe the entry into the force-bearing states, 
including the phosphate-release step. Mechano-diversity in this transition is controversial and virtually 
unexplored. We will continue our cryo-EM work to determine the structure of Myo1c, a motor with highly divergent 
tension sensing properties. We will also use cryo-EM to determine the structure of mechanically strained myosin, 
which will be facilitated by the novel cryo-EM analysis techniques developed in our recent paper (Mentes et al. 
(2018)), and the generation of engineered Myo1b dimers that, when actin-bound, have a positive and negative 
mechanical strains that substantially affect ADP release. Investigation of myosin-I function in living cells, under 
working conditions, has been extraordinarily difficult, as identifying the population of proteins that are actively 
generating force has not been possible. Thus, we are very excited about the development of FRET-force-sensors 
for exploring myosin function. Correlation of in vitro calibration studies with cellular experiments is novel and 
powerful, and these tools will be continued to be developed and applied during the next funding period. 
Aim 2: Biochemical and Mechanical Properties of Myosin-I Binding Proteins and Membranes. The most 
impactful outcome of our Aim-2 research is the discovery that the myosin-I motor domain plays a defining role 
in development of left-right (L/R) asymmetry in Drosophila, through planar cell polarity mechanisms (Lebreton et 
al., 2018). The molecular roles of myosin in this process are unknown, as are the mechanisms by which a subset 
of myosin-I isoforms power leftward turning of actin filaments. Nevertheless, a key feature of the mechanism is 
that once myosins are bound to the membrane, specific isoforms can establish left from right. Strong evidence 
points to myosin-I isoforms binding to sites of cell-cell adhesion via direct interaction of the tail domains with 
cadherins at sites of Arp2/3-mediated actin growth. Thus, we will undertake a series of biophysical and 
biochemical investigations to gain a better understanding the fundamental properties of Myo1C and Myo1D 
individually and in complex protein ensembles. Already underway are cryo-EM experiments with the two isoforms 
to examine actin binding sites and lever arm geometries to determine the origin of isoform-specific chirality. We 
will also investigate the biochemical and mechanical interactions (e.g., affinities, attachment durations, adhesion 
forces) of Drosophila myosin-I with E-cadherin using the methods outlined in our original proposal and our prior 
publications. It is possible that that myosin drives L/R asymmetry by directing the geometry of the actin network, 
as suggested for formins (Tee et al., (2015) Nat Cell Bio 17:445-57). Thus, we will study the effect of myosin-I 
on actin network polymerization and geometry using micro-patterned coverslips to grow Arp2/3-nucleated actin 
in a spatially controlled fashion as a function of myosin-I content. 
Aim 3: Determine the mechanisms of tropomyosin regulation of myosin-1. We will explore the diversity of 
regulation in the myosin-1 family by examining the effect of tropomyosin on one isoform from each of the 
phylogenetic subgroups (Myo1b, Myo1c, Myo1, Myo1g), and we will determine the detailed biochemical 
mechanism for modulation of myosin-I function. A eukaryotic expression system have provided us with tag-free, N-terminal acetylated tropomyosin isoforms which we will use for biochemical and motility experiments."
11159867,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is predicted to become the second deadliest cancer within the
next 10 years. Investigations into novel mechanisms of PDAC transformation are urgently needed as no
effective PDAC treatment currently exists. Transcriptional regulation during transformation is multifaceted with
genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations playing vital interconnected roles. A key unelucidated facet of
gene regulation in the context of transformation is the molecular mechanism which mediates changes in
chromatin reorganization. ChIP-seq and ChIP-PCR studies in an inducible model of oncogenic KRAS, a key
initiating factor in PDAC, demonstrate a relocation of heterochromatin to the nuclear periphery. These lamina
associated domains (LADs) are enriched in H3K9me2 and positioned at the nuclear lamina. ChIP-seq and
RNA-seq identified loss of active enhancer regions incorporated into LADs and downregulation of LAD
associated genes, respectively. To investigate the mechanism regulating the assembly of LADs downstream of
oncogenic KRAS we performed several molecular and biochemical studies. We conducted a screening BioID
utilizing Lamin A, a core component of the nuclear lamina known to interact with LADs, as bait. Lamin A BioID
identified a novel myosin, Myosin 18a (MYO18a), enriched at the nuclear lamina under oncogenic KRAS
signaling. Immunocytochemistry revealed increased nuclear localization of MYO18a and enrichment at the
lamina upon KRAS activation. Biochemical analysis validated MYO18a-Lamin A interaction and confirmed
MYO18a interaction with chromatin. siRNA knockdown for MYO18a rescued expression of genes associated
with oncogenic KRAS-mediated LADs. These data lead us to our central hypothesis that MYO18a acts as a
downstream effector of KRAS to modulate chromatin positioning at the nuclear lamina to silence oncogenic
gene expression. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct ChIP-seq and RNA-seq experiments in parallel to
detect MYO18a associated LADs in in vitro models of PDAC. LAD assembly will then be investigated in the
presence/absence of MYO18a. We will also develop MYO18a genetic engineered mouse models to explore
the role of MYO18a and nuclear MYO18a in PDAC development and progression. Further study into this
mechanism can provide valuable insight into gene regulation in the transformation process and will identify
potentially druggable targets."
11159350,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Impaired wound healing is an alarming problem in diabetes, attributed to the development of over 750,000
diabetic foot ulcerations (DFU) and 70,000 lower extremity amputations per year in the USA. DFU is a
heterogeneous disease with a variable clinical course and there is an urgent, unmet need to identify subjects
who are at higher risk of an impaired wound healing. Our preliminary collaborative study of the circulating
proteome points to the interesting candidate biomarker proteins prognostic of the DFU course. In our pilot, study
we have identified proteins associated with the prospective wound healing outcome belonging to such classes
as adhesion molecules, carboxypeptidases, and inflammatory proteins among others. Pathway network
analyses seeded with these proteins revealed β catenin and cellular Myc (c-Myc) among the most connected
nodes. Interestingly, Wnt/β catenin pathway and transcription factor, c-Myc have been extensively implicated to
play a role in the DFU including work of the Diabetic Foot Consortium (DFC) investigators. The DFU course is
heterogeneous and multi-factorial, thus we hypothesize that multi-biomarker panel will offer the most optimal
prognostication. Biological processes reflected by protein levels are often connected, thus we hypothesize that
by employing parallal biostatistical and machine learning approach will offer us tools to build a robust signature.
This proposal has the three aims: Aim 1 (R61 phase) will focus on refining candidate protein exemplars for a
prospective wound healing among subjects with diabetes. We will perform semi-targeted measurements of our
candidate proteins (identified in our preliminary study) in subjects of the DFC cohort followed for a 3-month
disease course. We will employ biostatistical tools supported by machine learning methods, adequate for
correlated data to finally determine key protein exemplars. In Aim 2, (R61 phase), we will develop a focused,
proteomics biomarker signature comprising of a targeted quantitative panel of 10-12 proteins. For that purpose,
we will perform an extensive analytical validation and subsequently we will build a focused and quantitative multi-
biomarker panel. Finally, in Aim 3 (R33 phase) will initiate determination of the clinical utility of our prognostic
biomarker signature for the DFU course. To this end, we will perform targeted biomarker measurements in the
DFC cohort. We will employ rigorous biostatistical metrics to evaluate the biomarker signature’s performance
(integrated discrimination ability, Akake criterion among others). Advancements in this project will identify and
initially determine a value of the biomarker signature prognostic for the prospective diabetic wound healing
course. These efforts will aid in refining a target population with a phenotype of interest by providing objective
quantifiable metrics that can enhance clinical trial enrollment criteria for Phase 2/3 studies."
11159351,"Project summary
Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a widespread, serious, and common complication of diabetes. Diabetes-related
amputations are associated with disability, drastic reduction in quality of life, high morbidity and resulting
alarming mortality rate of 35% over 5 years. Non-invasive detectable biomarkers that correlate with healing
outcomes of DFU are critically needed for early targeting of hard-to-heal ulcers for advanced interventions
beyond standard of care (SOC) therapy, as well as for timely monitoring of response to treatment. Preliminary
evidence developed in our laboratory supports circulating urinary microRNAs (miRNAs) as detectable
biomarkers for DFUs and other diabetes-associated complications; these miRNAs can be isolated and
quantified from urine in a technically robust and reproducible manner. Utilizing an R61/R33 funding mechanism
in response to RFA-DK-21-001, this project will capitalize upon patient enrollment in the existing protocols and
infrastructure of the Diabetic Foot Consortium to develop a practical, quantitative, non-invasive, cost-effective
prognostic biomarker comprised of a urinary microRNA subset that, when assessed in patients at baseline,
accurately and reliably differentiates DFUs that have the capacity to heal with SOC from those that do not.
Specifically, in R61/ Exploratory phase, a combined data reduction and prognostic modeling approach will be
applied to narrow the determine miRNome of top 10-20 miRNA parameters that predict DFU clinical healing
outcomes at Week 12. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of predictions will be evaluated and with
successful completion of R61 milestones the model will progress to the R33/Validation phase, in which the
custom miRNA subset biomarker panel will be interrogated for its ability to predict healing outcomes in a
prospectively enrolled cohort of 100 additional patients with open DFUs. Results of the Validation phase will
yield a biomarker ready for submission for FDA biomarker qualification approval and subsequent direct clinical
implementation as a point-of-care assessment to guide clinical management decisions and improve wound
closure outcomes, thereby reducing associated DFU morbidity and mortality."

It is striking and disheartening that Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders (AA-NHPI)
experience health disparities that are substantial, growing, and poorly understood. Our project entitled “Hawai‘i
Health Equity Research and Outreach Network (HAWAI‘I HERON)” will create an Administrative Core to allow
us to quickly respond and participate in multi-institutional studies that support three health equity pillars: equity
of voices, equitable data efforts, and equity in clinical trials. First, we will enhance equity of voices by 1) amplifying
the voices of our AA-NHPI stakeholder communities; 2) understanding diverse patient perspectives, preferences,
and unmet needs; and 3) supporting expansion of culturally and linguistically tailored health education. Second,
we will support equitable data efforts by expanding capacity to evaluate outcomes by 1) race/ethnicity; 2)
geography; and 3) other social determinants of health. Third, we will promote equity in clinical trials by 1)
identifying barriers; 2) employing innovative strategies to increase clinical trial enrollment for AA-NHPI; 3)
understanding the impact of the evolving multicultural landscape on trial participation; and 4) increasing training
for diverse students and investigators. The HAWAI‘I HERON Administrative Core will foster collaboration with
the Food and Drug Administration Office of Minority Health and Health Equity and other institutions that are part
of the Racial & Ethnic Minority Acceleration Consortium for Health Equity (REACH) network. In addition, we will
leverage the Administrative Core to conduct a pilot study involving a discrete choice experiment examining AA-
NHPI perceptions and preferences for diabetes medications. We will gain an understanding of AA-NHPI
preferences regarding attributes of diabetes medications through administering patient preference surveys to 50
AA and 50 NHPI with type 2 diabetes. Random utility theory will serve as the basis for analysis. This assumes
that individuals make choices to maximize their utility (or wellbeing), which they derive from different choices.
Mixed logit regression, which allows for heterogeneity in preferences across individuals, will be used to estimate
the random utility models. Results will enable us to better understand the importance of different attributes and
levels, as well as willingness to trade-off between attributes. We will compare findings for AA to those of NHPI
and describe similarities and differences. Sensitivity analysis will be used to test the robustness of the results to
different assumptions and model specifications. We will hire and train a Health Equity Fellow to support the
discrete choice experiment in diabetes medications and build expertise and scholarship for future work and
engagement. Achievement of these aims will enable HAWAI‘I HERON to be an active partner to the FDA Office
of Minority Health and Health Equity in collaborative research efforts to advance minority health and health equity
focused research, to improve outreach and communications, and to support training and mentoring of diverse
students and junior researchers."
11142059,"Project Summary
Institutional efforts are required to achieve the level of diversity, equity, and inclusion that will ensure
recruitment and advancement of individuals now underrepresented in academic medicine (URiM). Siteman
Cancer Center (SCC) is committed to overcoming structural barriers that have limited diversity in the cancer
research workforce and to supporting the success of early career cancer researchers. Aligned with the NCI
National Cancer Plan Goals to eliminate inequities and to optimize the workforce, and with the support of a
CCSG Supplement, SCC has implemented a Training Navigation program. The overarching goal of this
program is to provide personalized navigation to resources and services that enhance the career development
and trajectory of early career scholars (particularly postdoctoral fellows and early-stage investigator faculty),
including women and those from backgrounds that are URiM. This SCC effort is a collaboration between
Cancer Research Training and Education Coordination (CRTEC) and Plan to Enhance Diversity (PED).
Importantly, CRTEC and PED staff collaborate to ensure that early career scholars benefit from navigation
support and programming, and that all SCC scholars receive exceptional support during graduate school,
postdoctoral work, and as ESI faculty. We previously trained a PED staff member as a training resource
navigator to provide hands-on support and link scholars to career development resources and programs. To
support scholars, particularly URiM and women, we will continue to evaluate, improve, and sustain our training
navigation infrastructure and programs in order to promote resource access and build a climate conducive to
persistence and success in cancer research careers. Our aims are to: (1) Identity competitive and promising
underrepresented cancer-focused trainees and ESI faculty within SCC and the region; (2) Provide
personalized navigation to resources, professional preparation, and networking opportunities; and (3) Evaluate
program outcomes and evolve the program as needed to meet changing needs and opportunities, while
implementing plans for sustainability of our high-impact activities. Our objective is to conduct activities that
improve the training climate and increase participation of URiM and women scholars in training and career
development programming. Navigation is a key strategy for linking scholars to the supports they need and
want, and we have planned a sustainable approach. Specific initiatives include proactive and personalized
navigation, grant writing and biosketch training, access to scientific editing and grant reviews, support for travel
to cancer conferences, and other professional development opportunities. Short-term outcomes include equity
and inclusion in scholars reached and supported, scholars linked with NCI program officials, participation in
training activities, and grant submissions including career development awards and diversity supplements.
Longer-term outcomes include grants awarded, and equitable retention in cancer research and career
progression. Our approach is designed for long-term success in building a diverse cancer research workforce."

Despite potential lifelong consequences of gut microbiome dysbiosis, little is known about environmental
factors that influence its diversity and composition, including windows of susceptibility to exposure. The gut
microbiome performs essential functions for human health, and is related to neurobehavioral development via
the gut-brain axis. While a few studies have examined the infant/adult microbiome in the context environmental
epidemiology, the adolescent microbiome has not received attention, even though it occurs in a period of rapid
development when the hormonal milieu is changing, and internalizing behaviors often emerge. The proposed
project aims to address these gaps by examining the relations between exposure to triclosan—an antimicrobial
and endocrine disrupting compound—pubertal hormones, the adolescent microbiome, and neurobehavior.
This work will leverage the Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment Study, a longitudinal birth
cohort with rich data collection including quantification of urinary triclosan at 10 visits from early gestation
through 12Y, pubertal hormones, the serum metabolome, and behavior. Crucial to this project, participants
provided stools at 12Y. During the K99 phase, fecal DNA will be sequenced to profile microbial communities,
which will be used to identify windows of susceptibility to triclosan (Aim 1). Dr. Laue will assess the role of
hormones in shaping the microbiome, including whether they mediate or modify the triclosan-microbiome
association (Aim 2), and examine the relationship between the adolescent microbiome and behavior (Aim 3a).
During the R00 phase, microbiome and behavioral assessment at 18Y to inform our understanding of the
longitudinal association between the microbiome and behavior (Aim 3b). Dr. Laue will characterize the role of
the serum metabolome in the microbiome-behavior association (Aim 4) and will determine whether bacterial
features mediate or modify the association between triclosan and adolescent behavior (Exploratory Aim 5).
To complete this research, Dr. Laue will complement her expertise in environmental epidemiology and the
infant microbiome with extensive training under the guidance of her mentorship team (Dr. Margaret Karagas—
primary mentor, Dr. Joseph Braun—co-mentor, Dr. Juliette Madan—advisor, Dr. Abby Fleisch—advisor, Dr.
Amy Willis—advisor). Dr. Laue will learn from coursework, workshops, and individualized trainings in 1)
processing microbiome data and microbiome measurement error, 2) multiple informant modeling and other
methods for identifying windows of susceptibility, 3) causal mediation, 4) pediatric endocrinology, and 5)
neurobehavior. This award will prepare Dr. Laue to be an independent researcher specializing in
environmental epidemiology and the adolescent microbiome. Dr. Laue’s research will fill a critical gap in the
environmental epidemiological literature, namely what role the adolescent microbiome and metabolome play in
the relationship between a ubiquitous environmental toxicant (triclosan) and neurobehavior."

Dental caries, the most common microbial disease, is caused by overgrowth of acidogenic and aciduric bacteria
including Streptococcus mutans. Childhood caries incidence in the U.S. is high and there is a clear imperative to
better understand caries pathogenesis. Cariogenic organisms thrive in biofilm environments. Amyloid was
first identified in the context of pathology but does not always represent a protein mis-folding pathway.
Functional amyloid is also recognized. Amyloid aggregates are evolutionarily conserved cross -sheet
quaternary structures with common biophysical properties enabling their detection and study. Multiple
microorganisms are now known to produce functional amyloids within biofilm environments. Our group was
the first to discover Streptococcus mutans amyloids. We have now identified four amyloid-forming proteins in
this bacterium. Three of these, P1 (AgI/II), WapA, and Cnm are sortase-localized adhesins whose extracellular
truncation derivatives are amyloidogenic. The previously unknown fourth protein, Smu_63, serves as a
negative regulator of biofilm cell density and genetic competence. We have provided extensive tertiary and
quaternary structural characterization of adhesin P1 and structural characterization of other proteins is in
progress. We have provided definitive X-ray fiber diffraction evidence of a classical stacked -sheet amyloid
structure for S. mutans amyloids. Furthermore, our work contributes to a new paradigm for multiple
streptococcal and staphylococcal amyloids. Naturally-occurring truncation products play two key roles within
these organisms' biofilm life cycles. First by promoting adherence to cognate ligands in their monomeric
forms via quaternary interactions with the parent adhesins linked to the cell surface, and second by facilitating
detachment of biofilm cells and extracellular matrix components from aging biofilms in their amyloid form.
The left-handed Z-configuration of extracellular DNA within biofilms was recently associated with biofilm
stability whereas right-handed B-DNA disrupted extant biofilms. The amyloid, but not monomeric form of
neuropathologic A, drives conversion of Z-DNA to B-DNA. Cardiolipin-rich mitochondrial membranes
modulate amyloidogeneis of -synuclein and Htt involved in Parkinson's and Huntingtin Diseases. We have
identified cardiolipin as a prevalent lipid in S. mutans cytoplasmic membranes and extracellular membrane
vesicles. In this renewal application we will explore relationships between S. mutans amyloid-forming
proteins and B- and Z-forms of DNA in vitro and in vivo within adherent and detaching biofilms (Aim 1),
determine the impact of membrane lipid composition on S. mutans amyloid formation within aging biofilms
and assess interactions of amyloidogenic proteins with specific lipids of interest (Aim 2), and continue to use
state of the art methods including solution and solid-state NMR to identify and characterize structural
transitions reflective of monomer to amyloid conversion and determine if amyloid signatures for each protein
are impacted by exposure to different DNA configurations, lipids, or other amyloidogenic proteins (Aim 3)."

The US health care system leads the world in administrative complexity and its associated costs. Research on
administrative costs has primarily focused on costs to the health care system and rarely includes patients,
though patients often perform a lot of administrative work, meaning the time, effort, and stress of navigating the
health system to obtain, pay for, and coordinate care. Cancer is a complex and often high-acuity condition with
persistent disparities in health outcomes, making cancer care delivery a priority setting for assessing patient
administrative burdens and identifying solutions. This program of research harnesses multiple methods to
define, measure, and describe the impact of patient administrative burden in cancer care delivery on quality
and care outcomes including oral anticancer agent adherence and guideline-recommended supportive care.
This early K99/R00 will establish Michael Anne Kyle, PhD, RN as an independent investigator focused on
improving the quality and value of cancer care delivery by reducing nonfinancial costs. Training goals in
advanced survey and psychometric methods and cancer care delivery will support Dr. Kyle’s success in her
research aims and transition to independence. An outstanding team of mentors will guide her training and
career development. The K99 phase focuses on defining patient administrative burden in cancer care delivery
and developing a survey instrument to measure it. It will engage patients or patient proxies in focus groups
elucidating the patient-facing nonclinical tasks involved in managing cancer care (Aim 1a). Qualitative insights
will inform the development and validation of a novel survey instrument measuring patient administrative
burden and its psychometric properties (Aim 1b). The R00 phase, will administer the validated patient
administrative burden survey to patients with cancer across a large NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center (Aim
2a). It will then link patient survey data with data on practice characteristics to examine the relationship
between organizational characteristics and administrative burden. (Aim 2b). Finally, it will link the survey with
patient-level utilization data burden to examine the relationship between administrative burden and cancer care
quality, including adherence to oral anticancer agents and adherence to guideline-recommended supportive
care (Aim 2c). Together, these results will enable the measurement and diagnosis of administrative burden
across cancer care settings and produce evidence identifying and motivating actionable organizational or
policy targets for clinical leaders and policymakers."

The mission of the Yale CCEH is to facilitate, enhance, and promote research in hematopoiesis, stem cell
biology, and other nonmalignant hematology-related areas. The YCCEH’s unique focus is the application of
innovative, emerging technologies to study of normal and perturbed hematopoiesis. We have recently made
substantial progress towards the mission with three technology cores (Cell Prep, Imaging and Animal) that have
led to nonmalignant studies published in high impact journals, supported awarding of major grants, and trained
the next generation of nonmalignant hematology researchers. We now propose to add further cutting edge
technology and much needed clinical samples to the basic cores to further enhance studies and innovation.
Specific Aim #1 will add single platelet characterization to complement the technologies provided by the Cell
Preparation and Analysis Core. Specific Aim #2 will complement the Animal Modeling Core with key human
nonmalignant hematology samples and Specific Aim #3 will add the most recent FLASH-PAINT technologies to

The first two specific aims of this R37 grant were to test our hypothesis that cohesin-mediated loop
extrusion plays a key role in lgH class switch recombination (CSR) and lg variable region exon somatic
hypermutation (SHM). A third aim was to test our hypothesis that Peyer's Patch (PP) germinal centers(GCs)
expand rare V(D)J clonotypes with high intrinsic SHM levels. For these studies, we developed powerful assays
for CSR, SHM and chromatin interactions. We also employed our RAG2-defcient blastocyst complementation
approach (RDBC) to generate ES cell-based V(D)J passenger allele and V(D)J-rearranging mouse models for
in vivo studies. Despite pandemic challenges, we made substantial progress in the first 3.5 years."

This multi-PI proposal titled “SARS-CoV-2-reactive
subjects” is written in response to ‘RFA-CA-20-039’ -
tissue-resident memory T cells in healthy and cancer
Research projects in SARS-CoV-2 Serological Sciences.
Recent studies have shown that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection decline rapidly over time, implying
a lack of durable protective humoral (B cell) immunity. Whether this is also true for cellular immunity (e.g., T
cells) is poorly understood. It is well established that CD8+ TRM cells are the first line of defense in viral infections
at mucosal/barrier sites. They are also known to protect hosts against homologous or heterologous re-infections.
Our group was the first to show that TRM cells are pivotal players in driving effective anti-tumor immune responses
in lung cancer, and that TRM cells are the primary cellular targets of anti-PD1 therapies. These key findings were
possible because of the ongoing collaboration between Dr. Vijayanand, Dr. Ay, and Dr. Ottensmeier (Multi-PI).
This team brings together experience in T cell immunology, single-cell genomics, bioinformatics, and cancer
immunology. Our Multi-PI team has recently performed the first and largest single-cell RNA-seq and TCR-seq
analysis of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (~300,000 single-cells) from COVID-19 patients. Here,
to understand TRM responses to SARS-CoV-2, we will capitalize on a cohort of cancer (n=100) and non-cancer
(n=100) patients, who will provide excess airway (nasal, oropharynx, larynx), lung and tumor tissue specimens
obtained during routine surgery. In AIM 1, we will define the properties of SARS-CoV-2 reactive TRM cells from
cancer and non-cancer patients with or without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will perform combined
single-cell RNA-seq and TCR-seq analysis of CD8+ TRM cells in the airways (nasal, oropharynx), lung, and tumor
tissue. In parallel, by stimulating PBMCs with SARS-CoV-2 peptide pool, we will determine the transcriptomic
and TCR sequence of SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells. We will utilize this TCR sequence information to define the
numbers and properties of SARS-CoV-2 reactive-TRM cells in mucosal and tumor tissues. Recent studies in non-
exposed individuals (pre-COVID-19 pandemic) indicate pre-existing, circulating CD8+ T cells, with human
coronavirus cross-reactivity. Here, we will measure the quantity and quality of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-
reactive TRM responses in subjects without clinical or serological evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. In
AIM 2, we will assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on anti-tumor and other anti-viral TRM responses. We
will stimulate matched PBMCs (as above) with peptide pools targeting (i) common respiratory RNA viruses
(influenza (FLU), RSV), (ii) persistent DNA viruses (CMV, EBV), and (iii) a tumor-driving virus (HPV) to define
the TCR sequence of the respective virus-specific and tumor(HPV)-specific CD8+ T cells; we will utilize the TCR
information to determine frequency and properties of other virus/tumor-reactive TRM cells in mucosal and tumor-
tissue cells."

Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) impact over 2 million Americans annually, result in over 130,000 amputations each
year, and are associated with high mortality rates. To date, there has been no single infectious agent of DFU
identified as a good marker of healing outcome. This is likely because DFUs are host to a diverse community of
microbes (i.e., the wound microbiome). Wound microbiomes analyzed at the community-level are promising
predictors of wound healing outcomes. We have shown that wounds persisting beyond 12 weeks exhibit high
and persistent proportions of mixed-population, anaerobic bacteria within their microbiomes. Additionally, we
found a significant increase of anaerobic transcriptional activity in persistent and amputated wounds, even from
species identified as being in low abundance by traditional 16S rRNA based gene sequencing. This suggests
microbial transcription, and specifically from anaerobic bacteria, are promising biomarkers of wound healing in
diabetic patients.
The proposed project will identify microbial biomarkers that can be used as prognostic and monitoring tools for
DFU wound healing. We hypothesize using RNA instead of DNA will provide a better snapshot of the wound
environment and more sensitive biomarkers: specifically, the proportion and transcriptional activity of anaerobes
within the wound microbiome can be used as predictors of wound healing outcomes. Using RNAseq to measure
the metatranscriptome of the DFU microbiome, we will leverage advances in machine learning approaches to
demonstrate the capacity of the anaerobic component of the wound microbiome to serve as a biomarker for
wound healing. We have vigorously evaluated the optimal sample collection techniques and methods of
detection, determining a simple swab of the ulcer bed is sufficient to characterize the metatranscriptome and will
facilitate clinical implementation. We will develop a multiplexed RT-qPCR assay for the panel of candidate
biomarker genes we identify and validate the assay sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision. We will work
closely with the Diabetic Foot Consortium Steering Committee and Data Coordinating Center to test and validate
our biomarkers in a multi-site trial with the DFC. Our goal is to develop a multiplexed biomarker assay integrating
the complex interactions occurring within the DFU microbiome and tissue microenvironment. It will use a simple
swab of the ulcer bed, rely on objective measurements, and is designed to predict healing trajectories at an early
time in the clinical course."

Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is the most severe manifestation of alcohol-associated liver disease that is
characterized by hepatocyte dysfunction, systemic inflammation and poor clinical outcomes. We recently
reported heterogeneity in neutrophils in AH with over-activated, high-density (HDN), and functionally
exhausted, low density (LDN) neutrophil populations that contribute to liver damage. Here we hypothesize
that alcohol-induced extracellular traps (NETs) play a role in neutrophil heterogeneity and also contribute to
hepatocyte damage, inflammation and fibrosis in AH. Our preliminary results suggest that alcohol-induced
neutrophil activation and NET release are associated with increased activation and phosphorylation of the
Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase. We postulate that BTK is a master regulator in
AH by promoting both inflammation and hepatocyte dysfunction. Given that BTK can interact with the NLRP3
inflammasome as well as the STING/IRF3 pathways that play key roles in alcohol-induced inflammation,
hepatocyte damage and steatosis, we propose to explore the role of these interactions in AH. Finally, we
propose that therapeutic inhibition of NETs, BTK, or both will ameliorate neutrophil mediated inflammation
and liver damage. The aims of this proposal are #1: To characterize neutrophil phenotypes, populations
and the role alcohol-induced NETs in AH by: a) Characterizing neutrophil phenotypes and populations
from AH patients using single cell RNAseq; b) delineating mechanisms by which alcohol-induced NETs
activate monocytes/macrophages, hepatic stellate cells and hepatocytes; c) Defining the role of BTK
activation in alcohol-induced neutrophil NET induction and LDN generation. Aim 2 will evaluate the role of
cell-specific BTK phosphorylation in AH by assessing: a) Mechanisms of BTK activation by alcohol and
defining the impact of acute and chronic alcohol on BTK activation in the liver; b) A BTK phosphorylation on
the phenotypes and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in circulating monocytes of patients with AH; c) The
effect of myeloid- and neutrophil-specific deletion of BTK in a mouse model of AH. Aim 3 will evaluate
inhibition of NETs or BTK as potential therapeutic interventions in preclinical models of AH in mice.
Results from these experiments will unravel unique heterogeneity of neutrophils in AH that will lead to better
understanding of the controversial role of neutrophils in AH. Our results will characterize the functional
impact of NETs on inflammation and fibrosis in alcohol-induced liver damage. The proposed studies will
provide novel insights into the role of BTK at the molecular and cell-specific level and define its interactions
with other key signal transduction pathways and explore BTK and/or NETs as new therapeutic targets for
amelioration of AH."
11159865,"Diabetes is now a global epidemic. More than 95% of diabetes is type 2 diabetes (T2D), a chronic disease that can cause serious complications, including heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, blindness, and lower limb amputation. Progressive deterioration in pancreatic islet β-cell function is a hallmark of T2D, however, the mechanism of β-cell loss in T2D remains elusive. Βeta cells increase insulin secretion in response to hyperglycemia. If insulin production surpasses the capacity of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to make functional proteins, misfolded proteins will buildup, a process called the ER stress. Metabolic stress due to obesity, aging, and other lifestyle changes disrupts energy homeostasis, which triggers ER stress in β cells leading to the activation of UPRs. Chronic ER stress under metabolic stress, which is characterized by insulin resistance, turns adaptive UPR to maladaptive UPR, which is believed a driving force for β-cell mass loss in T2D. Our long-term goal is to identify the tilting point of UPR under metabolic stress and to explore its translational potential for therapeutic interventions.
Xbp1s, a UPR transducer activated by ER stress, is crucial for β-cell function and survival. Consistent with the requirement for Xbp1s to protect β-cells from dysfunction under metabolic stress, Xbp1s is found elevated in β-cells in preT2D donors and prediabetic models. However, the overexpression of Xbp1s, when studied in vitro showed conflicting results: one showing Xbp1s promotes β-cell apoptosis, and the other showing Xbp1s promotes β-cell proliferation. Despite the controversy about Xbp1s overexpression in positive or negative regulation of β-cell survival, it is clear that the action of Xbp1s in β-cells is complicated and it is insufficient to elucidate the impact of Xbp1s on β-cell integrity under metabolic stress by in vitro studies solely. Meanwhile, the Xbp1 loss-of-function mouse models used in the field are deficient in both spliced and unspliced form of Xbp1. Therefore, a knowledge gap remains for the pathological role of Xbp1s in β-cell function and survival under metabolic stress.
Using a novel mouse model that allows inducible ablation of spliced Xbp1 selectively in β-cells, we found a striking impact of Xbp1s on β-cell function and survival. Elucidation of the role of Xbp1s as an integrative player in adaptive remodeling of β-cells under metabolic stress will advance our understanding of the progressive deterioration in pancreatic islet β-cells in T2D and pave a way for novel, more effective therapeutic design for preventing β-cell loss in T2D progression."

Genomic medicine has transformed prevention, care, and targeted medical regiments through the milestone
achievements of Human Genome Project and the advent of genetic testing for health purposes. Germline
genetic testing focused on hereditary risk, the focus of this proposal, can include various types and purposeful
testing like carrier screening, newborn screening, and cancer predisposition testing, etc. This tests have
already enabled genetic providers to improve health outcomes for many with increased screening
recommendations, prevention efforts (chemoprevention), and behavioral change recommendations. However,
the diffusion of genetic testing for underserved groups, specifically Latinx (gender neutral use of Latino/a/e)
groups, remains a major challenge. Despite a strong interest in using genetic testing, there remains a dearth of
research on facilitating and barrier factors for Latinx populations. Thus, the goal of this proposal is to
empirically examine Latinx individuals' experiences with genetic testing, their attitudes, and identify perceived
facilitators and barriers to testing. In particular, I will characterize salient attitudes, facilitators, and barriers of
Latinx individuals towards genetic testing for health purposes using a sequential explanatory mixed-methods
design (Aim 1). The first phase of the study (Aim 1A) will characterize salient attitudes, facilitators, and
barriers of 20 Latinx individuals towards genetic testing for health purposes using semistructured elicitation
interviews. The sample will be stratified by previous experience with genetic testing, and those who have not
tested as was to better characterize attitudes, facilitators and barriers that differ between these groups.
Interviews will center on questions of attitudes, perceived norms, and personal agency inclusive of facilitators
and barriers. Results will then guide the next phase of the research (Aim 1B). In this phase, I will examine the
associations of attitudes, facilitators, and barriers with intentions related to carrier screening and cancer
predisposition testing for a Latinx population. Specifically, using wording from interviews, I will design a survey
focused on attitudes, facilitators, and barriers and administer the survey on a Qualtrics Panels with 500 Latinx
individuals. Using Structural Equation Modeling, I will then test the associations between attitude, facilitators,
and barrier factors with behavioral intention to both carrier screening and cancer predisposition testing to
determine which may be the best factors for intervention. Building upon the F99 results, in the postdoctoral
phase I will utilize findings about attitudes, facilitators, and barriers to develop translational intervention
research to engage Latinx populations in genetic testing (Aim 2). The goal of my postdoctoral research training
developing culturally appropriate communication strategies to improve genetics engagement for Latinx
populations. Through a more robust understanding of attitudes, facilitators, and barriers can genomic
researchers better engage with Latinx populations and therein reduce health inequities within genomics."
11142023,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Shoulder pain accounted for 12.6 million ambulatory physician visits in 2015 in the United States. Rotator cuff
tears are one of the leading causes of shoulder pain and disability and accounted for 272,148 surgeries in 2006.
The etiology of degenerative atraumatic rotator cuff tears is unknown. Data from familial aggregation studies
provide convincing preliminary evidence suggesting genetic predisposition to rotator cuff tears. However,
large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using imaging-verified rotator cuff tear cases and
controls are lacking, and the search for causal genetic variants and causal genes remains elusive.
The degree of fatty infiltration (FI) of rotator cuff muscles is critical for treatment decision-making since higher
grades of FI are associated with worse outcomes. About 40 to 50% of patients with rotator cuff tears develop
FI. The genetic etiology behind FI has not yet been assessed, and whether the relationship between obesity and
FI is causal remains unclear. Patient-reported outcomes after rehabilitation and surgery for cuff tear are also
variable. There is supportive evidence for the role of genetic variants in predicting treatment outcomes, but this
has not been well-studied.
Our research team is recruiting for a 12-site, NIH- and PCORI-funded, clinical trial of 700 patients randomized
to arthroscopic surgery versus physical therapy for atraumatic cuff tears called Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff
(ARC). This provides a unique opportunity to leverage our existing infrastructure and recruit 2,500 patients in
an imaging-verified, case-control study on the genetics of cuff tears. We have developed standardized
approaches to ascertain image-verified cases and controls using electronic health record (EHR) data. By
applying these standardized approaches to EHR-linked biorepositories at Vanderbilt (BioVU) and Kaiser
Permanente (GERA), each with approximately 100,000 genotyped individuals, and by collaborating with
investigators from Utah and Stanford who are leaders in the only two existing GWAS of cuff tear, we have
convened the largest consortium (cuffGEN) to study the genetics of rotator cuff disorders. We will perform
one-of-a-kind GWAS investigations with well-classified discovery and replication samples of 5,000 imaging-
verified rotator cuff tear cases and 5,000 imaging-verified controls. This well-designed study will identify
associations between genetic variants and cuff tears, FI, and optimal patient-reported outcomes after surgery
or rehabilitative treatments. We will prioritize gene discovery by incorporating gene-expression data from
adipose and muscle using reference databases with GWAS results. Through Mendelian randomization, our
study will clarify if there is a causal relationship between obesity and FI. The proposed study allows NIH funds
to leverage existing infrastructure without which this large genetic study would be difficult.
Genetic profiling to assess intervention readiness and rehabilitation progress are NIH priorities which the
proposed study will deliver upon. Data on genetic predisposition to cuff tear, FI, and optimal treatment
outcomes will help in identifying high-risk individuals and developing optimal interventions based on an
individual's genetic profile."

My long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focusing on how pollutant exposures may adversely
affect respiratory health and identify measures to effectively mitigate such exposures. My primary project
objective is to investigate the exposure and toxicity of chemical constituents of concern (CCOC), namely metal
and aldehydes, as well as the pulmonary health effects, including inflammation, of using new and emerging
electronic cigarette (e-cig) devices among young adults. E-cig devices work by heating a mixture of chemicals
to generate an aerosol that is inhaled by the user. Use of e-cigs has increased and, among adults, remains the
highest among those aged 18 to 24 years. More recent e-cig devices such as disposable PODs have grown in
popularity, yet it is currently unknown whether these new devices’ design characteristics in conjunction with user
vaping regimen impact CCOC exposure and influence respiratory health. Thus, my specific aims are to 1)
evaluate the relationship between e-cig use and CCOC exposure and effect, 2) assess the association of e-cig
use with respiratory outcomes and inflammatory markers, and 3) assess CCOC exposure as a mixture and
potential mediator in e-cig related respiratory health outcomes. In this cross-sectional study, to achieve Aim 1
(K99 phase), 150 participants (75 e-cig users, 75 non-users) will be recruited to assess biomarkers of exposure
(aldehydes, metals) and effect (metallothionein) from e-cig use. This will leverage the ongoing EMIT study which
looks at metal exposure and collects e-cig user regimen via questionnaire, aerosol samples, biospecimens
(blood, urine), and spirometry measures. After receiving training in chemical analysis, respiratory clinical
outcomes, and inflammatory markers, including gene expression changes, a new cohort of 150 participants (75
e-cig users, 75 non-users) will be recruited for Aim 2 (R00 phase). This phase will not only collect the same data
as in Aim 1 but also biomarkers of effect and inflammation (blood, urine, FeNO) and gene expression profiles (in
nasal epithelial cells). Whether e-cig users have increased respiratory symptoms, inflammation and altered gene
expression profiles compared to non-users will be evaluated. Combining Aims 1 and 2 cohorts (n= 300), Aim 3
will employ the use of Bayesian and causal mediation methods to assess if CCOC exposure is positively
associated with and explains, at least in part, the respiratory effects from e-cig use. With the proliferation of
newer e-cig devices, there is an urgent need to characterize exposure and respiratory health effects resulting
from their use. This study has the potential to generate critical data to inform FDA regulation to limit adverse
exposures and health outcomes and curb the increasing prevalence of use among young adults. Through this
research, my didactic coursework, and the guidance of my mentoring team consisting of a pulmonologist,
exposure scientist, immunologist, analytical chemist, and environmental epidemiologist, I will acquire critical
skills needed to be a successful independent researcher in environmental health and tobacco control."

Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is most common form of HF in the US and is
associated with high morbidity and mortality. HFpEF disproportionately affects women and non-Hispanic Black
persons. HFpEF is now understood as a heterogeneous syndrome intertwined with aging and multiple
comorbidities, and likely has multiple phenotypes. The pathophysiology remains incompletely understood and
few evidence-based treatments exist. This is the premise for HeartShare, a pivotal NHLBI initiative, whose
ultimate goals are to discover novel biological signals that will lead to actionable targets to inform future HFpEF
interventions.10 HeartShare is developing a Registry of 10,000 HF patients and matched comparators, and a
comprehensive 1000 participant Deep Phenotyping cohort. The Deep Phenotyping arm has to date recruited
262 participants from 7 sites. Of these, 80%, are White, and only 11% are African American, considerably
below the expected goal. There has developed a broad consensus among HeartShare stakeholders that
additional effort and support are needed to develop and implement strategies to help achieve diversity goals,
and specifically for a ‘Diversity Champion’ approach. Without the urgent, coordinated intervention in this
proposal to enhance inclusivity, participant diversity is likely to continue to be suboptimal, jeopardizing
HeartShare’s validity and generalizability. The Wake Forest-Atrium HeartShare Clinical Site has a diverse
investigator team, has consistently exceeded diversity enrollment targets in many clinical studies, and to date
leads overall Heart Share enrollment and has the highest percentage of female participants and the second
highest percentage of Black participants among the 7 sites. The overall goal of this proposal is to enhance
enrollment of under-represented groups across HeartShare sites by carrying out the following Aims: 1)
Completing a comprehensive assessment of resources and strategies for enrolling URM participants at each of
the clinical sites across HeartShare, as well as outcomes to date; 2) Utilizing the results of the comprehensive
assessment to develop optimal practices for enrollment of URM participants in HeartShare, test and refine
them at Wake Forest’s site, and then disseminate and help implement them across all HeartShare sites; 3)
Continuously monitor progress and dynamically adjust strategies as needed to help ensure optimal participant
diversity and inclusion across HeartShare. Our proposal is supported by: 1) An unexpected, compelling need
in a pivotal, ongoing NHLBI study; 2) Preliminary data indicating lack of a cohesive, robust, organized
approach to diversity and inclusion; 3) a diverse, multi-disciplinary leadership team consisting of a promising
minority female early career investigator combined with highly experienced senior investigators and staff, who
together have developed a strong track record for diverse participant enrollment in HeartShare and multiple
other trials; 4) enthusiastic support of the HeartShare Data Translational Center and Clinical Sites."

highly experienced Principal Investigators, SACERT goals are to increase timely progression to completion of
doctoral degree primarily among underrepresented pre-doctoral students, and to improve the educational and
mentoring climates of 12 participating institutions in South Africa. The focus of SACERT is chronic stress and
non-communicable chronic mental disorders including substance abuse, depression, and posttraumatic stress
disorder across the life course. SACERT responds directly to current national governmental initiatives to train
pre-doctoral students who are at the dissertation stage in the mental health field. We focus particularly on
building capacity of scholars in the nursing, social work, occupational therapy, psychology, psychiatry, and
public health fields to conduct translational mental health-related research via two pathways, Tracks A and B.
We will provide short-, medium-, and long-term research training which includes coursework and research
training in an intensive 3-month in-residence training at UCLA and a long-term mentorship (Track A), as well as
annual workshops in South Africa (Track B). The Specific Aims are to: 1) Implement a two-year
multidisciplinary training program at UCLA and in South Africa for four pre-doctoral Scholars (“Track A,” who
will be post-master’s degree, with approved dissertation proposals) per year (cumulative n=16) to: a) enhance
their research skills in the areas of chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders, b)
support their research productivity during the two-year tenure, and c) strengthen their relationships with

Aim 1 Scholars (n=4/year) and mentors (n=4/year) and additional Scholars who will be master’s and pre-
doctoral students (“Track B”; n=36/year for four years; cumulative n=144) and faculty (n=36/year), primarily
from historically disadvantaged universities, to: a) strengthen research and mentoring skills related to chronic
stress and non-communicable chronic mental health disorders, b) build and sustain a supportive network of
Scholars and mentors across primarily historically disadvantaged universities, and c) disseminate the results of
Scholars’ and mentors’ research related to chronic stress and non-communicable chronic mental health
disorders; 3) Provide mentorship training to Scholars’ mentors (n~16/year) to: a) enrich the mentor-scholar
dyad, b) increase capacity in South African university environments, and c) promote sustainability of our
research mentorship model; and 4) Evaluate these training and mentorship efforts with regard to: a) time to

 The skin serves as a primary barrier to the external world and is thus often injured. As such, rapid repair
of tissue damage is vital for organismal survival. Failure to repair wounds results in the formation of chronic or
non-healing wounds, which affect over 2% of the western population and cost an estimated 25 billion dollars to
manage annually. Immunosuppression is one major predisposing factor to chronic wound formation, indicating
that signals derived from immune cells are necessary for optimal repair. Yet, there is a significant gap in our
understanding of exactly how immune cells are activated and precisely how they crosstalk with the epithelium to
direct repair.
 Normal skin comprises a myriad of “homeostatic” immune cell types that actively patrol the tissue in
health and we find are rapidly activated and recruited to the site of injury. These include type 17 immune cell
subsets that have only been uncovered in the last 10 years and whole function in repair has not been studied in
immunocompetent animals. We systematically ablated each type 17 cell type to determine their role in activating
the wound edge epithelium and found that in type17-γδ T cells, but not other subsets are absolutely necessary
for wound -re-epithelialization. This crosstalk is mediated by the prototypic cytokines IL-17A/F signaling directly
into the epithelium via their receptor IL-17RC. Surprisingly, we uncovered that IL17RC signaling activates HIF1a
protein, and that this signaling axis is required for optimal HIF1a activation at the wound edge even in the pres-
ence of hypoxia. Loss of epithelial HIF1a profoundly disrupts wound re-epithelization indicating that this tran-
scription factor is a master regulator of epithelial activation at the wounds edge. While type17-γδ T cells have
been studied in pathogen responses, how they are recruited and activated in wounds is poorly understood.
Additionally, exactly how IL17 signaling induces HIF1a is unclear and the molecular targets of HIF1a that drive
repair require elucidation.
 We will address these fundamental questions in two independent aims: (1) How are type17-γδ T cells
recruited to and activated at the wound’s re-epithelizing front? ; (2) How does inflammatory HIF1a control re-
epithelialization programs downstream of IL-17? Decoding the molecular interactions between wound-associ-
ated lymphocytes and would edge epithelium, as we propose here, is an essential first step in finding immune-
based therapies for chronic non-healing wounds. Moreover, many inflammatory conditions and cancers, driven
by type 17 immunity, co-opt features wound repair. Thus, our studies will not only unearth fundamental mecha-
nisms of immune-epithelial crosstalk in repair, but may also provide novel therapeutic targets for a range of
type17 immunity-mediated epithelial pathologies."

Bacterial colonization of biomaterials is a common complication that often leads to infection and
necessitates implant replacement or removal. Reducing bacterial colonization and proliferation on the
implant by changing surface chemistry shows great promising in reducing inherent risk of infection.
Recently, modification of implant surfaces using simultaneous photopolymerization and photografting of
zwitterionic methacrylate monomers cross-linked hydrogels to cochlear implant and tympanostomy tube
biomaterials, reducing protein and cellular adhesion and subsequent fibrosis. For this work, we will
further modify this hydrogel coating with a secondary network to enhance mechanical properties while
imparting anti-bacterial effects. By utilizing the inherent swelling of the hydrogel, we will incorporate an
interpenetrating secondary network containing cationic monomers with anti-bacterial properties. This
approach will result in a coating that is both anti-fouling and anti-bacterial, with greater durability than
single network systems alone. The overall objective of this research is to synthesize and evaluate the
ability of cationic dual network systems to inhibit the growth and adhesion of common infectious
bacterial species while maintaining the antifibrotic properties of zwitterionic hydrogel coatings. We
hypothesize that cationic monomers in the secondary network will exhibit significant bactericidal
properties while preserving the antifibrotic properties of zwitterionic hydrogel coatings. These hydrogel
coatings will significantly reduce the complications associated with bacterial colonization and fibrosis of
cochlear implant and tympanostomy tube biomaterials. Additionally, this work will provide a deserving
researcher from an underrepresented group an exceptional career training and mentorship experience."

Health disparities affecting older adults reflect disparities across the life span with the added burden of ageism.
Black sexual minority men (BSMM) in particular, who comprise a substantial proportion of people with HIV, are
affected by large health disparities for multiple mental and physical health indicators that increase with age.
Aging sexual minority men and Black adults show low social connectedness (loneliness and social isolation),
which can lead to poor health outcomes. This application, submitted under PAR-21-350, proposes to use a
longitudinal mixed methods social network study to examine how changes in loneliness and social isolation are
related to changes in health and wellness among aging BSMM, and how multileveled social-ecological
contextual factors may mediate and moderate these associations, following the Sexual and Gender Minority
Health Framework and social isolation and intersectional stigma theories. The Specific Aims are to: (1) Test
associations of longitudinal trajectories of social disconnectedness (loneliness, social isolation) with mental and
physical health behaviors (healthcare engagement, adherence), quality of life, and chronic health conditions
(including HIV-related outcomes) among aging BSMM, a population that shows accelerated aging effects (due
to physiological “weathering” effects of systemic discrimination, and potentially, from HIV and its treatment); (2)
Examine structural (regional), community (neighborhood), social network (interpersonal), and individual level
resilience and risk factors that may explain, buffer, or amplify impacts of social disconnectedness on health
among BSMM; and (3) Engage with community experts to interpret results and discuss next steps for feasible
and acceptable multi-level interventions to increase positive social connections among aging BSMM. We will
recruit 400 Black SMM (200 with HIV, 200 without HIV) aged 40 and older, with a focus on high-priority
jurisdictions for the US Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative in Southern California and the state of Alabama.
Participants will be surveyed at baseline, 6-months, and 12-months; a subset of 80 participants will complete
longitudinal in-depth interviews to explain quantitative ratings of loneliness and isolation, and connections and
subgroups depicted on their social network diagram, as well as to suggest ideas for potential interventions to
address social disconnectedness (e.g., social prescribing, including acceptable activities and groups). In
accordance with community-based participatory research principles, we will engage with community experts in
Southern California and Alabama to interpret results and discuss ideas for multi-level feasible and acceptable
interventions to increase positive social connections and reduce disparities among aging BSMM. This research
is Stage 0-1 along the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, in which we are collecting
basic data in order to generate ideas for intervention, which will be tested in future clinical trials. Information
gained from this research will be broadly applicable to fostering healthy longevity for all aging Americans."

Allergic disease is a chronic inflammatory state where CD4+ T cells manifest a biased T helper 2 (Th2) cell
differentiation and effector phenotype. The polarization and ultimate effector function requires timed and
transient intracellular signaling regulated by positive and negative hemostatic factors. One such negative factor
we recently identified is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Both asthma
and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) are more common in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF, the
disease due to mutations in CFTR) and represent an exuberant CD4+ Th2 cell inflammatory response,
suggesting that CD4+ Th2 cells may be important in CF airway disease. We have studied the adaptive
inflammatory response to Alternaria alternata, a ubiquitous fungal aeroallergen that is associated with severe
asthma in Cftr-/- mice and found that compared to Cftr+/+ mice, Cftr-/- mice produce higher levels of the Th2
cytokines, IL-5 and IL-13. Moreover, Cftr-/- CD4+ T cells have increased in vitro Th2 polarization and cytokine
production compared to Cftr+/+ CD4+ T cells, suggesting that the absence of functional CFTR produces an
exaggerated Th2 response. Furthermore, we have found that the master regulator of Th2 cell differentiation
and function, GATA3, binds to the murine Cftr promoter following CD4+ T cell activation. Based upon these
preliminary results we hypothesize that CFTR functions to inhibit CD4+ T cell Th2 polarization and cytokine
production, and that CFTR expression is driven by GATA3 transcriptional activity. In Specific Aim 1 we will
determine the role of CFTR in negatively regulating CD4+ Th2 polarization and effector function. We will define
whether CFTR signaling is sufficient to inhibit Th2 polarization using CFTR overexpression in murine naïve
CD4+ T cells and whether endogenous CFTR expression inhibits Th2 cytokine production in Th2 polarized
murine CD4+ T cells. Specific Aim 2 will determine the importance on GATA3 binding on CFTR expression. We
will delineate whether GATA3 overexpression or transcriptional repression is sufficient or necessary for CFTR
expression, respectively. In Specific Aim 3 we will determine if CFTR modulation using recently FDA approved
small molecules capable of correcting or potentiating mutant and wild-type CFTR, 1) decreases Th2
polarization and/or effector function in healthy or CF human CD4+ T cells, 2) reduces Alternaria alternata
induced adaptive inflammation in a murine model expressing CFTR modulator-sensitive human CFTR, and 3)
decreases type 2 inflammatory biomarkers (IgE and eosinophils) in individuals with CF post-CFTR modulator
therapy compared to pre-CFTR modulator levels. Together these studies hold promise of elucidating the
importance of CFTR in CD4+ T cell biology and may represent a novel therapeutic approach to Th2 mediated
allergic disease. Importantly, this award will provide training in immunology from world-renowned
immunologists and cellular biologists to further my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician
scientist with expertise in pulmonary manifestations of CD4+ T cell mediated allergic disease."
11140032,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Intercellular adhesive junctions, including desmosomes and adherens junctions, connect epithelial cells within a
tissue to provide mechanical integrity, regulate cell sorting and migration, and control chemical signals that
further instruct cell decisions. In particular, desmosomes resist mechanical stress and respond to mechanical
cues to regulate complex cell behaviors to promote differentiation, facilitate migration and wound healing, and
mediate other functions critical in development and in diseases of many tissues, including the skin and heart.
While significant progress has been made identifying potential load-bearing elements within desmosomes, a
huge knowledge gap exists about their roles in epithelial mechanics and mechanotransduction. Specifically, the
mechanisms of force regulation across the desmosome-intermediate filament linkage are poorly understood.
There is limited direct evidence for when and even whether the molecular components of desmosomes bear
mechanical loads, the first step towards mechanotransduction. More importantly, still unaddressed is whether
specific desmosome components act as mechanosensors that determine the strength and duration of chemical
signaling pathways critical in adapting to mechanical stresses in tissues. Our previous studies showed the
capacity of desmosome-intermediate filament linkage in regulating cell mechanics, a role that has long been
regarded to belong solely to adherens junctions. This suggests the potential for desmosomal components to
participate in force regulation. In this MIRA project, building on these findings and leveraging a newly developed
single cell-cell adhesion interrogation platform, we will examine the important, but less studied, role that
desmosomes play in epithelial mechanics and in mechanotransduction. We will focus on two major research
thrust areas: 1) investigate the role desmosome plays in maintaining the mechanical integrity of epithelial cell-
cell junctions and 2) determine its potential in transducing mechanical cues at the junction in coordination with
mechanosensitive molecules at the adherens junctions and the actin network. Through a series of studies on
epithelial cells with desmosomal components harboring loss- and gain-of-function mutations, we will quantify the
contribution from each desmosomal protein in maintaining epithelial mechanical integrity in stressed conditions.
We will answer the question: How does actin-based contractility affect desmosome regulation of tension within
actin-based adhesive networks? We anticipate providing the first direct observation of desmosome serving as a
mechanotransduction site at the cell-cell junction. The proposed studies will enhance our understanding of how
desmosomes coordinate chemical and transcriptional pathways in response to mechanical tension in the
epithelia, lay the groundwork for similar studies of desmosome mechanosensing in other tissues, and ultimately
provide new knowledge to aid in developing treatments for disorders resulting from interference with these
adhesive junctions and their mechanosensing pathways."
11145396,"The complementary expertise and resources of Johns Hopkins University and RTI International are combined
as the NIH Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Cohort Study Data Analysis Center
(DAC). A DAC with expertise in informatics, epidemiology and biostatistics is essential for effective longitudinal

genetic susceptibility on pediatric health and adverse outcomes, with attention to solution-oriented research.
System enhancements, a secured computing environment, and experience with on-boarding sites will facilitate
an efficient, and effective transition from the first cycle (ECHO1) into the next cycle (ECHO2). DAC’s familiarity
with existing ECHO sites and data enables continued productivity concurrent with implementation of ECHO2.
DAC uniquely offers deep experience in developing innovative methods for analyzing data combined from
disparate sites, as evidenced in ECHO1. DAC will broaden access and useability of ECHO Cohort data to the
scientific community. To help drive the next generation science in pediatric research, expertise in
epidemiology, statistics, informatics, pediatric outcomes, environmental exposures, and genetics is synergized
to realize these specific aims: 1) Provide a secure, uniform and flexible central framework for data capture and
storage and tracking of biospecimens, and to ensure high data quality and fidelity; 2) Provide statistical and
epidemiological expertise in the design, analysis, and interpretation of research proposals, develop innovative
and novel analytical methods where needed, and conduct analyses under direction of relevant content area
scientists to enhance the scientific rigor and reproducibility of ECHO products; 3) Enhance research
infrastructure, integrate data standards to support findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)
principles to accelerate data sharing; 4) Use an organizational, reporting, and accountability structure for
optimal internal governance of the DAC and interaction with other components of the ECHO Cohort Study that
will enhance transparency, accountability, and clear communication. The proposed enhancements, tools, and
methods development for collecting, combining, and analyzing individual, geographic, family, and social data

10661128,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
This project has sought to understand the functions of the cathelicidin family of antimicrobial peptides in
mammalian immunity. Cathelicidins are an evolutionarily conserved gene family, with orthologous genes
present in several species. Conservation between family members resides primarily in the amino-terminal
precursor domain. The carboxy-terminal peptide domain has potent immunological activity, acting as an
endogenous direct antimicrobial that kills some pathogens. Our previous work has shown that this activity
is essential for resistance to invasive bacterial infection by S. aureus and Group A Streptococcus and
associated with several human inflammatory diseases. However, our group and others have found that
some of the human disease associations with cathelicidin are likely not a consequence of its antibiotic
activity but rather due to its immune activating activity. Several important observations prior to year 1
suggested that the human cathelicidin peptide LL37 will amplify inflammation by presenting nucleic acids
to cytosolic receptors. We termed this process "" innate immune vetting "" ."
10774815,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Safe and efficacious vaccines are needed to massively reduce the economic and human health costs of
HIV-1/AIDS, dengue, malaria, and COVID-19. This goal has been hindered by the genetic diversity of the
etiological pathogens. Randomized, controlled trials that rigorously assess the efficacy of candidate
vaccines to prevent infection and/or disease caused by these pathogens are a core research platform for
improving vaccines. Moreover, randomized efficacy trials of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody
(bnAb) regimens aid vaccine development. This project develops statistical methods for vaccine and bnAb
prevention efficacy trials, with purpose lo rigorously characterize multiple types of distinct and
complementary ""immune correlates,"" which are critical tools for driving the iterative research process for
improving vaccines. Aim 1 develops methods for assessing immune markers measured over lime as
correlates of instantaneous risk of acquisition of HIV-1 or SARS-CoV-2 (of any strain or with a strain with
a particular feature such as an amino acid (AA) sequence or neutralization phenotype) in (a) HIV-1 and
COVID-19 vaccine and (b) HIV-1 bnAb efficacy trials. Aim 2 develops methods for assessing immune
markers measured by a fixed time point post-vaccination in HIV-1, dengue, malaria, and COVID-19
vaccine efficacy (VE) trials as multiple types of correlates of protection: (a) an estimated optimal surrogate
a summary marker combining information from all markers that best predicts overall or feature-specific
outcome; (b) a correlate of VE la marker that modifies VE, studied via the statistical frameworks principal
stratification, controlled causal effects, and stochastic interventional causal effects. Aim 3 develops
dynamic recurrent event models for assessing (a) malaria VE against overall and circumsporozoite protein
(CSP) AA-specific malaria infection and disease, and (b} how CSP AA-specific malaria risk depends on
prior malaria infections and vaccination. Aim 4 develops causal methods for assessing vaccine and bnAb
efficacy to prevent (a) overall and (b) feature-specific HIV-1 acquisition in study populations defined by
certain patterns of pre-exposure prophylaxis use. The methods are developed with application lo 14
recently completed or ongoing VE trials (4 for HIV-1, 2 for dengue, 2 for malaria, 6 for COVID-19) and 2
HIV-1 bnAb efficacy trials. Collectively, the aims advance development of immune correlates based on
both immune marker data and pathogen genetic sequence/immunophenotype data."

10831065,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This K24 proposal will provide protected time for Dr. Cyndya Shibao to deliver high-quality mentoring to
post-doctoral and junior faculty investigators at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. In this regard, she
proposes a comprehensive and dedicated mentoring plan that will facilitate the effective transition of her
mentees into independent academic careers. Her application includes an across-the-board strategy to
augment her training through acquisition of advanced skills in mentoring, training in diversity, leadership, and
strategic planning. In addition, her research plan includes a cross-collaboration with members of the Feinstein
Institute of Bioelectronic Medicine to acquire additional expertise in vagus nerve stimulation, which is
thematically link to her current studies on parasympathetic cholinergic regulation of vascular oxidation.
 Endothelial dysfunction, a pro-thrombotic, inflammatory condition that causes impaired vascular reactivity is
an early reversible step in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Multiple
studies consistently shown that African Americans (AAs) have impaired endothelial function compared to
whites. African Americans also experience disproportionately higher CV morbidity and 20% higher mortality
than whites or Hispanics. Endothelial dysfunction is caused by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species
(ROS), particularly superoxide which interferes with endothelial-derived nitric oxide signaling pathways. One of
the major sources of superoxide is NADPH oxidase; our previous work found that activation of NADPH oxidase
contributes to vascular oxidation through immune cell activation. It is well-known that inflammation and
oxidative stress are modulated by the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS). Dr. Shibao and others
found that AAs have reduced PNS activity compared with whites. Currently, her funded studies are
focused on the effect of central acetylcholinesterase inhibition, which increases cholinergic activity, on vascular
oxidative stress in this population. For this K24 application, she will expand these studies to determine if trans-
auricular vagus nerve stimulation (TaVNS), another intervention that stimulates PNS, prevents immune cell
activation, reduces markers of vascular oxidation in harvested endothelial cells and improve endothelial
function as measured by flow-mediated dilation. The planned studies will provide a comprehensive
assessment of the mechanism underlying the effect of increased PNS transmission on vascular oxidation and
inflammation, which precedes endothelial dysfunction in African Americans. Furthermore, these studies will
provide ample training opportunities for Dr. Shibao’s mentees in the area of cholinergic regulation of vascular
oxidation."
11159287,"Elasticity imaging techniques generate quantitative measurements of the biomechanical properties of tissue
that serve as biomarkers for disease presence as well as enabling the characterization of its progression and
response to treatment. Both ultrasonic shearwave elastography (SWE) and magnetic resonance elastogra-
phy (MRE) are currently used clinically to assess liver fibrosis. The availability of standardized, calibrated
isotropic liver-mimicking phantoms that provided validation of the quantitative measurements gener-
ated by these imaging tools was critical to the success and clinical adoption of MRE and SWE for liver
fibrosis assessment. Although current efforts in elastography research are focused on developing quanti-
tative biomarkers for anisotropic tissues, such as skeletal muscle, nerve, and brain, a standard, anisotropic
tissue-mimicking phantom does not exist. Given the significant potential impact of imaging biomarkers in such
anisotropic tissues, and the amount of funding dedicated to their development, there clearly exists a criti-
cal and unmet need for standardized, reproducible and tunable anisotropic tissue-mimicking elasticity
imaging phantoms, the development and dissemination of which is the goal of this supplemental ap-
plication. The Nightingale group has been a pioneer of SWE techniques and a primary contributor to the de-
velopment, calibration, and standardization of liver-mimicking SWE phantoms. The Bayly group at Washington
University in St. Louis has developed 3D-printed, hydrogel lattice composite anisotropic phantoms that mimic
the mechanical and magnetic properties of brain tissue and can be imaged with MRE. The Bayly group has
also validated the mechanical properties of these phantoms using established benchtop dynamic shear testing
(DST) procedures. Our teams are collaborating to adapt these anisotropic MRE phantoms to mimic ultrasonic
imaging properties, and we have obtained preliminary data demonstrating the potential for the development of
multi-modality standardized calibrated anisotropic phantoms. In this supplement we propose to optimize fabrica-
tion processes to demonstrate phantom tunability and robustness, to validate phantom anisotropic mechanical
properties using established DST methods, to compare estimates of biomechanical parameters made with both
MRE and SWE, and to develop standard calibration imaging sequences and analysis tools. Upon successful
completion of the aims in this supplement, we will provide validated anisotropic multi-modality imag-
ing phantoms, and fabrication and calibration protocols to the elasticity imaging community through
the NIST/NIBIB Imaging Phantom Lending Library. Successful completion of this work will provide an
accessible, robust, industry-wide standard for testing and validation of anisotropic elasticity imaging
systems."
11159291,"Summary
Increasingly liberal cannabis policies in the U.S. have been associated with both “replacement”, whereby
cannabis is substituted for alcohol, thus decreasing alcohol use, and “enhancement”, whereby cannabis use
increases alcohol use. These conflicting patterns may be partially explained by the fact that the potency of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; the main psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis) in cannabis in the U.S.
varies widely, with legal-market cannabis containing increasingly higher THC potencies. When combined with
alcohol, cannabis may confer either synergistic or mitigating effects on craving, impulsivity, cognitive
impairment and subsequent drinking, likely depending on several factors, including cannabinoid dose and
content. The limited literature in this area has generated conflicting findings; some studies have shown that
THC increases alcohol intake and has synergistic effects on the subjective effects of alcohol, and others have
shown that THC decreases alcohol intake or has no effects on these outcomes. Emerging work also suggests
that alcohol and cannabis exert opposing effects on the digestive, immune, and central nervous systems,
collectively known as the microbiota-gut-brain-axis (MGBA). Alcohol is linked to immune dysfunction and
disturbances in gut microbial species (microbiota), and these MGBA disruptions have been associated with
neurobehavioral AUD symptoms (e.g., craving, impaired control). Conversely, preclinical data suggest that
cannabinoids may confer beneficial effects on aspects of the MGBA. The opposing findings regarding the
effects of cannabis on alcohol use may be partially due to the differential actions of cannabinoids throughout
the MGBA, which need to be better characterized in humans. Thus, the goal of this naturalistic study is to
explore effects of legal-market cannabis on acute and daily alcohol consumption, neurobehavioral AUD
phenotypes and MGBA function in heavy drinkers. We will recruit N=61 heavy drinking, regular users of legal-
market cannabis to complete daily diary measures of alcohol and cannabis use during two 7-day periods (a no-
cannabis period and an ad lib cannabis use period) and undergo two lab sessions; Visit A assesses cognitive
function, impulsivity, craving, alcohol self-administration, MGBA biomarkers and blood-THC levels in the
absence of acute cannabis, and Visit B tests the same outcomes following subjects’ self-administration of their
preferred legal-market cannabis in their homes. The study uses the Mobile Cannabinoid Pharmacology Lab
(an IRB-approved method developed by our team to test acute effects of legal-market cannabis and quantify
blood-THC). The PI, Dr. Karoly, will pursue training aims to broaden her skillset and enable her to develop
expertise in 1) MGBA analysis, 2) cannabinoid pharmacology, and 3) biostatistics. To guide her research and
training, Dr. Karoly has assembled a premiere mentorship team with expertise spanning these domains. She
will be well-supported as she develops the skills and expertise necessary to launch her independent, patient-
oriented, translational program of research focused on novel AUD treatment and harm reduction strategies."
11159091,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Mechanisms of inter-organ signaling have been established as hallmarks of nearly every
pathophysiologic condition, where many exist as related and complex diseases. While significant work has
been focused on understanding how individual cell types contribute and respond to specific perturbations
related to common, complex disease, an equally-important but relatively less-explored question involves how
relationships between organs are altered in the context of an integrated living organism. Current technical
advances, such as proteomic analysis of plasma or conditioned media, have allowed for a more unbiased
visualization and discovery of additional inter-tissue signaling molecules. However, one important feature
which is lacking from these approaches is the ability to gain insight as to the function, mechanisms of action
and target tissue(s) of relevant molecules. To begin to address these constraints, we initially developed a
correlation-based bioinformatics framework which uses multi-tissue gene expression and/or proteomic data, as
well as publicly available resources to statistically rank and functionally annotate endocrine proteins involved in
tissue cross-talk. Using this approach, we identified many known and experimentally validated several novel
inter-tissue circuits. This was this first study to directly link an endocrine-focused bioinformatics pipeline from
population data directly to experimentally-validated mechanisms of inter-tissue communication. While these
validations provide strong support for exploiting natural variation to discover new modes of communication,
these serve as simple proof-of-principle studies and, thus has promising potential for expansion. As a result,
we have developed a series of in silico tools to guide discovery of endocrine interactions. Specifically,
pathway-targeted enrichments, Bayesian network interrogation and scalable machine learning. The goal of
this proposal is to closely bridge these computational tools with experimental methods to systematically dissect
mechanisms by which tissues communicate and how these interactions are perturbed in metabolic disease
settings. Given that we survey genetic variation to guide prediction of new modes of endocrine
communication, these findings are likely to be robust across diverse backgrounds. We will implement high-
throughput screening of specific tissue communication circuits which operate under disease-specific conditions
of metabolism (ex. Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes), define which are conserved from mice to humans and
mechanistically dissect pathophysiologic impacts of endocrine communication through in vivo experimentation.
The success of these aims relies heavily on bridging computational and experimental approaches, justified by
the training and focus of the PI. Collectively, these objectives will begin with unbiased computational
approaches, validate using high-throughput in vitro assays and evaluate therapeutic potential of new endocrine
interactions using mouse models of disease."
11159095,"CORE D: SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The ability to effect change in healthcare is as dependent on a successful implementation as it is on the intervention itself. Personalization of screening and targeted risk reduction proposed by this Program Project is an ambitious undertaking that must be highly integrated with patient centered outcomes as proposed in this Core. In addition to clinical outcomes, the impact of the proposed interventions on patient-centered outcomes is affected by perceptions, behaviors, psychosocial outcomes, and personal costs. Therefore, optimizing adherence requires addressing perceptions and willingness to accept and try new approaches; this will be critical to the overall success of the project, as will the assessment of patient-centered outcomes. Perhaps the biggest challenge of a personalized screening approach is not whether it works, but whether, if it is shown to be better, it will be accepted and embraced, since it is a big departure from our practice today. The overarching objectives of the Patient Center Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness (PCO-CE) Core are to establish innovative approaches that improve education and adherence to breast cancer screening and risk reduction recommendations and guidelines, and to collect patient-centered outcomes data to support the cost- effectiveness analysis and the proposed Project Program Framework. The Patient Centered Outcomes and Cost-effectiveness (PCO-CE) will ensure enhanced translation, education, communication, and outcomes measurement with a focus on adherence and non-adherence to risk-based recommendations. The Core will aim to improve translation of personal data into breast cancer screening and risk reduction behaviors that match recommendations by creating and delivering educational innovative multi-media material for each risk-stratified screening recommendation in both English and Spanish, and testing if the materials improve participant: (a) understanding of breast cancer risk; (b) understanding of their screening recommendation, and (c) adherence to their risk recommendation. We will complement this effort by developing communication strategies and infrastructural interventions for radiologists, primary care physicians and other clinician groups to improve adherence to risk-based screening recommendations. Finally, the PCO-CE core will be responsible for integration of patient-centered outcomes measures within the framework of the cost-effectiveness analysis that will help make the case for broader generalization, dissemination, and adoption."
11159198,"Current modalities for preventing dental caries are insufficient, particularly when biofilms rapidly accumulate
under cariogenic conditions in susceptible individuals, requiring new approaches. In the previous funding period,
we studied the potential of catalytic (peroxidase mimics) iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) for controlled, pH-
dependent activation of hydrogen peroxide as a novel antibiofilm and anticaries treatment. We found that IONP
displays selective-biofilm targeting and elimination under cariogenic (acidic and sugar-rich) conditions, while also
reducing apatitic demineralization. In vivo studies revealed that IONP are highly effective against caries
development without affecting oral tissues and the oral microbiome diversity, confirming therapeutic precision.
We also discovered that an FDA-approved IONP formulation, ferumoxytol (FerIONP), displays similar acid pH-
activated antibiofilm and anticaries mechanisms in vivo. In search for ways to improve efficacy and applicability
to enhance current modalities, we tested the possibility of combining FerIONP with fluoride. We unexpectedly
found a remarkable synergy between FerIONP and stannous fluoride (SnF2) that was exceptionally effective in
preventing caries in a severe rodent caries model. In this renewal, we propose to further develop this treatment
regimen, and then understand its mechanisms of action as well as potential deleterious effects using laboratory,
in vivo and human in situ models to facilitate clinical translation and product development.
The significance of this work is to develop a more effective and targeted antibiofilm and caries preventive
approach for susceptible populations. We hypothesize that FerIONP interacts with SnF2 to modulate both
biological and physicochemical properties by increasing localized antibiofilm action and protection against
enamel demineralization, potentiating anticaries efficacy without increasing the concentration of agents. We will
perform dose-response studies to improve the efficacy of FerIONP/SnF2 and assess local and systemic
biological actions in vivo (Aim 1). We will assess enhanced antibiofilm and caries preventive performance at low
doses without deleterious effects on oral-gut microbiome or toxicity on oral mucosal tissues and vital organs. We
will compare with previous FerIONP regimen (internal control) and currently used antimicrobial fluoride (SnF2).
Then, we will investigate the mechanisms of action and biodistribution of FerIONP-SnF2 (Aim2). We will generate
specific FerIONP analogues to understand biofilm targeting specificity and their combined effects with SnF2 on
enamel structure. We will perform multi-omics to assess the influence on biofilm composition and functional
activities as well as biodistribution of FerIONP via radiolabeling. The impact on enamel structure will be
determined via physical-chemistry and spectroscopic methods. In Aim 3, we will further elucidate the bioactivity
of the improved formulations using the human intra-oral biofilm model with a clinically relevant topical treatment
regimen. We envision a viable and novel technology to target virulent biofilms and prevent caries in susceptible
individuals under high cariogenic conditions that will motivate product development and clinical efficacy studies."
10994014,"Project Summary: Early systemic dissemination, extraordinary local invasion, late diagnosis, and inadequate
response to the existing chemotherapy contribute to poor prognosis for pancreatic cancer patients. There is an
urgent need to identify novel therapies that would significantly improve survival in patients. While most pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinomas have mutations in Kras, multiple other genetic alterations contribute to molecular
oncogenesis and patient prognosis. These genetic lesions hold the key to novel personalized therapies for
pancreatic cancer patients but remain poorly explored. Identifying novel personalized therapeutic combinations
would be a significant advancement in combating PDAC.
We and others identified a novel ME2 deletion as a passenger deletion with SMAD4 loss, which is prevalent
in up to 30% of PDAC patients. By utilizing cell culture models, organoids, orthotopically-implanted mouse
models, and patient-derived xenografts of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with and without ME2-loss, we
made the novel observation that ME2 has a direct negative impact on tumor growth and metastasis in pancreatic
cancer. Here, we propose to investigate the molecular basis of ME2 loss-mediated oncogenesis in pancreatic
cancer. By utilizing a series of unbiased high-throughput screening approaches, we have identified novel
signaling alterations in pancreatic cancer cells due to ME2 loss. Hence, we will also investigate the effectiveness
of blocking the signaling pathways induced by the ME2 loss that facilitate aggressiveness in pancreatic cancer.
Such mechanisms potentially regulate tumor cell growth and invasiveness of low ME2-expressing tumor cells.
Thus, our studies will facilitate the development of new and more effective treatments for pancreatic cancer.
Our long-term goal is to determine the molecular basis of ME2 loss-mediated signaling that facilitates
invasiveness and metastasis in pancreatic cancer. In the first aim, we will utilize genetically engineered mice
models to investigate the impact of ME2 loss on pancreatic cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. The
second aim will investigate the molecular basis of ME2 loss-mediated aggressiveness in pancreatic cancer. Aim
3 will investigate the potential of personalized therapies for patients with ME2 loss by utilizing spontaneous
models and patient-derived xenografts and evaluate biomarkers and molecular regulators of their efficacy.
Collectively, the proposed studies employ an innovative and integrative approach to elucidate the molecular
basis of ME2 loss-mediated tumor progression and may uncover additional personalized therapies and
biomarkers of therapeutic efficacies for the treatment of aggressive pancreatic cancer."

also patients, students, providers and providers in training. The proposal has two aims, first to build an
administrative research and communication infrastructure to support, collaborate and coordinate efforts
between PR-REACH and the FDA OMHHE. To this end a PR-REACH leadership team, three research cores,
a training and mentoring core, and an advisory team will be created to: 1) employ innovative strategies,
trainings, education, and communication methods to understand Puerto Rican individuals preferences,
experiences and unmet needs regarding FDA approved treatments and medications, 2) leverage big data,
machine learning and artificial intelligence data analysis and local health data sources in PR to be able to
evaluate the safety and efficacy of FDA-approved products (therapeutics, diagnostics, and vaccines) and
products subject to EUAs/EUA expansion, and 3) identify barriers to clinical trial enrollment for Hispanic Puerto

will be conducted (aim 2) to advance the understanding of substance use disorder patients’ journey as
perspectives, preferences and unmet needs regarding substance use disorder (SUD) treatment with FDA

living in Puerto Rico as a model than can inform and guide subsequent extrapolation to Hispanics in the US.
These activities will be conducted in a 2-year period."
11144694,"Kidney stones are a painful and common health problem, occurring in 8-12% of the population. Most kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate (CaOx). Current therapies to prevent CaOx kidney stones have low efficacy, and recurrence rates are high. Pet dogs are an exceptional model of kidney stone disease. They naturally form CaOx kidney stones and share environmental and metabolic risk factors with humans. Using this natural model, we discovered a genetic variant in the uromodulin gene that has a profound effect on stone risk. Uromodulin (aka Tamm-Horsfall protein) is the most abundant protein secreted in urine and has long been linked to human kidney stone disease. The canine stone-risk variant is located within a sequence of uromodulin that is necessary for polymerization and excretion of small bioactive peptides. Our preliminary work demonstrated that both polymerization and peptides are disturbed in dogs with the variant, implicating these uromodulin features in stone pathogenesis. Our overarching objective is to identify the renal cellular and molecular mechanisms by which uromodulin polymerization status and peptides impact stone formation. 
The proposed study will test the hypothesis that defects in uromodulin polymerization status and peptides cause alterations in renal solute transporters/channels (Aim 1) and inflammatory cytokines involved in stone formation (Aim 2). The results of this work will identify disturbances in renal solute transport and inflammatory molecules that occur with abnormal uromodulin polymerization and peptide excretion. This will provide important insight into how uromodulin features affect its functions in the kidney. Uromodulin polymerization and peptide excretion can be modified with diet or drugs. Thus, the proposed research will lay the groundwork for future development of therapies to mitigate risk for CaOx kidney stone recurrence in humans."
11135992,"Project Summary
Tyrosine O-sulfation, i.e., transfer of a sulfonate group to tyrosine amino acid residues in proteins, is a
widespread posttranslational modification (PTM) in eukaryotic cells with a variety of known functions in health
and disease, including receptor binding, viral replication, inflammation, and retinal function. The enzymes that
catalyze tyrosine sulfation are located in the Golgi apparatus. The function of this organelle is to ensure that
correct protein modification occurs and to package proteins into vesicles for export to the cell surface, or the
extracellular environment. Because proteins must typically enter the Golgi to become sulfated, most known
sulfoproteins are secreted proteins or membrane proteins. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for global
PTM analysis in cells and tissues; however, large scale analysis of tyrosine O-sulfation has not been feasible,
due in part to its labile nature in the gas-phase environment of a mass spectrometer, and in part due to the lack
of appropriate data analysis strategies. In MS experiments, proteins are typically digested into smaller peptides,
which are ionized, detected, and fragmented to deduce sequence information. When measuring protein
phosphorylation, another rather labile PTM known to regulate Golgi disassembly and reassembly during cell
division, in interphase vs. mitotic Golgi, we found that tyrosine O-sulfation was co-enriched. This discovery is
not surprising because the chemical properties of sulfation (O-SO3) are similar to phosphorylation (O-PO3H).
However; high mass accuracy measurements are required to deduce the small mass difference of 0.0095 Da
between these two PTMs. Even as such high performance measurements are becoming more routine, standard
database search tools typically do not identify protein sulfation because this PTM is completely lost during
analysis. We found that open database searching was able to overcome this problem and, thus, we were able
to accomplish identification of a number of novel sulfoproteins in rat liver Golgi. While an exciting advance, the
exact location of O-sulfation within proteolytic peptides could not be directly measured. In Aim 1 of this proposal,
we seek to develop improved methods for detection of intact sulfopeptides by MS, including elimination of
competing phosphorylation, determination of peptide sequence effects, implementation of stabilizing adducts,
and conditions that selectively dissociate sulfopeptides. To further allow sulfate site localization, in Aim 2, we
seek to develop technologies for fragmenting sulfopeptides while retaining sulfate in fragment ions. These
approaches include negative ion mode free radical initiated peptide sequencing, which allows sulfopeptides to
enter the mass spectrometer as more stable anions, and the development of “smart” data acquisition strategies
for improved electron transfer dissociation. The final Aim 3 seeks to apply these improved approaches for
comprehensive analysis of the Golgi sulfoproteome in cells and animal tissue, particularly under perturbed Golgi

information regarding the regulatory roles of tyrosine sulfation and its impact on cellular function."
11144633,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) maintain blood homeostasis through a delicate balance in fate choices of
self-renewal and commitment to differentiation. An imbalance in HSC fate choices is the key contributor to
hematologic diseases that affect millions of people. HSC fate choices is maintained by coordinated symmetric
self-renewal, symmetric commitment and asymmetric divisions. Thus, understanding the control of HSC
division choices holds therapeutic potential for hematopoietic diseases. However, our knowledge on the control
of HSC divisions is still lacking. Here, I aim to fill the gap by implementing novel systems and high-throughput
assays to interrogate HSC fate choices. We recently revealed a unique role of m6A RNA methylation that is
essential for HSC symmetric commitment, the division choice that is critical for the rapid replenishment of
mature blood cells upon stress. Hence, I propose to leverage the m6A deficient HSCs as a novel system to
elucidate the m6A-associated molecular programs in controlling HSC symmetric commitment. To uncover
novel regulators in HSC fate choices, I aim to define the role of the understudied RBP NYNRIN, which is a
stemness factor identified from my preliminary data and our recent AML-iPSC study, in controlling HSC
divisions. I also aim to implement FATE-seq, a novel method involves HSC barcoding followed by in vitro
division and single cell RNAseq that allows for a global assessment of HSC divisions. FATE-seq as an
orthogonal system will identify novel regulators of HSC fate choices. The Specific Aims are: (1): Characterize
the HSC-like intermediate state controlled by m6A RNA methylation. (2): Determine the molecular programs
driven by m6A RNA methylation in controlling HSC symmetric commitment. (3): Uncover novel regulators in
HSC symmetric and asymmetric fate decisions. Success of this work will define the novel regulators of HSC
fate control and provide novel therapeutic opportunities for hematological diseases and stem cell expansion.
Dr. Hanzhi Luo is currently a postdoc fellow in the Molecular Pharmacology program at the Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center. Her initial achievements include uncovering m6A's role in HSC symmetric
commitment, as well as revealing the RUNX1 dependency in leukemia stem cells with the AML-iPSC model.
Both studies were recently published in Cell Reports. Her long-term goal is to establish a research team with
an emphasis on molecular mechanisms of HSC fate choices with a strong commitment to translate basic
sdiscoveries into the clinic. The proposed research will provide new training for Dr. Luo in hematopoiesis and
RNA regulators. This work will be performed at the MSKCC, an exciting research environment with cutting-
edge facilities. Dr. Luo will be mentored by Dr. Michael Kharas, a leading expert in studying RNA regulators
in normal and malignant stem cells, and a dedicated supporter for young trainees. Together, this career
development plan will help Dr. Luo establish her independent research lab at a research-oriented academic
institute and become a leader in the field of hematopoiesis."

 From the moment of fertilization to birth, the maternal immune system evolves, adapts, and supports the
growth of a fetal allograft that ultimately perpetuates the human race. Immunological changes throughout a
pregnancy play a key deterministic role in the success of the pregnancy. While pregnancy was historically
regarded as a simple shift towards tolerance, emerging immunological data point to remarkable dynamic
changes during pregnancy. The pregnancy immunome must protect the fetus from a maternal attack while at
the same time it must afford the maternal-fetal dyad protection from invading pathogens. The health of the mother
and the fetus requires that these two opposing immunological tasks work in concert. Thus collectively, pregnancy
marks a whirlwind of immune adaptations that render the pregnant immune system a truly unique immunologic
marvel. Despite our growing appreciation for these highly controlled dynamic shifts, the precise mechanisms that
lead to optimal pregnancy health, profoundly impacting both mother and fetus, are incompletely understood,
delaying the development of targeted therapies for this population. Capitalizing on this unique moment in vaccine
history, with the introduction of several novel-vaccine platforms for SARS-CoV-2, the consortium will build a
Pregnancy Immune Atlas via the application of high-density immunological profiling technologies to deeply and
comprehensively dissect the overall changes that occur across pregnancy and how the immune system, as a
collective, responds to in vivo perturbations with vaccines. Using both de novo vaccine induced immune
responses and booster vaccination, the consortium will capture overall changes in the pregnant ImmunOME as
well as shifts in the pregnant AdaptOME to fully capture the immunological mechanisms that govern the balanced
growth of the fetus and battle of the maternal:fetal dyad against invading pathogens. Thus, together the Maternal
‘Omics to Maximize Immunity (MOMi) consortium seeks to build the foundational data to advance our
knowledge of natural tolerance, fertility, shifts in immunity during pregnancy to better understand this evolutionary
marvel required for the perpetuation of the human species."
11144647,"Abstract (Overall) 
The goal of the KIDney Single cell and Spatial Molecular Atlas Project (KIDSSMAP) is to create an anatomical
and molecular “metaverse” of the human kidney. KIDSSMAP will accomplish this by generating multiscalar,
multidimensional and multimodal maps of the adult non-diseased human kidney at a single cell resolution. This
work will build on and extend the existing efforts of the investigative team through the first phase of HuBMAP.
We will specifically focus on micro functional tissue units (FTUs) and structures that are along the cortico-
medullary axis of the kidney. The technologies generating data include paired single nucleus chromatin
accessibility and RNA expression (snRNA/ATAC-seq -cell type and state diversity), smFISH and DART-FISH
(targeted high resolution spatial interrogation of 30-1000 transcripts), spatial transcriptomics (untargeted
genome wide spatial mapping of dissociative technologies), CODEX (multiplexed spatial protein interrogation
to bridge with RNA technologies and 3D IF technologies), 3D multiplexed immunofluorescence (3D IF-
subcellular resolution to define neighborhoods in microFTUs), lightsheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM-
anatomical maps at mesoscale of key and 3D maps of neurovascular associations with FTUs) and Scattering
Raman Spectroscopy (SRS-2D, 3D label free volumetric mapping at subcellular scale). The maps generated
will define quantitative metrics of cell diversity, spatial defined neighborhoods across wide scales for different
types of analytes interrogated by a diverse set of single call based and spatial technologies encompassing
chromatin states, gene expression, protein, extracellular matrix, metabolites and lipids ranging from subcellular
to volumetric meso and anatomic scale. These will be further augmented by characterizing biologically diverse
(sex, age, race) samples. These tasks will be accomplished through a KIDney Organ Specific Project
(KIDOSP) and a KIDney Data Analysis Center (KIDDAC), with their outputs, milestones and delivery to the
HIVE centrally managed. KIDSSMAP is formed by the alliance of investigators who have extensive expertise in
kidney tissue interrogation, spatial mapping and data integration. The investigators have a track record of
contributing to large consortia such as HuBMAP and KPMP through fruitful and collaborative interactions. By
mapping the human kidney with its diverse functional units at high resolution and large scale, KDSSMAP will
generate a valuable resource for the community to understand kidney health and disease."

Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) has set out to deliver a cancer-free frontier across the Mountain West and
beyond. Our Cancer Center’s impact extends throughout the 5-state Mountain West (Idaho, Montana, Nevada,
Utah, Wyoming), a region not served by any other National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Cancer Center.
The Mountain West is home to over 10,000,000 people, including more than 40 American Indian Tribal
Nations. Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, Director of the National Institutes of Health, recently noted that American
Indians in the United States have the very worst cancer outcomes – they have not benefited from the advances
that have improved outcomes for nearly every other population in the country.
HCI has a long-standing commitment to serving these populations, as evidenced by our 22-year-old American
Indian Program. Through our American Indian Program, HCI is poised to build upon current tribal relationships
to listen and learn from local tribal members to understand what we are missing and how we can increase
American Indian and Alaskan Native (AI/AN) survival rates, improve community interventions, and transform
the way health research is perceived and conducted in tribal communities.
The objective of this supplement is to advance knowledge and build relationships to improve cancer-related
outcomes for AI/AN populations. We will accomplish this by establishing and convening an initial meeting of an
AI/AN Think Tank at HCI with the goal of bringing key stakeholders and partners to the table for listening,
discussion, and learning about the critical lack of medical options available to AI/AN populations and
determination of potential solutions through: new research avenues directed specifically toward these
populations, retraining current workers, and training the next generation of researchers to tackle these urgent
issues. This Think Tank will accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) Determine the key cancer health issues
within AI/AN communities that research can help address, 2) Understand how to combine traditional ways of
knowing with Western science to develop innovative solutions, and 3) Develop sustainable interventions that
will increase the cancer survival rate for AI/AN populations.
This work will be driven by the AI/AN Tribal members, but fully supported and endorsed by 13 NCI-designated
Cancer Centers, who have convened to form a consortium of Centers that are highly supportive of and
engaged with AI/AN communities."

accelerate its contributions to cancer research in the next funding period."
10934656,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Overview:
Animal genomes provide instructions for producing an amazing diversity of cell types during development, perhaps
especially in the brain. One of the most surprising findings in the genome-sequencing era has been how few genes
there are - only about 25,000 in most animal genomes regardless of their size or complexity. How do these genes
interact during development to produce the incredible diversity of cell types? What kinds of genetic changes have
allowed neural cell types to be modified or to increase in number across species over evolutionary time? In order to
address such questions, we propose to use the insect retina as a model to understand the genetic basis of neural
cell type evolution. Insect eyes can be incredibly diverse in some ways and yet rigidly conserved in others. Compound
eyes are highly recognizable given their characteristic structure. Yet these structures can vary in morphology and
underlying organization in sometimes dramatic ways to help adapt insects to thrive in diverse environments around the
world. For example, butterflies have expanded color vision using a more complex retinal mosaic, while house flies have
a novel neural type that improves target detection and tracking. Hidden underneath the surface, mosquito eyes have
dramatically rearranged and highly regionalized retinas, potentially for host and water detection. We present preliminary
data which suggests that, overall, insect eye patterning is incredibly highly conserved and uses the same transcription
factors and signaling pathways to define core cell types across species. This begs the question: What kinds of genetic
changes underlie the dramatic differences found in some groups? How does this deeply conserved, highly organized
feature evolve modified or novel functions? We will use a combination of new genomic and genetic tools such as single
cell sequencing and CR IPSR/Cas9 genome editing to characterize differences across species, test the function of
candidate genes directly in species of interest, and to identify and test gene regulatory regions responsible for neural
cell type evolution. We will uncover how gene regulatory networks can be modified to reorganize tissues and to produce
novel types of eel Is.
Intellectual Merit:
The Drosophila retina has been a premier model for the study of cell fate specification for many years. Now, new tools
have opened the door to asking questions about how this exquisitely patterned structure evolves across species. The
field is primed to understand how genetic networks specify an incredible diversity of neural fates and how changes in
genome sequence shape that diversity. Our comparative approach will determine how the insect visual system has
been modified over time in response to natural and sexual selection to produce new arrangements, modified functions,
and novel types of neurons. Key questions include: 1) What types of genes are responsible for neural cell type evolution,
and how are changes in their expression achieved? 2) How do novel neural types arise, increasing neural complexity?
3) How are deeply conserved developmental processes modified or added to without disrupting core ancestral function?
4) How do such changes influence animal behavior? We will identify fundamental principles by which processes such
as cell fate specification evolve. This research will enhance our understanding of the evolution of complex traits
and has broad implications for understanding how the genome encodes neural diversity and function.
Broader Impacts:
Using butterflies as a charismatic means of engagement, this project will enable educational activities at three
levels: Citizen Science, 5th-12th graders, and undergraduate students. 1) Citizen Science research will engage
dozens of regional students and adults annually in collaboration with the San Diego Botanic Garden and the UC Reserve
System. This project will use group butterfly walks at the Gardens and at Scripps Coastal Reserve to survey and monitor
local butterflies and investigate differences in visual function. Cataloging insect interaction in the field has inspired
several projects in our lab, and community members are regular contributors to efforts aimed at rearing new species.
Results of the survey will be used in conservation and resource management efforts as well as inspire science in the
lab. 2) Focusing on underrepresented groups from under-resourced schools, we will introduce middle and high school
students to ""what it means to be a scientist"" through a combination of lab and classroom visits. 3) In collaboration with
the UCSD Green Initiative, an undergraduate-led effort will install a native pollinator garden on campus as a resource
for student research, education, and outreach projects."
11177532,"Within the Division of Population Health Research (DiPHR), the Contraceptive Development Program (CDP) at NICHD supports research to develop compounds that can disrupt normal ovulation, sperm production or sperm function for the purpose of developing safe, effective and affordable contraceptives for women or men. The Biological Testing Facility (BTF) is a critical component in this process designed to allow rapid evaluation of new compositions-of-matter, drug formulations, delivery systems, and devices for contraceptive and endocrine activity. The BTF provides overall project management and the capabilities to support all phases of preclinical activities pursuant to development of new contraceptive methods: these include, but are not limited to administrative support, manuscript support, contraceptive target discovery database, in vitro and in vivo assays, plasma and microsomal stability studies, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET), pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiling, animal studies, manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), process and product development, formulation, clinical lot production, preclinical enabling studies and associated tasks leading to the filing of investigational new drug (IND) applications. Compounds formulated by the BTF that are prepared under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) will allow clinical evaluation in the CDP’s Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The CCTN investigators have developed protocols to evaluate the drug candidates identified as high priority by the Program. The BTF has been working with the CORs for the Chemical Synthesis Facility and the CCTN and with the investigators in the CCTN to develop and test the appropriate formulations for clinical batches of the candidate compounds. The next clinical study for each candidate drug is dependent on timely receipt of clinical batches to begin the process of recruitment and enrollment. Drugs that are currently in ongoing clinical trials require stability testing of the clinical formulations. The Biological Testing Facility plays a critical role in the drug development mission of the CDP.  

The objective of this task order is to support services for manufacture, stability testing, and clinical formulation development using in house or appropriate subcontract facilities including but not limited to administrative support, manuscript support, discovery database, clinical formulation research and development, stability testing, and clinical manufacturing for use in preclinical studies and clinical trials of potential contraceptive products. New chemical entities (NCEs) and/or active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) in appropriate formulation and appropriate concentrations will be provided under this task.  The task requires that the contractor provide documentation and reports of studies to support regulatory filings acceptable to stringent regulatory agencies in support of clinical trials and ultimately toward filing a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval of a contraceptive method."
11146922,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Efficient and user-friendly paradigms to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia are needed in primary
care. The UCSF Brain Health Assessment accurately detects cognitive impairment via an appealing tablet
interface with automated scoring and EMR integration. With the first round of funding, we validated the paradigm
in English and Spanish speakers, developed regression-based norms that accurately classify patients by their
likelihood of impairment, identified racial and ethnic disparities and barriers to brain health care, and at UCSF
primary care the paradigm increased diagnosis rates by 40%. The primary goals of the proposed work are to
evaluate the effectiveness of the paradigm for improving brain health care via a large pragmatic trial, to address
challenges to implementation, and to pioneer precision medicine approaches to reference group adjustments. In
Aim 1, we will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized trial in 26 Kaiser Southern California primary care clinics
to determine the effectiveness of the paradigm on detection rates and other brain health outcomes. In Aim 2, we
will identify and address challenges to implementation and sustainability. In Aim 3, we will further diversify our
well-characterized reference group and refine our detection algorithms to adjust for social determinants of brain
health (not race), which is novel and also critical for a paradigm to be appropriate for all members of the
increasingly diverse U.S. older adult population. If successful, this work will produce a validated paradigm that
is available to address the unmet need to detect cognitive impairment, including dementia, in large and diverse
populations seen in primary care, and provide useful information about wide scale implementation of the
paradigm to mitigate healthcare disparities and improve brain health care."

The inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are comprised equally of two major subtypes, Crohn's disease and
ulcerative colitis, with a peak age of onset between 15-30 years of age. As for many immune-mediated
inflammatory diseases (IMID), IBD incidence is rising world-wide, especially among diverse populations.
Although IBD prevalence in LatinX and Black populations in North America is lower, compared to European
ancestry populations, outcomes are often worse, for myriad reasons, including diagnostic delays and reduced
access to care and disease-modifying treatments.
The NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium (IBDGC) was established in 2002, with the major goal of developing a
thorough understanding of the genetic structure of IBD to elucidate the pathophysiology of IBD for improved
patient outcomes. The NIDDK IBDGC is comprised of 7 Genetics Research Centers (GRCs) sited at major IBD
centers in the United States and Canada, and a Data Coordinating Center (DCC). Biospecimens, immortalized
cell lines and phenotypic and genomic datasets from the IBDGC are available via the NIDDK Central Repository
and dbGaP. The IBDGC also acts as a coordinating center for the International IBD Genetics Consortium. The
major priority of the IBDGC during the current funding period (2022-2027) is to enhance recruitment of LatinX
and Black IBD cohorts, for both social justice and scientific reasons. The NIDDK IBDGC has developed protocols
and workflows to enhance diverse patient recruitment throughout North America (including direct to patient),
reaching beyond highly resourced IBD-specialized centers.
Common data elements (CDEs) for IBD do not currently exist. Therefore, in this supplement request, the IBDGC
DCC, in collaboration with the University of Miami GRC and with other IBDGC investigators, is proposing
development of IBD-related CDEs for submission to the NIH CDE Repository, NIH endorsement and
dissemination. CDE development will leverage extant forms developed by the NIDDK IBDGC. Form-based,
research-focused CDEs will be integrated with major model-based research and clinical care, such as HL7/FHIR,
PheCodes, LOINC and OMOP structures, with harmonization and validation between two major health systems,
the University of Miami and the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York. CDEs and form-based
models directed toward patient - primary care provider - general gastroenterologist - IBD specialist referral
efficiencies will be developed. CDEs will provide the building blocks by which AI-assisted forms and models can
be developed for patients, primary care providers, general gastroenterologists and IBD subspecialty centers.
Development of CDEs for IBD will enhance clinical and translational research in IBD, facilitate recruitment among
diverse populations, enhance opportunities for collaboration and allow extant IBD resources to be more fully
leveraged, such as the lymphoblastoid cell lines, other biospecimens and matched genetic and phenotypic data
deposited by the IBDGC at the NIDDK Central Repository, providing broad community value."

epidemiology, biostatistics, and surveillance emerging as integral components of the multidisciplinary research
mounted at Johns Hopkins during the current pandemic. We propose development of a Serological Sciences
Center of Excellence: the Johns Hopkins Excellence in Pathogenesis and Immunity Center for SARS-CoV-2
(JH-EPICS). The overarching goal of JH-EPICS is to distinguish immune responses that protect from those
that cause pathology during infection. Under the Multiple PI leadership of Drs. Klein and Cox, the JH-EPICS
Administrative Core will ensure resources and samples are available to systematically evaluate innate, T cell,
and antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serological samples from
COVID-19 patients sampled longitudinally. JH-EPICS contains three interconnecting Research Projects (RPs).
RP1 focuses on innate immune sensing and activation of the human inflammasome by SARS-CoV-2, with
evaluation of how anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies modulate innate sensing. RP2 uses a novel flow-cytometry
based platform that enables single cell analysis of traditional cell surface markers combined with intracellular
staining for proteins involved in metabolic programming. Using this platform, we have identified distinct myeloid
derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and T cells abundant in COVID-19. RP1 will characterize these MDSCs,
while RP2 will explore novel populations of T cells identified in COVID-19 patients. RP2 will also define novel
biomarkers in order to predict severity of disease, track the course of disease, and define novel surrogate
markers for testing therapeutic regimens. Together, RP1 and RP2 will identify novel therapeutic targets. In
RP3, the magnitude, duration, and class switching of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody isotypes as well as virus-
specific neutralizing antibody responses will be analyzed and compared with non-neutralizing antibody
functions, e.g., complement fixation and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, using a novel core set of
serological assays. A centralized Virology Reagent Core will provide antigen for ELISAs, reagents to identify
virus-specific immune cell populations, inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viruses, methods for quantifying SARS-CoV-
2, and access to biosafety level 3 facilities and training needed to perform any experiments involving live
SARS-CoV-2. The Analysis Resource Core will provide statistical modeling and analysis to frame and test
hypotheses about the mechanisms mediating the severity of COVID-19 as well as the intersectionality of sex,
gender, age, and racial differences in immune mechanisms of COVID-19. In concert with the trans-network
collaborations, this research will provide significant insights into pathologic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2,
identification of novel therapeutic targets, and definition of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. By
uncovering the correlates of protective immunity, JH-EPICS research will further enhance vaccine design and
evaluation of vaccine candidates."

Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome (HDGC) is a hereditary condition associated with increased risk of
diffuse gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer. While HDGC is classically caused by germline mutations in the
CDH1 gene, recent evidence has identified the CTNNA1 gene, coding for α-E-catenin, as a new putative HDGC
risk gene. We previously showed that 12% and 67% of individuals with a CTNNA1 loss-of-function (LOF) variant
identified on multigene panel testing had a personal history of diffuse gastric cancer or breast cancer
respectively. However, given limitations of previously collected data the extent and magnitude of the cancer
risks associated with LOF variants in CTNNA1 remain uncertain at this time. Elucidating accurate cancer risk
estimates for CTNNA1 LOF variant carriers is critical to allow for proper cancer risk management of this affected
cohort as well as their family members. Our preliminary data demonstrates that CTNNA1 LOF variant carriers
can be successfully recruited as study participants, enabling collection of detailed personal and family history
with creation of three-generation pedigrees that can be used for cancer penetrance analyses. Furthermore, we
show that CTNNA1 LOF variant carriers may have differing variant-specific cancer risks, with potentially reduced
gastric cancer risk associated with C-terminal LOF variants. Finally, we demonstrate that patient-derived gastric
organoids, including from CTNNA1 LOF variant carriers, can be successfully established. Taken together we
hypothesize that CTNNA1 LOF variant-specific cancer risks can be established through a combination
of improved cancer penetrance estimates and patient-derived gastric organoid models. We will
investigate this hypothesis by first defining the cancer penetrance of CTNNA1 LOF variant carriers through the
prospective CTNNA1 Family Expansion (CAFÉ) Study, enabling collection of detailed personal and family
medical history, with subsequent creation of three-generation pedigrees that will be utilized for cancer
penetrance analysis. Secondly, we will determine CTNNA1 variant-specific gastric tumorigenesis using patient-
derived gastric organoids, which are invaluable tools for recapitulating gastric cancer development. We will
utilize these patient-derived gastric organoids to test the carcinogenic potential of different CTNNA1 LOF
variants. Together, the study results from this proposal will be critical for establishing variant-specific cancer
risks for CTNNA1 LOF variants, which will ultimately help inform cancer risk management decisions for these
affected patients and their families."

Systems biology models provide an effective way to study the functional impact of biological process within
complex disease system. Despite a plethora of knowledge on the differential equation-based systems biology
model have gained, there are still major gaps in raising dynamic models within the context of human diseases.
Essentially, the parameters involved in the non-linear dependencies are largely unknown under disease
conditions and the systems biology models are always within a reductionist paradigm, which can hardly
characterize the complicated disease system. The large amount of single-cell, spatial or tissue multi-omics data
obtained from disease tissue has been proven to be endowed with the potential to deliver information on a cell
functioning state and its underlying phenotypic switches. Hence, advanced systems biology models and
computational tools are in pressing need to empower reliable characterization of biological processes and their
functional roles in disease by using multi-omics data. Our preliminary data include (1) a new computational
method to approximate systems biology model using transcriptomics data, and (2) computational principles to
approximate dynamic system by using omics data, which form the methodology and theoretical foundations of
this project. In this MIRA project, I proposed to develop a suite of novel computational methods, systems biology
models and quantitative metrics to bring the following unmet capabilities: (1) A computational framework to
establish dynamic models using omics data, which will enable the following analyses to study a complex disease
system: (i) assessing sample-wise activity of biological processes; (ii) perturbation analysis to evaluate the
impacts of biological features or model structures to the system, which could serve as new drug targets, and (iii)
evaluating how the system evolve through disease progression; (2) A natural language processing-based
extraction of biological functions and relations to automatically establish context specific knowledge of system
structure and components from scientific literature datal; and (3) computational principles and theories of the
identifiability and mathematical representation of dynamic systems in omics data. By implementing these
methods into multi-omics data analysis, we plan to address the following outstanding biological questions: (i)
identification of molecular features with high impact to metabolic variations in different diseases, (ii) the role of
metabolism in fueling epigenetic regulation, (iii) transcriptional regulation of metabolism and other biological
processes, (iv) functional annotation of genetic variations, and (v) assessment of biochemical variations. We will
also develop novel knowledge representation and transfer of metabolic and other variations in pan-disease
analysis to aid in better understanding of the basic disease pathology and promote the precision medicine
research, including prediction and validation of new biomarkers, nutrition recommendation, and drug repurposing.
Successful execution of the proposed research will provide a suite of computational capabilities to quantify and
study general biological processes that could be broadly utilized by the biomedical research community."

Since its establishment in 2001, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development (NICHD) has been instrumental in supporting the collection, analysis,
and dissemination of data from pelvic floor disorder studies through the Pelvic Floor Disorders
Network (PFDN). Over the years, the PFDN has systematically vetted and reused standard data
collection instruments specific to pelvic floor disorder studies research, laying the groundwork
for the development of common data elements (CDEs). This project will create standardized
CDEs for the pelvic floor disorders research community to enhance data consistency and
comparability across studies."

Vision is an active sense, with eye movements powerfully shaping the acquisition of visual
information about the world. This project investigates how motor learning adjusts the neural
circuitry controlling eye movements, to maintain the accuracy of eye movements over short and
long time scales. The specific focus of the research is to understand how oculomotor learning,
i.e., improvement of the accuracy of eye movements through experience, is transferred from
short-term to long-term storage. This consolidation process occurs, not only for motor skills like
eye movements, but is a general feature of learning and memory systems. Some memories,
including oculomotor memories, are transformed during the time after the initial acquisition of the
memory, in a way that renders older, consolidated memories independent of brain areas that are
critical for newer memories. This process, known as systems consolidation, is thought to depend
on activity of neurons in the brain area initially critical for the memory, and the hypothesis is that
this activity induces changes in the brain area(s) supporting long-term storage of the memory.
The proposed research characterizes the nature of the neural signals transmitted between brain
areas supporting memory at different times after their acquisition, and the rules that operate on
those neural signals to implement stable transfer of a memory from one brain area to another."
10798362,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) establishes a latent infection in hematopoietic progenitor cells
(HPCs) and cells of the myeloid lineage and its reactivation is exquisitely linked to hematopoietic
differentiation and stress. Latency is poorly defined for HCMV at the molecular and cellular level. The
long-term goal of our work has been to define the mechanisms by which HCMV enters and exits the latent
infection. The UL 133-UL 138 locus coordinates the expression of four genes, UL 133, UL 135, UL 136, and
UL 138 with pro-latency and pro-reactivation functions. We have defined the cellular pathways modulated
by these viral proteins to define mechanisms of latency and reactivation. Our work has shown that
accumulation of the reactivation determinant, UL 136p33, is controlled by the host E3 ubiquitin ligase
IDOL, which is induced by the liver X receptor in response to sterol levels. Maintenance of low levels of
UL 136p33 by IDOL is critical for the establishment of latency and downregulation of IDOL with
differentiation is important for reactivation. A host target of IDOL is the low-density lipoprotein receptor
(LDLR). We determined that HCMV infection downregulates LDLR and prevents the maturation of LDLR
through the ER. We show that UL 138 is important in driving ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of
immature LDLR forms in infection. UL 138 further is required for the induction of the unfolded protein
response and sterols in infection. We have identified UL 138-host interactors important to ERAD and
regulation of the unfolded protein response and ER stress. We hypothesize that UL 138 regulates ER
stress, proteostasis, and sterol metabolism important for viral latency through its ERAD-related host
interactions. We will determine how UL 138 regulates ERAD by defining virus-host interactions (Aim 1),
how UL 138-mediated regulation of ERAD impacts ER stress and lipogenesis/sterol synthesis in infection
(Aim 2), and how this regulation of host pathways impacts the regulation of latency and reactivation (Aim
3). We anticipate that UL 138 regulation of ERAD impacts the cellular sterol environment sensed by HCMV
to control UL 136p33 levels through changes in IDOL concentration for latency. Our work reveals new
mechanisms by which HCMV controls UPR/ERAD with implications for the regulation of ER stress and
sterol synthesis to regulate HCMV latency and reactivation. Defining these mechanisms elucidates novel
host pathways important for HCMV latency and reactivation."
10805634,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Fully exploiting the promise of factor acetylation as a relevant drug target in HIV infection has the potential 
to significantly advance progress towards effective functional cure strategies. The overall objective of this 
proposal is to define the unique role of factor acetylation in latency establishment, maintenance and 
reactivation. The central hypothesis is that acetyl-lysine readers proteins (BRD4 and RPRD1) are critical 
regulators of latent HIV infection. The short isoform of the BET protein BRD4 (sBET) and the BAF chromatin-remodeling complex silence transcription of HIV and endogenous retroviruses, consistent with the model that 
the complex senses and silences genome-invading retroviruses. RPRD1 proteins are a novel class of acetyl-lysine reader proteins that, without bromodomains, bind acetyl-lysine residues (K7ac) within the RNA 
polymerase II C-terminal domain, a mark that is found highly enriched at the latent HIV LTR. A model is 
proposed of a cascade of latency-establishing events during or shortly after proviral integration including the 
methyltransferase SMYD5, the KAT8 acetyltransferase (MOF complex) and the sBET/BAF complexes. To 
test this model, the following experiments are planned: Aim 1: To define the role of the sBET-BAF-KAT8- 
SMYD5 factors in genome surveillance. The working hypothesis is that a cascade of SMYD5, KAT8 and 
sBET/BAF activity senses double-stranded DNA breaks caused by integrating retroviruses and silences gene 
expression by positioning a repressive nucleosome at the transcription start site. Dual-fluorescent HIV, Cas9- 
induced DSBs and knockdown studies of sBET, KAT8 and SMYD5 will be used to test this hypothesis. Aim 
2: To characterize recruitment of sBET-containing complexes to the integrated provirus. The working 
hypothesis is that a cascade of H3K36me3 and H4K16ac modifications recruits sBET-BAF to the integrating 
HIV promoter. Comprehensive mutagenesis, co-immunoprecipitation and ChIP experiments combined with 
factor knockdown are planned to test this hypothesis. Aim 3: To determine how RPRD1 proteins regulate
HIV transcription via R-loops. The working hypothesis is that RPRD1 proteins read K7ac marks at the latent 
HIV promoter and prevent transcription elongation of the paused RNA polymerase through R-Loop formation 
(DNA-RNA hybrids). ChIP, DRIP (DNA-RNA IPs) and CRISPR-targeted nuclease recruitment to dissolve R-loops are planned to test this hypothesis. Important insights into the roles of H3K36me3, H4K16ac and R-loops in HIV latency establishment and maintenance are expected, enabling new cure therapies."
10661138,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Natural killer cells provide a critical early defense against viral pathogens by virtue of their ability to 
recognize and kill virus-infected cells without prior antigenic stimulation. This is accomplished through the 
integration of signals from killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and C-type lectin receptors 
(NKG2A and NKG2C) on NK cells and their MHC class I ligands on target cells. KIR and HLA class I
polymorphisms can have profound effect on the course of HIV-1 infection and the efficacy of NK cell-based 
therapies for eliminating virus-infected cells. However, animal studies to address the underlying 
immunological mechanisms have been hampered by our limited understanding of NK cell receptor 
interactions in nonhuman primate models. For MERIT extension of R37 AI095098 “KIR and MHC class I 
immunogenetics in SIV infection”, we will build on recent success defining the MHC class I ligands of 
rhesus macaque KIRs, isolating antibodies to these receptors, and investigating the effects of viral peptides 
on KIR-MHC class I interactions. We will also extend these studies to assess the influence of viral peptides 
bound by MHC-E on interactions with macaque NKG2A and NKG2C and to test the hypothesis that 
adaptive NKG2C+ NK cells have a significant impact on the course of SIV infection. Aim 1 will determine 
how KIR polymorphisms shape ligand recognition and generate reagents (antibodies and MHC class I 
tetramers) for differentiating these receptors on primary NK cells. Aim 2 will investigate the influence of 
viral peptides bound by MHC class I ligands on KIR and NKG2A/C interactions to address alternative 
hypotheses concerning the role of peptides in enabling NK cells to differentiate virus-infected cells from 
healthy cells or to facilitate immune evasion. Aim 3 will assess the contribution of adaptive NKG2C+ NK 
cells to the outcome of SIV infection by depleting these cells during the acute and chronic phases of SIV 
infection. This animal study will also afford an opportunity to investigate longitudinal changes in the 
phenotypic properties of NKG2A+ and NKG2C+ NK cell subsets in response to SIV infection using KIR-specific reagents generated in Aim 1."

 Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) lead to roughly 1.5 million ED visits and
700,000 hospitalizations annually. Recovery is slow, and accompanied by high levels of acute care utilization
and mortality. Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) is a structured program of exercise and self-management support
that has been shown to relieve dyspnea and improve quality of life. Clinical guidelines recommend PR for
patients with stable COPD and after an exacerbation. Unfortunately, even when referred by physicians, our
research has shown that few patients who might benefit from PR ever begin treatment. The primary goal of this
project is to identify effective strategies for promoting and sustaining participation in PR.
 Peer Support involves pairing a patient with a trained peer from a similar background, and facing similar
health challenges, who has completed PR. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the feasibility,
acceptability, and effectiveness of telephonic peer support for chronic disease management. Narrative
interventions, or `Storytelling', are novel approaches for changing attitudes and behaviors of patients that
involve creating and disseminating videos narrated by individuals with lived experience with the same condition
or facing the same treatment. Storytelling interventions have been shown to help patients achieve better blood
pressure control, and storytelling is being studied in a variety of other clinical contexts.
 In the R61 Phase, we will recruit and train a cohort of peer coaches in behavior change techniques, and will
recruit a diverse group of storytellers, capture their narratives on video, and create a library of 6-8 powerful
stories. We will finalize our protocol, trial infrastructure, and pilot our recruitment strategy. During the R33
Phase, we will recruit 305 adults treated for exacerbation of COPD, and randomize them to 1) Enhanced
“Usual Care” (eUC); 2) eUC + Storytelling; or 3) eUC + Peer Support. We will evaluate the effectiveness of
each strategy compared to eUC, and to each other, at promoting participation in PR at 6 months. Using a
mixed-methods approach, we will evaluate intervention acceptability, sustainability, and cost, from the
perspectives of the patients and peer coaches as well as PR program staff and hospital leadership. We will use
these findings to refine the strategies and to disseminate an implementation package that will enable other PR
programs to adopt these approaches.
 This project engages key stakeholders in study conceptualization, execution, and dissemination, and is
responsive to the NHLBI/CDC COPD National Action Plan that calls for the development of strategies to
increase the number of Americans that benefit from PR."
11162615,"Lifestyle interventions have had established efficacy for decades but they are costly and have poor scalability.
Remotely delivered lifestyle interventions have increased the potential for scale and systematic reviews have
found that they are effective, especially those that include human coaching. Some remote lifestyle
interventions are synchronous, such that they are delivered via videoconferencing or phone. Other remote
lifestyle interventions are asynchronous, such that they are delivered via online platforms that allow for
clinicians and patients to engage via text exchanges or via online groups where patients engage with a
clinician and each other by posting messages and contributing to discussion threads. The advantage of
asynchronous approaches is 24/7 accessibility which makes them conducive to “just in time” support, allowing
patients to engage anytime they want to, as opposed to in scheduled blocks of time each week. Asynchronous,
remote interventions may also be more scalable than synchronous remote interventions. We conducted a trial
of two asynchronous, remote lifestyle interventions—one with a group of 94 participants and one with a group
of 40 participants. Findings revealed similar weight loss and acceptability between conditions. We also found
that the larger group was more sustainable, such that participants continued to engage in the group for longer
when we turned the groups over to participants to lead themselves for a year after the intervention ended—a
period we referred to as the peer-led maintenance phase. The next step in this research is to examine how an
asynchronous, remote intervention compares to a synchronous, remote intervention, not only in short term
weight loss, but also in sustainability, scalability, and weight loss maintenance. Now that we’ve established the
feasibility of conducing large asynchronous, remote groups, in the proposed trial we will randomize participants
to large groups (n=82) in both conditions, which will allow us to compare synchronous to asynchronous remote
interventions that are scaled up to a level that we have established is acceptable for asynchronous remote
interventions. The purpose of the proposed trial is to determine whether an asynchronous, remote lifestyle
intervention is non-inferior to a synchronous, remote lifestyle intervention in weight loss at 6 and 12 months,
but more scalable and sustainable, and thus producing greater weight loss maintenance at 18 and 24 months.
Establishing evidence for asynchronous interventions is more important than ever given that telehealth
reimbursement for behavioral health has recently expanded but is still limited to synchronous forms of remote
care. Asynchronous interventions may be more convenient for some people and possibly more scalable but for
this treatment model to reach its potential, evidence for efficacy is needed to inform reimbursement policy. We
hypothesize that an asynchronous, remote lifestyle intervention will produce similar initial weight loss as a
synchronous, remote version but will be less expensive, more sustainable, and generate greater collective
efficacy, which will drive greater weight loss maintenance at 18 and 24 months."

Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has revolutionized medical diagnostics by providing high-
resolution morphological imaging. However, the early stages of many diseases occur before any
morphological changes are detectable. To address this gap, the optical attenuation coefficient (OAC) has
been identified as a promising contrast mechanism to enhance OCT’s diagnostic power. Despite its
potential, traditional OCT struggles with precise OAC measurement due to multiple scattering and model
fitting uncertainties. Our parent grant aims to overcome these challenges by developing beam offset OCT
(BS-OCT), which promises accurate OAC quantification by analyzing the backscattered photon profile
(BSPP). This project will create and validate high-quality tissue phantoms to support the BS-OCT
technology, ensuring precise measurement capabilities before in vivo testing. We have two aims: Aim 1:
Fabricate and test high-quality phantoms for OAC measurement validation. Aim 2: Create multi-layer
tissue phantoms for retinal simulation and BS-OCT validation. The outcomes of this project will
significantly advance OCT technology by providing robust validation tools for BS-OCT. These phantoms
will not only support OCT but also benefit other imaging modalities, potentially becoming standard
references for the broader imaging community. Detailed documentation will be disseminated via the
NIST/NIBIB Imaging Phantom Lending Library."
10904499,"ABSTRACT
Control of insulin biosynthesis in beta-cells occurs primarily at the level of translation of the insulin mRNA. An 
acute rise in glucose levels stimulates insulin translation by a process that involves binding of proteins to the 5' 
untranslated region of the insulin mRNA. Simultaneous translational upregulation of other secretory granule 
proteins also contributes to glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and provides evidence that beta-cells 
coordinately regulate translation of functionally related mRNAs. By contrast, exposure of beta-cells to sustained 
high glucose suppresses glucose-stimulated insulin translation and secretion. The mechanisms responsible for
dysregulation of insulin translation and whether the deleterious effect of chronic high glucose impacts translation 
of other proteins are not known. This project will test the hypothesis that glucose toxicity leads to early alterations 
in mRNA-specific beta-cell translation that are mediated by intrinsic properties of mRNAs and by dynamic 
remodeling of the ribosome itself. Furthermore, we propose this programmatic translational dysregulation 
contributes to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Knowledge gained from this study has the potential 
to identify novel therapeutic targets for prevention of progressive beta-cell failure in diabetes and for optimizing 
functionality of ex vivo generated beta-cells for cell replacement therapy."

Humanity is confronting a pandemic caused by the new Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Our long-
term goal is to develop a potent prophylactic pan-Coronavirus vaccine to stop/reduce past, current and
future Coronavirus infections and/or diseases. While SARS-CoV-2-induced antibody and CD4+ and CD8+
T cell responses are critical to reducing viral infection in the majority of asymptomatic individuals, an
excessive proinflammatory cytokine storm appears to lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome in many
symptomatic individuals. Major gaps: Identifying the epitope specificities, the phenotype and function of B
cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells associated with “natural protection seen in asymptomatic individuals
(those who are infected, but never develop any major symptoms) should guide the development of a future
coronavirus vaccine. Preliminary Results: We have made significant progress in: (A) Identifying a priori
potential human B-cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell target epitopes from the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome; (B)
Identifying “universal” epitopes conserved and common between: (1) previous SARS and MERS
coronavirus outbreaks, (2) current 4388 SARS-CoV-2 strains that now circulate in the United States and
184 other countries; and (3) SARS-like coronavirus strains currently found in bats that have the potential
to produce future human outbreaks; (C) Applying our scalable self-assembling protein nanoparticles
(SAPNs) antigen delivery platform to produce prototype multi-epitope pan-Coronavirus vaccine
candidates, that incorporate conserved protective epitopes from human and bats Coronaviruses, and
demonstrated their B- and T-cell immunogenicity in HLA transgenic mice; and (D) Generating a novel
“humanized” susceptible HLA-DR/HLA-A*0201/hACE2 triple transgenic mouse model in which to test
these vaccine candidates. Our hypothesis is that one of our pan-Coronavirus vaccine candidates,
containing conserved “asymptomatic” SARS-CoV-2 B- and T-cell epitopes that are mainly recognized by
the immune system of “protected,” asymptomatic individuals would protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection and
disease, upon intranasal delivery. To test this hypothesis our Specific Aims are: Aim 1: To test in vitro the
antigenicity of conserved Coronavirus epitopes, we recently identified from the whole SARS-CoV-2
genome, using blood-derived antibodies, CD4+ T-cells and CD8+ T-cells from SARS-CoV-2-infected
symptomatic vs. asymptomatic individuals. The immunodominant conserved “asymptomatic” epitopes will
be identified and used in our multi-epitope pan-Coronavirus vaccine candidates. Aim 2: To test in vivo the
safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of highly conserved multi-epitope pan-Coronavirus vaccine
candidates, delivered mucosally, to our novel “humanized” susceptible triple transgenic mouse model.
Successful completion of this preclinical vaccine project is expected to identify a broadly protective pan-
Coronavirus vaccine candidate that could quickly proceed into an FDA Phase 1 clinical trial."

A leading cause of global disability, depression is widespread among women in low and middle income countries (LMIC). Poverty plays a major role in depression via multiple pathways, while depression worsens poverty, compromising economic productivity.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for U.S women, annually killing >400,000 women.
Compared to whites, non-Hispanic Black and Latina women are at higher CVD risk. Despite the burden of CVD
in women, risk factors specific to women are understudied and thus not considered in current CVD risk
prediction or prevention strategies. Early detection of subclinical disease is key to CVD risk stratification and
prevention. Since prenatal and postpartum care is the sole health care access point for most U.S. women,
pregnancy represents a critical opportunity to measure CVD risk and implement innovative strategies to
address this critical gap in women’s health care. Furthermore, CVD risk factor trajectories begin in utero and in
early life, so pregnancy is also an opportunity to identify CVD risk in children. Our long-range goal is to
identify and disseminate obstetric care practices that mitigate CVD risk for women and their children. The
objective of this prospective, multicenter study is to estimate CVD risk in healthy and medically complicated
pregnant women and their infants. We will also examine the relationships among personal, social, and
ecological factors and CVD risk for 3 years postpartum. Our primary outcomes are maternal and infant
central pulse wave velocity (PWV), a validated measure of arterial stiffness (vascular aging) that predicts CVD,
independent of other established CVD risk factors. We will enroll a cohort 840 pregnant women of diverse
race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status: 420 healthy and 420 women with preeclampsia, gestational diabetes,
and/or suspected fetal growth restriction. We will measure maternal and infant PWV, cardio-metabolic (e.g.,
blood pressure, lipids, adiposity, HbA1c) and inflammatory (e.g., hs-CRP, IL-6, adiponectin) markers of CVD
risk, and assess personal, social, and ecological factors at 34-40 weeks’ gestation, delivery, 6 months, 18
months, and 3 years. The study aims are the following: 1) Measure arterial stiffness by PWV during and after
pregnancy; 2) Measure infant/child PWV following healthy and complicated pregnancies; and 3)
Identify maternal and infant modifiable risk factors associated with CVD risk measured by PWV. To date, no
studies have longitudinally measured CVD risk in pregnant women and their infants, nor ascertained the effect
of biologic, personal, social, and/or ecological factors on CVD risk. Using a noninvasive measure of arterial
stiffness, we propose to determine CVD risk in a cohort of mother-infant dyads. Our interdisciplinary study
team of experts in CVD, high-risk pregnancy, exercise and sports physiology, CVD epidemiology, public
health, and cardiology are well poised to complete the proposed aims by using a synthesis of expertise to
achieve our common, shared goal of mitigate CVD risk for women and their children. We are proposing an
innovative paradigm shift in the goals of prenatal care to use pregnancy as a time in a woman’s life, particularly
if she is at high risk for CVD, to identify and mitigate early markers of CVD for herself and her offspring."
10918730,"Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations
have been successfully treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). Osimertinib has emerged as
one of the preferred front-line agents given the significant improvement in progression-free survival and overall
survival. However, the majority of patients will develop acquired resistance to this targeted therapy. Osimertinib
is effective in combination with MEK/ERK signaling inhibitions in overcoming and even delaying acquired
resistance to osimertinib in pre-clinical studies. Single-cell molecular profiling has identified that YAP inhibitors
may overcome acquired resistance to osimertinib, even after exposure to MEK/ERK inhibitions. Bulk molecular
assays and single-cell RNA-seq methods have been the mainstream approaches to evaluating the signaling
alterations in cultures and tissues. However, there is little known about spatially resolved single-cell and
subcellular details of signaling networks and interactions in NSCLCs. Recently, the rapid multiplexed
immunofluorescence (RapMIF) assay (developed by the Pl) revealed the effect of osimertinib on the subcellular
organization of signaling protein factors. To further evaluate the protein-protein interactions in NSCLC cells and
tissues, this proposal will establish rapid multiplexed protein interaction (RapMPI) method to study drug-sensitive
and resistant human cell lines in cultures and tissues from cell line-derived xenografts in mice and patient-derived
xenografts (PDXs) with EGFR mutations (EGFRm). RapMPI will be optimized using automated labeling,
multiplexing chemistry, and signaling interactome reconstructions. This project tests the hypotheses that single
cell and spatial signaling networks and interaction maps will quantitatively model MEK/ERK upstream' s crosstalk
with YAP's upstream to define 20 pre-selected protein pair interactions for rationally designed combination
therapies to overcome acquired resistance to osimertinib. Aim 1 will map out spatial signaling interactors and
their subcellular localization on major organelles using RapMPI in drug-sensitive and resistant EGFRm cells
under control, osimertinib treatment only, MEKIERK, or YAP inhibition only, and osimertinib combined with
MEKIERK or YAP inhibition conditions. Aim 2 will then measure spatial signaling interactome using RapMPI in
vivo using MEK/ERK or YAP inhibitors in combination with osimertinib in mouse xenograft and PDX models (pretreatment,
1-week, 1-month, and until resistance occurs, n=5 each) and EGFRm human tissues with osimertinib-responsive
or resistance clinical outcome (n=10 each). The long-term goal of this R33 is to uncover the spatially
and temporally coordinated acquired resistance using the subcellular and cellular signaling network maps. This
R33 is innovative because ii establishes an emerging subcellular image-based signaling analysis technology to
guide rationally designed combinatorial intervention for overcoming resistance to osimertinib. The proposed work
is significant because it generates new knowledge on compensatory signaling networks in NSCLCs at the
highest molecular resolution on a single cell basis otherwise not attainable by bulk signaling protein assays."

protecting their local environments and thus health. The goal of this proposal is to establish MI-CARES: The
Michigan Cancer and Research on the Environment Study to describe and quantify the impact of known and
novel environmental exposures on cancer risk. With MI-CARES we will examine well-established environmental
carcinogens such as air pollution and heavy metals, but also focus on less characterized exposures including
per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), noise, and chemicals in personal care products for which there are
urgent needs to assess carcinogenicity. As disparities in these exposures are common by geographic region,
socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and lifestyle, research is required to understand how these factors impact
the relationships between the environment and cancer risk. Michigan (MI) is an ideal location to carry out
research on environmental exposures and cancer risk. Michiganders have experienced a tragic suite of
environmental exposures ranging from contaminated animal feed with polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in the
1970s, to the lead contamination of Flint’s water supply, and the highest known PFAS levels of any state. The
“Tri-Cities” area of metro Detroit, a predominantly Black and Hispanic community, is the most polluted region in
Michigan and high-ranking in the entire U.S. These exposures in MI are profound and the strong history of
community engagement makes MI-CARES feasible. In this project, we hypothesize that environmental
exposures impact inflammation, cellular aging, epigenetic regulation, and immune function to ultimately increase
cancer risk. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose to establish MI-CARES, a racially/ethnically diverse
cohort of 100,000 cancer-free men and women aged 25-44 residing in environmental injustice hotspots in MI:
the Detroit metropolitan area, Flint, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Lansing, and Saginaw. We will recruit equal
numbers of Black, Hispanic, Middle Eastern and North African (MENA), and White participants; all but the latter
are underrepresented in environmental and cancer research. Questionnaire, community-level data, and birth
records will be collected for all participants using a life course approach to capture data during critical windows
of susceptibility. Data collection will include information on individual sociodemographics, residential histories,
health, and lifestyle. Lifetime exposures to environmental pollutants will be ascertained through questionnaire,
residential proximity-based measures or models. In addition, biospecimens (blood spots and saliva) will be
collected on all participants. Within MI-CARES, we will form an enhanced measurement cohort (n=1,000 cancer-
free cohort members) and a nested case-control sample (n=250 cancer cases and 250 matched cancer-free
cohort controls) in whom a comprehensive laboratory-based exposure and intermediate cancer biomarker
assessment will be conducted, including PFAS, metals, untargeted metabolomics, DNA methylation, and
inflammation biomarkers."

Serologic testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is a critical tool for understanding the epidemiology
and designing control strategies for the COVID-19 pandemic. Our understanding of the epidemiology of this
pandemic is primarily derived from real-time data on the number of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive
COVID-19 patients in outpatient and inpatient settings, and thus misses patients with asymptomatic infection or
who have not had SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Serologic testing for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can identify
persons who have been exposed and infected with SARS-CoV-2 at any time and might be a correlate of
protective immunity. This project aims to advance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 serological testing at the
individual and population-level. To achieve this we will develop and implement a large-scale, population-
based, flexible platform to assess SARS-CoV-2 sero-prevalence, sero-incidence, risk of sero-conversion and
longevity of antibody response in a large, integrated health system with linked rich demographic, behavioral
and clinical data. For Aim 1 we will establish a community cohort of Kaiser Permanente Northern California
(KPNC) members; a random sample of community dwelling persons, age 7 years and older, will be invited to
participate in ongoing surveillance of antibody development to assess population-level sero-prevalence and
sero-incidence. For Aim 2, we will enroll a cohort of persons who are positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR or
antibodies and will follow them prospectively with repeat SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing for immune surveillance
and to determine longevity of antibody response. For Aim 3, we will establish a data-only cohort of all persons
who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 disease, or had SARS-CoV-2 PCR or antibody testing; As of July
15, 2020, there are about 290,000 such persons in KPNC and the number increases daily as we test ~10,000
persons per day. In this cohort, we will assess risk of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and will have the opportunity to
examine interactions with a personal history of cancer or cancer treatment and other clinical factors or
comorbid conditions, to determine if these conditions influence the likelihood of development of COVID-19 or
reinfection. For Aim 4, we will establish mechanisms for collaboration with other scientists in the Serological
Sciences Network, including mechanisms for additional sample collection. This series of linked studies
embedded in a large, integrated health system with a large number of COVID-19 patients and high SARS-
CoV-2 testing capacity will enhance our understanding of the utility of commercially available, large-scale
SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing for population-level and individual-level disease control."
11160246,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Given persistent racialized and socioeconomic inequities in neighborhood tobacco retailer availability (TRA),
decreasing TRA is an important intervention for decreasing inequities in tobacco use and tobacco-related
disease. To address inequities in TRA, several cities have implemented licensing-based policies such as
limiting the number of retailers that may possess a license to sell tobacco in a neighborhood. However, local
licensing-based policies may be difficult to implement in states with preemption, which prohibits local
governments from enacting tobacco control policies such as retailer licensing. To date, 14 states preempt local
governments from regulating tobacco retail licensing. Oklahoma (OK) is one of the most comprehensively
preempted states in the nation, and the state has exclusive authority over tobacco retailer licensing. However,
an examination of OK’s statutes reveals that the state does not preempt localities from regulating zoning or
land use. Use-based zoning may be able to reduce TRA by regulating the land (i.e., parcels) where retailers
are permitted or prohibited from selling tobacco products (e.g., residential, industrial). This mixed-methods
study (based in Oklahoma City and Tulsa) will be the first to explicitly evaluate the impacts of use-based zoning
on eliminating racialized and socioeconomic inequities in TRA in a comprehensively preempted state. The two
Specific Aims include: 1) Evaluate the equity impacts of policies that cap the number of tobacco retailers in
certain zones and 2) Engage with local key stakeholders to identify facilitators and barriers to the dissemination
of Aim 1 findings and implementation of zoning-based tobacco control policies. We will use geographic
information systems and spatial epidemiology methods to identify the relationships between specific zones,
TRA, and neighborhood sociodemographic characteristics. We will then simulate policies that limit the number
of tobacco retailers within certain zones and compare changes in observed neighborhood inequities in TRA
(e.g., weakening of inequities; percent and absolute decreases in TRA) pre- vs. post-policy. We will then use a
semi-structured interview guide to explore key stakeholder recommendations for improving the dissemination
of study results and to better understand perspectives on facilitators and barriers to implementing zoning-
based tobacco control policies in OK, focusing on key implementation outcomes. This innovative and equity-
focused study fits within NCI’s mission to “support cancer research across the nation to advance scientific
knowledge and help all people live longer, healthier lives” with the long-term objective to reduce inequities in
tobacco-related cancers. This study is grounded in dissemination and implementation science best practices
and may produce evidence of reductions in TRA and pro-equity effects, which may open the door for a new
suite of policy tools that can promote tobacco control and health equity, especially in preempted states."

 The Delaware Center for Musculoskeletal Research (DCMR) will support basic and preclinical research on
the central theme of musculoskeletal health and disorders, from the level of the entire body to the molecule, with
an emphasis on the mechanisms by which physical and biological cues influence tissue structure and normal
function, dysfunction, and potential therapeutic interventions. A strong Administrative Core will maximize the
impact of the DCMR by successfully leading the administrative and fiscal operation of the Center and by
supporting complex scientific operations that are interwoven within the Center and draw on resources available
through various centers across the University of Delaware and beyond (Aim 1). Excellence and career
development of the Project Leaders is critical to the success of the Center, as they conduct impactful
musculoskeletal research within the Center and as future independent investigators. Thus, the Administrative
Core will also implement a comprehensive mentoring and career development plan for Project Leaders that
complements formal departmental mentoring and will enable them to launch successful research programs and
attain independent investigator status (Aim 2). The Administrative Core will also work to expand the impact of
the DCMR through establishing a collaborative interdisciplinary community, supporting a Pilot grant program,
hiring new faculty, and retaining faculty (Aim 3). Finally, the Core will establish a rigorous evaluation program to
assess progress toward Center milestones, using best practices in program evaluation and led by an expert
internal evaluator (Aim 4). Added to the input of internal and external advisory committees, evaluation data will
be used to continuously improve the Center and ensure that it is achieving its overarching goal: to accelerate
fundamental and preclinical musculoskeletal research and contribute to a comprehensive basic-to-clinical
research pipeline that will substantially reduce the burden of musculoskeletal disorders."
11171159,"ABSTRACT
The prevalence of low back pain (LBP) among U.S. adults is estimated at 20%, with 50-80% of people
reporting a significant episode at some point in their life, and 23% of LBP patients reporting pain of high
intensity with disability. The greatest burden placed on society occurs when LBP becomes chronic (cLBP).
Inadequately managed chronic pain results in greater loss of productivity; increased expenditures for
hospitalization, surgery and medications; and costly out-of-pocket patient expenses. Given their high rates of
musculoskeletal disease, cLBP-related disability is rampant within our nation’s Veteran population. The
combination of cLBP and high medication use negatively impacts Veterans’ work productivity and quality of life,
and generates substantial risk for long-term disability and opioid addiction. There is arguably no more
important population than Veterans for performing research to evaluate effective non-pharmacological
treatments that are safe, pain relieving, cost-effective, and contain promise to restore function and quality of
life. One such option is chiropractic care. Several key factors support the need to deepen the study of
chiropractic care within the Veteran population: 1) biological models offer strong support for plausibility; 2)
sufficient strength of evidence in systematic reviews has garnered a recommendation by American College of
Physicians for spinal manipulation and/or chiropractic care targeting cLBP, and 3) since beginning in 2004, the
Veterans Health Administration (VA) has successfully integrated 115 doctors of chiropractic into ambulatory
care settings. These advances in chiropractic care integration have occurred despite substantial knowledge
gaps, particularly within VA. Specifically, studies examining the delivery of chiropractic interventions have been
highly variable and there is no optimal “dosing” in terms of treatment duration or number of visits. Thus, the
proposed study of Veterans age 18 and older with a diagnosis of cLBP is highly significant. Demonstration
project investigators will work closely with the NIH-DOD-VA Collaboratory to accomplish the following project
Aims: 1) Plan and develop the pragmatic research infrastructure needed to deliver a rigorous, multi-site,
randomized controlled trial within the VA addressing 15 milestones in four categories of activities; 2) Evaluate
the comparative effectiveness of a low dose (1-5 visits) of standard chiropractic care against a higher dose (8-
12 visits) in Veterans with cLBP; 3) Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of chiropractic chronic pain
management (CCPM) compared to usual care, following the initial treatment described in Aim 1; 4) Evaluate
the impact of CCPM on health services outcomes, compared to usual care; 5) Evaluate patient and clinician
perceptions of non-specific treatment factors, effectiveness of study interventions, and impact of the varying
doses of standard chiropractic care and the CCPM on clinical outcomes across 4 VA facilities using a mixed
method, process evaluation approach."
10657948,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Metabolism is the core process underlying essentially all biological functions. The application of this
concept to the immune system, known as immunometabolism, is arguably one of the most active and
transformative research topics in immunology. The critical link between metabolism and immunity is
highlighted by the findings that immunometabolism shapes dendritic cell (DC) function, T cell responses
and adaptive immunity, and contributes to cancer progression and therapy. However, molecular
mechanisms linking the metabolic state of immune cells with in vivo immune responses remain largely
unclear, and integrative, systems-level understanding and therapeutic targeting of immunometabolism are
lacking. My laboratory studies the interplay between metabolism and immunity, and how understanding
immunometabolism reveals new biology and disease targets. The long-term goals of my research
program are to establish the metabolic and signaling programs that direct DC- and T cell-mediated
adaptive immune responses. We approach these questions by multidisciplinary strategies, ranging from
immunology, genetics, cell biology and biochemistry, to in vivo models of cancer and inflammation. The
central hypothesis that guides our research is that metabolic pathways are inextricably connected to
immune cell state and fate and adaptive immune responses, and by understanding these connections, we
gain new concepts and disease targets. This hypothesis leads us to address the following three key
questions in immunometabolism. First, we will establish immunometabolic control of DC subsets and
adaptive immunity via mitochondrial and lipid pathways. Second, we will use functional genomics
approaches to systemically explore metabolic control of DC subsets and function. Third, we will determine
the roles of nutrients in mediating intercellular communication between DCs and T cells or tumor cells.
Completion of these aims are expected to identify novel mechanisms of intracellular and intercellular
metabolic checkpoints underlying DC subsets, T cell responses and adaptive immunity. Our established
contributions in the field of immunometabolism, expertise in the studies of both DCs and T cells, and
experience in the synthesis of hypothesis-driven and systems-level approaches, make us uniquely
positioned to produce fundamental discoveries in immunometabolism and new strategies for translation."
11170841,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) is predominantly observed in the circulating white blood cells of older men,
suggesting a significant link to the aging process. LOY stands out as the most frequently observed non-
physiological postzygotic chromosomal alteration in the human genome. Its profound association with age and
age-related diseases presents a critical area for in-depth study to understand the broader context of aging. In
this proposal, our central focus lies in exploring the LOY-aging nexus. Utilizing both computational and hands-
on experimental strategies, we aim to achieve an integrated understanding of LOY. This encompasses novel
methodological innovations, rare variant association studies, and a meticulous probe into the mechanism binding
LOY with aging. By diving deep into this specific genome irregularity, we aspire to shed light on the intricate
effects of genetic factors that play out as we age. Our overarching goal revolves around demystifying the
interconnections between LOY, genome instability as one ages, and the onset of age-related diseases. Our
research hinges on two foundational hypotheses: first, that rare genetic variants play a pivotal role in LOY's
manifestation, shaping its appearance against the backdrop of polygenic risks set by more common variants;
and second, that LOY isn't an isolated event, but a piece in the larger puzzle of age-associated genome
instability. These suppositions draw strength from our preliminary data, garnered using SNP array genotyping
and whole exome sequencing from the Einstein longevity cohort. This invaluable dataset previously enabled us
to identify links between rare genetic variants and exceptional human longevity. We now set forth three distinct
aims: to ascertain the extent of LOY mosaicism using sequencing data; to pinpoint genes heightening LOY risk;
and, most crucially, to decode the relationship between LOY and aging. We firmly believe that a holistic
understanding of LOY's genetic blueprint and the mechanics tying it to aging will serve as a gateway to
understanding age-related pathology. A deeper insight into LOY will not only allow for precise quantification but
also pave the way for innovative therapeutic strategies, potentially offering a novel approach to mitigate the
challenges of aging and age-associated diseases."

If successful, the proposed study will provide accessible and scalable methods with measurable and validated
accuracy to assess key indicators of an older adult’s health related to body composition phenotypes and
associated physical function. The approach uses inexpensive and widely available commodity optical scanners
as a novel imaging modality with the potential to practically reduce healthcare costs and disparities. The study
meets NIA strategic priorities by developing improved approaches for the early detection and diagnosis of
disabling illnesses and age-related debilitating conditions (C1) and in providing a foundation for developing
interventions for treating, preventing, or mitigating the impact of age-related conditions (C3).
Early screening and diagnosis of body composition and physical function combined with timely, dietary, exercise,
and/or pharmacological interventions can mitigate the risk of functional decline and negative health outcomes in
individuals with sarcopenic obesity. Simple anthropometric measures are easy to perform but have poor
diagnostic accuracy and are inconsistently associated with morbidity and long-term physical function. While other
modalities (e.g., dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), CT, MRI) may have higher diagnostic accuracy, they
are impractical for widescale integration into clinical practice. There are relatively inexpensive systems and
mobile apps that use 3D body shape from optical scanners for predicting body composition. While their validity
is sufficient for consumer-oriented applications, these prediction algorithms may not be applicable for clinical use
on older adults ─ they were not trained on data from this population. These systems also do not predict both
muscle mass and physical function which are critical in the diagnosis of sarcopenia and obesity. To address
these limitations, our team has previously developed highly accurate prediction algorithms using optical body
scanning technology (R21HL124443, R01DK129809). These promising results merit us to further test and
validate our system to translate such technologies into routine clinical and home-based care.
We propose collecting data in an observational cross-sectional study of participants recruited from community-
dwelling older adults. Participants will undergo: (i) 3D optical body scans to determine body shape; (ii) DEXA to
assess body composition; (iii) D3-creatine dilution tests to determine total muscle mass; and (iv) validated
physical function assessments. This data will be used to train artificial intelligence algorithms to predict body
composition and physical function. We will investigate the usability of the approach for clinicians and for older
adults using mobile platforms.
We anticipate that the next step in this line of research is to conduct a cohort study that demonstrates the
predictive nature on adverse outcomes in participants with sarcopenic obesity, or in using this system as part of
a clinical trial. Additionally, we envision transitioning this technology to real-world settings by developing a
prototype system as part of a Small Business Technology Transfer program."

11173966,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in the
developed world. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the leading cause of vision loss due to AMD. Although
anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy has shown a great breakthrough in CNV treatment,
persistent disease activity (PDA) is common. PDA has been demonstrated in 53% and 71% of patients treated
monthly with ranibizumab and bevacizumab, respectively. 20% of patients become legally blind and another
30% suffer from some degree of vision loss after 5 years of anti-VEGF therapy. While AMD is a serious problem,
one critical barrier limiting the ability to test novel therapies in preclinical settings is the lack of CNV animal
models with PDA and the lack of methods for longitudinal monitoring of disease biomarkers and response to
therapy. The goal of this project is to develop state-of-the-art multimodal molecular imaging for non-invasive
and longitudinal assessment of the imaging biomarkers in a new CNV rabbit model with PDA to offer a platform
technology for the development of novel therapeutics.
 We have developed a high resolution, multimodal ophthalmic imaging system incorporating
photoacoustic microscopy (PAM), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescence microscopy (FM).
Novel chain-like gold nanoparticle clusters have been developed and used to enhance molecular imaging and
target integrins present in CNV. We have also developed a robust animal model of PDA using older rabbits that
demonstrate minimal response to anti-VEGF therapy. Encouraged by these exciting preliminary results, we
propose to further develop this platform molecular imaging technology for AMD with a central hypothesis that
a multimodal molecular imaging system that can evaluate the CNV animal model could contribute to
understanding the fundamental biology of AMD and the development of new pharmaceutical therapies to treat
CNV. We will test our hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Upgrade the multimodal PAM, OCT,
and FM system for real-time imaging in rabbit eyes. Aim 2: Test the prediction that young rabbits with robust
response to anti-VEGF demonstrate capillary CNV while older rabbits demonstrate arteriolar CNV that can be
visualized with multimodal imaging. Aim 3: Test the prediction that the rabbit models of CNV in response to anti-
VEGF can be visualized at a molecular level with multimodal imaging powered by ultraminiature chain-like gold
nanoparticles. The results of this work will include concepts, tools, and strategies for future research across
several disciplines: a) Fundamental biology of AMD to visualize and quantify, with high spatial and temporal
resolution, functional and molecular changes in living animals. b) Strategies for testing and developing novel
drugs and non-pharmaceutical therapies in large eye models, particularly for CNV with PDA. c) Improved
prognostication research to enable real-time molecular biomarkers of treatment response."
11170093,"The goal of this research is to develop a sensor device prototype to rapidly measure an array of diverse
salivary biomarkers as input for novel machine learning (ML) methods that can predict periodontitis and
monitor periodontal progression. Our long-term goal is to develop a rapid, user-friendly, and low-cost pointof-care (POC) device, for use in either a dentist’s office or at home, that rapidly integrates and analyzes data
to support patient management. It addresses the priority area of the Data Science, Computational Biology,
and Bioinformatics Program of NIDCR in integrating and analyzing high-volume and diverse data to better
understand dental, oral, and craniofacial biology and diseases.
According to the CDC, nearly 50% adults have some form of periodontal disease. Perioodontitis is silently
progressive and patients often seek professional care only in an advanced stage where advanced, painful
and costly procedures are needed to control disease or replace lost teeth. Early detection of periodontal
disease at an individual patient level is required and there is growing awareness that multiple biomarkers are
valued in predicting risk of disease in individuals. We hypothesize that predictive models can be established
based on the measurements of a large set of periodontitis-associated biomarkers in saliva; a sensor device
that integrates multi-sensor modalities and the machine learning (ML) models will advance the clinical goal
of early diagnosis of periodontitis to enable earlier clinical interventions. Thus, we will develop and apply
three distinctive sensor modalities for detecting concentrations of salivary analytes relevant to various stages
of periodontal progression, i.e., inflammation, soft tissue destruction or bone destruction (Aim 1). Data from
both sensor outputs and clinical examination will be used to train ML models via a novel multi-modal
adversarial knowledge distillation ML framework, which promotes accurate early prediction with partial
longitudinal data representations (Aim 2). The multi-sensor modalities and the ML models will be embedded
in a single microfluidic device, incorporating steps such as sampling, detection, and data analysis as an
integrated lab-on-a-chip, and permitting the sensor data preprocessed to transmit only the actionable
information to the outside platform to protect the user's privacy (Aim 3). Such a device is anticipated to offer
for unobtrusive, accurate, and frequent saliva-based self-monitoring, and provide detailed medical data to
support clinical decisions. It will be an effective tool for future personalized medicine and dramatically
improve patients' oral health."
11160203,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cyclic cGMP (cGMP) enables phototransduction in vertebrate rods and cones. The cGMP synthesis by retinal
guanylyl (guanylate) cyclase (RetGC), one of the most essential processes in the photoreceptor physiology, is
controlled by calcium, guanylyl cyclase activating proteins (GCAPs), and retinal degeneration 3 (RD3) protein.
The abnormalities in cGMP signaling cause photoreceptor dysfunction and death. Among them, deficiency in
RetGC activity and regulation leads to a variety of recessive and dominant forms of congenital blindness. The
basic principles of the RetGC regulation and its fundamental importance for the photoreceptor signaling and
survival have been established, and the first clinical trials for RetGC-linked blindness now have begun, evolved
from the earlier molecular studies. Yet, some key molecular and cellular aspects of RetGC regulation still remain
insufficiently understood, including the molecular structure and the interactions of RetGC with the regulatory
proteins that define its biological function in photoreceptors. This proposal, conforming to the NEI mission to
support research with respect to blinding eye diseases, visual disorders and mechanisms of visual function, is
built on recent advancements in understanding of how RetGC enables the photoreceptor function: (i)
identification of mutations that affect RetGC interactions with GCAPs and RD3; (ii) establishing the structure on
RD3 and identification of its RetGC-binding interface; (iii) development of new mouse genetic models for
studying mechanisms of signal transduction and their abnormalities caused by mutations in RetGC1, GCAP1,
and RD3; (iv) establishing the complex physiological role of RD3 in photoreceptor function and survival. We
here propose a diversified study designed to achieve, by integrating protein biochemistry, molecular biology,
and molecular genetics, better mechanistic understanding of the regulatory processes that control cGMP
synthesis in photoreceptors and underlie their function and diseases. Aim 1 seeks establishing the presently
unknown structure of RetGC1, the main source of cGMP in photoreceptors, whose mutants cause severe forms
of blindness. Aim 2 addresses the molecular determinant of RD3 that controls RetGC trafficking in
photoreceptors using transgenic mouse models. Aim 3 will delineate the dynamics of RetGC complexes with
GCAPs and RD3 that enable RetGC to function in vivo. By completing these specific aims, we expect to achieve
deeper and more reliable understanding of the mechanistic interactions that define the fundamental role of
RetGC in photoreceptor biology and cause physiological abnormalities in congenital retinal diseases."

11171013,"Abstract
Research Core C will be integral to the examination of serological antibody repertoires in COVID-19 study
subjects as well as in convalescent plasmas obtained from survivors. Core C will employ a set of unique
experimental techniques including a proteomic methodology (Ig-seq) for the identification of the monoclonal
sequences and for determining the epitope specificity and function of the secreted component immunoglobulins
(IgG and IgA) comprising the polyclonal response to SARS-CoV-2. The UT Core will examine the persistence of
individual serum mAb clonotypes as a function of time and also the relationships between the IgA and IgG
repertoires in circulation and in BAL. To date, all human SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies have been isolated
exclusively from B cells transiently circulating in the periphery. The significance of the abundance, durability, and
interconnectivity of serological antibodies—IgG versus IgA, neutralizing versus non-neutralizing, mucosal versus
systemic—shall become clear as this research core comprehensively analyzes the molecular composition of
anti-viral IgG and IgA and traces the B-cell subpopulations from which they arose. These studies will be enabled
by robust sample collections from UNC Chapel Hill and from UT Austin. We expect that the experimental
outcomes of Research Core C will clarify (i) the extent of antibody breadth and potency of the constituent IgG
and IgA in the serological repertoires and role in protection (via viral blockade or through Fc dependent
mechanisms) against endemic and zoonotic coronaviruses in mouse models (Project 1), and (ii) the detailed
molecular-level characterization of convalescent plasmas used for transfusion therapy in a COVID-19 clinical
trial (Project 2). Comparative analyses shall be performed to determine adaptive immune signatures which may
explain differential patterns among asymptomatic, oligosymptomatic, and severe disease. This research will be
critical to our understanding the nature and complexity of human antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2
pandemic scourge."
11171014,"Abstract
Zoonotic coronaviruses (CoV) are responsible for three major epidemics/pandemics in the 21st century, including
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003 and the Middle East Respiratory coronavirus
(MERS-CoV) in 2012. In Dec 2019, a third novel CoV designated SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan China and
has caused over 13 million cases, >570,000 deaths in >220 countries. In the expanding US epidemic, SARS-
CoV2 has caused >137,000 deaths and significantly more severe infections characterized by pneumonia, severe
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathies, and inflammatory disorders. Incredibly, careful
analyses of zoonotic bat CoV has revealed the presence of numerous group 2b SARS-like, group 2c MERS-like
and remarkably, group 1 strains that replicate efficiently in primary human airway or gut enteroid cultures. To
prepare for future CoV calamities, defined diagnostic assays and serologic investigations are essential for
tracking current and future outbreaks and evaluate type specific and broad serologic immunity associated with
population immunity. The goal of this U54 Center Program is to develop novel type- and group-specific serologic
and neutralization assays (Project 1-Baric, Project 2-, Core B and C) designed to characterize the serological
repertoire and to identify key domain-specific mucosal and systemic neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies
after SARS-CoV-2 infection. One key underlying hypothesis is that IgA and IgG repertoires are different across
mucosal and systemic compartments and target unique and overlapping epitope domains in the SARS-CoV2 S
glycoprotein. Another underlying hypothesis is that intervention strategies can altered the memory B cell and
antibody repertoires in mucosal and serologic compartments. Finally the program develops novel mouse models
of human disease designed to mechanistically address fundamental immune innate and adaptive interactions
associated with protective immunity. The Project uses novel technologies, basic and applied strategies to build
a portfolio of reagents that map, track and treat SARS-CoV2 and other SARS-like group 2b CoV of the future.
In Aim 1, we evaluate the kinetics, magnitude, durability of type specific neutralizing antibody responses after
infection. Aim 2 characterizes the breadth of the mucosal and systemic serologic repertoires across
Sarbecoviruses. In Aim 3, we characterize the antibodies in the mucosal and serum serologic repertoires using
a variety of in vitro and in vivo platforms, designed to reveal correlates associated with protective immunity. To
achieve our goals, the project interfaces closely with other projects and cores within the Center."
11177989,"There is growing recognition that the immune protection generated by prior pathogen exposure is often highly variable. Nonetheless, the role of prior exposure to pathogens in inducing population-level variation in host susceptibility, and how selection from pathogens alters such heterogeneity over time, remains largely unexplored. Further, the way in which host variation in susceptibility emerges from interactions between pathogens traits, such as virulence, and host traits, such as acquired protection, is key for predicting how pathogen strains will evolve and coexist in the breadth of host-pathogen systems characterized by incomplete protection. While theoretical models suggest key downstream consequences of host heterogeneity in susceptibility for pathogen dynamics and evolution, there have been few opportunities to empirically parameterize such models and test their predictions. Here we blend theory and experiments in a tractable natural system -- house finches and a common conjunctival bacterial pathogen -- to explore an under-considered but broadly relevant mechanism of heterogeneity in susceptibility: variable host protection generated from prior pathogen exposure. How such prior exposure induces or dampens population-level heterogeneity in susceptibility will depend on several factors, including 1) the extent of prior pathogen exposure that individuals experience during epidemics, and thus the variation in protection generated and then lost via waning immunity (ecological processes); and 2) the extent of pathogen-driven selection on host susceptibility in a given population over longer time scales (evolutionary processes). Heterogeneity in host susceptibility is also specific to a given pathogen, and thus can be influenced by traits of pathogens (e.g. virulence) that interact with host prior exposure. We will assess these theories-- and their epidemiological and evolutionary consequences-- among individual finches with varying histories of prior pathogen exposure, across populations with varying histories of pathogen-driven selection, and among pathogen strains that vary in virulence. The work iteratively merges empirical approaches with epidemiological and evolutionary models to test: 1) how prior exposure to pathogens, via both ecological and evolutionary processes, influences host heterogeneity in susceptibility, 2) the epidemiological consequences of exposure-induced heterogeneity, and, 3) how prior exposure interacts with pathogen traits to influence heterogeneity, strain coexistence, and virulence evolution. By doing so, the project will generate novel and diverse insights regarding a largely understudied but key form of host heterogeneity."

Racial disparities in advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) treatment, care, and patient outcomes are
profound, persistent, and pervasive. Despite a large volume of studies linking structural racism to a range of
health outcomes, only recently has there been a surge in attention to the role of racism in driving the well-
documented inequities in CKD. Effective CKD treatment and care can improve quality of life, reduce the need
for deceased donor transplant, decrease the likelihood of allograft failure, and improve long-term patient
survival; yet racial disparities exist at each point along this pathway of care due to structural racism.
The Collaborative Chronic Care Model (CCM) offers a well-established, multi-level framework for organizing
health systems in order to maximize outcomes among patients with chronic diseases such as CKD; however,
alone, it fails to attend to the role of structural racism. We propose multi-level, multi-component interventions
under a new innovative framework to motivate systemic change: we will apply the four foci of Public Health
Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP), a public health framework that addresses change through an anti-racism lens,
to the six components of the CCM to impact CKD care in primary care and acute care access points,
nephrology, and dialysis care settings. In this manner, we propose to redesign structures within Emory
Healthcare to mitigate the effect of structural racism on CKD inequities.
Our long-term goal is to eliminate racial inequities in CKD progression, treatment, and care among patients
within Emory Healthcare by developing a model of care that can be replicated and sustained within health
systems across the country. In the development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of the multi-
component, multi-level interventions we will rely heavily on a community-engaged approach at all stages of
implementation. Our central hypothesis is that with substantial guidance from a Community Advisory Board,
comprehensive systems change implemented through an anti-racism lens will improve access to all steps of
care along the CKD continuum among African American patients, thereby decreasing existing racial inequities.
In close collaboration with the U01 Research Coordinating Center, we propose these aims:
1. Apply PHCRP to develop multi-level, multi-component interventions that target patient & provider outcomes
2. Implement multi-level, multi-component interventions across primary care and acute care access points,
nephrology, and dialysis care using the six components of the CCM and PHCRP as organizing frameworks
3. Using a quasi-experimental interrupted time series design, determine the effectiveness of the interventions
on primary outcomes analyzed at the level of patients and provider type
4. Evaluate implementation and support dissemination of the multi-level, multi-component interventions using
the extended RE-AIM framework to assess Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
Maintenance/Sustainability from a health equity lens."

Age- and function-based positioning of mitochondria plays a critical and conserved role in cellular differentiation
and aging from yeast to humans. Evidence suggests that mitochondrial positioning mechanisms selectively
transport or retain specific mitochondria based on their fitness, resulting in physiological asymmetry between
mother and daughter cells. However, a major conceptual challenge is that mitochondria form connected
networks. They experience constant remodeling by mitochondrial fission and fusion, while their size continuously
expands during cell growth. The continuous mitochondrial content mixing should eliminate any differences
between mitochondria, making it difficult to explain how some mitochondria can be fitter than others. In this
proposal, we unite and integrate complementary expertise in mitochondrial biology, quantitative cell physiology,
and in silico modeling of organelle dynamics to mechanistically investigate the precise sequence of subcellular
events that lead to asymmetric mitochondrial segregation, first during the cell cycle and ultimately to replicative
aging. We will implement powerful molecular and single-cell techniques in combination with in silico modeling
approaches to control, track, and model individual mitochondria and their dynamics, topology, and function as
cells age. The true power and innovation of the proposed research is the tight integration of approaches guided
by novel mechanistic hypotheses of cellular aging. In Aim 1, we will test our model for the molecular basis of
fitness recognition, which centers on the role of cardiolipin (CL), a lipid linked to myriad mitochondrial functions.
We hypothesize that CL both enhances the import of mitochondrial components and is selectively recognized
by the mitochondrial transport and tethering proteins, providing a novel testable mechanism for the inheritance
of the fittest. We will test whether the tenets of our model enable the emergence of asymmetry in mitochondrial
content and function during the cell cycle and, in Aim 2, investigate the impact of that asymmetry on replicative
aging. In addition, we will consider the role of other organelles such as the vacuole. We will utilize the yeast
mother machine to reveal a hierarchy of age-related changes in mitochondria and vacuoles. The causal
relationship between cellular aging and age-dependent changes in mitochondria and the vacuole will be
determined. Our studies in yeast will uncover fundamental mechanisms used by cells to establish functional
asymmetry within mitochondrial networks. Therefore, this work has the potential to lead to novel therapeutic
strategies to slow or reverse aging in humans by manipulating the mitochondrial drivers of aging at the cellular
level."

11170307,"Pacific Islanders bear a disproportionate burden of obesity compared to other racial/ethnic minorities and the 
United States (US) population. Pacific Islanders residing in the US also have high maternal and infant health 
disparities with disproportionally high rates of preterm birth (<37 weeks) and low birthweight infants (<2,500 
grams). They are also more likely to experience preeclampsia, primary cesarean birth, excessive gestational 
weight gain, gestational diabetes mellitus, and low exclusive breastfeeding rates compared to other 
racial/ethnic minorities and the US population in general. These unique health circumstances increase medical 
complications and are associated with impaired glucose intolerance, delivery complications, and higher 
incidence of obesity and metabolic disease risk later in life for infants. Early and consistent supportive care 
throughout the pregnancy continuum is strongly associated with positive birth outcomes that can mitigate 
childhood obesity. 
However, Pacific Islanders are less likely to receive adequate prenatal care compared to other racial and/or 
ethnic minorities. Our preliminary studies using Arkansas birth records (n=2,488; 2019) have shown that 
Marshallese experience exceptionally poor perinatal outcomes, even compared to other US Pacific Islanders. 
Specifically, 15% of Marshallese women received no prenatal care (compared to 1.6% women nationally); 
more than 50% do not attend the recommended number of prenatal care visits; 19% of Marshallese infants 
were born preterm (compared to 9.6% nationally); and 15% of Marshallese infants were low birthweight 
(compared to 8.3% nationally). These poor health outcomes are highly associated with childhood obesity risk 
through increased odds of rapid infant weight gain and sub-optimal infant feeding practices. Thus, our 
foundational work demonstrates an urgent need for culturally adapted interventions to engage the Marshallese 
community in Arkansas in prenatal care that optimize birth outcomes that can mitigate childhood obesity. 
CenteringPregnancy, an evidenced-based group prenatal care model, challenges the standard model of oneon- 
one prenatal counseling and has demonstrated effectiveness in other populations in lowering the risk of 
preterm birth, low birthweight infants, and increasing exclusive breastfeeding initiation compared to women 
receiving individualized care. Our prior work has demonstrated how challenging delivering group care is to the 
Marshallese community because of transportation barriers. Mobile health clinics are transforming the US 
healthcare system by delivering services directly to communities of need. However, mobile health clinics have 
not yet been implemented with group prenatal programs like CenteringPregnancy in the US. The proposed 
study will determine the preliminary effectiveness of an innovative Mobile CenteringPregnancy program for 
Marshallese women while also evaluating implementation determinants and outcomes to inform sustainable 
scaling of the program."
11170311,"Maternal obesity, hyperglycemia and excessive gestational weight gain (eGWG) all associate with 
increased risk for overweight/obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in the offspring. It is 
particular women with low socioeconomic status and from racial minorities that record highest prevalence of 
maternal obesity, while also reporting the lowest prenatal care visits. On par, Arkansas has seen the 
nationwide highest increase in pregnancies with obesity (22/4%) with ~4 out of ten women being affected. 
Thus, there is a critical need for a cost-effective, efficacious intervention, fit for implementation in vulnerable 
populations. 
Obesity is a chronic disease that requires effective self-management. Unhealthy eating patterns and low 
levels of physical activity (PA) are manageable behaviors that have been linked to eGWG and adverse health 
outcomes in mother and children, and behavioral counseling interventions (BCI) focused on diet counseling 
and PA uptake have shown a ~20% decrease in eGWG occurrence and pregnancy complications. However, 
over half of women in BCI groups still experience inappropriate GWG. A possible avenue of refinement is in 
the process measures given to individuals to track intervention adherence. 
Self-monitoring via continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has shown improved healthful behaviors and 
glycemic control in adults with and without diabetes. Furthermore, preliminary data from our group show thus 
far feasibility in pregnant women with obesity but without diabetes diagnosis (79% compliance when wearing a 
CGM sensor for 14 days per trimester). Yet, the feasibility of continued CGM sensor wear throughout gestation 
as well as the behavioral feedback value of CGM data to enhance self-management in pregnant with obesity 
but without diabetes (PWOWD) has yet to be established. To address whether a future definite RCT of adding 
CGM as a self-management tool to an existing BCI in PWOWD is feasible, we propose the following aims: 
Aim 1: Complete formative research per the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) framework to identify 
key elements for including CGM into an existing BCI for use in Arkansas women from urban and rural areas. 
Aim 2: Determine feasibility of the adapted procedures and planned outcomes in a randomized pilot and 
feasibility trial. 
Overall Impact: Results from this study will provide essential data to inform an R01 application (RFA-OD-23- 
014) to conduct a definite RCT for testing the efficacy of an existing BCI enhanced by process measures from 
wearable technology. Leveraging feasibility assessments to incorporate formative work will demonstrate new 
avenues to improve BCI efficacy in future research designs and ultimately deliver impactful lifestyle 
interventions that will improve maternal and child health."

In the absence of cytology- and HPV-based cervical cancer screening, screening of the cervix by visual inspection after application of acetic acid (VIA) to highlight precancerous or cancerous abnormalities is recommended. During VIA, if a visible acetowhite pattern is perceived to be abnormal, the cervical epithelium is either ablated (by freezing or heat) or excised. This ‘see and treat’ approach to cervical cancer prevention has been widely adopted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), which has some of the world’s highest cervical cancer rates. Our team conducted one of the largest randomized controlled trials in SSA comparing these treatment approaches and determined they are almost 50% less effective in women living with HIV (WLWH). As evidenced by these findings, the elimination of cervical cancer as a significant public health disease requires the adoption and implementation of strategies that are easily accessible, affordable, acceptable and are equally efficacious in WLWH. One potential therapeutic agent that warrants further investigation is a vaginal application of the protease inhibitors (PIs) Lopinavir and Ritonavir (LPV/r), which have known anti-cancer and HPV activity. The overall goal of this trial is to find new, non-invasive, easily scalable solutions for secondary cervical cancer prevention, particularly among WLWH. The central aim of this study is to assess the safety and acceptability of vaginal LPV/r given alone or in combination with thermal ablation (TA) to treat VIA positive women, eligible for ablative therapy. The initial phase of this study has three components: 1) through surveys and interviews, assess the impact of social, behavioral and environmental factors on current treatment outcomes, 2) evaluate biological factors such as the vaginal microenvironment as contributors to poorer treatment response in WLWH, and 3) assess barriers, facilitators, and acceptability of the proposed treatment strategy with key stakeholders. For the intervention phase, we will enroll 180 VIA positive women from designated cervical cancer screening clinics in Lusaka, Zambia. Participants will be stratified based on HIV status and randomized to receive 1) LPV/r or placebo for 3 weeks followed by thermal ablation at 4 weeks or 2) LPV/r or placebo alone for 3 weeks with repeat VIA at 6 months and thermal ablation for those with persistent VIA positive abnormalities. Twenty of the 180 VIA positive women will be randomized to a comparator cohort of usual care with immediate TA if eligible. The expected outcome of this work is the generation of evidence that this novel LPV/r treatment is safe and acceptable for use as treatment or adjunct in women who screen VIA positive and identify potential contributors to overall treatment response. Results from this study will lay the groundwork for a large-scale study of LPV/r in additional SSA cohorts."

The primary goal of the Johns Hopkins Excellence in Pathogenesis and Immunity Center for SARS-CoV-2 (JH-
EPICS) is to systematically evaluate innate, T cell, and antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in peripheral blood
mononuclear cells and serological samples from COVID-19 patients. Through in depth analyses, the JH-
EPICS will identify the modifiers of the immune response and severe COVID-19 and isolate the cellular and
molecular targets for COVID-19 treatments as well as the correlates of protection necessary for SARS-CoV-2
vaccine-induced immunity. The primary objective of the JH-EPICS Administrative Core (AC) is to provide
centralized management, leadership, mentoring, sharing, and dissemination of the data from the proposed
Research Projects and Cores in JH-EPICS to ensure that the overarching research goals can be met. The first
Aim, under the Multiple PI leadership of Drs. Sabra Klein and Andrea Cox, will be to provide administrative and
budgetary management as well as scientific leadership and communication for JH-EPICS. The JH-EPICS AC
will distribute funds, organize monthly research meetings, and ensure integration of the JH-EPICS into the
COVID-19 research and educational networks at Johns Hopkins University. The AC will also develop standard
operating procedures for reviewing requests for specimens from the biorepository and their distribution as well
as the collection, processing, and sharing of data generated by the JH-EPICS and approved by the SeroNet
Steering Committee. The second Aim of the JH-EPICS AC will be to foster engagement with SeroNet and
other network activities. The JH-EPICS AC will participate in all trans-SeroNet initiatives, including
establishment of trans-SeroNet collaborative research projects. Finally, the third Aim of the JH-EPICS AC will
be to enhance dissemination of research findings from the JH-EPICS and establish an evaluation plan.
Dissemination of research findings from the JH-EPICS will involve publications and dissemination of results at
the annual SeroNet meeting, national and international meetings of professional societies, and the monthly
Center-wise research meetings. Development of a JH-EPICS website and social media presence will further
assist with dissemination of research findings to a broader audience. Finally, the JH-EPICS AC will establish a
rigorous evaluation plan, including annual progress reports, site visits, and requested documents (e.g., SOPs)
from NIH. The goal will be to ensure appropriate management and productive dissemination of research and
data from JH-EPICS to the broader community, including through public outreach."
11171007,"PROJECT 1: SUMMARY
As established through decades of research in protective immunity against infectious pathogens, achieving
durable immunity against SARS-CoV-2 will require specific functional properties of antibodies, B cells and T cells
that need to be defined through detailed repertoire studies. Antibody responses to viral infections in humans are
varied and of widely divergent clinical significance. Pre-existing, reactive antibodies or antibodies that are formed
early during infection can engage virus particles, forming immune complexes that may neutralize or mediate
clearance of the virus. On the other hand, immune complexes can also promote inflammation and exacerbate
symptoms of disease. SARS-CoV-2 infections can be asymptomatic or cause disease, COVID-19, which
manifests with a spectrum of symptoms ranging from mild to life threatening pneumonia and cytokine
dysregulation. The role of antibodies in protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections and whether antibodies may
play a role in promoting symptoms of COVID-19 remains unknown. In Project 1, we will define the heterogeneity
of antibody responses produced during SARS-CoV-2 infections and test the hypothesis that particular antibody
responses, with respect to the target antigen(s), specific epitopes and antibody effector functions, are required
for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections. We will perform studies under the following specific aims: Aim 1:
Characterize antibodies elicited by SARS-CoV-2; Aim 2: Define antibody correlates of COVID-19 pathogenesis
and protection. These studies will include structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy that will delineate
the main binding epitopes and molecular characteristics of antibody recognition against the SARS-CoV-2 spike
protein. Further, we will investigate whether there are antibody profiles that correlate with more severe outcomes
in COVID-19. Results from these studies will guide the development of safe and effective vaccines and
monoclonal antibodies for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19."
11171008,"PROJECT 2: SUMMARY
The B cell and plasma cell populations that give rise to serum and mucosal antibodies will ultimately determine
the effectiveness and duration of an individual’s humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We will
use several mutually-supporting strategies to analyze these cells in the Boyd lab: single B cell phenotyping, B
cell receptor (BCR) deep sequencing and determination of antigen specificity with DNA-barcoded antigen
tetramers; bulk B cell immunoglobulin gene repertoire sequencing; and monoclonal antibody production from
antigen-specific B cells. In complementary strategy, the Jardetzky lab will make use of yeast display libraries of
patient-derived single-chain antibody variable fragments (ScFv) enriched for native heavy-light chain pairing to
determine the antigen specificity of hundreds to thousands of antigen-specific clones per patient. In longitudinal
peripheral blood samples and nasal biopsy samples we will thoroughly characterize antigen-specific B cell
clones in patient responses to SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize that with these data we will be able to determine
which features of B cell clonal responses to SARS-CoV-2 are associated with differences in COVID-19 disease
severity and differences between populations groups stratified by age, sex, ethnicity and pre-existing
conditions, or dysregulated immunity in the context of checkpoint blockade treatment. We further hypothesize
that analysis of memory B cell populations together with serological responses may predict which individuals
will have longer-lasting humoral protection against reexposure to SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we will evaluate the B
cell responses stimulated by natural infection compared to vaccination, beginning with the Covaxx peptide-
based vaccine cohort, but with the expectation that additional vaccines will be approved for use during the
period of this project funding. In addition to studying aspects of the B cell responses that differ among these
clinical scenarios, we will search for features such as “convergent” virus-specific BCRs of highly similar
sequences shared between different individuals that may have prognostic value, for example by revealing that
an individual has a potent neutralizing antibody response to SARS-CoV-2. Our Aims are the following:
Specific Aim 1: Analyze B cell responses in acute COVID-19 disease.
Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the formation of B cell memory to SARS-CoV-2.
Specific Aim 3: Analyze mucosal B cell and plasma cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 compared to responses of
B cells in the blood."
11171009,"PROJECT 3: SUMMARY
COVID-19 is currently a global pandemic, but human T cell responses contributing to the quantity and quality of
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, or acting by cytotoxic mechanisms on infected cells, remain poorly understood.
In this U54 Project, we will study virus-specific T cell immunity in the blood as well as the respiratory mucosal
tissues where the virus is likely to initiate infection. We will also compare responses to natural infection with
those generated by a peptide-based vaccine in early clinical trials, and in other vaccines approved during this 5-
year study. Our groups have previously developed a suite of innovative, high-throughput technologies and
computational algorithms to enable the analysis of TCR alpha beta sequences, transcriptional profiles, and
epigenetic states in primary T cells from human samples, providing a comprehensive view of T cell specificity
and molecular phenotype. We hypothesize that a critical component of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is the antigen-
specificity, phenotype, and epigenetic durability of the T cell response, and the goal of this study is to measure
these components using high-throughput genomic tools to inform clinical profiles of protective immunity and the
design of effective vaccination strategies. In the first aim, we will build a comprehensive database of  TCRs
specific for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants to identify private and shared TCR specificities associated with disease
response and immunity. In the second aim, we will pair TCR specificities with transcriptional and epigenetic
phenotypes in SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells to identify immunotypes of the virus-specific T cell response. In the
third aim, we will investigate the role of epigenetic changes due to X chromosome inactivation in lymphocytes in
sex bias in COVID-19 immunity. We will pursue these aims in the context of several large patient cohorts of
COVID-19 patients, convalescent donors, and healthy subjects developed by the Clinical Virology Core, and all
T cell response data will be integrated with serology and B cell measurements in collaboration with Projects 1
and 2. Altogether, our studies will guide efforts to understand: (1) the diversity and specificity of antigen-specific
T cell responses in COVID-19 patients, (2) the phenotypes and durability of T cell memory in recovered
individuals, (3) relationships between T and B cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, and (4) T cell responses
stimulated by vaccination compared to natural infection."

interface with patient advocates, NCI program staff, external and internal advisory boards, NCI SeroNet activities,
other Lung Cancer NCI Networks, and collaborating institutions. The Center’s Administrative Core is led by three
world leaders in lung cancer translational research, founders of the COVID-19 Lung Cancer Consortium (CLCC),
who all have extensive experience leading large and complex lung cancer translational research programs: Dr.
Fred R. Hirsch at the Tisch Cancer Institute and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Dr. John Minna at
UTSW and Dr. Paul A. Bunn Jr. at the University of Colorado. The Administration Core PIs will work closely with
the U54 overall Co-PI (Dr. Adolfo Garcia-Sastre), the U54’s Steering Committee, which consists of the overall
PIs, the Administrative Core PIs, the Project and Core PIs, and a representative for our partner organization, the
patient advocacy organization GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer. The U54’s Steering Committee will have the
assistance and advice of an Internal Advisory Board (IAB) and an External Advisory Board (EAB). The IAB
will be established within the Mount Sinai Health System and will provide scientific advice and smooth access to
required institutional resources. The EAB consists of international leaders in thoracic oncology and in medical
virology and vaccinology and will assist with providing scientific advice and evaluating scientific progress with a
special focus on lung cancer implications. The specific aims of the Administrative Core are: AIM 1: Direct
the overall scientific integration and administrative management of the U54 and ensure effective communication
between U54 Project and Core investigators; AIM 2: Oversee Administration of Patient Cohorts, Clinical Studies,
Financial Reporting, and Regulatory Aspects; and AIM 3: Manage connection of the U54 with the NCI, SeroNet,
and other lung cancer research (e.g. NCI Lung-SPORE) and patient advocacy networks. Thus, the
Administrative Core will help this U54 to maximize its potential both internally (Mount Sinai, UTSW, and
University of Colorado), and inter-institutionally, including interactions with the NCI Serological Sciences Network
and the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR).
Successful completion of our U54 activities is expected to substantially increase our understanding of the
association between lung cancer SARS-CoV-2 antibody response based on infection or vaccination, and
ultimately be of significant service in designing lung cancer patient-specific SARS-CoV-2 preventive measures."

The central mission of the Clinical Core (CC) is to oversee all aspects of clinical study development, patient
recruitment and specimen collection for analysis in the Center’s scientific projects. The CC is led by Drs. Paul
Bunn, Philip Mack, and Jorge Gomez. Together with co-investigators Dr. Brody (Director of Mount Sinai Cancer
Biorepository) and Drs. Henschke and Yankelevitz (Directors of the Mount Sinai Lung Cancer Screening
Network), the CC brings to bear a wealth of experience in clinical trials development, translational medicine and
biorepository management. As described in Aim 1, the CC will be responsible for development, compliance,
IRB-approval, implementation and monitoring of the clinical study that serves as the basis for this U54 Center.
A foremost responsibility of the CC will be to rigorously maintain all regulatory, safety, privacy, confidentiality and
compliance elements necessary for clinical study enrollment. Leveraging the experience and infrastructure of
the Mount Sinai Tisch Cancer Institute Clinical Trials Office, the CC will oversee all study enrollment, following
all HIPAA and regulatory compliance elements. While developed and managed by the CC, the study will be
implemented in close partnership with the Data Science Core, and Project Investigators, under the guidance
of the Center leadership and Steering Committee. In Aim 2, the CC will Identify and enroll lung cancer and
control subjects onto the study, collecting the required longitudinal clinical information and serial blood
specimens. Lung cancer patients will be recruited mostly from Mount Sinai. Some patients of special interest
(younger, minorities) will be recruited through the GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer network. Non-lung cancer
matched controls will be recruited from the Mount Sinai Lung Cancer Screening Program, and will be composed
of individuals with no evidence of lung cancer and no active cancer within the last 5 years (except skin cancer),
matched by age, gender, ethnicity and tobacco smoking history. As vaccines become available, recruitment will
segue from studying antibody response to natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 to vaccine-induced antibodies

Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, PKAN, is a rare progressive
neurodegenerative disorder associated with iron accumulation in the brain. The disease causes
early immobility and often death by early adulthood. PKAN is caused by mutations in one of four
human pantothenate kinase genes, PANK2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial pantothenate
kinase. Consistent with the clinical presentation of PKAN in humans, cell biological analyses from
patient-derived cells as well as phenotypic characterization of mouse models of PKAN have
demonstrated that the loss of PANK2 activity results in major metabolic, cellular and physiological
defects. To date, no specific or established therapy exists for PKAN with most treatments directed
towards managing symptoms and to slow disease progression. We hypothesize that activation of
the human PANK3 (hPANK3) enzyme would result in stimulation of CoA production in PANK2
mutated cells and would represent an ideal treatment of PKAN. Chemical screening and
subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization (SAR) of the lead chemotype identified 9 human
PANK3 activators (VTAC1-9) that strongly activate hPANK3 with AC50 values in the nM range.
These compounds do not affect the activity of human PANK1 or PANK2, show no toxicity against
four human cell lines and one primary human cell, and have desirable functionality and solubility
properties. Pharmacokinetics studies in mice with the early leads VTAC1 and VTAC2
demonstrated both plasma and brain exposure, excellent t½, and no apparent toxicity. Together
these data indicate that these compounds are ideal candidates for the development of an effective
and safe PKAN therapy. The goal of the parent grant and proposed research is to conduct
detailed characterization of active VTACs and a library of their analogs to identify late leads
that could be advanced towards future clinical development. Towards this end, we will
pursue the following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will complete current SAR on this family
compounds by characterizing the biochemical activity, selectivity and physico-chemical properties
of an already synthesized 29 analogs and an additional 200 compounds to be evaluated on an
iterative basis. In Aim 2, we will conduct cell-based assays to identify compounds with excellent
in vitro therapeutic index and can restore biological activity in pank2-deficient cells. In Aim 3, we
will conduct ADME and PK analyses and evaluate the in vivo efficacy of VTAC1 and VTAC2 and
new leads from Aim 1 in pank2-/- mice and SynCrepank1fl/flpank2fl/fl mice by monitoring important
PKAN biological metrics including activation of the CoA metabolic pathway, iron homeostasis,
mitochondrial metabolism, and rescue of PKAN-like phenotypes. The success of these studies
will set the stage for future clinical evaluation of a lead activator of hPANK3 as a possible effective
and safe treatment for PKAN."

11174185,"Living donor kidney transplantation is the best treatment for selected patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, living kidney donation is not without medical consequences and risks. As in the general population, long-term health risks in donors vary by race, sex, and age. Post-donation sequelae have been primarily studied in national registry data linked to mortality and ESKD data, with comparison groups of “healthy non-donor controls” contrived from unrelated cohort studies. One notable risk to donors is developing ESKD, the very condition their donation sought to fix.  
Our team has been working for more than a decade to understand risk factors for kidney living donors. Several environmental, lifestyle, and genetic risk factors have been demonstrated among the general population, and the fact that biological relationship to the recipient is a risk factor for ESKD in donors suggests a possible gene-mediated risk in living donors. LKDs, however, are biologically distinct from the general population and donor risk factors for ESKD might or might not align with those in the general population. On the one hand, loss of one kidney and hyperfiltration of the existing kidney may increase the impact of genetic or other risk factors; on the other hand, that donors are healthy at the time of donation may mean that some risk factors have decreased or no impact. Unfortunately, the impact of many genetic, clinical, social, and lifestyle risk factors that may confer added risk of ESKD in kidney donors is unknown, forcing donors to make a life-altering decision with inadequate information. We aim to improve the counseling and selection of living donors by developing tools for tailored risk prediction according to donor characteristics. However, this cannot be done prospectively because it takes so long for living donors to develop ESKD. This work will prepare us to use an innovative case-cohort study design to address this gap. 
We propose to use qualitative research to inform recruitment strategies and messaging to maximize recruitment of black donors. We will conduct semi structured interviews with 30 living kidney donors to understand willingness to participate in a case cohort study and undergo genetic testing and counseling for research purposes. We will also gather their perspectives to inform our recruitment strategy. We will also conduct community engagement activities via a community advisory board (Living Kidney Donor Research Advisory Council) to build trust and inform future research approaches. In this process, we will also obtain feedback and recommendations for how to best produce videos to be used for recruitment purposes."

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem with high prevalence, high mortality and morbidity, and substantial expense. Black Americans are disproportionately affected by the disease. For example, in the US, Black Americans account for nearly 40% of the population with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), though they comprise only 13% of the general US population. Despite the persistent disparities for several decades, we have made little progress. Critical knowledge gaps have impeded progress to eliminate the disparities. Our previous award focused on racial disparities in CKD outcomes after the onset of CKD and yielded several key findings. We found that, beginning from the onset of CKD, compared to White patients, Black patients had persistently >2-fold higher risk of progressing to ESKD, but conversely had lower risk of death. Furthermore, at the onset of CKD, Black patients were strikingly 8 years younger than White patients. This earlier age of onset and unexpectedly lower risk of death after CKD onset suggest that differential risk factors and selection bias might have developed in the period before CKD and generated these later differences. Studying risk factors prior to CKD onset (pre-CKD) will be critical to fully understand these disparities. In this project we will extend our work to the period preceding CKD to evaluate upstream determinants such as community-level structural racism and socioeconomic status that contribute to early development of CKD risk factors (downstream factors) among Black adults. In Aim 1, we will develop and examine a range of uni-dimensional and multi-dimensional structural racism measures at the community level corresponding to geographic units such as counties or Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). In Aim 2, we will assess to what extent components of structural racism contribute to the racial differences in development of early CKD risk factors. These aims will be accomplished by analyzing a national cohort of veterans at-risk for CKD. The findings of this project will help us focus on identifying and modifying early CKD risk factors and upstream factors."
10981032,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Recycling endosomes, organelles intimately involved in the return of proteins and lipids to the plasma
membrane after their endocytosis, are of fundamental importance to plasma membrane turnover and the
control of plasma membrane composition. Advancing mechanistic understanding of recycling endosome
formation and function thus holds broad relevance to many areas of biomedicine. The mechanisms that
regulate recycling endosome biogenesis and function remain relatively poorly understood, lagging well behind
our understanding of other trafficking pathways. Our studies take advantage of the enormous technical
advantages in the simple animal model C. elegans that yield mechanistic insight into cell biological processes
within the physiologically relevant context of an intact metazoan animal. We then extend these find ings to
mammalian cells to expand understanding and define phylogenetic conservation. We focus on a system that
we pioneered, the C. e/egans intestine, a simple model that allows facile analysis of endocytic membrane
transport pathways within intact polarized epithelia. There is no cell division or cell replacement in the intestine
after embryogenesis, further simplifying analysis of mutant phenotypes. During the previous granting period we
greatly expanded our understanding of the essential endosomal regulator RME-8/DNAJC13. Our work
elucidated autoregulatory mechanisms controlling the RME-8 protein that allow RME-8 to regulate the
dynamics of endosomal coats and maintain separation of endosomal microdomains with conflicting functions.
We also showed that RME-8 is required for autophagic lysosome reformation in C. elegans and mouse
neurons, relevant to links between RME-8 to Parkinsonism. Our new studies during the last funding period also
focused our attention on fundamental forces that drive endosomal fission, particularly of recycling tubules that
must be severed from sorting endosomes to form recycling endosomes. Actin polymerization on endosomes
has long been proposed to provide necessary membrane tension to promote fission, but a clear understanding
of how actin contributes to tension, and how fission is regulated remain as large gaps in understanding that
require more in-depth study. Our studies provided surprising new evidence that non-muscle myosin II (NMII)
regulates endocytic recycling. We further discovered an endosomal signaling hub centered on the Syndapin
protein that controls endosomal RhoA and actomyosin. Here we propose extensive studies in C. elegans to
better define how the Syndapin pathway controls NMII and fission, extend this analysis into mammalian cells,
and determine the role of specific NMII isoforms in the fission process. We also identified a connection of
Syndapin-based RhoA-regulation that indicates signaling from endosomes to the nucleus for long-term
regulation of recycling. Our studies will test key predictions of these models and gain new understanding of
mechanisms that integrate acute and long-term regulation of endocytic recycling."

The Johns Hopkins Excellence in Pathogenesis and Immunity Center for SARS-CoV-2 (JH-EPICS) aims to
systematically analyze the innate, T cell, and antibody responses that either protect or cause pathology during
SARS-CoV-2 infection. In order to accurately accomplish the Specific Aims within the three JH-EPICS
Research Projects, a consistent and reliable source of virus-specific reagents and methods is required. The
Virology Resource Core (VRC) is tasked with providing SARS-CoV-2-specific reagents and access to BSL3
facilities to perform experiments with virus infected cells for the three JH-EPICS Research Projects. The VRC
draws on the expertise of Andrew Pekosz, PhD (Lead) and Michael Betenbaugh, PhD (Co-Lead) to generate
these reagents. The VRC will produce recombinant proteins and, in particular, proteins with complex
carbohydrate moieties. The VRC has the ability to use mammalian cells to express small or large quantities of
purified proteins that will be used by all the JH-EPICS Research Projects to measure viral antigen specific
responses. The Lead of the VRC has experience with respiratory viruses, such as influenza, SARS-CoV, and
SARS-CoV-2, which will enable the VRC to rigorously and accurately grow and provide the JH-EPICS
Research Projects with a consistent source of virus particles or infected cell lysates that have been inactivated
and can be used in laboratories outside of BSL3-containment. The VRC will provide the expertise and access
to facilities necessary to perform experiments on virus-infected cells, which will allow the JH-EPICS
investigators to validate results with live virus. The centralized production of these reagents, the use of
standardized protocols for virus infections, and consistent use across JH-EPICS Research Projects will
improve the quality, rigor, and reproducibility of data to increase the public health significance of the JH-EPICS

11169273,"ABSTRACT
Heterochromatin, a gene-repressive nuclear ultrastructure, is required for the normal patterning of the genome
into active and inactive regions, to preserve structural integrity and drive and maintain developmental fates.
While heterochromatin assembly is locally nucleated by DNA-sequences, the majority of the patterning process
requires it to spread along the chromatin template. A major form of heterochromatin involved in this patterning
is signaled by methylation (me) at Lysine 9 (K9) of histone 3 (H3). Major questions have remained unanswered
about heterochromatin spreading, which has limited our ability to effectively manipulate this process for
regenerative medicine or synthetic biology: 1. What are the biochemical mechanisms underlying it? 2. How can
heterochromatin spread over loci of vastly different chemical, structural and stability regimes? And 3. How is the
reaction tuned to expand or contract during development to stabilize cell fate switches? Over the last four years,
my laboratory has devised strategies to tackle these questions. We have developed single-cell sensors of
heterochromatin spreading that have enabled us to document the intrinsic behavior of the reaction in real-time
(Al-Sady et al, 2016; Greenstein et al, 2018), how euchromatic features sculpt the spreading reaction (Greenstein
et al 2019) and defined genes that enable this process in different chromatin environments (Greenstein & Ng et
al, 2020). Additionally, we have developed single molecule systems to study histone methylation on individual
chromatin strands and bulk biochemical methods to probe the function of the H3K9me “writer machines”. Over
the next five years, we will deploy these experimental systems to fully illuminate the heterochromatin spreading
process from three angles: 1. The writer machine: We will use single molecule and biochemical sequencing
approaches to unravel the mechanisms and molecular trajectories by which the enzyme complexes “write”
H3K9me along the chromatin template. 2. The substrate: Heterochromatin spreading occurs over radically
different chromatin landscapes and cannot fit a “one-size-fits-all” model. We will use single-cell heterochromatin
spreading sensors in fission yeast to examine how chromatin loci of different activity states or the same locus
with different histories impact the reaction. Further, we will define the genetic circuitry that enables and tunes
spreading in different chromatin environments. 3. The view form development: We focus on the developmentally
crucial H3K9 methylase G9a/GLP and will distinguish different hypotheses on how developmentally triggered,
G9a/GLP-dependent heterochromatin expansions and contractions are implemented in mammalian stem cells.
Further, since the relationship between H3K9 methylation by G9a/GLP and silencing is elusive, we will define
the steps that must occur for gene repression after H3K9 methylation. Together, this suite of projects connects
the intrinsic biochemical features of heterochromatin spreading, to the steady-state and developmentally
dynamic genome partitioning function of this unique ultrastructure, which underlies genome and cell fate stability."

 Many individuals with cognitive impairment experience decrements in everyday function that can signal
encroaching dementia. For every year that cognitive decline is delayed there is substantial savings in patient
care costs and inestimable savings in quality of life for patients and family members. The prevalence of
cognitive impairment in chronic stroke is approximately 50%. A number of techniques have been found to
improve various aspects of cognition in the training situation. However, their transfer to everyday situations
outside the training setting has been limited as is retention. They are therefore of reduced or narrow practical
value. A cognitive ability that is improved but not used to enhance real-world performance has limited
significance. Pilot work has been carried out here with a novel intervention designed to fill these crucial gaps.
The results are very promising. The purpose of the proposed research is to carry out a randomized controlled
trial (RCT) with a large enough sample to rigorously evaluate these preliminary results.
 The new treatment to be tested combines two repeatedly validated rehabilitation methods: the Transfer
Package of CI Movement Therapy and Speed of Cognitive Processing Training. The purpose of doing so is to
produce a marked enhancement in the transfer of cognitive improvement from the training setting to
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in everyday situations. Both halves of the new combination therapy
are founded on the investigators' own basic research. In both cases, efficacy is supported by positive results
from multiple single-site RCTs and a large multisite RCT. However, the effect of Speed of Processing Training
has been found to have limited generalization to cognitive-based IADL in everyday situations. In contrast, one
of the main strengths of CI Therapy is that it produces a robust and extensive transfer of treatment effect to
everyday life situations by means, in part, of its Transfer Package. A second strength of the Transfer Package
of CI Therapy is long-term retention of its effect. In our initial work, the Transfer Package procedures that this
lab has used effectively to transfer motor gains from the treatment to everyday setting were adapted to transfer
cognitive gains from the treatment to the everyday setting.
 We propose here an RCT with 2 arms: Speed of Processing Training (SOPT) in the lab combined with
the TP (TP+) and SOPT in the lab but without the TP (TP-). Participants will be 120 adults more than 1-year
post-stroke with mild to moderate cognitive impairment. Performance on cognitive-based tasks will be
measured in daily life and in the lab before and after baseline, after treatment, and 6- and 12-months
afterwards. This design will permit rigorous testing of the value of the Transfer Package with an adequate
sample size, objective measurement, blinding, and between-subjects control for amount and intensity of
training and therapist contact."
11169371,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The rising prevalence of cirrhosis, the end-stage of any chronic liver injury, is a significant contributor to morbidity
and mortality in the United States. Preventative measures including treatment of underlying liver disease,
monitoring and screening for complications and addressing risk factors associated with disease progression are
key to improved survival. As cirrhosis progresses, complications such as liver failure and liver cancer develop,
resulting in death. Racial/ethnic minorities, individuals with substance use disorders, HIV infection, and those
with low socioeconomic status are all at high risk for cirrhosis complications due to comorbidities and barriers to
healthcare access. Liver transplantation is the only medically viable option in end stage liver disease but given
the shortage of organs and even more numerous patients who are unable to be considered for liver
transplantation listing, there is a significant need to improve our understanding of underlying pro- and anti-fibrotic
processes and risk factors along with potential therapies to halt disease progression. In addition, evaluation of
contribution of clinical risk and social determinants of health that may differentially impact cirrhosis burden in at
risk populations is critical to addressing disparities in cirrhosis burden in this country. Thus, effective strategies
for prevention of cirrhosis complications is a high-priority need. Accumulating evidence suggests that statin, a
lipid lowering drug, has a preventative role in cirrhosis. Statins improve portal venous pressure and decrease
liver cancer risk and mortality in cirrhosis in epidemiologic studies and limited clinical trials. However, large
pragmatic randomized controlled trials in patients with compensated cirrhosis are required to confirm these
observations. To address these gaps in knowledge about cirrhosis as well as the unmet clinical needs of patients
with the disease, two sites within the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and their diverse community
links will contribute to the Liver Cirrhosis Network with the following specific aims: 1. To assemble a longitudinal
cohort with diverse etiology and stage of cirrhosis supported by comprehensive clinical measures and a
biospecimen repository in order to promote clinical and translational research in cirrhosis; 2. To conduct a
randomized controlled double-blind trial testing the efficacy and safety of a rosuvastatin versus placebo in
patients with compensated cirrhosis. Our short-term goals are to better characterize clinical risks and social
determinants of health associated with cirrhosis complications in at risk populations, to evaluate a Hippo pathway
related mechanism for cirrhosis progression (the YAP score), and to assess the role of rosuvastatin in
compensated cirrhosis and clinically significant portal hypertension from fatty liver disease (alcoholic and
nonalcoholic) and chronic viral hepatitis in those with or without HIV infection. The results are expected to have
broad implications, given that progressive fibrosis defines chronic injury not only in the liver but in essentially all
epithelial tissues."
11170840,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Our previous work demonstrated that hypoxic breathing, simulating high-altitude living, can prevent and reverse 
neurological damage in a mouse model of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) deficiency caused by 
mutations in a key complex 1 subunit. This research revealed that chronic hypoxia significantly extends lifespan 
and rescues biomarkers, behavior, and neuropathology. Building on these findings, a Phase 1 clinical trial 
exposing healthy volunteers to controlled hypoxia was performed.
To expand the understanding of hypoxia therapy's broader applicability, we are now testing the ability of low 
oxygen to rescue additional mitochondrial diseases caused by mutations in the mitochondrial proteostasis 
system. Furthermore, we propose investigating two potential mechanisms of hypoxia-mediated rescue: (1) 
activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) transcriptional response to promote metabolic adaptations and 
(2) stabilization of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster-containing protein complexes affected by ETC dysfunction.
By elucidating these mechanisms, this research will provide critical insights into optimizing hypoxia-based 
therapies for mitochondrial diseases and inform treatment strategies for broader clinical applications."

Abstract
This application is a supplement application to U01 EB034205-01, “Multiple x-ray source array
(MXA) computed tomography”. The Corgi phantom is an image quality and radiation dosimetry
phantom designed specifically for CT scanners and cone beam CT systems and is sold
commercially by the Phantom Laboratory. A key component to this physical phantom is analysis
software which will automatically generate rigorous image quality metrics such as the
modulation transfer function, the noise power spectrum, linearity, spatial uniformity, and cupping
artifact – automatic assessment is performed by uploading the DICOM CT information to the
Phantom Laboratory website. Aim 1 of this proposal is to add an additional module to the
existing modular Corgi phantom, which contains signals which allow the assessment of both
volume and texture. Volume accuracy is important in cancer imaging (etc.), and texture analysis
is important to the growing field of CT radiomics. Aim 2 of this proposal will make use of the
existing Corgi capabilities in addition to the new capabilities to assess the development of the
MXA-CT scanner prototype which is the subject of the parent award. Aim 3 of the proposal will
be to develop a user group of CT physicists around the country who will use the infrastructure
created by the NIST/NIBIB Phantom Lending Library to access both the Corgi phantom and the
evaluation software and evaluate unique CT scanner technologies at their institutions. The user
group will be able to assess and perhaps improve the infrastructure at the Phantom Lending
Library, in recognition that this phantom includes both hardware and software licensure
requirements. Overall, the proposed research will result in an improved Corgi phantom capable
of rigorous and quantitative assessment of CT scanner performance. It will be useful to
researchers developing new hardware or reconstruction software for CT, and it will also be very
useful to clinical medical physicists as they survey CT scanners at their institutions. The
comprehensive set of quantitative metrics, combined with the ease of use and reproducibility of
the assessment software, will improve CT performance evaluation and help to standardize the
metrics for CT image quality performance."
11163010,"Black and Hispanic adults suffer disproportionately from obesity and obesity-related conditions (e.g.,
Hispanic/White ratio: diabetes (1.7) compared to their white counterparts. While behavioral weight loss (WL)
interventions are the first line in treating obesity, they have mixed outcomes. Most fail to make a persistent
impact, especially in specific racial/ethnic subgroups. For example, Black women lose 50% less weight than their
white counterparts, even when enrolled in fully powered, well-designed behavioral WL trials. One plausible
reason for these sub-optimal results is a focus on behavior change at the individual level alone while neglecting
critical social and environmental forces. Social networks have been increasingly shown to influence health
behaviors, yet they have seldom been harnessed in studies targeting weight loss, especially among racial/ethnic
minorities. In response to PAS-20-160 Small R01s for Clinical Trials Targeting Diseases within the Mission
of NIDDK, this application will compare the effects of a social-network enhanced lifestyle intervention (hereafter
termed ""ROBUST"" Reducing OBesity Using Social Ties) to an individual level lifestyle intervention (control) on
modifying multiple network-level barriers to weight loss. We will randomly enroll 132 Black or Hispanic adults
with obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) and invite up to two social network members of participants in the ROBUST arm
to a 24 –week multi-competent lifestyle intervention. We will evaluate whether the ROBUST intervention not
only addresses individual-level behaviors (i.e., healthy eating, increased physical activity) but also: 1) reduces
social undermining as well as changes perceived health norms by activating communal coping - a behavioral
process that involves thinking, communicating, and acting as if a health risk (i.e., Type 2 diabetes) is shared;
and 2) dampens the harmful effects of increased interpersonal conflict on weight by teaching participants how to
induce a positive affect and self-affirming mindset which we have shown in a previous trial (NHLBI-U01HL07843)
prevents unwanted weight gain. Participants in the control arm will receive the same number of lifestyle sessions
as those randomized to ROBUST. But, their social network will not be directly engaged in the study. We
hypothesize that the ROBUST intervention will satisfy all a priori feasibility/acceptability criteria for recruitment,
retention, and study conduct. Additionally, the ROBUST intervention will result in positive changes in multiple
barriers to behavior change, leading to a more significant proportion of participants experiencing improvements
in diet, physical activity, and weight loss at 24 weeks compared to the control group. If proven effective, the
preliminary data gathered from this small RO1 will support a fully powered RCT that will result in an optimized
multi-level obesity intervention that impacts critical clinical endpoints (i.e., BMI, insulin resistance, and
hemoglobin A1c) in a population at very high risk of poor outcomes related to obesity and its metabolic sequelae."

The JH-EPICS Analysis Resource Core (ARC) will provide statistical modeling and analysis support to
investigators in this U54 proposal. In addition, the ARC will provide guidance in the framing and testing of
hypotheses about the intersectionality of gender, age, racial, and ethnic differences in immune mechanisms in
COVID-19. In both roles, the ARC will assure that the U54 research is valid, transparent, and reproducible.
Current evidence shows that the COVID-19 pandemic has differential effects on men and women, including in
relation to disease severity and mortality and negative social and economic impacts. It is vital that we explore
how sex and gender intersect with other biological and social stratifiers if we are to have effective and
appropriate therapeutic treatment and interventions. In its statistical analysis role, the ARC will develop and
implement statistical models and methods for comparing longitudinal trajectories among subgroups of the
Johns Hopkins COVID-19 registry using multiple measures of immune function. We will support the three
Research Projects to devise tests of specific hypotheses about baseline and time-varying factors that affect
disease progression. In its intersectionality function, the Core will provide expert guidance to both Projects to
test hypotheses about the intersectionality of gender (social construct), sex (biological construct), race,
ethnicity, and age differences with the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the human immune system. In collaboration
with the U54 investigators, the ARC will: 1. Acquire, manage, and curate data from laboratory experiments
and from the Johns Hopkins CROWN (COVID-19 Precision Medicine Analytics Platform) Registry of all
COVID-19 patients who receive health services within the Johns Hopkins network of 5 hospitals. 2. Frame the
investigators’ scientific questions in statistical terms, then design laboratory and/or clinical studies that
produce the strongest possible evidence to answer the questions posed. 3. Design and implement statistical
analyses and collaborate on interpretation of results so as to produce valid, transparent, and reproducible
scientific findings. Validity will be assured by distinguishing hypothesis generating from hypothesis testing
analyses. Each hypothesis testing analysis will have a pre-specified statistical analysis plan in advance of
working with the data. 4. Analyze the role of sex and gender and the intersection of sex and gender with
other biological and social stratifiers, such as age, race, and ethnicity, on COVID-19 immunologic
responses and clinical outcomes. These analyses will be integrated into Research Projects 1-3."
11171020,"PROJECT 1: ABSTRACT
Current information indicates that, in persons without cancer, natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 as well as
vaccination with COVID-19 vaccine candidates induce antibody responses to the spike protein of the virus
which should be protective against future infection. Lung cancer patients who become infected with SARS-
CoV-2 appear to develop severe COVID-19 with a high (35-40%) mortality rate indicating we urgently need to
plan for vaccine trials in this vulnerable population. Currently we have major knowledge gaps to fill in
preparation for such vaccine studies. These include: is there a higher incidence of SARS-CoV-2 in lung cancer
patients compared to the general population? Do lung cancer patients mount a comparable antibody response
in terms of quantity, quality, and longevity to people without lung cancer? Equally important are information in
lung cancer patients on the role of age, gender, smoking status, histology, and types of treatment for lung
cancer on both SARS-CoV-2 infection rate and generation of antibody responses. Through prospective
analyses of lung cancer cases (N= 1,000) and matched controls (N = 1,000) this Project “Characterization of
the Antibody Response to SARS-CoV-2 in Lung Cancer Patients” will provide answers to these important
questions through study of 4 specific aims and the use of our U54 Administrative, Clinical, and Data
Sciences Cores. Aim 1: Characterize the incident, magnitude and functionality of the antibody response to
SARS-CoV-2 in lung cancer patients versus non-lung cancer controls. Aim 2: Compare the longevity of the
antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 in lung cancer patients versus non-lung cancer controls. Aim 3:
Evaluate the impact of patient demographics and cancer-associated clinical factors on the antibody response
in lung cancer patients. And Aim 4: Characterize antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in lung
cancer patients versus non-lung cancer controls. The patient serology specimens will also be studied for viral
neutralizing functionality in collaboration with U54 Project 2. We have assembled a world-class team of lung
cancer clinical translational investigators, serology and virology experts, and patient advocates to address
these key issues. The results of this Project will have a significant impact on lung cancer patient management
during the COVID-19 pandemic, and even greater impact on designing optimal SARS-CoV-2 vaccination
regimens for lung cancer patients."
11177213,"The human mouth is a gateway for harmful pathogens that can lead to chronic conditions like gum 
inflammation and caries. The oral cavity is the second most populated microbial habitat in the body. It is 
densely colonized by over 700 microbe species and harbors an even more diverse bacterial population 
than the gut. Recent observational studies involving adults have indicated differences in oral microbiome 
diversity and abundance based on depression. Emerging evidence suggests the role of internal circadian 
rhythms in the oral microbiome, indicating circadian misalignment could significantly influence its 
composition and abundance, a phenomenon also affected by sleep loss. These findings hold particular 
significance for adolescents experiencing depression and undergoing developmental changes in 
sleep/wake patterns. Most of the work on the taxonomic composition of microbial communities has been 
descriptive and based on small-scale clinical studies. Research on the associations between the oral 
microbiome and depression has mainly involved adults. These associations need replication on 
adolescent and young adult population data. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
provides a unique opportunity to replicate these associations as ii contains data on oral microbiome 
diversity and abundance, sleep and rest-activity rhythms patterns, and depression from a representative 
sample of adolescents and young adults in the United States (U.S.). Our ultimate goal is to lay the 
foundation for informing new mechanistic models for adolescent depression through in-depth oral 
microbiome research. To that end, we have developed the following specific aims: Aim 1. Describe the 
oral microbiome composition and structure among adolescents (ages 14-17) and young adults (ages 
18-24); Aim 2. Compare sleep and circadian rhythm phenotypes on oral microbiome composition and

These models involved exposing mice to chronic variable stress (CVS) and glucocorticoid (GC)-induced stress in primary neurons, respectively. This dysregulation was significantly enriched in neuritic pathways of neurons. Based on these findings, I hypothesize that these alterations in ribosomal infrastructure can modify the stoichiometric composition of ribosomes during stress in a neuron-compartment specific manner. To test this hypothesis, we will utilize GC-stressed primary neurons grown on a microporous membrane to segregate the somatic and neuritic compartments. In Aim 1, I will examine whether downregulated RPGs lead to changes in RP stoichiometry within ribosomes. This will be assessed using a tandem mass tag (TMT)-based semi-quantitative proteomics approach, with results validated through parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)-based absolute quantification. In Aim 2, I will investigate whether upregulated RP-pseudogenes can contribute to altered ribosome composition during stress by potentially translating into paralogs. This will be assessed through integration of ribosome sequencing and RNA-sequencing approaches. The altered stoichiometry of ribosomes can give rise to heterogeneous ribosomes capable of specialized translation of specific mRNA species during stress. Upon identifying the RP contributing to ribosomal heterogeneity, our future research will focus on understanding the specialization induced by these heterogeneous ribosomes."
11160215,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a chronic disease with high mortality. Several pulmonary
vasodilators that reduce morbidity and mortality, especially with earlier initiation, have been
FDA approved. However, the identification of individuals that would benefit from such therapies
currently requires extensive testing of both the heart and the lungs using multiple modalities,
resulting in high healthcare costs and delay in diagnosis. This proposal seeks to introduce an MR
imaging imaging protocol to diagnose PH within a single imaging session by providing
assessments of both cardiac and pulmonary systems. Current MRI methods have several
limitations in the above setting. This renewal application aims to overcome these drawbacks
using a novel generative SToRM (g-SToRM) framework, which capitalizes on the recent
advances in deep generative models and unsupervised learning. This framework significantly
improves the analysis manifold regularization framework (SToRM) for cardiac MRI, developed
in the previous project. The proposed imaging methods will be validated by comparisons against
current breath-held MRI and CT imaging protocols. The preliminary utility of the quantitative
metrics to predict PH will also be determined."

11177998,"ABSTRACT | RESEARCH EDUCATION CORE
The Research Education Core (REC) of the Ponce Health Sciences University and Moffitt Cancer Center
Partnership has built an educational program that supports participants across the career continuum preparing
them for basic or clinical oncology-related careers. The long-term goal of the REC is to increase the recruitment,
advancement, and quality of cancer research scientists and oncologists from the Puerto Rican and
Hispanic/Latino (H/L) population while advancing health disparities research focused on this population. Through
ongoing interactions with all components of the Partnership, the REC’s educational framework (2007-2022) has
resulted in: 125 participants obtaining faculty, medical, or industry/federal/academic positions with 30 in
hematology-oncology clinical practice; completion of 137 research rotations by PhD, MD or PsyD students;
guidance of 22 Early-Stage Investigators (ESIs); and the creation of new courses, clerkships, and robust cancer
and health disparities seminar series. Leveraging our prior successes the REC strategy is designed to jointly
engage participants across career levels and institutes to create a lasting peer mentoring network which will be
accomplished under the following aims: Aim 1 engages H/L undergraduate students at both PHSU and MCC,
eight total per year, in a new two-year-plus program with year-round mentoring and research experiences
combined with intensive summer research immersion to promote conceptual change in preconceived ideas of
limited opportunities and ‘fit’ for STEM and cancer research. Aim 2 establishes two-year diversity post-doctoral
scholarships at MCC for H/L fellows to support career success with a focus on cancer health disparities and
minority health; and also establishes career development scholarships for late-stage PHSU PhD students to
support career enhancement activities and successful transition to post-doctoral training. Two rolling scholarship
slots are available at each site. The scholarships are interwoven with training in cultural competency,
professionalism, scientific writing, and health disparities to successfully promote a path toward independence.
Aim 3 addresses the need to increase the number of H/L medical residents and medical students entering an
oncology career track. REC will facilitate the creation of the first urology residency program in PR, enable surgical
oncology training at MCC for two PR surgical residents per year, and immerse eight medical students per year
in a summer cancer research experience alongside PhD students. Aim 4 enhances the career development of
ESIs by providing individualized support for each ESI through collaborative interactions, health disparities
training, grant/scientific writing workshops, career development activities, identifying networking opportunities,
and tracking, and evaluating ongoing mentorship and sponsorship. In sum, REC trainees will gain cancer
research and health disparities experience through exposure to Partnership projects and Cores. The REC
outcomes will support the overall Partnership objectives by building and strengthening trainee career pathways
at critical career transition points, resulting in a more diverse pool of oncologists and research scientists."
11177208,"Project Abstract:
Most (75%), individuals living with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) are found in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where
the condition accounts for about 16% (150,000 deaths) annually of under-5 mortality. In high income
countries, evidence-based strategies to control mortality and morbidity due to SCD, reduced by 68% the
mortality of children 0 – 3 years with SCD from 1983 and 2002. This success was achieved through four
interventions: Detection of SCD as early as possible in life, through screening; aggressive prevention,
detection and treatment of fatal complications, especially infections; The use of hydroxyurea as a disease-
modifying agent; comprehensive care programs. Uganda is one of the SSA countries with a high overall
sickle cell (HbS) gene prevalence of 13%. SCD accounts for 18% of child mortality in Uganda with
estimates that 50-80% of children with the condition die before their fifth birthday. The Department of
Pediatrics & Child Health, Makerere University College of Health Sciences established a sickle cell clinic in
1968. The clinic has a sickle cell database with over 10,000 unique patient records that increases by 1000
new registrations annually. The team has developed local guidelines for management of patients with SCD,
trains students, in addition to conducting high-quality research projects and NIH funded studies. There are
however remaining challenges that include: 1) Inadequate comprehensive care to all patients that has
resulted in high burden of SCD-related morbidity and mortality. Research done in Uganda has documented
high prevalence of stroke, neurocognitive impairments, acute chest syndrome, and micro-albuminuria
among children with SCD. 2) due to a lack of a comprehensive newborn screening program, many children
are diagnosed later in life or die before diagnosis, and 3) Low use of hydroxyurea despite the findings that it
is safe and effective for use in this setting. The team at Makerere University is applying to join the Sickle
Pan-African Research Consortium (SPARCO) as one of the Collaborative Consortium new sites, with a
goal of improving the health outcomes of individuals with of SCD disease in Uganda, through
implementation of evidence-based interventions. We shall leverage the resources and lessons learnt from
NIH investments in Uganda including the H3Africa biorepository (UH2 HG007051; Joloba), MEPI project
(R24TW008886, Sewankambo) and other ongoing grants including the HEPI project (1R25TW011213-01,
Kiguli) to achieve this. The project goal will be achieved through the following specific aims: Aim 1: To
develop a centralized, electronic, patient consented haemoglobinopathy registry at Mulago National
Referral Sickle Cell Clinic. Aim 2: To improve SCD patient outcomes in Uganda by establishing SCD
standards of care. Aim 3: To advance SCD related research by conducting cohort studies and
implementation science studies on patients enrolled in the SCD registry; and an additional study on
additional study on the transition from pediatric to adult care by SCD adolescents. MakCHS has well-
established, efficient mechanisms for coordinating and managing research grants. By the end of this 5-year
support, we anticipate having a system to support the sustainability of high quality SCD research and
clinical care that is scalable in Uganda and SSA."

11175835,"ABSTRACT: Cardiomyocyte proliferation is an important source of new myocardium during heart development
and regeneration. After birth cardiomyocytes are highly resistant to proliferation. The lack of adult cardiomyocyte
proliferation precludes cardiac repair and underlies the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with
congenital heart defects and adult cardiovascular disease. Therefore, identifying novel regulators of
cardiomyocyte proliferation is key to the development of regenerative heart therapies. Zebrafish are a well-
established model to study cardiac development and regeneration because their cardiomyocytes maintain a
remarkable capacity to proliferate allowing the heart to regenerate after adult injury. Our lab recently reported
that the AAA+ ATPase Reptin is a potent suppressor of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Reptin is a known
component of the Tip60 and INO80 complexes which have roles in DNA damage repair and chromatin
remodeling. Our lab demonstrated in zebrafish that reptin loss of function mutations cause myocardial
hyperplasia at 3 days post fertilization (dpf). We showed that cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of reptin
rescues the cardiomyocyte hyperproliferation phenotype. We further demonstrated that inducible overexpression
of reptin after adult cardiac injury resulted in decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and failure to regenerate.
Expanding on our published data, I propose to study the molecular mechanisms by which Reptin suppresses
cardiomyocyte proliferation. Preliminary data suggests that the ATPase function of Reptin is essential to dampen
proliferation at 3 dpf. RNA sequencing of reptin mutant and control cardiomyocytes at 3 dpf revealed the
unanticipated result that the hyperproliferative reptin mutant cardiomyocytes upregulate both pro-proliferative
(e.g. fosl1a & junba) and anti-proliferative (e.g. tp53 & cbx7a) transcripts. Analysis at 4 and 5 dpf revealed that
the reptin mutant cardiomyocytes lose their hyperproliferative phenotype by 4 dpf and have significantly reduced
proliferation rates compared to controls at 5 dpf. I hypothesize: 1) that reptin mutant cardiomyocytes require
AP-1 activity for their initial proliferative burst where DNA damage accumulates and triggers tp53
upregulation to halt cell division, and 2) that compensatory upregulation of the PRC1 complex
component cbx7a drives an anti-proliferative chromatin landscape in reptin mutant cardiomyocytes. In
Aim 1, I will assess the sufficiency of AP-1 family members to drive cardiomyocyte proliferation in embryonic
zebrafish, the accumulation of DNA damage in hyperproliferative reptin mutant cardiomyocytes, and the role of
tp53 upregulation in DNA damage signaling and cell cycle arrest in reptin mutant hearts. In Aim 2, I will identify
changes in the chromatin landscape that are associated with reptin loss of function and correlate those
alterations to changes in gene expression. I will also investigate the ability of cbx7a to dampen cardiomyocyte
proliferation in wildtype and reptin mutant backgrounds. The proposed studies will give insight into the regulation
of cardiomyocyte proliferation and identify druggable pathways/targets for novel regenerative therapies."
11145531,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Antiretroviral therapy has transformed HIV infection into a chronic disease and the population living with HIV
infection (PLWH) is aging. PLWH are twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) and in the past
two decades, the global burden of HIV-associated CVD has tripled. Chronic inflammation and immune activation
persist in the setting of treated HIV and are strongly predictive of CVD events and mortality. In the general
population, acquired mutations in hematopoietic cells (clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, CHIP)
increase with age and are associated with an increased risk for CVD and premature MI independent of age or
other traditional risk factors. Clonally expanded blood cells contain large scale mosaic chromosomal alterations
(mCAs) which also increase with age and are associated with risk for infectious disease, and mortality but have
not been studied in HIV. While the underlying mechanisms for excess risk of CVD among people with CHIP
mutations is not clear, recent studies suggest the NLRP3/IL-1β/IL-6 pathways play a role. This is critically
important because these pathways represent targets for immunomodulatory therapy and underlying
mechanisms by which PLWH have an excess risk of CVD. Our group has demonstrated that HIV is associated
with a 2-fold increase in CHIP and have a high prevalence of mCA but the relationship between CHIP/mCA and
CVD risk in PLWH has not been evaluated; furthermore, the underlying mechanism for increased CHIP/mCA
among PLWH remains unknown. We plan to study the existing Veterans Aging Cohort Study Biomarkers Cohort
(VACS BC) which is a prospective observational cohort of 1525 HIV+ and 853 HIV- Veterans with extensive
adjudicated outcomes, existing data on biomarkers of inflammation, and immune function. An additional 1000
PLWH in the Center for AIDS Research Network of integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) and 1002 PLWH in the
Department of Defense (DoD) cohort will also be studied. We hypothesize that HIV is a fertile substrate for
development of CHIP mutations and mCAs and that CHIP activates inflammation to drive HIV-associated
atherosclerosis. We propose the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: To determine if CHIP mutations and mCAs are
more prevalent in PLWH vs. uninfected individuals (Aim 1A). and to determine whether the presence of CHIP
mutations/mCAs are associated with an increased risk of CVD and mortality events in PLWH (Aim 1B); Aim 2:
To elucidate the mechanism underlying CHIP/mCA in HIV by evaluation of markers of inflammation/immune
activation, epigenomics, and HIV viral reservoir size; Aim 3: To investigate whether clonal populations of immune
cells from PLWH with CHIP display altered gene regulatory programs that increase pathologic activation of
specific immune cell types. If our hypotheses are correct, CHIP/mCAs may serve as a novel biomarker for CVD
risk among people aging with HIV infection and help identify those PLWH who may benefit most from
immunomodulatory therapies. With the completion of these specific aims, we will advance our understanding of
the role that CHIP mutations/mCAs play in the development of CVD among PLWH."
11170823,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The US population continues to age, and millions of people will likely be affected by age-related muscle atrophy
and weakness (also referred to as sarcopenia) at some point in life. This represents an enormous unmet medical
need because sarcopenia lacks effective therapy, compromises independence, and increases all-cause
mortality. Skeletal muscle fibers are long-living cells that are particularly susceptible to proteotoxic stress and,
therefore, rely on efficient selective protein degradation (i.e., degradation of damaged/misfolded proteins) to
remain functional. However, the selective degradation of toxic protein aggregates becomes defective with aging
contributing to muscle dysfunction. Protein aggregates are degraded primarily by autophagy, and yet
impairments in autophagic rates (i.e., flux) are not commonly observed in aging muscle. Collectively, these
observations point to an age-dependent impairment in the autophagic sequestration of protein aggregates in
muscle. The research proposed here would address this issue by studying the protein kinase ULK2 and its
binding partner FIP200. We have recently demonstrated that skeletal muscle ULK2, but not its better-known
paralog ULK1, is required for the autophagic sequestration and degradation of protein aggregates. Hence,
defective ULK2 activity could contribute to sarcopenia. ULK2 is activated primarily via phosphorylation. We have
identified two sites at ULK2 that are phosphorylated in adult muscle but not in aged muscle suggesting these
are functionally important. Further, FIP200, a protein that is phosphorylated by ULK2, is hypo-phosphorylated in
aged and ULK2 deficient muscles. This is relevant because FIP200 interacts with toxic protein aggregates
marked for autophagy degradation and is required for autophagosomal formation at these aggregates. Our
proposed studies will build upon these initial findings and use adult and aging mouse models to address the
central hypothesis that ULK2 is required for efficient selective degradation of protein aggregates thereby
preserving skeletal muscle quality (i.e., force and mass) across the lifespan. We propose two specific aims to
address this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will establish ULK2 role in the development and treatment of sarcopenia.
Here, we will use inducible skeletal muscle-specific mouse models to determine the impact of ULK2 loss and
gain-of-function on the degradation of protein aggregates and muscle quality in adult and aged mice. In Aim 2,
we will define critical mechanisms by which ULK2 regulates the degradation of protein aggregates in adult and
aged muscle. Here, we will establish how phosphorylation modulates ULK2 using rescue-of-function experiments
with phospho-blocking and phospho-mimicking ULK2 mutations in ULK2 deficient and aged muscles. Next, we
will use phospho-blocking and phospho-mimicking FIP200 mutations to test whether FIP200 is required for
ULK2-mediated degradation of protein aggregates and sufficient to rescue the degradation of protein aggregates
in aged muscles. This proposal is significant because it delineates a novel ULK2-FIP200 signaling pathway in
muscle that may be targeted to preserve proteostasis, treat sarcopenia and extend healthspan."
11170824,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Age-related diseases are together the leading causes of death in the United States, and drugs targeting basic
mechanisms of aging have recently entered clinical trials. Single cell sequencing has enabled unprecedented
resolution in the study of cell types implicated during aging, contributing to our study of age-related
diseases. Yet, critical deficiencies remain in our experimental and computational toolbox, limiting our ability to
study cellular aging in two fundamental ways: (1) A hallmark of cellular aging is stochastic epigenetic drift,
where cells gradually accumulate errors in their cytosine methylation and histone modification profiles, leading
to cell-type specific aging phenotypes, such as loss of plasticity in stem cell populations. It is unclear how
errors accumulated at the chromatin level propagate to RNA transcription and splicing and how these errors
impact observed aging-related phenomenon, such as cellular senescence. This gap in knowledge is due, in
part, to the lack of formal definitions and actionable models for measuring epigenetic and transcriptomic
dysregulation. (2) The accumulation of senescent cells, i.e. cells that have entered irreversible cell cycle
arrest, in our tissues as we age has been widely appreciated as a driver of aging. Yet, there are few studies of
the relationship between epigenetic and transcriptomic noise and cellular senescence, partly because of the
aforementioned lack of analysis tools, and partly because senescent cells, which are usually present at small
proportions even in aging tissue, are difficult to isolate and characterize. In this project, we will develop
methods to estimate intrinsic noise, as it was classically defined by Elowitz, Levine, Siggia, and Swain (2022),
from single cell sequencing data. Across tissues and cell types, our preliminary studies show that intrinsic
noise measures the accumulation of error at the per-cell and per-gene level. We will develop computational
methods for the measurement of intrinsic biological noise at the levels of chromatin accessibility, gene
expression, and transcript splicing. Synergistically, we will perform experiments on which the new methods will
be applied to investigate the relationship between intrinsic cellular noise and cellular senescence, and address
essential questions in cellular aging, senescence, and anti-aging drug therapy. Our central hypothesis is that
epigenetic, transcriptional, and splicing noise provides both a quantitative profile of cellular aging and a critical
new perspective for understanding gene (dys)regulation, senescence, and tissue aging in a cell type specific
manner. Preliminary results support this hypothesis and suggest that our methods will be of interest to the
broader research community with the potential for wide adoption."
11169442,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Cirrhosis and its complications including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are increasingly common causes of
morbidity and mortality in the United States. The central hypotheses of this application are that (1) the creation
of a prospective cohort study of patients with compensated cirrhosis will facilitate the generation of novel
prediction models based on the clinical, behavioral, metabolic, and biomarker data we collect to predict clinical
decompensation, (2) this cohort can validate and then be supplemented by a larger electronic health record
(EHR)-based virtual cohort, the latter of which will enable validation of electronic cirrhosis phenotypes and
subsequent analysis of real-world data on the safety and effectiveness of individual lipid-lowering agents on
multiple outcomes among patients with cirrhosis and (3) long-term statin therapy will provide clinical benefits in
preventing hepatic decompensation and HCC independent of its lipid lowering effect. To investigate these
hypotheses, we propose unique approaches to both the cohort study and statin-based clinical trial for the Liver
Cirrhosis Network (LCN). In Aim 1a, we will create a prospective cohort of highly phenotyped patients with
compensated NASH, ALD, cholestatic and cryptogenic cirrhosis, in order to facilitate the interrogation of
biospecimens, patient reported behaviors and outcomes, and clinical data for novel predictors of disease
progression, and to understand through serum lipoproteins measurement the complex interaction between
cirrhosis and lipid metabolism. In Aim 1b, we will create a large LCN-wide EHR-based virtual cohort of patients
with compensated cirrhosis, prospectively validate electronic phenotypes for cirrhosis and its clinical
complications with our in-person cohort, and evaluate the use, safety and effectiveness of different classes of
lipid lowering medications upon outcomes in this large real-world virtual cohort. In Aim 2, we propose to study
the safety and efficacy of statins in preventing clinical decompensation among patients with NAFLD or ALD
cirrhosis while exploring the potential pleiotropic mechanisms of statins. In this trial, patients with and without an
established non-hepatic indication for lipid lowering will be randomized to pravastatin v. alirocumab (stratum 1)
or placebo (stratum 2), respectively. This innovative approach to the statin-based clinical trial will acknowledge
the patient's baseline indication for lipid-lowering therapy, and offer an alternative lipid lowering pathway in
PCSK9 inhibition, which has similar or greater LDL-lowering potency but lacks the pleotropic effects of statins,
to allow for novel insights into mechanisms by which statins might impact outcomes independent of its effects
on lipids. Throughout the cohort and interventional trials, we will study lipoprotein metabolism, inflammatory
markers, and collect microbiome and biospecimens for future translational research to better understand the
mechanisms behind disease progression in cirrhosis and for any potential impact of pravastatin and alirocumab
on clinical outcomes. These innovative strategies therefore leverage both cohort and clinical trial designs to
maximize the knowledge gained and improve clinical outcomes among patients with cirrhosis."
11169467,"Chronic liver disease, primarily cirrhosis, remains the 6th leading cause of death in adults younger than 65y in
the United States. Despite advances in diagnostics and therapies, mortality in cirrhosis has not changed
significantly over the last 40y and remains a major significant public health burden. We and others have used
modeling and database evaluations to show that alcohol related liver disease (ALD) and non-alcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) are the 2 major causes of cirrhosis in the United States. Treating the underlying etiology
of cirrhosis may help fibrosis regress but whether cirrhosis is reversible is not yet established. Whether fibrosis
progresses once a diagnosis of cirrhosis is established and if such a progression is related to decompensation
or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are also not known. Of the various complications of cirrhosis, sarcopenia
and physical frailty due to impaired contractile function are frequent, progressive and adversely impact clinical
outcomes. Despite the high clinical significance, there are no prospective studies on development, progression
and predictors of sarcopenia and frailty in cirrhosis. Co-morbidities especially infection with human immune-
deficiency virus (HIV) places patients with cirrhosis at high risk of progression of fibrosis, decompensation, and
sarcopenia/frailty syndrome. The gut microbiome and their metabolites (xenometabolites) play a mechanistic
role in hepatic injury and complications of cirrhosis including HCC and sarcopenia but there are very limited
prospective studies in human patients. Most studies on the progression, long term complications, impact of co-
morbidities and outcomes in cirrhosis are cross-sectional, have small number of subjects, and do not translate
advances in mechanistic understanding of development of cirrhosis or its complications into clinical practice.
Therefore, prospective studies in well characterized cirrhosis are critical to develop effective management
strategies and improve outcomes. There is increasing interest in the use of statins in the management of
cirrhosis due to anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects that may prevent decompensation and HCC. The
Cleveland Clinic Health System is one of the largest clinical programs with a large population of patients with
cirrhosis who are referred for long-term management including liver transplantation, because of our expertise
in innovative approaches to patient care including televisits and applications of digital health incorporated into
integrated electronic medical records. In response to the RFA PAR DK-20-003, we propose to be a part of a
Liver Cirrhosis Network to establish a longitudinal cohort of patients with cirrhosis, primarily alcohol related and
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with co-morbidities including HIV infection. We will develop a database of well
characterized patients and a biorepository from these patients to advance our mechanistic understanding of
progression of cirrhosis, development of complications and identify novel biomarkers and therapies to improve
clinical outcomes. We will also conduct a prospective randomized clinical trial using simvastatin/placebo in well
characterized patients with cirrhosis as part of the network to determine clinical responses and safety."

11170331,"Cancer predominantly affects the elderly, with a significant incidence of breast cancer in women aged 50-70.
While cell mutations contribute to tumorigenesis, age-related changes in the tumor microenvironment,
particularly in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which themselves are diverse subsets with distinct roles,
including inflammatory, vascular, and myofibroblast CAFs (iCAF, vCAF, and myCAF, respectively)2, may play a
crucial role. Importantly, CAF subsets display substantial variability between different tissues and even within the
same tissue3. Our study identifies senescent CAFs (senCAFs) as key players in breast cancer progression. In
exciting new data we find that 1) senCAFs are frequently found in DCIS where they predict recurrence and in
triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), estrogen receptor positive (ER+) BC, and Her2/Neu+ BC. 2) senCAFs are
restricted to the myCAF population, raising the possibility that they are a developmental endpoint and do not
simply appear stochastically in response to tissue level stress. 3) Depletion of senCAFs significantly reduces
primary tumor progression and metastasis. 4) senCAFs modify the biophysical features of the extracellular matrix
(ECM), which can impact host immune responses and tumor progression3. 5) senCAFs modify NK cell killing
activity, which supports tumor growth. Together, these data lead to our hypothesis that senCAFs alter the
biophysical properties of the ECM and immune responses to increase tumor growth and metastasis. To
address this exciting hypothesis, we will use state of the art immunological and biophysical techniques in novel
genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) that we have built and human BC specimens in the following
Aims. 1) Determine the organ specific effects of senCAFs on metastatic BC progression; 2) Determine
how senCAFs impact ECM dynamics and tumor cell migration; and 3) Determine the impact of senCAFs
on NK cell function and BC tumor progression. Our study on senCAFs, a novel component of the breast
cancer microenvironment, may uncover critical mechanisms in breast cancer progression, guiding the
development of immunotherapeutic and senolytic strategies."
11170332,"Abstract: Aging is associated with loss of mobility and infirmity, which accounts for 23% of the total global burden of
disease in people aged 60 years and older and will only increase over the next 20 years. Frailty is associated with dysbiosis
23, 41-43, but it is unclear what microbiota products contribute to health or frailty. We identified indole and its derivatives as
molecules secreted by benevolent commensal bacteria that act across diverse phyla (C. elegans, Drosophila and mice) to
augment healthspan and allow animals to live better for longer1. Indoles derived from commensal bacteria act via the Aryl
hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) to promote healthy intestinal homeostasis20, augment intestinal barrier integrity and limit
systemic inflammation1, 20, 23, as well as promote DNA repair and genome integrity in stem cells and germ cells22.
Preliminary and published data1 also suggest that as animals age, indoles limit the loss of muscle proteins concomitant
with loss of mobility. Citing our work as the starting point1, a recent metabolomic study was initiated using samples from
the Arivale and Osteoporotic Fractures in Men [MrOS] cohorts and found that loss of indole producing bacteria and
reduced plasma indole levels correlated with decreased mobility in aged humans44, 45. We hypothesize that indoles act via
Ahr to (i) promote stability of muscle proteins essential for the contractile apparatus by promoting chaperone-mediated
refolding of damaged proteins, and by regulating proteasome activity to promote loss of irreparable proteins and limit
aggregation of damaged proteins. We have identified other indole-regulated process in muscle that may act in
conjunction with proteostatic mechanisms to promote mobility in the aged. These include regulation of genes associated
with mitochondrial respiratory function and efficiency, which fuels muscle activity but declines with age46, 47. Together, we
hypothesize that these mechanisms maintain muscle mass and function and thereby promote mobility in the aged. Aim 1
will determine the mechanism by which indole limits age-dependent loss of existing assembled myofibrils via upregulating
the levels of the myosin chaperone UNC-45 and additional chaperones and proteasome components. Aim 2 will develop
address whether indole affects additional cellular pathways by using genetic approaches to identify which indole-
regulated genes are critical for maintaining mobility during aging. Gene ontogeny (GO) analysis to date has shown that
indole upregulates genes essential for mitochondrial function in aging animals. Thus, Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that
indole maintains or improves mitochondrial function in aged animals so as to fuel muscle activity and/or limit production
of factors that disrupt proteostasis (e.g. ROS). We use genetic and biochemical analysis in the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans, whose striated muscles exhibit significant structural conservation with mammals. Importantly, as C. elegans age,
they exhibit loss of mobility and changes in proteostasis, including loss of the contractile apparatus and mitochondrial
function, characteristic features of sarcopenia in mammals. Here, we also propose to corroborate our worm results in
aged mice. Together, these studies will provide mechanistic information on how indoles derived from commensal bacteria
counteract sarcopenia during aging. These mechanistic studies are essential to developing indoles as biomarkers for frailty
and health, and as possible therapeutics to treat muscle wasting, including sarcopenia in elderly people."

Resource Center (DAIRC) supports the ongoing efforts of the DAIRC to develop and maintain the
new data release infrastructure and associated workflows for data releases. The infrastructure
which will be launched this grant year, along with the release of the 6.0 ABCD Data, is planned
to be used for all future data releases. These supplemental activities will allow for broader use of
ABCD data, including to better ascertain the use of opioids and fentanyl and their impact on
adolescent development and the developing brain. By following more than 10,000 children as
they go through adolescence, the ABCD Study is well-positioned to explore how their many
experiences including substance initiation and use shape their social, emotional, intellectual, and
physical growth. These additional activities are important because the data sharing
system/solution needs to be optimized for large datasets (including neuroimaging, genomics) and
provide scalable data ingestion, integrated data analytics, and a customized user experience.
A central component of the new data release infrastructure is the reimplementation and extension
of the Data Exploration and Analysis Portal (DEAP version 2.0), which will feature extended
functionality for data download, exploration, statistical analysis, and advanced visualization. The
DAIRC is leading the development of DEAP 2.0 and supporting efforts, including the development
of backend components, databases, storage infrastructure, and computing infrastructure. This
support further funds the DAIRC’s development of more streamlined and standardized internal
data management processes which are essential to prepare the tabulated data, file-based data,
and metadata for releases on an ongoing basis. As part of this, the DAIRC are migrating to a new
database system, and working with contractors to set up and maintain security measures to
uphold NIH security requirements. In order to maximize the utility of this improved infrastructure
the ABCD data is being re-curated and user-resources are being expanded to better support data
users."

11177974,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Gastric cancer (GC) has a high mortality rate in Latinos. This is likely the result of multi-level social determinants
of health and population-specific factors. Our recent cancer registry-based study showed that Latinos have high
rates of poor prognosis diffuse GCs. Compared to intestinal-type tumors, Latinos with diffuse tumors had ~50%
lower 5-year survival. In addition to the histological classification, TCGA described four GC molecular subtypes,
including the genomically stable (GS) subtype, characterized by diffuse histology, low mutation and copy number
alteration rates and a high frequency of “undruggable” CDH1 and RHOA mutations. GS tumors are
chemotherapy-resistant, immunologically “cold,” and have the worst prognosis. Interestingly, we recently showed
that ~50% of all Latino patients have GS tumors, a fraction that is >3-fold higher than in Asians and Whites.
Hence, our studies suggest that Latinos are enriched with poor prognosis GC histological and molecular
subtypes, partly explaining GC disparities. Given the high GS prevalence in Latinos, we obtained paired tumor-
normal reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) data from 15 Latino patients and re-analyzed TCGA
methylation data to carry a preliminary GS epigenome analysis. We found that GS tumors, compared to other
subtypes, are enriched with differentially methylated genes (DMGs) in key pathways such as WNT, TGF-beta
and PI3K/AKT signaling, which may explain their aggressiveness and chemoresistance. Our analyses also
highlighted key limitations of existing publicly available GS epigenome data. For example, TCGA lacked Latino
samples and profiled primarily tumor-only samples using sub-optimal methods as we found that RRBS identified
many methylated regions that were missing in TGCA methylation arrays and which appeared to be GS-tumor,
and possibly Latino-specific. Our preliminary studies therefore highlighted several research gaps that will be
addressed in the present application. The objectives of the present application are to advance our
understanding of GS tumor biology using epigenomic and functional genomic approaches. To this end, we will
leverage our expertise in cancer biology, health disparities, patient-derived modeling, preclinical studies, and
genome engineering. Our hypothesis is that Latino GS tumorigenesis follows unique biological pathways, some
which may be amenable to therapeutic development. In Aim 1, we will characterize the epigenome of 100 Latino
GS tumors using RRBS. Aim 2 will investigate GS tumorigenesis using ethnic-appropriate Latino gastric
organoids and isogenic modeling for CDH1 and RHOA. In Aim 3, we will perform a loss of function screen that
will be used to identify synthetically lethal associations in CDH1- and RHOA-mutant GS cell lines, some of that
maybe amenable to molecularly guided therapies. Our study will significantly advance our understanding of GS
tumors' biology and therapeutic vulnerabilities. As GS tumors are likely drivers of higher mortality rates in Latinos,
our study will also significantly advance cancer health equity in the country."

The Stanford U54 SARS-CoV-2 Serological Sciences Center of Excellence (SUSS-COE) has remained true to
its original goals as a member of the SeroNet consortium organized to address the urgent need for better
understanding of human immune responses to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in the Covid-19 pandemic. We
have incorporated new facts into our research plans as they arose during the pandemic, including the availability
of mRNA vaccines, the development of long Covid by a subset of infected individuals, and rare reactions towards
vaccines. The preponderance of our work has been toward understanding the adaptive immune responses to
SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in the context of infection or vaccination, with emphasis on responses occurring in
non-blood tissue sites, and analyses of diverse populations. In the proposed Supplement funding for this award,
we will carry out further investigations into SARS-CoV-2-specific responses in pregnancy; multi-antigen variant
B cell sorting and single-cell transcriptome and B cell receptor sequencing experiments to deeply characterize
the evolution of B cell memory through the pandemic; structural studies of protective antibodies bound to their
antigens; extensive analysis of class I epitope presentation of SARS-CoV-2 across human HLA alleles; and in-
depth T cell and B cell lineage analysis in patients with long Covid. The combined impact of these studies will
be to extend understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms affecting immune responses to the
continuing evolving SARS-CoV-2 viral populations in individuals with different prior exposure histories, and in
some populations such as pregnant individuals or long Covid patients who have altered immunity."

The purpose of this K supplement is to request support following the impending critical life event of childbirth.
I was awarded an NIAAA K08 in February 2022, had my first child in June 2022, and then gave birth to my
second child in March 2024. The K08 aims are to 1) identify risk and protective factors in the ACEs-alcohol use
link, 2) evaluate the role of HPA axis functioning (hair cortisol) in the ACEs-alcohol misuse link and identify
relevant protective factors and 3) explore epigenetic mechanisms (saliva DNA methylation) linking ACEs and
HPA axis functioning. Despite becoming a first-time mother shortly after I was awarded a K08 grant, I
maintained a high level of productivity, which included completing all biological and survey data collection in the
first year. NIAAA’s administrative supplement following the birth of my first child allowed me to maintain a very
high level of productivity at a more sustainable pace, given that I was able to fund a full-time clinical research
coordinator and part-time biostatistician for support. It is worth noting that with the full-time clinical research
coordinator’s help, I was able to revise and resubmit a first-author manuscript and submit two additional first-
author manuscripts during my maternity leave while simultaneously caring for myself and my infant. Therefore,
the purpose of this K08 supplement application is to request funding to support my full-time clinical research
coordinator and fund a part-time biostatistician. The clinical research coordinator and biostatistician will support
me in my next career phase: submitting my first R34 and R01 grants, and transitioning to research
independence."

Individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) are susceptible to repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, which can result
in impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH). As a consequence, IAH contributes to diminished recognition of
the need for external glucose and the blunting of counter-regulatory responses that are required to increase
blood glucose. This can be a very risky situation for T1D individuals with IAH, possibly leading to coma and in
some circumstances, death. This can be a very risky situation for T1D individuals with IAH, possibly leading to
coma and in some circumstances, death. Many T1D studies exclude IAH individuals because of confounding
issues. Therefore, the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDKK) has issued
two RFAs to form the IAH Consortium that will investigate factors which contribute to the heterogeneity of
restoration of awareness of hypoglycemia in adult T1D individuals with IAH. RFA-DK-21-020 and RFA-DK-21-
036 request applications for Clinical Centers and the sole Biostatistics Research Center (BRC), respectively.
The objectives of the IAH Consortium will be to
 • determine if the most up-to-date management strategies using diabetes technology to optimize HbA1c
 while minimizing hypoglycemia can restore awareness of hypoglycemia and improve counter-regulatory
 responses in individuals with T1D and IAH
 • identify the magnitude and duration of time in range, time spent in hypoglycemia or other metrics for
 continuous glucose monitors that are associated with restoration of awareness of hypoglycemia
 • determine the association of current or newly developed self-reported measures of IAH with counter-
 regulatory responses to elucidate the heterogeneity in restoration of hypoglycemia awareness
The Department of Public Health Sciences at The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine proposes
to serve as the BRC for the IAH Consortium, and will pursue seven specific aims.
 Specific Aim 1: Collaborate on the development and conduct of studies, and lead statistical analyses
Specific Aim 2: Lead the Consortium in developing measures of self-reported IAH
Specific Aim 3: House a Central Laboratory
Specific Aim 4: Lead the Consortium in stakeholder engagement
Specific Aim 5: Develop data management and website processes
Specific Aim 6: Maintain regulatory compliance
Specific Aim 7: Provide communication and project management support"
11170808,"Obesity, a major risk factor for multiple diseases including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, has reached pandemic level and is still increasing alarmingly in the US and worldwide. Despite the recent breakthrough with GLP-1 based anti-obesity drugs, the causes of obesity remain unknown. To develop effective preventive interventions, the causal factors and physiological mechanisms of obesity need to be better understood. One known determinant is diet composition, but how it determines body weight remains unclear. Our rationale is that to ultimately understand the problem we first need to better understand how diet composition affects metabolic processes in energy metabolism, including those in energy expenditure and energy excretion where our preliminary data revealed major knowledge gaps. Determining how metabolic processes function requires quantifying metabolic fluxes, the rate at which nutrients and metabolites are produced or consumed. This in turn requires a complex interdisciplinary approach and, as a result, has only been done for limited number of cases. The long-term goal of this research team is to determine the physiological mechanisms of body-weight dependence on diet composition. Toward this goal, this proposal will leverage their fluxomics expertise to determine the effects of dietary fat and carbohydrate content on fundamental processes of energy metabolism. Their in vivo flux quantification approach integrates isotope tracer infusion into animals, mass spectrometry and stable isotope gas measurements, and mathematical modeling. They will quantify the fluxes of metabolic processes that lie within two main areas of energy metabolism that have been shown to be dependent on dietary fat and carbohydrate composition: energy expenditure and energy excretion. Addressing these areas, the specific aims of the project are 1) to determine the dietary dependence of tissue fuel selection, 2) to determine the dietary dependence of systemic metabolic cycling, and 3) to determine the dietary dependence of fecal nutrient content. The proposed study is innovative because it will generate previously unavailable metabolic flux information on the effects of dietary fat and carbohydrate composition on important energy metabolic processes. The proposed research is significant because it will reveal the specific metabolic processes that underly the changes in energy metabolism on different diets. The results will move us forward to understanding the physiological mechanisms of how diet composition affects body weight, and ultimately contribute to the development of effective and sustained therapeutical and preventive strategies for obesity."

Childhood cancers, although rare, significantly impact thousands of children globally each year. The complexity and
variability of these cancers necessitate extensive research to understand their underlying mechanisms. Given the small
number of cases and the diverse genetic and clinical profiles, collaboration across multiple institutions is crucial. The Beat
Childhood Cancer (BCC) Research Consortium is a national collaborative group consisting of over 50 institutions and
hospitals devoted to research and clinical trials in neuroblastoma, CNS tumors, sarcomas, and other rare solid tumors.
Close to 1,000 tumors have been investigated for their genomic and transcriptomic profiles, clinical and imaging data,
leading to the establishment of several clinical trials, including the recent FDA approval of DFMO for high-risk
neuroblastoma. The BCC cohort is well-positioned to collaborate with other pediatric cancer research consortia and
institutes to further the goal of eradicating childhood cancer. Federated learning (FL) offers a novel approach to facilitate
such collaborations, allowing researchers to pool data and insights without compromising patient privacy and security. By
enabling the analysis of distributed datasets, FL generates robust models and uncovers critical insights, leading to
improved diagnostics and therapies for childhood cancers. In this P30 supplement project, we will focus on establishing
an FL framework for neuroblastoma and pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Neuroblastoma is a highly
heterogeneous cancer arising from multiple organ sites and primarily affecting young children. Despite advancements in
understanding its genomic landscape, the prognosis for high-risk patients remains unfavorable. Pediatric CNS tumors are
a diverse group of malignancies that occur in the brain and spinal cord, representing the second most common type of
cancer in children. The brain's intricate structure and vital functions make these tumors particularly challenging to treat.
The location of the tumor within the brain can greatly influence symptoms and treatment options, impacting critical areas
responsible for movement, sensation, cognition, and other essential functions. Pediatric brain tumors encompass a wide
range of subtypes, each with distinct biological behaviors and prognoses. Our central hypothesis is that a FL framework
can enhance the integration and analysis of diverse pediatric cancer datasets, leading to the identification of multimodal
survival predictors and therapeutic targets. We will test this hypothesis through three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: To
finalize the implementation of a FL pipeline to securely centralize and analyze diverse datasets from multiple institutions.
Specific Aim 2: To elucidate factors that influence survival in pediatric neuroblastoma using machine learning (ML) and
FL. Specific Aim 3: To elucidate factors that influence survival in pediatric CNS tumors, including gliomas and
medulloblastomas, using ML and FL. This study introduces a novel FL framework for pediatric cancer research, enabling
secure, collaborative analysis of diverse datasets. This research promises to advance our understanding of pediatric
cancers, improve patient outcomes, and pave the way for AI-driven decision-making applications in healthcare."
11170829,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Bladder conditions such as incontinence and urinary tract infections (UTI) are increasingly common with aging
and driven by poorly understood changes that occur at the cellular and molecular levels. The objective of this
project is to define the molecular pathways that underpin how aging makes the bladder epithelium (urothelium)
prone to UTIs and develop new therapeutics to target those pathways. Data indicate that IFRD1 plays a key role
in ribosomal quality control, translation, ER trafficking, and ER stress; and loss of IFRD1 produces aging
phenotypes. The central hypothesis is that aging disrupts the cellular function of proteostasis, particularly
ribosome dynamics during protein translation, modification, and trafficking between the ER and Golgi. Aim 1 will
determine the role of ribosomal and translational quality control machinery in the maintenance of bladder
homeostasis in young, aged, or Ifrd1−/− urothelium of mice. Cycloheximide treatment will be used to inhibit
translation in young mice, and translation efficiency will be quantified with a puromycinylation assay to test if
treatment is sufficient to induce phenotypes of aging or Ifrd1−/− bladders. UTI will be induced using uropathogenic
E. coli., and bladder tissue will be collected to assess molecular-cellular and inflammatory responses using
histological analysis, western blots, and qRT-PCR to measure expression of ribosome-associated quality control
markers and IFRD1 expression. To determine urothelial-intrinsic role, we will use a newly generated state of the
art 3D- murine urothelial organoid system, with the potential to extend investigations to a human urothelial
organoid system. Aim 2 will determine whether chronic ER stress is sufficient for promoting aging phenotypes,
and if alleviating ER stress will ameliorate the phenotypes. In aged, young, and Ifrd1−/− mice bladders and
organoids, the expression of ER stress proteins and uroplakins will be compared. Western blots, qRT-PCR, and
immunostaining will be used to determine if uroplakin trafficking is altered in aged bladders, as in the Ifrd1−/−
phenotype. Inflammation, DNA damage, lysosomes, mitochondria, urothelial cell shedding, and expression of
ER stress response proteins will be assessed in response to the ER-stressor tunicamycin and ER stress
alleviator TUDCA to determine if this stress drives aging in the urothelium using organoid models. Aim 3 will
determine the effects of pharmacological interventions on aging bladder and identify novel proteins governing
bladder aging. Understanding the effects and mechanism of action in these drugs will establish a foundation on
which translational research can work to develop novel interventions for the treatment of urinary tract conditions
that are known to progress with age."

The overall goal of this proposal is to understand how organisms as diverse as humans and the fruit flies use
the same molecules to decide when and where cells will divide, especially when they are needed to repair
damaged tissues. The specific focus of this application is a protein that is highly conserved from insects to
humans, and appears to act specifically in the adult gut to support stem cell renewal of this tissue over the
organism's lifespan. Despite its apparent importance to gut homeostasis, the protein has not been the subject
of sustained study. Our preliminary data indicate that acts as a signaling hub that receives inputs from
phospholipids and in turn delivers regulatory outputs onto two highly conserved pathways broadly involved in
human health and disease. We are very excited to leverage the strength of our data to understand how
this protein coordinates these various roles within intestinal stems cells in Drosophila. Our own cells have
a version of this protein, so we believe that our work will shed light on mechanisms that support our stem cells
too."

Heparanase, an endo-β-D-glucuronidase, is the only known enzyme to cleave the heparan sulfate (HS) side chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are key components in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of all tissue types. In the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), these HSPGs play a crucial role in the glomerular filtration barrier. Alterations in HS has been associated with glomerular barrier dysfunction in nephropathy. Under diabetic milieu, the release of heparanase is significantly increased, and heparanase has been identified as a key contributor in the development of diabetic nephropathy, which is marked by a decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and the presence of albuminuria. Prior investigations using existing HS-based heparanase inhibitors have shown promising therapeutic effects, such as restored glomerular filtration barrier and reduced albuminuria, in animal models or patients with diabetic nephropathy, suggesting an emerging therapeutic option for the disease. However, HS-based structures are heterogenous, suffering from batch-to-batch variation, and the existence of other HS binding proteins has led to undesired off-target effects, limiting their therapeutic application. We therefore hypothesize that heparanase inhibitors with defined chemical structures, high selectivity, and drug-like features can yield successful outcomes for the prevention and treatment of diabetic nephropathy. Currently, no orally available heparanase inhibitor has been developed. In this project, we will develop innovative artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods, aiming to support the development of potent orally available small-molecule heparanase inhibitors, which will be evaluate in murine models in the next phase."

This program is an extension of our successful HIV basic science training program with the HIV Cure Research
Infrastructure Studies (H-CRIS) based at the University of Ghana - an ongoing collaboration between
Washington University in St. Louis (WU) and the University of Ghana (UG). Finding a permanent cure for people
living with HIV, a key priority for the NIH, requires rigorous and inclusive basic science research. The main
obstacle to an HIV cure is the persistence of transcriptionally silent and immunologically unrecognizable
proviruses in quiescent memory CD4+ T cell reservoirs in people who are on ART. Although over 70% of HIV
patients live in Africa, very little of the basic science of cure research involves African patients or scientists. This
is a clear deficiency in the cure research efforts that needs immediate remedy. Most HIV basic science research
on cure has been conducted in the USA and Europe in Caucasian men and on one viral subtype (HIV subtype
B). However, HIV in Africa predominantly affects women, who are thus excluded from cure research. In addition,
African women living with HIV have co-infections like tuberculosis, hepatitis, and human papillomavirus, which
can all determine CD4+ T cell responses.
Since 2018, a partnership between WU and UG has set up the HIV Cure Research Infrastructure Studies (H-
CRIS) at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, UG. H-CRIS is training graduate students and
postdoctoral fellows in HIV basic science and cure research with outstanding success; many trainees have
obtained independent grant funding. The parent grant to this supplement will enroll 3 PhDs (4-year program), 4
MPhil (2-year master's with a laboratory research thesis), and provide a two-year intensive basic laboratory
research training and mentorship for four postdoctoral fellows (11 trainees in all). This supplement will train an
additional postdoctoral fellow and a master's student whose basic research into HIV will specifically focus on
questions relevant to women living with HIV in Ghana. Our specific aims are:
1. To build capacity and experience at the University of Ghana for basic science researchers to design and
conduct HIV cure-related research in Ghana.
2. To equip trainees with research skills through 2-year intensive and mentored postdoctoral research projects
focused on HIV basic science and cure.
3. To establish and maintain a mentorship plan for trainees at UG who aspire to become independently funded
investigators in the basic science of HIV research."

11159988,"Cancer-associated cachexia and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represent two significant
challenges in oncology. Cachexia, a severe syndrome characterized by weight loss and muscle atrophy,
dramatically worsens patient outcomes across various cancers. Early detection of cachexia is essential for
improving quality of life and survival rates. Concurrently, PDAC is one of the deadliest forms of cancer, often
arising from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are pancreatic cysts with malignant
potential. Accurate risk stratification of IPMNs is crucial for early intervention. Both conditions necessitate
advanced predictive models that leverage diverse data sources while ensuring patient privacy.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop and validate privacy-preserving multimodal machine/deep
learning (ML/DL) models for the early detection of cachexia across multiple cancer types and risk stratification
of PDAC from IPMNs using clinical, imaging, genetic mutational, and social determinants of health (SDOH) data.
To access large-scale representative data while respecting the privacy and the security of sensitive patient data,
this proposal leverages Federated Learning (FL). This advanced ML paradigm enables the development of
robust predictive models across multiple institutions without centralizing data. FL allows each participating
institution to train models locally on their own datasets, sharing only model parameters (e.g., weights and
gradients) with a central server. This approach maintains data confidentiality and complies with privacy
regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR. By aggregating model updates from multiple sites, FL enhances the
diversity and generalizability of the models, reducing biases and improving performance across different
populations.
 Aim 1: Develop a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) model for the early detection of cachexia in cancer
patients using clinical data, imaging biomarkers from abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans, and SDOH
for pancreatic, colorectal, gastrointestinal, and ovarian cancers.
 Aim 2: Develop a multimodal predictive model for risk stratification of IPMNs to identify those most likely to
progress to invasive pancreatic malignancy using imaging, clinical, patient-specific risk factors, SDOH,
histopathology, and genetic mutational data.
 The federated model’s performance will be benchmarked between sites and the centralized model using F1
score, AUROC, and accuracy metrics. The successful completion of these aims will enhance the early detection
of cachexia and risk stratification for PDAC, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. We are fully prepared
to comply with all the administrative requirements outlined in the FOA. Our team has deployed NVIDIA-FLARE
and OpenFL with PyTorch and NumPy on Moffitt’s AI cluster and is conducting FL studies. Our NVIDIA-FLARE

In the first year after birth, human sensitivity develops markedly to the fundamental features on which all higher-
level vision depends: contrast, spatial scale, edge orientations, chromatic content. It is well known that this
development is highly dependent on visual experience because disruptions in experience have significant and,
in some cases, permanent consequences for vision from sensation to cognition. The field does not have,
however, an empirical characterization of the low-level feature statistics of typical infant visual experience. This
gap is critical because emerging studies of higher-level content indicate these statistical properties change with
development and are dependent on the infant’s own changing internal visual biases and behaviors (eye
movements, head movements, other body movements). These factors play a direct role in selecting and
organizing the spatial structure of images projected to the eye. This project will collect and analyze the first-
person visual experiences of 200 infants (50 each) at 2-3, 5-6, 8-9, and 11-12 months of age, plus a sample of
20 infants tested at all of those ages. The core hypothesis is that the statistics change systematically in a
developmentally consistent sequence in the everyday lives of infants. The experiences are collected by infant
head cameras worn for hours in the home and precision measures of eye and head movements in the laboratory.
Analyses will quantify the spatial organization of fundamental low-level features in the collected images as a
function of age, posture, activity, and specific contents. The project will also characterize the influence of
refractive error and front-end visual immaturities on the images. The research will determine how infants’
behaviors influence the spatial organization of visual features in the input by analyzing the motion patterns in the
at-home head-camera images and through direct measures of eye and head motion patterns in the laboratory.
The research will provide the first characterization of the natural visual statistics of infant experience in the first
year after birth and is expected to reveal specific developmental risk-points in those expected visual statistics."

The over-arching aims of this research are to: (1) develop a novel primary care screening tool to identify elder
neglect in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) and a point-of-care
technology-driven intervention for caregivers [R61], and (2) conduct a NIH Model Stage III 3-arm randomized
clinical trial to determine the impact of both screening itself and screening combined with the intervention
compared to usual care [R33]. We are focusing exclusively on developing screening for neglect rather than all
types of mistreatment given that neglect is very common in AD/ADRD patients, neglect is associated with the
highest mortality and morbidity of all mistreatment types, and specific targets exist for interventions. Combining
all types of mistreatment, the approach taken to date in screening tool design, has important disadvantages. It
makes screening time-consuming and challenging. Additionally, different mistreatment types are very different
phenomena, occur in different groups of older adults under different circumstances, have different impacts on
health, and likely require different intervention strategies. Further, our research team has developed and
studied a successful, evidence-based technology intervention for AD/ADRD caregivers. We believe that an
adaptation of this intervention for caregiver neglect, which focuses on education and skill building and access
to resources, may be highly impactful in reducing and preventing neglect. The Specific Aims of the R61 phase
are: (Aim 1a) develop a novel, easy-to-use, brief screening tool to identify elder neglect in primary care and
describe the tool’s test characteristics (KQ3), (Aim 1b) develop an innovative intervention for elder neglect by
modifying a highly successful evidence-based technology-driven caregiving intervention, and (Aim 2) pilot-test
the screening tool and intervention in primary care (NIH Model Stage 1b) to assess feasibility and acceptability.
In the R33 phase, we will conduct a 3-arm randomized controlled trial (NIH Model Stage III) to compare: (1)
screening + intervention, (2) screening only, and (3) usual care without screening. The Specific Aims of the
R33 phase are: (Aim 3) evaluate the impact of screening for elder neglect on reduction in neglect exposure
(KQ1) and other patient and caregiver-important outcomes by comparing to usual care and (Aim 4) evaluate
the impact of screening tool paired with a technology-based caregiver intervention on reduction in exposure to
neglect (KQ5) and other patient and caregiver-important outcomes by comparison to usual care and screening
without intervention. Neglect screening in primary care with a novel screening tool will have a positive impact
on outcomes including decrease in presence of neglect at 6 months and other patient and caregiver-important
outcomes (e.g., neglect severity, neglectful ideation; caregiver burden) and that screening paired with a
technology-based caregiving intervention will have a greater positive impact than screening alone. Our long-
term goal is to develop a screening tool for neglect in AD/ADRD patients that may be integrated into primary
care and paired with a scalable intervention with sufficient evidence to justify USPSTF endorsement."
11159998,"The overall mission of this research program is to determine how the antioxidant enzyme, extracellular
superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD or SOD3) regulates redox-sensitive signaling pathways responsible for
inflammation and fibrosis in pulmonary vascular diseases across the age span, and harness this knowledge to
design new and precise therapies. The different research projects are based on three complementary themes.
Theme 1 interrogates the regulation of SOD3 expression, activity and distribution in the healthy and diseased
pulmonary circulation in the mature and immature lung. These studies would include in vitro, and in vivo
studies using animal models, as well as activity translating the work through new human studies. They will
address the multiple levels of SOD3 regulation, including genetic polymorphisms, epigenetic regulation, or
other post-translation SOD3 modifications, that can influence gene expression, enzyme activity, half-life and
localization. Theme 2 evaluates how changes in SOD3 activity or binding properties impact redox sensitive
signaling pathways that are responsible for the development of pulmonary vascular disease, in particular,
inflammation and subsequent vascular remodeling and fibrosis. These experiments utilize a unique series of
SOD3 mouse strains, including a mouse with knock-in of a known human SOD3 polymorphism, to interrogate
how individual changes in SOD3 location or content can influence disease pathogenesis and severity. Based
on the unique extracellular localization of SOD3, studies will test the effects of insufficient SOD3 on matrix
integrity, matrix-cell interactions, cell-cell interactions and communication between extracellular signals and
intracellular cellular responses. Ongoing studies are testing how the loss of vascular SOD3 increases the
susceptibility of two key redox-sensitive targets localized to the extracellular matrix (ECM): activation of latent
TGF-β, which enhances PASMC and fibroblast growth, inflammation and synthetic function, or oxidative
fragmentation of hyaluronan, which binds to macrophage CD44 receptors and activates the NLRP3
inflammasome. Future planned studies will test how altered SOD3 impacts the redox landscape to modulate
innate immunity, cellular metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction responsible for vascular fibrosis in PH.
Theme 3 translates the findings into new therapeutic strategies to replenish deficient SOD3 to restore redox
homeostasis. This framework is supported by a new initiative, funded by a Dean's Strategic Infrastructure
Research Committee Award for the purchase of an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer, to develop
a collaborative and interdisciplinary UCD Redox Biology Shared Resource Facility to advance the study of
Redox Biology. These studies collectively will provide new insight relevant to the mission of the Precision
Medicine Initiative, as they will uncover how individual variables that influence SOD3 impact the development
of inflammation and fibrosis in pulmonary hypertension."

In congruence with the mission of the NIMHD funded RCMI program, the Morehouse School of
Medicine (MSM) has continued to address health equity. In alignment with the MSM Strategic
Plan, the Administrative Core (Admin. Core) will develop and strengthen the research
infrastructure necessary to achieve this goal. The Admin. Core will continue to provide
coordination and logistical support for four Cores [Research Infrastructure Core (RIC),
Investigator Development Core (IDC), Community Engagement Core (CEC) and a Recruitment
Core], plus 3 research projects. It will also continue to support health equity related research,
intellectual activities (e.g., lectures and seminars), workshops and research retreats, while
continually broadening our community partnerships across Georgia through the initial fostering
of multidisciplinary translational teams (MDTT). This describes addressing all sides of health
disparities in a team-based structure ultimately leading to health equity. We will leverage the
U54 resources at hand, other MSM resources into rural communities to expand our program
impact into the rural communities using our MDTT concept of coordinated basic, clinical, and
community research. And we will develop structures so that other researchers can access this
platform bringing to bear all aspects of MSM’s capability on those communities. Thus, in this
cycle the U54 Admin. Core will be redesigned to provide oversight, coordination, support, and
logistics for the various cores to expand the CTRHD ability to emphasize cutting edge
translational research through MDTT’s in both our current urban communities as well as
expanding our reach into rural communities. This will be accomplished through further linking
MSM’s basic, clinical, and community researchers and research, and enhancing our ability to
build the next generation of health disparities researchers. The CTRHD will achieve the above
through the following aims and specific objectives: SA1: Support administrative and logistical
support to all CTRHD cores, projects, and oversight for all CTRHD activities and partnerships;
SA2: Supervise and evaluate the impact of the CTRHD and its cores for enhancing MSM’s
mission of health equity research; increasing productivity of investigators; and MSM’s overall
success in obtaining extramural research funding. SA3: Coordinate with the RCMI Coordinating
Center with other RCMI institutions, NIH/NIMHD and other NIH funded centers and programs
across Georgia (i.e., GaCTSA)."

Polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) was introduced more than 20
years ago but has only recently reached the level of technological maturity needed to support
biomedical translation. Today, PS-OCT is one of the most exciting methods in OCT and
promises to open a new set of doors in applications from intravascular cardiology to nerve-
sparing in surgery. However, specialized phantoms are needed to support the development of
PS-OCT but are not broadly available. Our P41 Center has developed PS-OCT phantoms that
we have used to support our internal PS-OCT development, but which require careful and
unpredictable fabrication methods. Here, we propose modifications and optimizations to the
phantom design to allow these PS-OCT phantoms to be easily made by any group using
broadly available materials. By developing and sharing these phantoms through the NIST/NIBIB
Imaging Phantom Library, this work can act to accelerate PS-OCT development and translation
and to enhance the robustness and interpretability of PS-OCT imaging study results."

The UJMT Fogarty LAUNCH Program has an established track record in global health research, supporting over
270 US and international trainees to date. While the program has sought to recruit individuals from diverse
backgrounds, to date the applicant pool has been limited and poorly defined. Traditional metrics such as race
and ethnicity alone have been inadequate and fail to capture the richness and potential of diverse perspectives
in global health. The Fogarty Pathway Program at the Morehouse School of Medicine has been designed to
address this gap. Built upon past programmatic experiences and formative research, this newly proposed
initiative seeks to orient and train 10 doctoral students (medical or PhD) through didactic and experiential
learning. The program focuses on global hemoglobinopathies research, a scientific priority for NIH and an area
of ongoing work for participating US and international faculty. The format is a four-week course abroad, where
US students are taught and supervised in a fostering, mentored environment. Opportunities will be available
through separate trips to Accra, Ghana and Kingston, Jamaica. Although the core curriculum will be similar, each
builds upon existing relationships and ongoing projects at NIH-approved institutional partners. Recruitment will
focus on individuals who are interested in global health but lack the formative experiences needed to spark
further career growth. It will emphasize diverse backgrounds, which will be broadly defined in a manner that is
nuanced, inclusive, and fully aligned with the program announcement. In this pilot phase, the Fogarty Pathway
Program will be rigorously evaluated for content, delivery, and participant outcomes. This initiative will enrich the
pool of diverse applicants to the UJMT Fogarty LAUNCH Program in ways that remain distinct yet complementary
from the parent award. With a demonstration of feasibility and early impact, this initial investment will lead to
sustainable institutional and/or funder support of this important global health pathway."

11145996,"PROJECT SUMMARY.
Down syndrome (DS), the genetic condition caused by trisomy 21 (T21), is a leading cause of intellectual and
developmental disability, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 700 live births. Individuals with DS display
increased risk of numerous co-occurring neurological conditions including autism, seizure disorders, and
Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Recently, an increasing number of reports have documented individuals with DS
displaying a condition known as Down Syndrome Regression Disorder (DSRD), which include symptoms such
as catatonia, mutism, depersonalization, loss of ability to perform activities of daily living, hallucinations,
delusions, and aggression. The etiology of DSRD is unclear, with affected individuals being subjected to highly
heterogenous diagnostic work ups and disparate therapeutic interventions, including psychiatric medications
(e.g., Lorazepam), electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Therefore,
additional research into the etiology of DSRD and the relative efficacy of different therapies is clearly needed.
We propose here a comprehensive clinical research program that will not only advance our understanding of
DSRD etiology, but which would also provide important information about the relative safety and efficacy of three
different therapeutic approaches. Importantly, we hypothesize that many DSRD cases are driven by immune
dysregulation affecting the central nervous system (CNS) and that these cases will benefit from immune-
based therapies. Therefore, we propose to complete a comparative mechanistic investigation of three potential
DSRD therapies: the benzodiazepine Lorazepam, IVIG, and the JAK inhibitor Tofacitinib. Our Specific Aims are:
1. To define the relative safety profile of Lorazepam, IVIG, and Tofacitinib in DSRD. We will complete a
randomized, open-label, Phase II clinical trial for Lorazepam, IVIG, and Tofacitinib in individuals with DSRD with
the primary endpoint being safety.
2. To compare the efficacy of Lorazepam, IVIG, and Tofacitinib in DSRD. Using key metrics for the evaluation
of individuals with DSRD, a suite of secondary and tertiary endpoints will assess improvements in overall
neurological health, activities of daily living, and quality of life, as well as domain-specific improvements in
catatonia, movement and motor function, speech, sleep, and cognition.
3. To investigate potential mechanisms underlying DSRD and its response to therapies. Using
biospecimens from individuals affected by DSRD collected during the trial and control samples from a companion
active cohort study of individuals with DS, we will define biosignatures associated with DSRD diagnosis and the
impact of each treatment modality on these biosignatures.
Results from this phase II trial will generate much needed insights into DSRD etiology and treatment, paving the
road for future larger trials to fulfill an unmet need in the DS community."

Progression of SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infected patients to life threatening disease may result from
a virus-mediated, dysregulated immune response associated with excessive production of inflammatory
cytokines, cytokine release syndrome. In this proposal we seek to identify therapeutics and knowledge of
Coronaviruses that will counteract the disruption in cytokine signaling pathways involved in effective host
defense.
 We contribute to the urgent need for therapeutics that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection using pathway
specific reporter cells to screen for therapeutically active compounds that restore cytokine signaling. Our pathway
specific screens are a component in SBP-wide initiative to develop therapeutics that limit severe COVID-19. Our
screening strategy selects drugs identified in libraries of pharmacologically active therapeutics that block SARS-
CoV-2 lytic replication. We use cytokine pathway reporters to test these compounds in SARS-CoV-2 infection of
a lung cell line and human lung organoids in BSL3 facilities. The selected candidates will undergo analysis for
potential drug development.
 Fundamental knowledge of cytokine-regulated defense mechanisms related to Coronavirus infection
limits the rational design of therapeutics and vaccines. To advance this knowledge we focus on the Lymphotoxin-
β Receptor (LTβR) and the Herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM, TNFRSF14) pathways known to regulate anti-
viral cytokines, interferons (IFN) and interleukin-1(IL1β). Together, the LTβR and HVEM pathways act as an
integrated, homeostatic network that inhibits virus replication yet limits tissue damaging cytokines. Two SARS-
CoV-2 proteins, the Papain-like protease (PLPro, Nsp3) and Nsp9 target novel components in the TRAF3
interactome that control the NFκB transcriptome. We will determine the role of these components in the key
cytokine pathways using genetic and pharmacologic approaches in a mouse coronavirus lung infection model.
Together these two independent but complementary aims will provide an opportunity to help solve the SARS-
CoV-2 pandemic, and protect future generations."

Our long-term goal is to identify the factors that contribute to effective mentorship networks for researchers from
underrepresented (UR) groups. Effective mentorship is critical for the retention of early career researchers in
academia. However, researchers from UR groups are less likely to have effective mentorship, which contributes
to disparities in grant funding and faculty representation. Current trends suggest that dyadic mentorship, which
is the most common form of mentorship, may not be the most effective form of mentorship, especially for
underrepresented groups, since it relies on one person to provide many aspects of academic and psychosocial
support. We hypothesize that mentorship networks, which involve multiple mentors with various roles, is a more
effective model than mentorship dyads for the retention and success of underrepresented researchers in
academia. How mentorship networks affect research success and what characteristics of a mentorship network
are important for early career UR researchers are not well-understood. We have developed a new tool called
Mentorship Network Analysis that assesses and maps the mentoring network of individuals. We will validate this
tool and retrospectively characterize successful mentoring networks of UR career development (K) grant
recipients. Then, we will test the feasibility of an intervention that helps UR researchers build effective mentoring
networks. Primary outcomes include mentor network robustness (i.e. the network is meeting the needs of the
trainee), career outcomes and intentions, and research success as measured by grants and publications.
Secondary outcomes include psychosocial predictors for research success (e.g. research self-efficacy) and
intervention acceptability and fidelity. After five years, we will better understand how the mentorship networks of
successful UR postdoctoral researchers form and change over time, their impact on career outcomes, and
patterns of UR mentorship networks critical for success. The findings will fill a critical need to understand how
best to mentor underrepresented trainees, informing investments in training grants and career development
programs that will close the mentoring gap in research training."
10738743,"Quorum sensing is a bacterial communication process that relies on the production, detection, and group-
 wide response to extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. Quorum sensing enables groups of
 bacteria to synchronously alter behavior in response to changes in population density and species
 composition of the vicinal community.
In Aim 1, an investigation of phage-bacteria-eukaryote quorum-sensing-mediated interactions will
be undertaken. The proposed research seeks to explore newly-discovered inter-kingdom quorum-
sensing-mediated communication pathways that shape host-microbe-phage interactions. Mutagenesis,
bioassays, small molecule purification, and crystallography will be used to define the mechanisms by
which phages, in response to host quorum-sensing information, launch their lytic programs. The native
cue that is released from lysed bacterial cells that appears to be the key input that activates the
phage quorum-sensing ""eavesdropping"" program will be purified. More complex mechanisms that underlie
phage infections of the human microbiome, how affected bacteria avoid phage infection, how phage infection
of microbiome bacteria affects health-promoting and harmful gut microbes will be investigated. The team
will use what is learned to guide the development of phage therapies to combat human diseases.
In Aim 2, the team will image the bacterial biofilm dispersal process and discover the key components.
Quorum sensing controls the development of surface-associated communities called biofilms, a predominant
form of bacterial life on Earth. Biofilms are notorious for causing infections and damage to surfaces.
Unlike biofilm formation, almost nothing is known about the second half of the biofilm lifestyle, biofilm
dispersal. The team will develop a new imaging system with light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM)
that will enable imaging of the biofilm dispersal process. By imaging, at single-cell resolution, bacteria
exiting biofilms the team will discover when dispersal occurs, if cells leave individually or collectively, and
whether or not the process is globally synchronized. Using fluorescent reporters to quorum-sensing-
controlled genes, quorum-sensing activity during dispersal will be monitored. The unique and combined
contributions of the different autoinducers in driving/suppressing biofilm dispersal will be studied. This
aim will provide leads for manipulating dispersal, a key step in bacterial lifecycles including those of global
pathogens."

care and public health needs. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) Maternal Fetal Medicine
Units (MFMU) Network clinical center is committed to addressing these major public health burdens by continuing
to contribute to high-quality, definitive multi-site collaborative clinical studies. The UNC MFMU includes UNC
Health Care (UNC-Chapel Hill and UNC Rex hospitals) and WakeMed Health (WakeMed Raleigh and WakeMed
North hospitals); combined, there were 15,175 deliveries in 2021. UNC MFMU sites have >30 years of MFMU
perinatal research experience and include three Level IV and one Level Ill NICU, with established graduate
follow-up programs for each hospital system.
UNC has an established track record of success as a strong performing, active member of the NICHD MFMU
over the last 22 years. The UNC MFMU has completed 22 studies; an additional 9 are currently active. Several
currently active studies were initiated during the peak pandemic period; despite this timing, the UNC MFMU
maintained excellent recruitment and data quality, demonstrating our perseverance and flexibility to rise to
ongoing challenges. We consistently enroll racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse participants, and
averaged 6th overall in recruiting from the 2016-2022 cycle. The continued success of the UNC MFMU is
supported by our solid infrastructure, ability to successfully recruit from our large diverse patient population,
experienced and dedicated team, and culture of clinical research. Further, our expertise and unique strengths in
areas including preterm birth, lactation, substance use disorder, disparities, translational research,
environmental science, epidemiology, and beyond will prove invaluable to the MFMU Network community.
The UNC MFMU is perfectly suited to continue to make substantial contributions to improve obstetric care, with
strengths directly aligned to support the MFMU Congressional and public health goals. We will leverage UNC's
unique resources to design and implement innovative multi-site, collaborative research proposals to
address priority areas as outlined by three overarching aims. Aim 1: Reduce rates of PTB and related morbidity
by advancing novel, solution-oriented research. Aim 2: Increase pregnant and lactating people's access to safe
and effective therapies to prevent and treat medical and obstetric complications. Aim 3: Develop optimal
strategies to protect mothers and babies affected by ongoing and future public health crises, including mental
health disorders, substance abuse disorders, environmental hazards, and pandemics. UNC's track record of
success for over 20 years, combined with superb infrastructure and personnel and innovative research
plans that leverage unique site-specific resources will result in sustained clinical and public health
impacts in optimizing perinatal health outcomes for pregnant people and their offspring."

Sepsis is a global epidemic with a high patient morbidity and mortality, and it accounts for staggering
healthcare costs both within the US and worldwide. Clinicians caring for septic patients are unable to
distinguish between septic patients who will rapidly recover and those patients who will develop a prolonged
disease course marked by immune dysfunction, infectious complications, chronic critical illness (CCI) and
death. This affects their ability to weigh the clinical risks versus benefits of immune-adjuvant therapy, in cases
where sepsis is characterized by marked immune paralysis. The long-term research goals are (1) to develop
novel, rapid and personalized tools with which to predict the prognostic trajectory of septic patients based on
underlying immune phenotype, and (2) to integrate this information into the clinical care of septic patients. The
subject of this proposal encompasses the first of these two goals, with objectives aligning with the NIGMS
Sepsis Research priorities (NOT-GM-19-054). Specifically, we will continue recruitment into an ongoing,
prospective, observational, clinical research trial enrolling patients suffering from acute sepsis at a tertiary care,
academic medical center. We will utilize a combination of immune-based assays and computational
approaches to (i) Validate the prognostic value of rapid, microfluidic cytokine analysis, following ex vivo
stimulation of whole blood. Hypothesis: functional immune phenotyping can identify septic patients with
subclinical immune paralysis who are prone to secondary infections. Approach: Quantitative analyses
comparing cytokine responses to immune adjuvants before and after ex vivo stimulation of whole blood.
Microfluidic cytokine analysis provides rapid and precise measurements and that are compatible with a clinical,
point of care test. (ii) Compare the CCI syndrome following medical and surgical sepsis. Hypothesis: Iatrogenic
tissue damage and inflammation caused by surgery alters the immune response and pathophysiology of CCI in
surgical patients, as compared with medical patients. We will use a combination of transcriptomic and
metabolomic data to confirm current theories of CCI pathophysiology in surgical patients, and then explore how
it differs in patients having medical sepsis. (iii) Develop high fidelity, in vitro models of human myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSCs) with which to perform preclinical testing of potential therapies for sepsis-induced
CCI. Hypothesis: human MDSCs (immature myeloid cells that expand during chronic infection and suppress
immune responses) can be generated through differentiation from peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated
from whole blood. These cells can be used as a novel preclinical model with which to test potential therapies
for CCI that are extrapolated from the treatment of cancer."
11140790,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Respiratory infections, including SARS-CoV-2, disproportionately affect residents of correctional facilities (jails
and prisons). While the Federal Bureau of Prisons and state Departments of Correction (DOCs) implemented
numerous prevention strategies including social distancing protocols, vaccination campaigns, and testing
programs to mitigate transmission and reduce the disease burden, overarching guidance on COVID-19
prevention within correctional facilities is limited. As a result, DOCs must develop and modify their policies based
on existing evidence regarding the effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention strategies within correctional facilities.
Unfortunately, the existing evidence base is limited. Specifically, the effectiveness of prevention strategies has
principally been estimated in isolation (not in combination with other strategies) and while holding the variant
constant. Because of this, DOCs are left with little evidence on how to implement and adapt prevention strategies
in combination and under the ever-changing COVID-19 landscape. With the goal of expanding the evidence
base for infectious disease prevention strategies within correctional facilities, we will estimate the effects of
testing and vaccination on the burden of COVID-19 in both jails and prisons. To do so, we will develop an
individual level discrete time hazard (transmission) model of SARS-CoV-2 and test the feasibility and reliability
of a cutting-edge statistical causal inference approach as an alternative to transmission modeling (Aims 1 & 2).
To examine the effects of testing and vaccination in combination and to identify scenarios when strategies require
modification to contain spread and reduce disease burden, we will simulate waves of SARS-CoV-2 in the
community and identify the strategy combinations required to prevent outbreaks within facilities using our
transmission models (Aim 3). The proposed simulation approach will allow for the simulation of SARS-CoV-2
transmission and disease under known and future, theoretical scenarios. The execution of the proposed aims
will strengthen the evidence available to DOCs and other policymakers and could make possible the estimation
of indirect treatment effects under a causal framework within complex, nested social networks. In addition, their
execution, coupled with the proposed training program comprising coursework, structured mentoring, and
experiential learning, will allow Dr. Lind (the candidate) to enrich her knowledge of infectious disease
transmission modeling, causal inference methods for treatment effect estimation in the presence of interference,
and health disparities and infection control within a highly marginalized population, residents of correctional
facilities. The candidate has established an expert mentoring and advisory team led by Dr. Albert Ko at the
Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases Department at the Yale School of Public Health to enable this training, guide
Dr. Lind's transition to independence during the R00 award phase and support her growth as an independently
funded infectious disease epidemiologist."
11140584,"Overall Project Summary
The ability to control bacterial infections with antibiotics has been one of the most important public health
advancements in human history. Before the discovery of antibiotics and vaccines, infectious disease was the
leading cause of death and constituted nearly 50% of deaths in the US alone. Now, infectious diseases as a
cause of death barely makes the top ten and we now treat most bacterial infections as a nuisance rather than
life-threatening diseases. Unfortunately, this is rapidly changing with the emergence of antibiotic resistant
bacterial pathogens. Ultimately, our ability to develop new antibiotics faster than resistance amongst
pathogens emerges has failed and many scientists expect we will experience a return to a pre-antibiotic era in
which we cannot treat what are now easy to cure bacterial infections. Therefore, novel, non-antibiotic
approaches to controlling bacterial infections are required and need to be explored. The main theme of the
BCM-CARBIRU is to use microbiome-based approaches to control bacterial infections at mucosal surfaces.
We will investigate ecological principles of microbial community inhibition of pathogen colonization as well as
the use of bacteriophage for precision elimination of bacterial pathogens. Both approaches have advantages
over the use of antibiotics in that they leave the native microbiome largely intact, avoiding the elimination of
beneficial microbes along with the pathogens targeted by antimicrobials. We propose three projects,
supported by two scientific cores and the administrative core, to explore and optimize microbiome-based
strategies for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections. Project 1. Discovery and mechanistic
understanding of phage activity and synergism at host mucosal surfaces. Project 2. Defined microbial
communities to prevent and eradicate infection by antibiotic resistant pathogens. Project 3. Nasal microbial
consortia combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We expect two main outcomes from the execution of these
projects. First, we expect to define and understand the ecological principles that are key for microbial
communities and bacteriophage to function to control pathogens at mucosal surfaces. Second, we expect to
have identified actionable phage and microbial communities that will be available for testing in human clinical
trials at the end of the project periods. Together, these projects will capitalize on protective measures at the
mucosal surface, which have existed for millennia prior to modern medicine, as we enter the next era of
microbiome-based therapies."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects nearly 1 in 2 U.S. adults, is the #1 killer of men and women, burdens
disadvantaged groups, and has costs greater than any other condition. While these statistics highlight the
importance of CVD prevention, current approaches have only partial effectiveness. This has created a need to
identify new CVD prevention targets, their underlying mechanisms, and effective interventions. Insomnia, its
candidate mechanisms, and insomnia treatment are strong candidates in this regard. Thirty years of evidence
indicates that insomnia is an independent, clinically important, robust, and potentially causal and modifiable
risk factor for CVD. In addition, biologically plausible mechanisms that could explain how insomnia promotes
the development of CVD have been proposed, with the most strongly supported being systemic inflammation,
autonomic dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation. Our recent RCT of adults with insomnia disorder provides
promising preliminary support for one such candidate mechanism. Adults randomized to cognitive-behavioral
therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), versus education control, had a reduced risk of high C-reactive protein (CRP), an
inflammation marker implicated in the pathophysiology of CVD and predictive of future CVD events, at follow-
up. Because insomnia now receives limited attention in settings where CVD prevention occurs (e.g., primary
care), there is a large cohort of patients with an unaddressed CVD risk factor (insomnia). This status quo and
the strong state of the insomnia-to-CVD science create the current need for a well-powered, mechanistic trial
to elucidate biological mechanisms underlying the insomnia-to-CVD relationship and CBT-I’s mechanisms of
action, both of which are presently unknown. Therefore, we propose a mechanistic trial of 200 primary care
patients (45% minority) with insomnia disorder and CVD risk factors but no clinical CVD. Patients will be
randomized to 6 months of the SHADES (Strengthening Hearts by Addressing DisruptEd Sleep) Intervention or
Active Control. The SHADES Intervention is our modernized collaborative care intervention consisting of well-
established internet, telephonic, and face-to-face CBT-I. Active Control consists of sleep education/hygiene,
symptom monitoring, and primary care for insomnia. Our proposal has four aims – Aim 1: determine the effect
of the SHADES Intervention on our primary CVD mechanism of high-sensitivity CRP; Aim 2: determine the
effect of the SHADES Intervention on our secondary CVD mechanisms of systemic inflammation, autonomic
dysfunction, and metabolic dysregulation; Aim 3: examine if 6-month improvements in upstream sleep
mechanisms mediate the SHADES Intervention effect on 6-month improvements in downstream CVD
mechanisms; ExploratoryAim: explore the effect of the SHADES intervention on proinflammatory gene
expression. The proposed trial would generate the critical support for the mechanistic rationale and conceptual
framework needed to justify the next-step phase III, multi-site RCT to determine the SHADES Intervention
effect on CVD clinical outcomes, endpoints of great"

Climate change-related extreme weather – extreme heat, heatwaves, and intense rainfall – pose an urgent
threat to public health. Children may bear a disproportionate burden of the adverse effects of extreme weather
for a multitude of reasons, including their immature and developing bodies, low body mass, and dependence
on caregivers to respond to environmental threats. A growing body of literature, including studies from our own
research group, shows links between extreme weather and acute childhood morbidity. Nevertheless, there
remain critical knowledge gaps, including incomplete characterization of the scope of pediatric health
outcomes related to weather extremes and almost no assessment of chronic health (lasting) impacts. We
propose to conduct a large, multi-site study of the relationship between extreme weather and children’s health
by linking data from PEDSnet – a research consortium of U.S. pediatric health systems, including over 12
million children, spanning the years 2009 through 2023 – with high-resolution geospatial measures of extreme
weather and residential neighborhood environments. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Estimate associations of
extreme weather events – hot temperatures, heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and intense rainstorms – with a broad
scope of acute adverse health events in children, such as dehydration, asthma exacerbation, respiratory
infections, acute gastroenteritis, injuries, and acute care for mental health disorders; 2) Investigate the
relationship between cumulative exposure to multiple, possibly repeated extreme weather events, and
development of chronic health conditions during childhood – including mental health disorders, asthma and
allergic rhinitis, and overweight/obesity – assessing initial development of the condition, as well as its
persistence; 3) Quantify disproportionate impacts of extreme weather on children according to small-area
(census-tract) indicators of residential neighborhood-level social and infrastructural vulnerability. Our study will
considerably advance scientific understanding of relationships between climate-change related weather
extremes and children’s health. Given the geographical diversity of the study area, the size of the patient
population included, the detailed richness of our compiled database, and the novel investigation of chronic
health outcomes, this project will have a sustained impact on the state of knowledge about the scope,
magnitude, and inequities of children’s health outcomes from extreme weather."

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is historically described as an endocrine (β-cell) specific autoimmune disease. However,
reduced pancreatic size and subclinical exocrine insufficiency are also present at T1D diagnosis. The
mechanisms, natural history, and role of these findings in T1D pathogenesis remains unclear. Exocrine atrophy
may even precede the onset of multiple islet autoantibodies (Stage 1 T1D) in some subjects, signifying that
clinical measures of exocrine mass and function could be helpful early T1D biomarkers. The primary objective
of this proposal is to establish the natural history of exocrine loss in pre-T1D and to identify exocrine T1D-
predictive biomarkers. We will measure fecal elastase (FE-1), a clinical marker of exocrine function, throughout
the course of pre-T1D within TEDDY (The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young) subject banked
samples (Aim 1A). An enrolling R01-funded study of TrialNet (TN) subjects (Campbell-Thompson and Haller,
mPIs) will prospectively examine pancreas volume by MRI in single islet autoantibody positive (AAb+), multiple
AAb+, and AAb- T1D first degree relatives (FDRs) to evaluate its prognostic utility. Herein we propose to add
evaluation of serum and stool exocrine functional markers in this complementary population to evaluate their
prognostic utility and determine timing of exocrine loss (Aim 1B). We hypothesize that exocrine markers will be
reduced prior to Stage 1 T1D in those destined for progression and that their rate of decline can be used to
predict disease onset. Lastly, the mechanisms underlying reduced exocrine pancreatic mass and function in T1D
remain unclear; leading hypotheses include a lack of insulin secretion or autoimmunity to exocrine tissue leading
to pancreas atrophy. The secondary objective of this study will use samples from the Network for Pancreatic
Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD) cohort to investigate these potential mechanisms and evaluate exocrine
pancreatic autoantibodies as biomarkers of risk (Aim 2). We hypothesize that exocrine autoimmunity is present
in subjects with multiple islet AAb+ and those with clinical T1D and leads to diminished exocrine mass and
function. We hypothesize that insulinopenia is present in those with clinical T1D and leads to further exocrine
atrophy. If our hypothesis is proven, this will represent a paradigm shift in our traditional understanding of the
pathogenesis of T1D as an endocrine-specific autoimmune disease. This proposal will advance my early career
goal to better understanding the timing and role of T1D exocrine pancreas changes and apply this knowledge in
prevention and intervention trials. The skills set forth within this research proposal and career development plan
will promote independence as a clinical investigator and include collaborations in several large T1D research
consortia and training in 1) human subjects research trial design, implementation, and analysis 2) biomarker
evaluation and 3) translational science design and technique. The collaborative rapport, excellent mentorship,
and mission of training the next generation of investigators across University of Florida institutes and
departments provides an ideal environment for career success."

Title: Increasing the Capacity of a Community-Based Research Center to Address Opioid Use
Disorder and Related Health Inequities in Urban American Indian Communities
The Native American Community Clinic (NACC) research center, The CEDAR Center, proposes
a two-year project to increase their research capacity and evaluate culturally-centered models of
care for urban-dwelling American Indians struggling with opioid use disorder (OUD) and related
conditions. As an Indigenous-led Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) serving over 4,500
American Indian/ Alaska Native (AI/AN) patients annually, NACC’s research center is uniquely
positioned to conduct research inline with the organization's mission to provide care through a
culturally-centered model that integrates Western and Indigenous knowledge systems to
address the opioid crisis and related health inequities.
Our project will:
1. Build capacity to conduct local community-based HEAL-prioritized research by:
a. Increasing key staff
b. Developing research policies, practices, and procedures
c. Establishing a Community Advisory Board
d. Establishing a Scientific Advisory Board
2. Enhance NACC's model of integrating cultural healing practices within a Western
 community health center to address OUD/SUD, overdose, and related health and
 wellness factors.
3. Prepare a NIDA proposal for a full-scale project testing the impact of our culturally
 centered model.
a. Employing a mixed methodological pilot approach, including analysis of existing
 clinical data, community surveys, focus groups, and interviews, we will assess
 our culturally-centered model's effectiveness and identify improvement areas.
Throughout the project, we will focus on building sustainable research capacity within our
organization and community. This includes training AI/AN staff in research methods,
establishing data governance protocols, and creating pathways for community members to
engage in all stages of the research process.
This project aims to improve health outcomes and overall wellness for urban AI/AN people by
developing and evaluating culturally centered, community-driven approaches to OUD treatment
and prevention. Our findings will inform larger-scale intervention studies and contribute to the
evidence base for holistic Indigenous healthcare models addressing the opioid crisis."

Beyond mortality directly from conflict and mass displacement of populations, conflict has been associated with
numerous acute and chronic health hazards including infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCDs),
malnutrition, and mental health problems. For example, studies have documented high prevalence of trauma-
associated mental disorders, with the most common psychiatric disorders being posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD), anxiety, and depression and comorbid health problems are very common in such populations. Evidently,
humanitarian settings such as refugee camps pose grave threat to public health not only for the forcibly displaced
refugees but to host communities as well. Crucially, there are significant scientific questions with high public
health importance that can be answered through research in humanitarian settings. Unfortunately, it is
exceedingly difficult to conduct research in humanitarian settings and there is well-documented research
capacity gap to help identify and develop evidence-based strategies to address the myriad of health challenges
facing vulnerable refugee populations in humanitarian settings. Specifically, there is significant lack of cultural
competence and limited knowledge among researchers about appropriate ethical guidelines for research among
vulnerable refugee populations. Additionally, there are often barriers that make conducting research in these
settings difficult including language barriers, power dynamics between researchers and refugee participants, and
questions around voluntary participation and informed consent. In this regard, it is imperative to recruit and train
refugees youth interested in research and build their capacity to carryon critical research focused on addressing
unique health issues faced by populations in humanitarian setting. Thus, we propose employing a three-phased
participatory approach involving key stakeholders like UNHCR, IRC, the Office of the Prime Minster (OPM) that
is responsible for refugee welfare in Uganda, and refugees themselves to identify research capacity gaps and
develop a much-needed research training curriculum focused on intervention research design, implementation,
and ethical conduct of research. Then, recruit 30 refugee youth 20 to 35 years of age, with diploma, bachelor’s
degree or higher to receive a 12-week structured training and conduct program evaluation. Consistent with the
aims and scope of the parent grant (D43TW012275), the proposed administrative supplement will have the
following aims: (1) conduct planning and consultative meetings with key stakeholders to identify research
capacity gaps and opportunities to build research capacity among refugee youth residing in humanitarian
settings; (2) based on data gathered in aim 1, develop a training curriculum along with key stakeholders to
develop research capacity in areas of intervention research design, implementation, and ethical conduct of
research; (3) recruit 30 refugee youth and deliver research training based on the curriculum developed with
stakeholders in aim 2 and conduct evaluation of the short-term impact of the training program."
11160178,"Project Summary
More than 6 million U.S. adults live with diagnoses of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias
(AD/ADRD), with projections as high as 13.8 million cases by 2050. There are no cures for AD/ADRD, making
lifestyle factors key targets for reducing risk, as they account for at least a third of AD/ADRD cases. Engaging in
regular physical activity (PA), particularly in midlife, is associated with reduced risk for AD/ADRD. Yet nearly
half of midlife adults (48%) do not meet national PA guidelines of 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity PA.
Goal setting is a commonly used behavior change strategy to increase PA. Key psychosocial mechanisms
believed to underpin the use of goal setting to promote PA include self-regulation and self-efficacy. Yet, the
most effective goal setting technique to enhance these psychosocial mechanisms for the successful promotion
of PA and adherence to national PA guidelines remains unclear. In the proposed study, we will use a two-
phased approach to empirically test three goal setting techniques to enhance psychosocial mechanisms of self-
regulation and self-efficacy for the successful promotion of PA and adherence to national PA guidelines among
insufficiently active midlife adults with obesity. In the R61 phase, a Phase 1 pilot study will establish feasibility
and help refine the intervention. In the R33 phase, a Phase 2 9-month 4-arm proof-of-concept mechanistic trial
(6-month active intervention and 3-month no contact follow-up) will be implemented to establish preliminary
efficacy of goal setting techniques to increase PA and promote adherence to national PA guidelines. All
participants will receive a Fitbit to self-monitor PA and engage in PA action planning sessions with a study
interventionist. In addition, participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups: i) static weekly goal of 150
minutes/week of moderate-intensity PA, which most closely resembles the approach of public health
campaigns and care providers; ii) weekly self-selected PA goals, which allows for self-determination and
adaptation of the goal; iii) modest incremental weekly PA increase goal (i.e., researcher determined PA goal
that 20% minutes/week greater than the minutes/week of PA in the previous week); or iv) non-goal setting
control group. Based on Goal Setting Theory, it is hypothesized that participants in the incremental goal group
will have the greatest increases in self-regulation and self-efficacy, which in turn, will lead to the greatest
improvements in PA and adherence to national PA guidelines over the 9-month intervention. Further,
individuals with the greatest PA adherence are expected to experience the greatest improvements in AD/ADRD
risk factors, including cognitive functioning (memory, executive functioning, processing speed), AD plasma
biomarkers (plasma amyloid 42/40 ratio. plasma phosphorylated tau 231), and measures of cardiometabolic
disease risk (BMI, blood pressure, plasma glucose, TG, total cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, VLDL-C, IDL-C,
insulin and insulin sensitivity)."

Sarcoidosis a rare systemic inflammatory disease with high morbidity and increasing mortality.
Granulomatous inflammation affects the lungs in 90% of cases, with ~1/3 of patients progressing to
experience severe pulmonary disease that can result in lung transplant or death. Sarcoidosis is thought
to be due to interaction between an unknown environmental antigen and host genetic susceptibility.
Extensive epidemiological evidence supports the involvement of bioaerosol in pulmonary sarcoidosis.
However, only one component of bioaerosol has been directly measured in a cohort of patients with
sarcoidosis. We hypothesize residential bioaerosol exposure drives immune dysregulation in pulmonary
sarcoidosis leading to severe lung disease. We will test this through three aims:
Specific Aim 1: Determine the association between rBio and pulmonary sarcoidosis severity.
We hypothesize bioaerosol exposures are unique within residences of those experiencing severe
pulmonary sarcoidosis compared to exposures of patients with minimal to non-existent fibrosis and
controls. We will collect rBio and analyze its composition using traditional and micro/mycobiome
techniques, then compare it to patient symptoms, lung function and chest imaging.
Specific Aim 2: Determine the role of rBio in peripheral blood immune dysregulation in fibrotic
pulmonary sarcoidosis. We will quantify and compare serum biomarkers and immune cell profile to
rBio. We will compare these findings to controls, and to patient pulmonary disease severity using
patient symptoms, lung function, and chest imaging.
Specific Aim 3: Assess the epithelial responses to rBio in severe pulmonary sarcoidosis. We
hypothesize epithelial cells from patients with fibrotic pulmonary sarcoidosis will have impaired cell
adhesion, and barrier integrity in response to rBio. We will test this hypothesis in vitro by exposing
primary human airway epithelial cells from recruited subjects to BDG, LPS and mixed bioaerosol from
residences. We will assess protein expression, transcriptomic and functional responses.
Completion of this proposal will inform potential disease mechanisms, diagnostic and progression
biomarkers, and novel treatments for people with sarcoidosis including environmental remediation"

Exposure to environmental chemical mixtures may increase the risk of cardiometabolic disease. Of particular
concern are prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of chemicals used as processing
aids for oil/water repellant textiles, fluoropolymer manufacturing, food packaging, cleaning products, and
firefighting foams. PFAS exposure is ubiquitous, deriving from contaminated food and drinking water. Over 6
million people in the US have PFAS contaminated drinking water, and many more have low-level exposure.
Animal and human studies show that prenatal PFAS exposure may increase the risk of obesity, insulin
resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension – components of the cardiometabolic syndrome that markedly
increase the risk of adulthood cardiovascular diseases. However, few studies have investigated the health
effects of PFAS mixtures, and the biological pathways underlying these effects are poorly understood. Guided
by our preliminary studies and the hypothesis that biological pathways represented in the serum metabolome
are sensitive to early life PFAS mixture exposure and predictive of later life cardiometabolic health, we will use
non-targeted high-resolution metabolomics to quantify the associations between prenatal PFAS mixtures, the
metabolome, and cardiometabolic disease. Building upon two established and ongoing prospective cohorts of
pregnant women and their children from Canada (MIREC Study, n=500) and Cincinnati, Ohio (HOME Study,
n=250), we will measure >25,000 features of the serum metabolome at delivery and ages 3-5, and 7-12 years.
We will link these data to previously collected or to be measured prenatal PFAS biomarkers and
cardiometabolic outcomes at age 7-12 years. We will use sophisticated biostatistical techniques to reduce the
dimensionality of these data and discover metabolomic signatures associated with both prenatal PFAS
mixtures and cardiometabolic outcomes in MIREC, replicating our findings using HOME. Specifically, we will:
1) characterize trajectories of the serum metabolome in the first 12 years of life; 2) identify features of serum
metabolome trajectories in the first 12 years of life that predict adolescent cardiometabolic disease; 3)
determine if metabolome features mediate the association of prenatal exposure to PFAS mixtures with
adolescent cardiometabolic disease; and 4) determine the chemical identity of metabolome features
discovered in Aim 3. This interdisciplinary proposal that includes epidemiologists, clinicians, biostatisticians,
and chemists will efficiently leverage two ongoing cohort studies to address these timely aims. Ultimately, the
proposed studies will have substantial impact by improving our knowledge of the health effects of PFAS,
identifying novel metabolic alterations associated with PFAS mixtures and adolescent health, and improving
our understanding of biological pathways affecting cardiometabolic disease. These results are critical to
ongoing evaluations of PFAS toxicity and may help identify exposed populations at risk of cardiometabolic
disease and potentially ameliorate the effects of PFAS exposure."
11146037,"Abstract: The neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, known as neuroCOVID-19,
have raised concerns regarding the underlying mechanisms and potential involvement of
antibodies. Antibodies can exert inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses based on their
glycosylation patterns. Building upon our data, our central hypothesis is that inflammatory IgGs
associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection trigger activation and/or damage to resident brain cells
and endothelial cells, leading to disruptions in brain homeostasis. Furthermore, we propose that
these inflammatory IgGs exhibit an enrichment for autoreactivity against brain antigens. To test
this hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will elucidate the impact of inflammatory IgGs on glial cells, neurons,
and endothelial cells. By utilizing well-characterized inflammatory and anti-inflammatory IgGs
obtained from plasma and CSF of COVID-19 donors, we will assess their effects on human
induced pluripotent stemcell (iPSC)-derived astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and brain endothelial
cells. This investigation will evaluate changes in cellular phenotype, inflammatory status, and
functional integrity. In Aim 2, we will investigate the potential role of inflammatory IgGs in brain
homeostasis using chimeric human brain/mouse NSG mice. Through the infusion of labeled
inflammatory and anti-inflammatory IgGs, we will examine their trafficking into the brain,
characterize their cellular associations, and determine their impact on brain homeostasis. In Aim
3, we will determine the involvement of inflammatory IgGs in COVID-19 autoreactive responses.
Previous studies have indicated the presence of autoreactive antibodies in COVID-19, with some
reports linking them to neuroCOVID-19. However, a comprehensive understanding of the impact
of autoreactive IgGs in the context of COVID-19, particularly their brain antigen targets, remains
unclear. To address this, we will employ Omics-scale high density protein microarrays to discover
COVID-19 autoreactive antibodies in the brain. Subsequently, we will assess their effects on
resident brain cells and investigate the contribution of inflammatory IgGs to t his autoreactive
phenotype, including analysis of their glycosylation patterns. Collectively these studies will
provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the neurological effects of COVID-19
and the role of antibodies in these processes. The outcomes of this research have the potential
to inform therapeutic interventions targeting the neurological complications associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection."

Twenty-five percent of children with HIV-infection have childhood wasting (low weight-for-height or low mid-upper
arm circumference, and HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) children are twice as likely to be underweight as
comparable HIV-unexposed children. Wasting is known to promote morbidity, HIV-progression, and mortality
among these children. Improving wasting prevention and treatment for children and in early infant diagnosis and
HIV-care programs could not only improve the child health outcomes of these children, but also substantially
lower the global burden of childhood wasting.
This proposal will develop a novel two-way short message service (SMS) platform that targets key barriers to
improving nutritional care for HEU and HIV-infected children. This intervention will combine a maternally
administered malnutrition monitoring system (MAMMS) with infant and young child education (IYCF) delivered
by SMS. After developing the intervention using participatory design methods, we will complete a proof-of-
concept quasi-experimental trial of MAMMS-IYCF in the R21. If the R21 milestones are meet, we will use the
R33 to conduct a randomized trial testing the effectiveness of MAMMS-IYCF at reduced the incidence wasting,
and the duration of wasting treatment. During this trial we will also assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of
MAMMS-IYCF, and to better understand which barriers are being successfully addressed by intervention we will
measure its effect on key attitudinal and behavioral outcomes including trust in the healthcare system, intention
to seek if a child becomes wasted, and IYCF knowledge. This trial will generate the evidence necessary to
integrate MAMMS-IYCF interventions into existing HIV-mHealth programs across the globe, and improve the
outcomes of children in early infant diagnosis and HIV-care services while also substantially lowering the global
burden of childhood wasting."
11163795,"This supplement request will take advantage of the ongoing effort to place MR-opaque fiducial markers over
acupoints, as part of human anatomical MRI data collection for the TARA platform. We will add to this protocol
new imaging data collection for fascia localization. Specifically, deep to the skin surface under the placed MR-
SPOT markers, acupoints may prove to be located within networks of fascia. Fascia is manifest throughout the
human body, but our understanding of the fascial relationship to acupoints is limited, and most of our general
knowledge about this tissue thus far comes from cadaver dissection and animal studies. Direct imaging of fascia
alongside MR-SPOT imaging would represent an exciting opportunity to image fascia directly and link it into this
study. To date, MRI exploration of fascia anatomy in vivo has been limited by the thin structure of this tissue and
its very short T2* times. Recent work has shown that dual echo Ultrashort TE (UTE) MRI overcomes the
limitations of conventional MRI, namely by acquiring images at echo times suitably short to acquire signal from
the collagenous fascia tissues, and by subtracting conventional TE images from the UTE images to maximize
contrast. We will use such data to build biomechanical models to better resolve fascia thickness, relative to
acupoints, in healthy adults. In this supplement, we propose to support protocol development and optimization
of MRI approaches for imaging human fascia in vivo. There will be two aims associated with this supplement: 1)
develop and tune an MRI protocol at the Martinos Center, using our 3T scanner for imaging limb fascia. 2) Recruit
and image one participant with this protocol, with several MR-SPOT markers placed at acupoints. These data
can then be evaluated for potential usage in informing the 3D fascia models being developed at the Auckland
Bioengineering Institute as part of the TARA project. The generation of a digital atlas of acupoints in humans is
the main aim of the TARA project, and these acupoints, below the skin markers, may be embedded within the
continuous and interconnected fascia system. This supplement proposes to integrate UTE MRI, targeting fascia
imaging, into the TARA platform, which will serve to inform our development of the first digital anatomical atlas
of fascia and acupoints."

11168170,"An administrative Supplement is requested to purchase a high-performance computer system to simulate and
generate data for predicting diabetic retinopathy hemodynamics.
Pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy is characterized by the appearance of morphological abnormalities in the
retinal capillary vessels. Although such abnormalities are used in the clinical evaluation of the disease severity,
the hemodynamic mechanisms underlying their development and progression remain unknown. These
morphological abnormalities are highly localized in specific regions of the retinal vascular network, and may
correlate with the local variations of the hemodynamic parameters and forces. Diabetic conditions significantly
alter the biophysical properties of the blood cells, however the influence of such altered biophysical properties
on the retinal hemodynamics and pathogenesis of retinopathy are not known. Existing in vivo imaging
techniques have limitations in terms of the hemodynamic measurements in the topologically complex and multi-
plexus retinal vasculature. Additionally, tissue hypoxia and the loss of blood flow autoregulation are pathogenic
factors in retinopathy. No study exists that correlates diabetes-mediated altered biophysics of the individual
blood cell to the loss of retinal tissue oxygenation and flow regulation. Our underlying hypotheses are: (i)
altered biophysics of diabetic red blood cells (RBC) alone can mediate vascular abnormalities by altering the
hemodynamic parameters and forces; and (ii) such changes are spatially heterogeneous across the retinal
vascular network, and correlate with the focal and heterogeneous nature of vascular abnormalities. The broad
objective of this project is to understand the relationship between the hemodynamics of diabetic blood cells,
retinal vascular network topology, and pathogenesis of retinopathy, using a high-fidelity, predictive
computational modeling study. Specific aims are: 1) To develop a multiscale computational model of the
diabetic retinopathy hemodynamics taking into consideration the precise microstructural and geometric details
of the 3D vascular networks as obtained from in vivo images of the human retina, and 3D deformation of every
single blood cell with altered biophysical properties representing diabetic conditions. 2) To predict diabetic
RBC-mediated alteration in the retinal hemodynamics, and how such changes are correlated to the formation
and heterogeneity of microvascular abnormalities and vascular adaptation at different stages of progressive
retinopathy. 3) To evaluate the significance of diverse cellular-scale hemodynamic pathways involved. 4) To
predict the role of RBC hemodynamics on retinal hypoxia and loss of nitric oxide bioavailability as pathogenic
factors in retinopathy. This study is significant and innovative because it will (i) develop the first high-fidelity,
predictive computational model that combines the exact 3D geometry of ultra-large-scale and multi-plexus in
silico retinal vasculature, and 3D deformation and rheology of every blood cell, (ii) provide a rheology-
topology coupling mechanism as a basis of hemodynamics-mediated initiation and progression of vascular
abnormalities, (ii) directly model heterotypic individual cell-cell and cell-endothelium interactions, and (iv)
couple individual RBC transient deformation with blood and retinal tissue gas transport.
Acquisition of the high-performance computer system will enable us to perform the simulations and generate
data to accomplish the Specific Aims."

Lyme disease is the most reported vector-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Lyme disease is caused
by the spirochetal bacterium¾Borrelia burgdorferi¾an unusual pathogen in that it is capable of causing severe
disease, despite lacking any recognizable virulence factors. Prompt therapy is often affective, but many patients
may still experience severe symptoms, chiefly Lyme arthritis. The reason(s) for persistent symptoms is poorly
understood and the most debated topic in the field. The lead investigator of this proposal discovered that B.
burgdorferi sheds ~45% of its peptidoglycan (PG)—the essential component of the bacterial cell-wall—from
inside the cell, into its environment. B. burgdorferi PG can be detected in the synovial fluid of Lyme arthritis
patients' months after oral and/or intravenous antibiotics. Experimental animal studies have shown that purified
B. burgdorferi PG alone, is capable of causing arthritis. We have shown that the chemical constituents of B.
burgdorferi PG are unlike any on the planet and real-time tracking studies indicate that these unique features
are associated with extended dwell times in discrete organs. Taken together, we hypothesize that the natural
release of unique B. burgdorferi PG fragments is responsible for driving Lyme arthritis, post-therapy, in
susceptible mammals, but we can target lingering fragments for therapeutic purposes. This proposal will critically
assess 1) what exactly is being released and what persists; 2) where and how the material persists; 3) the
relationship between Borreliae PG chemistry and persistent disease; 4) host factors that may contribute to PG-
induced arthritis; and 5) if targeted monoclonal antibody therapy is viable approach to treat patients suffering
from Lyme arthritis. Our studies will fill critical knowledge gaps in what is driving patient symptomology after
antibiotic therapy and may lead to new ways to treat patients when conventional options have failed."

physiologic changes associated with lower disease and disability risk. Whether this translates to actual
reductions in disease and disability is unclear. A large multi-year trial with definitive clinical outcomes is needed
to fill this evidence gap. Time restricted feeding (TRF) could be an attractive alternative to CR if it produced
similar health benefits, was more easily sustained, and mitigated CR’s undesirable loss of muscle and bone.
 The overall goal of this 3-year HALLO planning grant is to develop a protocol for a rigorous, multi-site,
randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing clinically-relevant health outcomes in older persons randomized to
daily CR, a TRF regimen, or a non-dietary attention control group employing innovative mHealth tools to
promote adherence. We will complete a 12-month pilot study enrolling 120 older adults (age ≥60 years; 50%
women; ≥23% minority) to provide critical information on feasibility, intervention delivery, and data informing
effect size determination.
 HALLO-P’s Objectives are to:
1. Establish a scientific advisory board and other structures to guide planning activities and the design of a full-
scale RCT that engage a wide range of stakeholders and build a national constituency for the project.
2. Refine our mHealth behavior-change and adherence tracking platform—the HALLO-P Companion App—to
optimize delivery of both the CR and TRF interventions.
3. Conduct focus groups and a 12-month pilot RCT of: 1) 20% CR delivered in-person; 2) 20% CR delivered
remotely via video conferencing; and 3) TRF (8-10 hours) with ad libitum caloric intake. Pilot data will help
refine recruitment criteria, estimate recruitment yields, and refine intervention approaches. We will use doubly-
labeled water to measure achieved CR and continuous glucose monitoring to assess adherence to TRF.
4. Model aging biomarker changes for differing CR doses using WF OAIC repositories and the HALLO-P pilot.
Existing epidemiological databases will be used to estimate the anticipated effect of these biomarker changes
on clinical outcomes and to derive key design metrics related to inclusion/exclusion criteria, and event rates
related to multi-morbidity, health deficit accumulation, and functional decline/disability; and
5. Integrate new data, the scientific literature .and expert advice to prepare a protocol, and develop informed
consent forms, manuals of operation, study forms, and related systems to permit the rapid launch of the larger
trial upon completion of the pilot activities in coordination with the other U01 project funded by this mechanism."
11137377,"Project Summary
 Pre-sympathetic neurons (PSNs) of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) are essential drivers of
physiological and pathological increases of sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). Perhaps their most robust property is
their resting state of discharge quiescence. Early studies linked quiescence to the dominance of synaptic inhibition,
but mechanisms that establish and defend GABAergic inhibitory tonus in the PVN are understood only on a
rudimentary level. This is an important knowledge gap because pathogenic factors that increase PVN-driven SNA
must ultimately subvert or overwhelm mechanisms that regulate the quiescent resting state of PSNs. In preliminary
studies, we uncovered a presynaptic mechanism that is novel to the PVN, referred to as “Glutamate-GABA
strengthening (GGS)”, that increases GABAergic inhibition in pace with synaptic glutamate (Glu) spillover. To do so,
GGS regulates the amplitude of GABA-A receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) through uptake
of synaptically released Glu, ostensibly into local GABA terminals, by the neuronal excitatory amino acid transporter
3 (EAAT3). Once internalized, Glu is converted to GABA and GABA molecules are packaged into synaptic vesicles
at greater than normal density. Stressors that acutely increase PVN-driven SNA are hypothesized to increase
synaptic Glu release without changing extrinsic GABAergic input. As a result, “over-filled” GABA vesicles are
released that dampen excitation and aid restoration of PSN quiescence. During chronic sympathoexcitation
challenges accompanied by reduced GABA input, GGS is subverted (due to low GABA release) and can therefore
provide little opposition to synaptic excitation. Proposed studies will use state-of-the-art transgenic mouse models,
optogenetics and virus-mediated gene over-expression and CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown to assess mechanisms and
functional outcomes of GGS. Kinetics, sensitivity and efficacy of GGS will be established at the single PSN level
using a novel horizontal brain slice preparation that preserves Glu input from the forebrain median preoptic nucleus
(MnPO) as well as GABA input from the PVN peri-nuclear zone (PNZ). Retrogradely transported AAV will be injected
into the PVN of vGlut2-Cre mice to express channelrhodopsin (ChR2) in glutamatergic MnPO-PVN neurons.
Optogenetic activation will determine the capacity of MnPO inputs to drive GGS amongst RVLM-projecting PVN
PSNs. Using vGlut2fl/fl mice, we will determine functional effects of GGS on GABA-A receptor inhibitory tone and
SNA responses to forebrain angiotensin II (AngII) and hyperosmolality when glutamatergic MnPO neurons have
normal (vGlut2 intact) or diminished (vGlut2 knockdown) capacity to release Glu from PVN synapses. To further
illuminate in vivo mechanisms and efficacy of GGS, EAAT3 on PNZ GABA inputs to the PVN will be increased and
decreased to grade PVN GABAergic tonus and the magnitude of PVN-driven SNA responses to (1) acute forebrain
AngII and hyperosmolality as well as (2) sub-acute water deprivation and high salt intake. Proposed studies will
provide unprecedented mechanistic insight into the physiological role GGS plays in generating and defending
PVN PSN quiescence, and are essential for advancing the goal of preventing and reversing disease-promoting
sympathoexcitation."
11138363,"Disease associated with allergies such as asthma are a rising health problem with no current curative
solutions. CD4+ helper T cells (TH) that respond to common allergens play an important role in driving airway
inflammation in asthma.
To better understand the diversity of T cell subsets in allergy and asthma, we analyzed the single-cell
transcriptome of ~50,000 house dust mite (HDM) allergen-reactive TH cells from asthmatics and non-
asthmatics, with and without HDM allergy. From our analysis, besides canonical clusters of cells such as TH2,
TH17, and TH1, we identified a novel subset of allergen-reactive TH cells characterized by an IFN responsive
gene signature that we called THIFNR cells (Seumois et al. Science Immunology, 2020).
Proportions of THIFNR cells were significantly increased in nonallergic individuals compared to allergic
patients, suggesting an allergen-specific host specific response even in non-allergic individuals. Moreover, the
exclusive presence of the allergen-reactive TH2 cells in the allergic patients suggests a protective role (anti-TH2
response) of the THIFNR cells in the non-allergic patients with exposure to allergen.
This potential protective role was reinforced by our in vitro studies showing that TNF-related apoptosis-
inducing ligand (TRAIL) produced by THIFNR cells directly inhibits T cell activation triggered by TCR
engagement. In follow-up studies, we found THIFNR cells among viral-reactive TH cells directed towards Flu or
SARS-CoV2, suggesting a broader role of those cells in immune responses. Also, we found THIFNR cells as a
stable TH subset in a large cohort of healthy individuals. Because of the recent discovery of THIFNR cells, very
little is known about their origins, differentiation, phenotype, and function. We hypothesize that these THIFNR
HDM-reactive T cells could play a role through TRAIL engagement in dampening TH2 inflammation in allergy
and asthma.
In Aim 1, we will utilize Interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) reporter mice and T cell-specific
interferon receptor 1 (IFNAR1) knockout mice to determine the importance of THIFNR cells in controlling
allergic airway inflammation in asthma models. In Aim 2, we will perform single-cell ATAC-seq profiling to
identify transcription factors that may be involved establishing and maintaining the epigenetic state of THIFNR
cells. Finally, we will test functionally those TF by using shRNA knockdown experiments. Overall, studies in
this program will improve our understanding of how THIFNR cells are generated in vivo and how they interact
with other CD4+ T cells subsets like TH2 cells to curtail allergic airway inflammation in asthma models."
11145368,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 This K08 application proposes a ﬁve-year career development and research program focused on elucidat-
ing the transcriptional determinants and molecular heterogeneity of Barrett’s esophagus (BE). The applicant,
Ramon Jin, M.D., Ph.D., is a physician-scientist and an Instructor in Medicine in the Section of Hematology and
Oncology, Department of Medicine, at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM). Since completing his hematology and
oncology fellowship as a chief fellow, Dr. Jin has worked in the laboratory of Dr. Jason Mills, where he has applied
his foundation in molecular cell biology to study Barrett’s esophagus and upper gastrointestinal (GI) metaplasias
through development of genetic mouse models and establishment of human patient-derived organoids. From a
GI developmental perspective, Barrett’s metaplasia reﬂects a “caudalization” process with loss of esophageal
and gain in both gastric and intestinal traits. Speciﬁcally, two pioneering transcription factors involved in GI tract
patterning, SOX2 and CDX2, are likely to involved, and the proposed research is based on the hypothesis that
SOX2 decrease and CDX2 gain are critical steps during BE development and maintenance. To address this
hypothesis, Dr. Jin proposes to carry out two speciﬁc aims: 1) Characterize the eﬀects of SOX2 and CDX2 dis-
ruption on foregut homeostasis with and without bile acid treatment, and 2) Determine the eﬀects of SOX2 and
CDX2 restoration on BE maintenance and the molecular heterogeneity of BE.
 Continued mentorship and protected research time provided by this grant will ensure the support needed
to complete these aims and allow Dr. Jin suﬃcient time to establish an independent research program. Specif-
ically, the current award would provide an important opportunity to train in multi-omics techniques and bioinfor-
matic analyses, while expanding a unique set of tools including genetically modiﬁed mouse models and human
BE and gastroesophageal cancer organoids. Dr. Jin’s career development will be nurtured through continued
mentorship by Dr. Jason Mills and his mentorship committee. Drs. Cristian Ciorfa and Bing Zhang are both es-
tablished computational scientists specializing in bioinformatic integration of multi-omic data; Dr. Kunal Rai is an
expert in epigenomic regulation of development and oncogenesis; and Dr. Sarah Blutt is a leader in advanced GI
organoid culturing techniques. Dr. Jin’s career development will be supplemented by continued growth in grant-
manship, mentorship, leadership, and research community integration through courses and programs oﬀered
at BCM; involvement in ad hoc publication, abstract, and grant reviews; active participation in local and national
research meetings; and preparation of manuscripts and grants. The guidance provided by his highly experienced
research mentor and mentorship committee, the knowledge and technical skills derived from the proposed ex-
periments, and the completion of the carefully outlined career development plan will allow Dr. Jin to successfully
establish an independent research program that will be highly competitive for R01 funding."

Abstract:
The rapidly increasing number of microbial genomes has revealed an enormous diversity of proteins without
any known function. We still know relatively little about over half the proteins encoded in a typical bacterial
genome, and traditional laboratory techniques are too time consuming to characterize even a small fraction of
the observable universe of proteins. This neglected ""dark proteome"" potentially contains many important
determinants of virulence, antibiotic resistance, and disease. Casting a light on the dark proteome is possible
through comparative genomics because proteins interacting across evolutionary timescales leave behind a
signature of coevolution that can be used to connect proteins of unknown function with proteins of known
function. This 'guilt-by-association' analysis helps to generate hypotheses about the cellular role of unexplored
proteins. Here, we develop novel methods for quantifying coevolutionary signals, and we apply these methods
to an unprecedently large collection of genomes spanning the microbial tree of life. This project will result in a
network of coevolving genes that we will make publicly accessible as a web tool for biomedical research. To
further harness the power of comparative genomics, we will develop and deploy web applications that provide
deeper insights into the universe of microbial proteins."
11145311,"Abstract
Turkana County located in Northwest Kenya is a semi-arid region that has traditionally been
underserved and marginalized because of nomadic lifestyle of its people. The 2018 Kenya
Population Based HIV Impact Assessment survey reported that the HIV prevalence in Turkana
County was 6.8% which is higher than the national HIV prevalence of 4.9%. Only 62% of people
living with HIV (PLWH) were aware of their status, 89% of those were receiving ART, and 40%
achieved viral suppression which is lower than the national average. Non-communicable
diseases (NCDs), especially mental health problems but also co-morbid conditions such as
diabetes and hypertension negatively impact the quality of life of PLWH as well as uptake and
adherence to ART. Nearly 1 in 4 PLWH experience depression and the prevalence of non-
communicable diseases such as diabetes and hypertension among PLWH increase with age.
Therefore, PLWH, particularly the nomadic community in Turkana who are also a hard-to-reach
populations are at risk of mortality from common NCDs if these conditions are not identified and
treatment initiated. Therefore, programs providing HIV care need to integrate NCD screening,
prevention and management. There are limited opportunities for advanced education and
scientific research for health providers in Turkana County. Therefore, building research capacity
among a diverse group of trainees serving the under-resourced Turkana County can promote
locally relevant research and bring in different perspectives to aid identification of innovative
strategies to optimize NCD prevention, diagnosis and treatment for PLWH in Kenya. Our
application will leverage the training and capacity building activities currently underway as part of
the D43 award “Integrating prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases and HIV
care through research training in Kenya-INTEGRATE(TW009580)” led by Drs. John Kinuthia and
Carey Farquhar. The D43 provides for advanced training and mentorship in research to promote
HIV and NCD integration to Kenyatta National Hospital and Ministry of Health staff. Last year, we
were awarded a supplement grant “Promoting Diversity, Equity, and Inclusivity in Research
Training to Optimize HIV Prevention and Treatment-DIVERSITY” that aims to promote diversity,
equity, and inclusion of health-providers and community from Turkana County in HIV research by
providing foundational training in research methodologies. In this administrative supplement we
plan to build on our current efforts by providing advanced research training and high-quality
mentorship to Dr. Kristina Lokuruka, a medical doctor from Turkana and a trainee in our diversity
supplement. She will undertake a one-year MPH training at the University of Washington (UW).
The advanced training in epidemiology, biostatistics and implementation science coupled with
high-quality mentorship by Kenyan and the US faculty will equip her with skills to conduct locally
relevant mental health research and set her on path to be an independent researcher in her home
county. We will in addition offer advanced Epidemiology and Biostatistics training to a new trainee
from Turkana with a background in statistics and who has interest in research on mental health
or diabetes or hypertension comorbidity among PLWH. The trainee will undertake a 3-month
training in Epidemiology and Biostatistics course at UW that will include hands-on data analysis.
Thereafter the trainee will undertake a mentored research project that will utilize secondary data
from Turkana County. This will build their skills for future research in NCD among PLWH/ The two
trainees have diverse educational backgrounds and lived experiences (from living and working in
Turkana county and being of Turkana ethnic background) that can advance research to optimize
non-communicable diseases and HIV care in Kenya and at the same time promote inclusion of
traditionally underserved population in research."
11145325,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Clinical and translational research (CTR) across Harvard is conducted at 17 independent and geographically
dispersed institutions, including Harvard Medical School (HMS), Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health,
and 15 HMS-affiliated academic health care centers. Each of these institutions is fiscally and operationally
independent with their own governance, faculty, IRB, and electronic health records. Harvard Catalyst (HC)
serves as the sole coordinating entity for CTR and has brought these institutions together as a federated CTR
network. Since 2008, HC has developed a substantial portfolio of educational and CTR resources to meet the
needs of the CTR workforce at Harvard and, when their value has been demonstrated at Harvard,
disseminated them to the CTSA consortium. Moving forward, HC’s overarching vision is to partner with our
CTR workforce, institutions, and communities to become a living clinical and translational science (CTS)
learning laboratory. The CTS learning laboratory will continuously assess and reassess the hub’s CTR
strengths and weaknesses, developing and implementing programmatic innovations to improve the efficiency,
quality, effectiveness, and impact of CTR. Using the principles and methodologies of CTS and guided by a
logic model, HC is committed to achieving these goals and overcoming translational roadblocks. Seven
translational roadblocks have been prioritized that can be mitigated or overcome: 1) educational resources are
not reaching all learners and have been focused on investigators, rather than investigational teams; 2)
extensive research resources are frequently invisible and difficult to access; 3) substantial structural and
regulatory barriers limit cross-institutional collaborations; 4) research and clinical data need to be connected
and their access democratized; 5) CTR workforce is not sufficiently diverse and must be grown in all domains;
6) there is limited access to and participation by diverse populations in research; and 7) insufficient
mechanisms exist to support implementation of CTR evidence into practice. HC will also focus on better
understanding and meeting the needs of early-stage and underrepresented in medicine investigators and their
teams, as well as diverse patient populations and communities, while working to diversify the workforce and
reduce health inequities. Multiple initiatives are proposed to address five specific aims: 1) train and diversify
the CTR workforce; 2) connect trainees and CTR teams with HC resources; 3) partner with community
stakeholders to improve research participation; 4) democratize health informatics; and 5) use CTS to overcome
significant CTR roadblocks. HC is eager to learn from other CTSA hubs and is committed to dissemination and
sharing across the CTSA consortium. The insights derived from employing CTS approaches will be used to
overcome translational roadblocks and advance the collective national goal of improving human health."

Resilience, and Cardiovascular Complications: Defining the mechanistic basis of high risk endotypes.
Tim Chan

Abstract
The objective of this proposal is to understand the immunologic foundations of heart disease which can occur
as a result of COVID19. Cardiac impairment, when it develops is often fatal, and our hypothesis is that the
maintenance of endothelial function is critical to surviving the protracted nature of COVID19 pneumonia,
especially in those with reduced or delayed antibody responses.
 Our first aim will be to analyze those differences in immune function which pre-date infection but appear
to impact the risk of fatal COVID. This will be done by enrolling those at high risk for developing COVID19
(frontline healthcare workers), and performing serially assessments of their immunologic function if they develop
COVID. We will specifically investigate the mechanisms that link pre-infection inflammatory pathways to
protective serologic responses and symptom severity and recovery.
 Our second aim will be to perform in vitro experiments to assess the requirements for endothelial cell
dysfunction and infectivity. We will compare various inflammatory and cardiovascular stimuli which seem to play
a role in promoting COVID19-related cardiovascular complications.
 Our third aim is to characterize immune cells, endothelial cells, and cardiomyocytes in heart tissue from
those with COVID19-induced left ventricular dysfunction. Using single cell sequencing techniques, we will
determine cellular and molecular signatures that characterize the microenvironment of the COVID19-affected
heart, compared to appropriate controls.
 Our conceptual model is that pre-existing immune dysfunction 1) reduces the efficiency of neutralizing
antibody responses, and 2) in conjunction with cardiovascular disease risk factors, induces endothelial
downregulation/depletion of nodal regulators which protect against inflammatory insults. This renders
endothelial cells unable to withstand COVID-specific stimuli. Once completed, this study will provide the
necessary information to improve the identification of those at risk for COVID-related heart disease and develop
rationale approaches to improve the improve survival in the setting of COVID."
11144139,"SUMMARY
A number of drugs and interventions have been identified that curb morbidities associated with individual age-
related diseases, and a few compounds have been identified that increase longevity in mice and other non-
human species. However, few, if any, have been definitively shown to work by slowing the aging process and
thereby simultaneously delaying the onset of multiple diseases and ultimately extending human longevity. Thus,
current searches for drug and intervention targets that can lead to the development of longevity- enhancing
`geroprotectors,' i.e., interventions which stave off multiple age-related diseases and increase longevity by
slowing or disrupting aspects of the aging process, need to be improved. Only very integrated approaches are
likely to lead to successful searches given the need to reconcile complexities surrounding the pathogenesis of
age-related diseases with processes contributing to the synchronized decay of multiple systems that defines
aging. We believe that such integration can be achieved practically by: 1. pursuing multiple human longitudinal
studies focusing on the discovery of metabolites and proteins associated with a biologically-compelling definition
of slow and healthy human aging in different tissues; 2. exploiting novel cross- species longevity studies involving
multiple tissues to obtain insights into conserved pathways impacting longevity whose elements may be
consistent with factors discovered in human studies and hence validate them as truly related to longevity and
not just disease; and 3. aggregating data arising from items 1-2 along with relevant available public domain data
to generate/validate hypotheses, in addition to pursuing a GWAS to identify protective factors for disease and
using novel statistical and inferential methods. Our proposed studies are some of the first to champion the notion
that the `triangulation' of disparate scientific studies and discoveries, i.e., the attempt to unify results from
different study designs based on their biological coherence, is the optimal way to advance identification of human
targets for longevity-enhancing geroprotective drugs and interventions. Importantly, although we believe that
each of the individual studies we are proposing is itself powerful enough to identify potential geroprotector
targets, their collective and integrated use with novel analytic methods will have unprecedented power and
provide a paradigm for anti-aging drug discovery research within the academic community. For example, we are
proposing the first human longitudinal study to search for druggable factors associated with the epigenetic clock
and other validated measures of the aging rate/healthy aging in thousands of individuals; the largest
metabolomics and proteomic cross-species multi- tissue study (N=60 species) of factors associated with lifespan;
the largest human longitudinal comparative tissue study of aging exploring blood, muscle, fat and skin samples;
and the largest study of aggregated data from public domain sources for association analyses including standard
GWAS and a unique polygenic risk score-based healthy genome GWAS."

Elder mistreatment (EM) has profound effects on 1 in 10 older Americans, and rates are amongst the highest for
people living with dementia (PLWD). Family caregivers most frequently inflict this harm and are typically
remorseful for their behavior. This proposal will address this societal problem through a novel approach that
identifies care partners/caregivers (CPG) at primary care medical clinics, whether they are there for their own
care or that of the PLWD. During the project’s R61 phase, we will develop and test the feasibility of an evidence-
based brief Risk Assessment Screen (RAS) for use in primary care clinics to screen CPGs of PLWD. A 3-
component intervention will be developed and feasibility-tested. The first component will direct the CPG during
the clinic visit to a website specifically designed to engage them in solution-focused strategies. The second
component will provide 1-3 home or technology-assisted visits with a care navigator who provides person-
centered guidance to facilitate effective caregiving strategies and alerts CPGs to risks of EM. A third component
will educate the clinical care team to address caregiving needs directly with the CPG during the clinic visit and
schedule a follow-up visit within 2 months to monitor for change. We will develop an Outcome Tool that includes
a compilation of validated measures of modifiable risk factors known to be associated with EM by CPGs which
will be used to measure change in risk of EM over time. During the project’s R33 phase, the research team will
conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of the RAS and the 3-component
intervention. Primary care clinics across Los Angeles County will be randomized to one of the three study arms:
control, RAS only, or RAS plus intervention. Analyses will assess the impact of screening and the intervention
on participants’ level of risk of EM, as well as other outcomes at the level of the CPG and the PLWD. Additionally,
potential harms from the RAS and/or the intervention will be assessed. Finally, we will generate exploratory
qualitative data to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of risk and change that may result from our
application of the RAS and the intervention."
11163178,"For more than a decade, our work has focused on development of therapeutic interventions for viral- and
bacterial-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the more severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Significantly, we identified the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway as key to the host response to
influenza and secondary bacterial infection following influenza. We also identified High Mobility Group Box 1
(HMGB1), a host-derived “danger-associated molecular pattern” (DAMP), as a biomarker of disease severity for
multiple respiratory viruses and detected greatly elevated levels in sera from patients hospitalized for severe
influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Importantly, our data indicate that HMGB1 is a central mediator of
influenza-induced respiratory disease that acts by stimulating TLR4/MD-2 to elicit the potent inflammatory
response associated with ALI/ARDS. Therapeutic administration of TLR4 antagonists (e.g., Eritoran and many
others), as well as small molecule HMGB1 antagonists, mitigate the life-threatening pulmonary manifestations
of acute lung injury (ALI) and lethality in preclinical rodent models. The identification of these promising
therapeutic targets has led us to the central hypothesis that our findings may well be applicable to other ALI-
inducing agents. Indeed, since our earliest reports of the efficacy of the TLR4 antagonist, Eritoran, in influenza-
induced disease in both mice and cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus, a species uniquely susceptible to non-adapted
human viruses), this agent has been reported to blunt disease in animal models of Ebola virus and Dengue virus,
leading to a reduction in cytokine and chemokine production and reduced disease symptoms. Given the clinical
relevance of ALI and ARDS that has been exposed by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, and the striking similarities
between influenza- and SARS-Cov-2-induced ALI/ARDS caused by a cytokine storm leading to loss of
homeostasis and, ultimately, multiorgan failure and death, we propose, as the central goal of this phase I STTR,
to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of our newly developed, inflammation-inducible, adenoviral vector encoding
the HMGB1 antagonist, “HMGB1 Box A,” to ameliorate severe influenza-induced inflammation. We will test the
efficacy of our intervention in murine models of LPS-induced lung inflammation and mouse-adapted influenza
infection, and in cotton rats challenged with non-adapted human influenza strains for which we have correlated
HMGB1 levels with disease severity. We predict that our innovative strategy will provide a novel approach to
treatment of inflammatory lung disease that is mediated by multiple non-infectious and infectious agents that
cause ALI/ARDS."
11163792,"Cognitive deficits such as learning and memory impairments are common in people subjected to chronic
disturbance of the circadian cycle due to shift work, travel, or genetic dysregulation of the circadian clock.
Epidemiological studies have revealed a global rise in cognitive disorders with circadian disruptions comorbidity
such as depression, and Alzheimer’s disease, stressing the need to identify the causal relationship between
these phenomena. However, the molecular mechanisms linking the circadian cycle and cognitive performance
in health and disease remain largely unresolved. Neuronal synapses are the cellular basis for learning and
memory processes. Synapse number, activity, and expression levels of synaptic proteins show rhythmic time-
of-day-dependent changes, yet how these changes are regulated by the circadian clock is poorly understood. A
growing body of work supports a critical role for the glial cells, astrocytes in normal clock function. Astrocytes are
important synaptic regulators, and key for establishment and maintenance of memory and learning. Yet, how the
astrocytic clock regulates synaptic rhythmicity and related cognitive performance has not been thoroughly
examined. This critical gap in knowledge must be addressed in order to understand not only the fundamental
functions of the astrocytic clock, but also to characterize the regulatory mechanisms that control circadian
changes in synaptic levels. This application will define the role of astrocytic clocks in regulating synaptic
rhythmicity and subsequent learning and memory behaviors in three aims. Aim 1 investigates how the astrocytic
clock expressed in brain regions responsible for cognitive processes (e.g., cortex, and hippocampus; outside the
central clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)), affects time-of-day-dependent changes in synapses
and cognitive performance. Aim 2 investigates how the astrocytic clock is regulated by calcium activity to
influence synaptic rhythmicity. In Aim 3, we test the hypothesis that astrocyte-derived synapse-regulating factors
are rhythmically produced to facilitate time-of-day-dependent modulation of synapses. Successful completion of
these aims will uncover the role of astrocytic clock in regulating synaptic and cognitive rhythms, and reveal
strategies for future manipulation of synaptic rhythmicity through astrocyte-targeting, to restore clock-associated
cognitive deficits prevalent in neurological disorders."
11143965,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Black-White inequities in Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementia (ADRD) are a pressing public health
problem: prevalence is almost double for Black adults aged 65-84. ADRD is a leading cause of death in the
United States, affecting an estimated 5 million Americans. ADRD is a progressive disease impacting the parts
of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. Unlike heart disease and cancer, death rates from
ADRD are rising. ADRD prevalence is projected to decrease for White and increase for Black adults over time.
Higher education is a strong social determinant of lower ADRD risk. However, large Black-White inequities in
ADRD persist at the highest levels of education. Unfortunately, most nationally representative studies on ADRD
are comprised of White adults. To address this disparity, we must consider risk factors that impact Black
Americans uniquely as opposed to White experiences. Though structural racism is implicated as a fundamental
cause of higher education gaps, little is known about if, and to what extent, uniquely Black college experiences
influence ADRD risk in Black adults, specifically Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). HBCUs
are comprised of predominantly Black students (76%) and uplift Black individuals as well as Black communities
through economic and cultural empowerment, increased social and political capital, and neighborhood
revitalization and pride. Thus, early life exposure to HBCUs is a promising and unexplored mechanism that may
improve later-life ADRD outcomes and inequities for Black adults.
This K99/R00 study proposal leverages three large, well-established racially diverse national panel datasets to
investigate the impact of early life exposure to HBCUs on vascular risk factors of ADRD, late-life incidence of
ADRD, and all-cause mortality in Black adults; The Health and Retirement Study (HRS), Reasons for Geographic
and Racial Differences in Stroke study (REGARDS), and Project Talent. We will apply quasi-experimental
methods to evaluate the causal effects of (1) HBCU attendance and completion compared to a Predominantly
White Institution (PWI), (2) early life HBCU proximity compared to a PWI through educational attainment, and
(3) state and federal funding policy of HBCUs compared to PWIs during college-aged years.
The research plan is complemented by an exceptional multidisciplinary mentorship team at the University of
California San Francisco and training activities that build on the candidate’s background in racism-related
research by providing new training in (1) life course determinants of ADRD, (2) data harmonization, and (3)
causal effects of social and policy measures. The combined research and training plans will prepare the applicant
for a successful independent epidemiology research career specializing in the study of structural racism as a
social determinant of ADRD and inequities. This study aligns with NIA’s strategy for reducing health disparities
and harmonizing population data. Findings from this proposal will provide critical insight into our understanding
of uniquely Black college experiences as a source of cognitive resilience for Black adults.

11144012,"We previously showed that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) produced within the kidney is part of a
mechanism that regulates renal function and the blood pressure (BP) response to increases in dietary salt
intake. Our recent studies suggest that TNF effects in the kidney are evident in the medullary (m) thick
ascending limb (TAL), proximal tubule (PT), and cortical (c) TAL/macula densa (MD) regions of the nephron.
However, the cellular sources within the kidney that produce the TNF that accounts for these effects have not
been determined, nor have the molecular mechanisms been identified. Thus, we developed two mouse
models in which TNF has been genetically deleted in the: 1) TAL, and 2) distal nephron downstream of the PT,
which will be used to understand the role of TNF produced by renal epithelial cells as part of an emerging
intratubular TNF system that attenuates increases in BP induced by high salt (HS) intake. We also have
tailored a complementary approach, using PT- and TAL-specific TNF silencing lentivirus constructs, to
specifically inhibit TNF production by these cell types. The genetic and lentivirus approaches will be used in
tandem to determine the mechanism by which TNF regulates Na+-K+-2Cl- (NKCC2) phosphorylation and
isoform expression, renal function, and BP. Preliminary data suggest that TNF, via activation of TNF receptor
1 (TNFR1), inhibits phospho-NKCC2 (pNKCC2) expression by a mechanism involving activation of the
serine/threonine phosphatase, calcineurin (CN). The effects of TNF on CN have not been explored in the
kidney, thus experiments will address TNF-dependent increases in CN activity as well as expression of the
catalytic subunit CNAb and regulatory subunit CNB. The genetic and lentivirus strategies will be adapted to
determine the effects of salt intake on TNFR1-dependent CN-mediated inhibition of pNKCC2 expression,
electrolyte excretion, and the BP response to HS intake. The NKCC2A and NKCC2B isoforms are strategically
localized along the mammalian TAL and contribute to regulatory functions in response to high and low salt
conditions, respectively. TNF inhibits the expression of both isoforms suggesting a role for this cytokine in both
the mTAL and cTAL/MD segments of the TAL. We previously showed that in each instance, TNF regulates
renal function involving these isoforms in a manner that limits reabsorption of NaCl. However, the molecular
mechanism by which TNF suppresses both NKCC2A and NKCC2B mRNA in response to high and low salt
intake, respectively, has not been determined. Previous miRNA profiling of the TAL in combination with new
preliminary data have identified 3 candidate miRNAs that regulate NKCC2 isoform mRNA abundance. For
instance, miRNA-195 expression is induced by TNF derived from the TAL and inhibits NKCC2A mRNA
accumulation and pNKCC2 expression in mice ingesting HS. Collectively, the studies will define a novel
intratubular regulatory system in which TNF production by renal tubular epithelial cells, in response to
increases in salt intake, regulates NKCC2 isoform expression and function and contributes to BP homeostasis."

The goal of this competitive T32 renewal application is to continue a research training program that is
preparing postdoctoral physician and PhD fellows for careers as investigators addressing priority research
topics at the interface of geriatrics and palliative care. Funding is requested for 4 post-doctoral trainees per
year, the same number of trainees as in year 5 of the current T32 award. This T32 research training program
supports postdoctoral training for both physician-scientists and Ph.D.-scientists.
The primary impetus for the current T32 training program, and this requested competitive renewal, is the
urgent need for a pipeline of well-trained investigators positioned to advance the field of palliative care,
ultimately improving care for older adults with serious advanced illness. This T32-supported research training
program addresses a scientific knowledge and research workforce gap in aging and palliative care, namely, the
paucity of robust research evidence and a pipeline of investigators.
The initial funding period for this T32 focused on: 1) recruiting and retaining outstanding post-doctoral trainees;
2) supporting their research training through experiential and didactic instruction; 3) ensuring the highest level
of academic success through conscientious monitoring of thoughtfully constructed individual research career
development plans; and 4) enhancing the mentoring skills of junior mentors through co-mentoring with more
experienced senior mentors, expanding the cohort of senior mentors in palliative care research. These goals
remain at the heart of this program and are reflected in the organization and focus of this training grant.
The proposed competitive renewal builds on the demonstrated successes over the first funding period,
enhancing the existing approach through a refined curriculum that meets the identified and evolving needs of
the field and expanding the Program and Affiliated Faculty. Success in the initial 4 years of this T32 is
demonstrated by ability to: 1) fill positions with 7 outstanding trainees and foster an ongoing pipeline of trainee
candidates; 2) produce academically successful and productive trainees who are publishing peer-reviewed
manuscripts, presenting in national venues, obtaining intra- and extra-mural grant funding and attaining
research-focused faculty positions; 3) expand the cohort of research mentors by engaging more junior faculty
as co-mentors; and 4) enhance geriatric palliative care research capacity through deliberate and strategic
interactions amongst programs and faculty, bringing new skills and expertise to and engaging new senior
mentors in palliative care research. This T32 has, and with ongoing funding will continue to have, immediate
local, regional, and national influence by developing a cadre of skilled, productive researchers."

 In 2005, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)
established the Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network (CPCCRN) to support multi-institutional
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies in critically ill children. This PL1 proposal from the
University of Utah is submitted on behalf of a newly conﬁgured CPCCRN network increased to 12 Clinical Sites
and 12 ancillary sites with > 61,000 annual ICU admissions. The expanded network has geographic, racial/ethnic
and socioeconomic diversity, and will be a platform to develop additional investigators, especially young clinician
scientists. The network will conduct a highly innovative large-scale multi-center study of personalized, targeted
immune modulation in children with sepsis-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). The study
includes two concurrent, immunophenotype-driven placebo controlled RCTs that will address the central hypoth-
esis that individualized, pathophysiology-speciﬁc immunomodulation will improve outcomes from sepsis-induced
MODS in children. This study builds on R01-funded CPCCRN studies that have demonstrated the existence of
speciﬁc immune phenotypes among children with sepsis-induced MODS (R01GM108618 PI: Carcillo) and suc-
cessful reversal of immunosuppression by administration of the immunostimulant granulocyte macrophage-colony
stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (R01GM094203 PI: Hall). It also complements the ongoing NICHD R01-funded study
investigating the risk factors for immunoparalysis in pediatric MODS (R01HD095976 MPI: Hall, Zuppa).
 This application has three speciﬁc aims: (1) Implement the CPCCRN organization; (2) Mount a comprehen-
sive strategy for development of young clinician scientists and submission of rigorous proposals to fund additional
research in critical care; (3) Conduct the Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-induced MODS study. The
ﬁrst trial focuses on the use of the drug GM-CSF for the reversal of immunoparalysis. The second trial uses
adaptive randomization and focuses on the drugs anakinra and tocilizumab for the targeted treatment of hyper-
inﬂammation. The primary outcome of both trials will be duration and severity of organ dysfunction using the
cumulative PELOD-2 score, and secondary outcomes will assess health related quality of life and family function-
ing at 3 and 12 months.
 The Personalized Immunomodulation in Sepsis-Induced MODS study represents a paradigm shift in the man-
agement of pediatric sepsis, ﬁnally moving beyond simple supportive care. We are uniquely positioned to suc-
cessfully execute this approach to personalized, real-time, pathophysiology-directed sepsis treatment, leveraging
the strengths of a diverse and highly accomplished group of investigators to deliver high-impact science to the
beneﬁt of our patients and our ﬁeld."
11160201,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 In sexually reproducing species males and females have divergent morphologies, behaviors, and
reproductive strategies to reach their respective fitness optima while sharing a largely similar genome. These
differences can cause sexual conflict, wherein the presence of a particular trait can result in opposite fitness
effects in males and females. In intralocus sexual conflict (ISC) the presence of a single gene within a locus
can increase the fitness of one sex while decreasing the fitness of the other.
 There is widespread evidence of ISC occurring in many animals, including humans, and the presence
of sexual dimorphism suggests that some aspects of ISC can be resolved. While previous theoretical and gene
association studies have helped predict ISC and strategies for its mitigation, we still have little empirical
evidence of which genes are involved in ISC, their roles, and their direct impacts on sex-specific fitness in
evolution.
 Recently, our laboratory published the first direct evidence implicating new gene evolution through gene
duplication in the resolution of ISC. We found that a pair of recently duplicated genes in Drosophila had quickly
accumulated sequence changes and acquired essential, sex-specific functions in male and female
reproduction—supporting previous theoretical predictions. This was a groundbreaking finding as it suggests
that ISC resolution can drive new gene evolution. However, the generality of this single case study remains
unknown.
 The objective of this proposal is to define the generality of sexual conflict-driven new gene evolution.
I hypothesize that intralocus sexual conflict resolution can drive the evolution of new genes through rapid
acquisition of novel functions which contribute to sex-specific fitness. I will test my hypothesis in two major
Aims. First, I will use a CRISPR-Cas9-aided reverse genetic approach to assess the genetic necessity of 36
newly duplicated genes through sex-specific fitness assays. Thus far I have knocked out seven new genes and
found that loss-of-function mutations in three genes reduced the fertility of male or female flies, suggesting they
may have contributed to the resolution of an ancestral sexual conflict. Second, I will conduct a deeper
functional analysis on five genes examined in Aim 1, using RNA sequencing at both the tissue and single cell
levels, to identify pathways and cell types that require new gene functions in resolving sexual conflict. My
proposed research combines a CRISPR-Cas9-based reverse genetics approach with transcriptome profiling to
define the generality of ISC-driven new gene evolution and how these new genes facilitate sex-specific
functions to mediate or resolve sexual conflict."
11160202,"The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly exacerbated rising patterns of excessive alcohol consumption, particularly
in women. Binge alcohol drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol drinking and is associated
with increased risk of developing mood disorders and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Social support strongly
buffers against alcohol craving and relapse, yet many individuals display reduced valuation of social rewards
and/or deficits in the processing of social stimuli following alcohol exposure and subsequent abstinence. This
may compound interpersonal problems in people with AUD and limit their capacity to seek out or receive social
support. Therefore, understanding the neurobiological mechanisms mediating alcohol’s effects on social
behavior is required to inform future treatments aimed at enhancing social functioning and reducing relapse in
patients with AUD. Drinking in the Dark (DiD) is a robust paradigm for investigating the circuit and molecular
mechanisms of binge-like alcohol consumption on physiology and behavior in rodents. In addition, the 3-chamber
sociability model permits the interrogation of both social reward and social recognition behaviors following
alcohol consumption. Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor signaling in the lateral habenula (LHb)
has been implicated in the development of negative emotional states associated with abstinence from alcohol,
but the LHb remains highly understudied in the context of AUD. I recently found that DiD reduced social
recognition selectively in female mice during abstinence, and that genetic deletion of the LHb Gq-protein coupled
serotonin receptor 5HT2c partially prevented this effect. My preliminary data suggests that binge alcohol
consumption enhances the intrinsic excitability of LHb 5HT2c-containing neurons (LHb5HT2c) in the medial sub-
region, that 5-HT is released onto LHb5HT2c during social interaction, and that acute engagement of Gi signaling
in LHb5HT2c can normalize social deficits induced by alcohol. Moreover, DiD appears to modulate the expression
of multiple 5-HT receptor subtypes co-expressed in LHb5HT2c. Together, these data suggest that excessive
activation of LHb5HT2c via dysregulation of 5-HT receptor signaling may underlie social deficits induced by alcohol.
Using these preliminary findings as a foundation for the current proposal, I will 1) characterize how DiD alters
the translational and physiological landscape of LHb5HT2c projecting to the DRN (5HT2cLHb-DRN) and 2) investigate
the functional impact of genetic manipulation of 5-HT receptor sub-types in 5HT2cLHb-DRN on neuronal physiology
and DiD-induced dysregulation of social behavior. Together, these experiments will determine the effects of
binge alcohol drinking on molecular and physiological processes in 5HT2cLHb-DRN and identify novel mechanisms
by which these neurons promote social dysfunction during abstinence. Furthermore, this award will provide me
with valuable technical and professional training that will facilitate my transition to independence."
11144137,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cirrhosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among adults in the United States. Acute kidney injury
(AKI) is a common, expensive, and lethal complication of cirrhosis. The strongest predictor of AKI in cirrhosis
patients, regardless of etiology, is chronic kidney disease (CKD), as measured by estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR). Given that there is a rising incidence of both AKI and CKD in this population, there is a
developing critical need for clinical tools that identify cirrhosis patients at risk for AKI before its development.
This proposal’s three research aims address this need. Leveraging an ongoing cohort with >1000
decompensated cirrhosis patients with >2500 banked biospecimens, these aims will: (1) establish the
independent association between renal health biomarkers and AKI and compare the discrimination of novel
renal health biomarkers to serum creatinine (sCr) to predict AKI (Aim 1); develop and internally validate a
clinical risk tool to identify cirrhosis patients most vulnerable to AKI (Aim 2); explore the association between
longitudinal changes in renal health biomarkers on AKI reversibility (Aim 3).
I am a hepatologist specializing in liver transplantation at the University of California, San Francisco. Through a
pilot award provided by the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease, we have generated the
preliminary data needed for this application. These data, coupled with a strong foundation of hepatology and
nephrology research (Master of Advanced Studies in Clinical Research, >10 publications), have prepared me
for this proposal. However, there are several gaps in my training that this NIDDK K23 Career Development
Award will address (e.g., cohort development, advanced statistical techniques). Under the direct supervision of
a multidisciplinary team of leaders in nephrology (Hsu, Liu), hepatology (Lai), and biostatistics (McCulloch), I
will execute a detailed career development plan to accelerate my path toward 4 career goals outlined in this
proposal: (1) to develop a foundation of core nephrological principles; (2) to acquire analytic skills to validate
biomarker use; (3) to learn novel methodologies at risk prediction, including machine learning techniques; (4)
to expand a cohort and to apply methods of longitudinal data analysis. As part of my 5-year plan, I will actively
engage in coursework and structured tutorials in nephrology and biostatistics, and interdisciplinary
development and leadership programs. In addition, I will integrate myself into the nephrology research
community and establish a network of nephrology researchers for current and future collaboration.
RELEVANCE: Identifying a metric that captures which cirrhosis patients are at greatest risk for and least likely
to reverse from AKI has important clinical implications—it will allow for the implementation of interventions that
prevent the occurrence and halt the progression of a major driver of mortality in this population."

The duration and nature of humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) infection need to be better
understood. While most studies have focused on the immune response in patients with clinical illness,
little is known about the antibody response to CoV2 immediately after exposure and before the onset
of illness, especially in asymptomatic individuals. It is important to understand how this impacts long-
term immunological memory. This supplement aims to extend the objectives of the original grant to
address these gaps in our knowledge by prospectively following household contacts compared to
clinical cases of CoV2 to determine innate and adaptive immune events associated with early viral
exposure. We have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of samples from these patients, including
RNA sequencing of peripheral blood cells, proteomic analysis of oral secretions (the site of initial
CoV2 replication), measurement of viral load using N protein levels, and CoV2-specific IgA and IgG in
blood and saliva. We have identified innate and adaptive signatures associated with viral clearance
and among household contacts that may be associated with their failure to be infected or, if infected,
fail to develop clinical illness. We have identified CoV2 antigens, notably the N protein that is
expressed on CoV-2 infected cells, which are targets of ADCC. Antibodies generated by the N protein
can similarly kill infected cells with various variants of concern, suggesting a potential variant-
transcending target. We have also tracked the humoral immune response in a long-term cohort of
nursing home residents to the CoV-2 mRNA vaccine and subsequent booster responses. This
supplement will continue these ongoing studies and allow their completion."
11138176,"A Phenomics-First Resource (PFR) for interpretation of variants
Genomics is key to precision medicine; however, despite the ease of sequencing, clinical interpretation is still
thwarted because relevant data (disease, phenotype, and variant) is complex, heterogeneous, and
disaggregated across sources. Moreover, this evidence is sometimes incomplete, conflicting, and erroneous.
Consequently, clinicians face long lists of candidate diseases, genes, and countless variants of unknown
significance. This situation will not improve without capturing and harmonizing the underlying phenotypic
information; computability of this information is the bedrock for the emerging field of ​phenomics​. From basic
science to clinical care, communities need structured ways to represent and exchange phenotypes and
disease definitions. Addressing these fundamental phenomics needs makes it possible to computationally
assess and reveal links between diseases and variants. We have previously shown how the addition of
phenotypic information using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) can improve the diagnostic yield for
hard-to-diagnose patients, and HPO is therefore now a global standard for “deep phenotyping”. We have
demonstrated the applicability of deep phenotyping in the evaluation of rare diseases which have overlapping
mechanistic underpinnings with common/complex diseases as well as evolutionarily conserved mechanisms in
model organisms. Having coordinated the community and prototyped the underlying computational platforms,
we will now align both phenotype ontologies and clinical terminologies, enabling better comparison and
inference of phenotypes for improved diagnostic efficacy. We propose to develop a Phenomics-First
Resource (PFR). ​Specifically we will:
 1. Create a community-driven framework of interoperable phenotype definitions across species​ (uPheno)
 2. Harmonize human disease definitions with the ​MONDO​ disease alignment resource
 3. Create a community-wide exchange standard for clinical and model-organism phenotypes
(​Phenopackets​)
 4. Develop an integrated phenomics platform ​to provide the research ​(e.g. BioLink) and clinical (​FHIR​)
 communities with programmatic access to phenomics ontologies, data, and algorithms
The dynamic suite of interlinked technologies will together leverage community-developed knowledge in order
to make variant interpretation more reliable, better provenanced, and more clinically actionable."

The development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may be critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a
critical gap in knowledge is the lack of understanding of correlates of SARS-CoV-2 immunity in humans.
Our preliminary data suggest that antibodies correlate with protection following vaccination in nonhuman
primates and that unique antibody functional profiles appear to predict disease outcome in natural infection in
humans. Our data also point to a converging antibody profile, including both the antigen-binding domain driving
neutralization and Fe-mediated effector functions driving protective immunity. Another gap in knowledge is the
unknown durability of protective immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in humans.
Our preliminary data suggest that antibody titers may wane quickly following SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans,
but larger studies and longer follow-up are needed to define the kinetics of antibody responses in convalescent
individuals. Moreover, the durability of vaccine-elicited antibody responses remains to be determined.
We hypothesize that both convalescent and vaccinated humans will develop the functional antibody
signature that correlates with vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques.
We further hypothesize that vaccination will induce antibodies with greater durability than those induced
by natural infection and that an immunologic correlate of durability can be defined.
Specific Aim 1. Define the antibody profiles following SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination that correlate
with protection. We will dissect the functional antibody responses elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals
and in SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated individuals to provide insight into correlates of protection.
Specific Aim 2. Define the immunologic correlates of durability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses
following infection or vaccination. We will compare the durability of antibody responses induced in SARSCoV-2 infected and vaccinated individuals, and we will define an immunologic correlate of durability."
11145598,"Background
Eating disorders (EDs) likely affect a significant proportion of female and male Veterans; however, they remain
understudied and under-treated in VA. Individuals with EDs are likely to be high users of medical care, which is
at least partly due to the physical complications of EDs. Nonetheless, EDs often go undetected in general
medical settings, unless providers screen for them. Currently, the VA does not routinely screen for EDs; thus,
enhancing VA's capacity nationally to provide comprehensive care for Veterans with EDs is a priority area of
focus. This proposal will address four major gaps: the lack of prevalence estimates of EDs in nationally
representative samples of Veterans, the lack of knowledge of healthcare needs and preferences of Veterans
with EDs, the paucity of findings regarding military/Veteran-specific risk factors for EDs, the lack of a validated
screening measure for EDs in Veterans, and the lack of knowledge regarding Veteran preferences for ED
screening. These gaps are barriers to screening for and treating Veterans with EDs in VA healthcare.
Objectives
The specific aims are to establish a nationally representative cohort of male and female Veterans in order to: 1)
a) examine the prevalence of male and female Veterans reporting full and subthreshold EDs and b) to examine
the potential prevalence of EDs among vulnerable subgroups of Veterans; 2) to identify service use and needs
among male and female Veterans with full and subthreshold EDs; 3) to estimate models of risk and protective
factors for EDs, including military sexual trauma, combat trauma, and unit and family deployment support; and
4) to validate an existing screening measure of EDs in a Veteran sample and assess screening preferences.
Methods
In order to achieve these aims, we will recruit a nationally representative sample of 1500 male and female
Veterans. We will request that the VA/DoD Identity Repository (VADIR), a VA office with access to Department
of Defense records, assist in randomly selecting 3750 individuals from the national Veteran population. We will
stratify the sample based on race/ethnicity and oversample women to achieve a 1:1 ratio. We will mail a
comprehensive survey to potential participants using a multi-pronged, six-stage mailing strategy.
Participants will complete survey measures of ED symptoms, risk and protective factors, and VA and non-VA
healthcare service and needs. Aim 1: sample weighting procedures will be used in order to calculate nationally
representative prevalence estimates of EDs among male and female Veterans. Aim 2: Poisson regression will
be used to compare healthcare service use for Veterans with EDs to Veterans without EDs. In addition, we will
use descriptive statistics to report service use among male and female Veterans with full and subthreshold
EDs and which services, if available, they would like to use. Aim 3: structural equation modeling will be used to
estimate models of risk and protective factors for EDs. Aim 4: Receiver Operating Characteristic curves will be
used to estimate sensitivity and specificity of the ED screening measure, regression models will be used to
investigate criterion validity, and descriptive statistics will be used to describe Veteran screening preferences.
Dissemination Plan
We will share our findings with our Operational Partners on monthly workgroup calls and make
recommendations based on these results. Our findings regarding the scope of EDs among Veterans and their
healthcare use and preferences will be used to inform ongoing provider trainings in EDs. We also will
disseminate findings during Women's Health Cyberseminars and via newsletters such as the Women's Health
Roundup. We will develop clinician and executive briefs in order to disseminate findings to both clinicians and
policy-makers. Thus, our results will be summarized and disseminated to VA leadership in a timely manner.

 Prostate cancer (PCa), the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among men in the US,
disproportionally affects men of African American (AA) descent, who exhibit greater incidence, faster disease
progression and higher rate of mortality than men of European descent (EA). AA men are more likely to present
high-grade disease and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. The drivers of this disparity are multifactorial,
and include socioeconomic, lifestyle and biological factors. Current evidence suggests genetic alterations - such
as changes in oncogenic and tumor suppressive genes associated with PCa progression - and the presence of
a more inflammatory tumor microenvironment (TME) in prostate tumors from men of African descent as major
underlying causes of this racial disparity. However, there is still a limited understanding of the molecular
foundations behind the racial differences in PCa. Here, we identified the diacylglycerol-regulated kinase PKCa
as a potential contributor towards racial disparities in PCa. We found PKCa to be aberrantly overexpressed in
aggressive PCa cell lines as well as in human PCa. Interestingly, silencing PKCa expression from PCa cells
impairs their invasive capacity as well as its ability to form tumors in mice. An in-depth RNA-Seq transcriptome
analysis integrated with existing database inquires established PKCa as a crucial determinant for the expression
of cytokines known to be dysregulated in prostate tumors from AA men. Most remarkably, database analysis
suggests higher PKCa expression in AA relative to EA prostate tumors. This led us to hypothesize that excessive
activation of PKCa signaling may contribute to racial disparities in PCa. In Aim 1 we will take advantage of a
large collection of primary and metastatic human PCa tumors both from AA and EA men to test the hypothesis
that there is disproportionate PKCa expression and/or activation in AA PCa. We will establish potential
correlations with Gleason score, disease recurrence and metastatic disease in the available cohorts of AA and
EA prostate tumors. In Aim 2 we will use both genetically engineered (PKCa-null/TRAMP mice) and syngeneic
models (orthotopic implantation of TRAMP-derived PCa cells) towards the goal of establishing the in vivo
functional relevance of PKCa in prostate tumorigenesis and metastasis. We will authenticate the findings in vivo
using a pharmacological (PKCa inhibitor) approach. In Aim 3 we will determine the relevance of prostate cancer
cell PKCa in the control of the tumor immune landscape and gene expression. We will pursue a thorough
characterization of immune cell populations and cytokine expression in mouse prostate tumors upon inducible
silencing of PKCa. This will provide a comprehensive perspective on how tumor cell PKCa contributes to the
generation of a pro-inflammatory tumorigenic state and an immunosuppressive landscape that is a hallmark of
PCa in AA men. In addition to revealing a novel biomarker for PCa progression and potential therapeutic target,
our studies should provide exceptionally valuable information on the pathways leading to racial disparities in PCa
and help strategizing novel therapeutic avenues."
11169397,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a chronic debilitating condition that accounts for over half of all substance
abuse treatment cases in the United States. Most AUD patients relapse despite treatment. It is increasingly
recognized that deficits in avoidance learning are critically involved in motivating habitual and heavy alcohol
use. Specifically, due to alcohol’s anxiolytic and analgesic properties, many engage in drinking to avoid painful
physical and affective states. Paradoxically, chronic alcohol use is associated with increased pain reactivity
and decreased cognitive control. These changes reinforce compulsive drinking as a maladaptive avoidance
strategy and further compromise learning of its harmful consequences. Yet, the neural, physiological, and
psychological processes inter-relating avoidance learning dysfunction with the maintenance and relapse of
AUD remain poorly understood. This K99/R00 proposal addresses this critical gap in research.
 To this end, we propose to collect functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in treatment-
seeking AUD patients during a probabilistic learning task which features pain and reward. Our first aim is to
characterize dysfunctions of the brain circuits supporting pain reactivity and cognitive control during avoidance
learning in AUD patients, as compared to social drinkers. In the second aim, we will evaluate how the neural
markers, along with clinical, physiological and behavioral metrics, may be used to (1) diagnostically distinguish
clinical characteristics; and (2) model the key pathophysiological pathways that sustain habitual alcohol use. In
the third aim, we will identify the risk factors that best predict relapse during the 12-month follow-up, thus
offering clinical implications for improving treatment outcomes.
 The long-term goal of the candidate is to start an independent career in neuroscience research of
alcohol addiction. This proposed study will support this goal by serving as a launchpad for the candidate to
transition to an independent investigator. The candidate has trained extensively in cognitive neuroscience and
devoted himself to the field of addiction neuroscience. By conducting this study, the candidate will broaden his
training in the clinical and neurobiological investigation of AUD as well as gain expertise in machine learning
and Bayesian modeling. The candidate has identified his training needs and assembled a team of expert
mentors for this K99/R00 proposal. The training plan includes structured mentoring, supervised research,
formal coursework, presentations at scientific meetings, and professional development. The exceptional
research environment and intellectual resources at Yale University will allow the candidate to receive ample
guidance, learn novel techniques, and gain independence, while pursuing the research he is passionate about."
11169410,"Glycosylation is an essential biological pathway that involves the post- or co-translational addition of sugar
moieties to proteins. Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDGs) are rare developmental disorders caused by
inborn errors of metabolism in glycosylation pathways. CDGs lack good treatment options, and this is typically
due to poorly understood mechanisms and difficulty in establishing clinical trials in small patient populations. My
long-term objectives are to determine mechanisms of CDGs and identify new therapeutics for CDG patients.
One example is DPAGT1-CDG - a CDG caused by mutations in the gene DPAGT1 which encodes for the first
enzyme used in N-linked glycosylation. Recently, I identified many modifier genes which can be perturbed to
rescue a model of DPAGT1-CDG, but their mechanisms are not yet known. In Aim 1, I propose to determine the
mechanisms of these modifier genes using human cell culture in order to characterize new therapeutic targets
for this disorder. I will use a DPAGT1-CDG cell model to determine how these rescuing modifier genes affect
patient-related health metrics of proliferation, stress, and their glycoproteome. In Aim 2, to identify new drugs
that can rescue this disorder, I will use an in vivo Drosophila DPAGT1-CDG model to perform a repurposed drug
screen using 1,500+ small molecules (98% FDA/EMA-approved). Using an in vivo model will ensure these drugs
are safe during development, and this repurposed drug screen will help expedite the clinical trial process for new
CDG therapies. In Aim 3, I will characterize a new finding that suggests that genes underlying CDGs (""CDG
genes"") themselves represent an enriched set of modifier genes for treating CDGs. Perturbation of CDGs can
rescue models of DPAGT1-CDG, as well as a model of the most common CDG, PMM2-CDG. I will use RNA
interference to perturb all 150+ CDG genes to identify any that are capable of rescuing both DPAGT1- and
PMM2-CDG human cell models (with the same health metrics as in Aim 1). The discovery of new CDG gene
modifier genes capable of rescuing these models could have the potential to translate into future therapies for
many other CDGs. Finally, in Aim 4, I will synthesize the above Aims to test therapeutic drugs from Aim 2 in
human cell culture models and CDG modifier genes from Aim 3 in Drosophila models. I will use high-throughput
tools in cell culture and in vivo stress markers in Drosophila to determine the mechanisms of these new therapies.
This multi-species approach will ensure a better transition from preclinical models into therapies for patients. In
addition to the above, completion of this proposal will provide me with training to complete my career goals. I will
learn new techniques in cell culture and small molecule screens while also taking formal courses in mentorship
and writing. I have an outstanding mentor, co-mentor, and advisory committee consisting of faculty with expertise
in CDGs, cell culture, drug screening, genetics, and molecular biology. I also have state-of-the-art facilities and
staff at the University of Utah available to me. With my plan, committed faculty members, and excellent institution,
completing this proposal will help me successfully transition to an independent research career."

African Americans develop and die from SARS-CoV-2 infection more than any other racial group in the United
States, including in majority African American cities such as Flint, Michigan. SARS-CoV-2 disparities stem from
many interconnected causes. Yet, connections to inflammatory biological processes in COVID-19 disparities
remain largely unknown. Evaluating inflammatory responses can be facilitated by SARS-CoV-2 antibody
testing, which can be used to identify and compare inflammation among those with and without confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, and to conduct cross-race comparisons of inflammatory factors. However, African
Americans will be reluctant to partake in conventional antibody testing programs due to medical mistrust and
experiences with racism that are salient in the COVID-19 era. There is thus an urgent need to develop and
deploy culturally-relevant communication and antibody testing programs. Our long-term goal is to identify and
reduce unjust COVID-19 racial disparities. The immediate objective is to better encourage understanding and
uptake of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. The central hypothesis is that African-Americans will be receptive to
antibody testing when benefits and limitations are communicated in a culturally effective manner, and when
non-invasive salivary collection methods and assays are used. Our rationale is that combining culturally
effective health communication with salivary testing will reduce mistrust and promote uptake that can lead to
better grasping the role of inflammation in COVID-19 disparities. Our aims are to 1) develop and compare
effects of a general versus culturally-targeted video about antibody testing on African American and White Flint
residents’ antibody testing attitudes and uptake; 2) identify and compare effects of a general versus culturally-
targeted video on activation of medical mistrust and racism-related cognition among African Americans when
considering antibody testing; 3) measure and identify multi-analyte inflammatory biomarker profiles among Flint
Registry enrollees who complete salivary antibody testing and compare inflammatory biomarker profiles by
race and antibody status. In collaboration with clinical and community partners, we will prepare and evaluate
general and culturally-targeted video tutorials about SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. These brief videos will be
distributed to the Flint community through the Flint Registry – a highly visible local health resource exchange.
In collaboration with leading salivary bioscience experts, we will furnish an opportunity to engage in at-home
salivary antibody screening – a non-invasive route to antibody testing that is highly suited to disparities-
oriented COVID-19 research. The proposed research is innovative and significant in highlighting that culturally-
targeted communication and non-invasive antibody testing are vital to propelling disparities-oriented

Advanced neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by choroidal
neovascularization (CNV), in which neovessels originating from the choroid invade the macula. CNV causes
permanent central blindness if left untreated and is the most sight-threatening pathology of AMD. The present
application will investigate the efficacy and regulatory mechanisms for a new class of CNV therapeutics. We
have identified in our preliminary data that ketone bodies suppress CNV and hypothesize that this effect is
regulated by macrophage and/or microglia reprogramming, which results in protective inflammation and/or
suppression of pathological inflammation. We will refute or validate this hypothesis in three Specific Aims. In
Aim 1, we will determine the therapeutic effects of ketone metabolites and their potential synergistic effect with
anti-VEGF therapies, the current standard of care for CNV. We will also determine whether the anti-angiogenic
effects of ketone metabolites are regulated by direct effects on endothelial cells or ketone-induced immune cell
phenotypic changes using co-culture models. In Aim 2, we will identify whether ketone bodies suppress CNV
via microglia, macrophages recruited from the circulation, or both. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of the
ketone body receptor, G Protein-coupled receptor 109a (Gpr109a) in phenotypic reprogramming of specific
immune cell subpopulations."

This application is in response to RFA-DK-20-003, which is a limited competition opportunity with the objective
of establishing the Liver Cirrhosis Network (LCN). Cirrhosis has doubled in prevalence in the last decade and is
now the 11th leading cause of death in the United States. The number of cirrhosis-related deaths is projected to
triple by 2030, with NASH projected to overtake HCV as the leading cause of liver transplantations. Severe limits
on the number of liver transplantations performed each year and anticipated increases in the cirrhosis patient
population create an urgent need to better understand predictors of mortality in cirrhosis and develop effective
therapies to treat cirrhosis. Studies from our group and others suggest statins may reduce future risk of HCC
and decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. Among statins, lipophilic statins such as atorvastatin have shown
the greatest chemopreventive effects against HCC occurrence. Atorvastatin is associated with dose-dependent
reduction in incident cirrhosis in HCV patients. Data supporting statin use for cirrhosis are promising, but larger,
randomized controlled trials (RCT) are needed to determine whether they may be routinely recommended. To
address the needs of the cirrhosis patient population, this research plan proposes the following aims: Aim 1: To
conduct a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter, multi-ethnic cohort study of patients with cirrhosis.
Among Hispanic men, cirrhosis is the 6th leading cause of mortality. To address this health disparity, we will test
the hypothesis that Hispanic patients with cirrhosis are at higher risk for hepatic decompensation compared to
non-Hispanics. We will establish and monitor a cohort of patients who have cirrhosis due to multiple etiologies.
Primary endpoints include (a) a composite endpoint of hepatic decompensation, (b) liver transplantation, or (c)
all–cause mortality. Ancillary studies will investigate associations between non-invasive imaging biomarkers,
cirrhosis genetic risk score, and risk of decompensation. Following up on our previous work, we will also identify
a microbiome signature that may predict decompensation risk. Aim 2: Phase 2, multi-center, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, RCT evaluating efficacy and safety of atorvastatin 20 mg in subjects with
compensated cirrhosis. The objective is to test the hypothesis that atorvastatin is more effective than placebo
in reducing risk of decompensation, all-cause mortality and other liver-related clinical outcomes in cirrhosis
patients. Primary outcome measure will be time to the first occurrence of any of the following adjudicated events:
all-cause mortality, MELD score ≥ 15, liver transplant, ascites requiring medical intervention, hospitalization for
onset of variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and development of
hepatocellular carcinoma. Secondary outcomes include safety of atorvastatin, decrease in fibrosis, as measured
by NITs and imaging biomarkers, and major adverse cardiovascular events. Exploratory analyses will investigate
associations between treatment response and (a) delta MRE and VCTE, (b) genetic risk factors, and (c) changes
in the gut microbiome."

The Parent Grant, Hyperpolarized MRI Technology Resource Center (HMTRC; P41 EB013598; 2011-2027),
aims to develop and disseminate optimal new HP 13C MR technologies with requisite training/documentation to
advance significantly this emerging molecular imaging method. From the HP 13C MRI studies done to date, it is
clear that HP 13C MR has outstanding research and clinical value, but also that all aspects of this technology
(instrumentation, agent chemistry, DNP/dissolution methodology, MR acquisition, and data analysis) require
specialized development to realize their full potential. Specialized C-13 MR phantom development has been a
critical component of this P41 for HP technology development & testing. We believe that this supplement project
fits the NOSI eligibility: “Parent grants that develop and use phantoms as part of their original scientific aims may
be eligible for the supplemental funding under this NOSI. If the supplement proposes to include and perform
additional steps but are needed to make the phantoms ready for dissemination. Applicants may propose to
perform tasks along the optimization, validation, and calibration pipeline”.
This supplement for optimizing, calibrating and disseminating C-13 MRI phantoms will benefit this NCBIB’s
Dissemination & Training aspects and the TRD’s, and especially TRD1 that is responsible for “beyond state-of-
the-art” polarizer and MRI hardware technologies for all HP 13C MRI studies performed & supported by this P41
Center’s TRDs, CPs and SPs. This TRD has been highly successful in developing novel technologies with 13C-
phantom testing for HP MRI driving first-ever HP 13C studies in humans at 15 sites to date & expect 50+ by 2
years. We have found that unlike many MRI phantoms that are spherical or cylindrical with non-homogeneous
internal structures, the most-useful HP C-13 phantoms currently are shaped like human anatomy and filled with
a uniform solution with C-13 signals and doped to match human loading and MR relaxation times. The new
phantom technology resources will be optimized & disseminated for use by the HP C-13 MRI community with
feedback on performance, quality, and ease of dissemination. New MR hardware developments including these
optimized phantoms are driven by the research needs of CPs together with TRDs2&3. TRD1 develops novel 13C
RF exciters and detectors that require specialized phantom testing and also for the TRD3 development and
testing of new methods for data reconstruction, visualization and analysis. These 13C MR phantoms, mimicking
human anatomy, have been critical for testing coil & acquisition technology developments, driven by the CPs for
metabolic imaging of brain cancer, abdominal/pelvic cancer, liver disease, and brain disorders. The major focus
of this supplement project will be on optimizing our specialized HP C-13 phantoms for dissemination to advance
HP 13C-MRI developments, benefit multi-site trials, and the training of new intra- & extramural investigators."

Alcohol consumption and mortality due to alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) are increasing in the United
States, and ALD is now the leading cause of liver transplantation. The natural history of ALD is distinct from
other etiologies of liver disease, with more advanced disease at the time of presentation but also opportunity
for hepatic recovery. Accurate prediction of outcome remains challenging. The proposed research will establish
a prospective registry and biorepository that will evaluate the outcomes of patients with ALD and alcohol use
disorder who are hospitalized with acute hepatic decompensation. This study will take a multifaceted approach,
considering the biologic and psychosocial influences on clinical outcomes. Patients will be recruited during
hospitalization and followed for 2 years in the outpatient clinics, with longitudinal measures of alcohol use
patterns, serum biomarkers, radiographic features, nutrition, frailty/sarcopenia, and non-invasive assessments
of fibrosis, inflammation, and steatosis. Specific Aims: (1) Characterize the cohort and optimize retention
procedures using frequent communication, collateral contacts, and technology-based resources, (2) Identify
distinct trajectories of ALD using latent class trajectory analysis and the predictors of trajectory classification,
and (3) Develop a patient-specific risk prediction model to predict hepatic recovery after an acute hepatic
decompensation. These project aims will identify distinct phenotypes and predictors of outcome in ALD and
improve prognostication to better target interventions and allocate resources. The principal investigator (PI) is a
hepatologist and clinical researcher at Stanford University, with a long-term vision of improving care for
patients with ALD. Her experience with outcomes research and her Master’s in Clinical Research and
Epidemiology have prepared her well to execute the project aims. The proposed research and career
development plan are well-supported by a multi-disciplinary mentorship team and the institution. The PI will
acquire advanced skills in longitudinal data analysis and machine learning, as well as content expertise in
alcohol research, which will allow her to apply advanced statistical techniques to optimize prediction of
outcome in ALD in a clinically relevant context. In addition, she will have a well-characterized ALD registry and
biorepository to serve as a platform for future translational and multicenter studies. This award will provide the
PI with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to develop an independent research
career in ALD and improve our understanding of this serious and prevalent condition."

Arsenic contamination of food and drinking water is a serious global health issue in the U.S. and worldwide.
Arsenical skin lesions are a common and early sign of arsenic toxicity, but exposure to arsenic is also
associated with risk for various types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, non-malignant respiratory disease,
and shortened life span. A major focus of epidemiological research on arsenic exposure has been
understanding genetic susceptibility to arsenic toxicity. Genetic studies have discovered roles for both
inherited variation (e.g., AS3MT variants) as well as dynamic features of the genome (i.e., telomere length) in
susceptibility to arsenic toxicity and response to exposure. Additional research is needed to fully understand
these gene-environment relationships. The last decade of research on genetic susceptibility to disease in
humans has clearly demonstrated that large studies with genome-wide measurement are highly likely to deliver
discoveries that are re-producible. Thus, we propose creating a large genomic data resource in the context of
an epidemiological study of arsenic exposure in rural Bangladesh. We will use this resource to identify the
features of the human genome that reflect susceptibility or response to arsenic exposure. Our first goal is to
extend our ongoing work on the genetics of arsenic metabolism efficiency (AME) and GxE (gene-by-
environment interaction) to identify inherited variants that influence arsenic metabolism or arsenic toxicity.
Under this goal, we will investigate the biological mechanisms of arsenic-related variants and evaluate the
utility genetic information for exposure reduction. Achieving this goal will entail activities such as genome-wide
association and heritability studies of AME and arsenical skin lesion risk, genome-wide searches for GxE,
estimating the effects of SNPs on arsenic-related health outcomes, and evaluating the impact of returning
genetic results to participants on exposure-related behaviors. Our second goal is to extend or our work on
arsenic and telomere length to identify additional dynamic features of the genome that reflect biological
response to arsenic or susceptibility to arsenic toxicity. Achieving this goal will entail testing numerous
genomic features for association with arsenic exposure and arsenical skin lesion status, including somatic
chromosomal losses and point mutations, DNA methylation, epigenetic aging, and mitochondrial DNA mutation
and copy number. If successful, this project will provide novel biomarkers of susceptibility and toxicity as well
as biomarkers of the biological effects of arsenic exposure. The biomarkers identified will provide information
useful for (1) identifying subgroups of highly susceptible individuals, (2) understanding biological mechanisms
underlying susceptibility and toxicity, and (3) motivating susceptible individuals to reduce their exposure.
Furthermore, we will continue developing technologies for targeted measurement of copy number variable
regions for large scale epidemiological and environmental health research. This work has the potential to have
transformative impact not only on knowledge, but also on both global and local environmental health."

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) has been linked to an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However,
its potential implications in various age-related conditions, particularly neurodegenerative diseases, remain
insufficiently explored. Recent research has highlighted the protective effect of clonal hematopoiesis of
indeterminate potential (CHIP) against Alzheimer's disease (AD), emphasizing the need for further investigation
into CH's role across a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, the involvement of CH in other
neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ALS/FTD), has not been comprehensively
investigated. Additionally, the distinct implications of other types of CH, including autosomal mosaic
chromosomal alteration (mCA) and loss of the Y chromosome (LOY), on these diseases have yet to be
thoroughly examined. To fill this knowledge gap, this project will unravel the disentanglement of commonalities
and disparities in associations between different CH types and neurodegenerative diseases by leverage a large
amount of high-throughput sequencing data of AD, PD, DLB, and ALT/FTD. Moreover, this project will gain
insight into the underlying mechanisms of its potential varying effects of CH across the diseases by utilizing
extensive functional genomics data. To this end, this project has three specific aims. In aim 1, we will uncover
the associations of different CH types with neurodegenerative diseases by leveraging whole-genome sequencing
data from multiple cohorts. We will also perform Mendelian randomization to support causal associations
between CH and neurodegenerative diseases. In aim 2, we will characterize inter-individual transcriptomic
variability in individuals with and without CH across central nervous system tissues and myeloid cells by
leveraging previously published data, including bulk, sorted, and single-nuclei RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), as well as
assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq), from disease cohorts. We will also
perform cell type-specific transcriptome and chromatin accessibility characterization by detecting cells with
autosomal mCA and LOY from snRNA-seq/ ATAC-seq. In aim 3, we will employ two innovative experimental
approaches: (1) snRNA-seq paired with genotyping of transcriptome (GoT) and (2) iPSC-derived human
microglia-like cells (iMGL) to delve into the cell type-specific functional impacts of CHIP. Aim 3 will significantly
complement Aim2 since cell type-specific characterization of CHIP is challenging unlike autosomal mCA and
LOY. Our preliminary results suggest varying effects of CHIP and LOY on the risk of different neurodegenerative
diseases and functional impact of LOY, especially highlighted in microglia. These findings validate and motivate
our work plan, driving us to pursue further studies in this project. The comprehensive understanding of CH's role
in neurodegenerative diseases achieved through this project will make significant contributions to the discovery
of novel treatment options and the discovery of biomarkers for predicting the risk or progression of these diseases."
11142157,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Quantitative dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) MRI metrics such as tissue perfusion rates, kinetic
parameters, extravascular volume, and plasma volume allow characterization of subtle differences in tissue
states related to ischemia, vascularity, inflammation, and fibrosis in neurological and cardiovascular diseases,
and in cancers such as pancreatic adenocardinoma (PDAC). The reproducible nature of quantitative imaging
makes it more suitable for multi-center or longitudinal studies than conventional “qualitative” imaging.
Quantitative DCE metrics have been shown to be important for risk assessment, early detection, staging,
characterization, and treatment monitoring of PDAC and other diseases.
 DCE MRI performs imaging before, during, and after injection of a gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent.
There are several major challenges, especially in moving organs: i) cardiac motion must be dealt with for heart
scans, generally by syncing acquisition with an ECG signal, leading to difficulty in arrhythmia patients as well
as low imaging efficiency and challenges for whole-heart 3D imaging; ii) respiratory motion must be dealt with,
typically by patient breath-holding; iii) safety questions surrounding Gd contrast agents lower the benefit-to-risk
ratio in many situations.
 The objective of this project is to develop low-dose, motion-resolved, quantitative dynamic contrast
enhanced (DCE) MRI for PDAC. This will be accomplished by developing and validating the MR multitasking
framework for multi-dynamic, highly time-resolved T1 mapping, and correlating MRI measurements to histology
in patients undergoing surgical resection. Multitasking designs DCE MRI around the concept of images as
functions of multiple time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1,
DCE). It integrates machine learning, low-rank tensor modeling, compressed sensing, and deep learning to
extract reproducible, quantitative measurements from 6D DCE images, even under free-breathing conditions.
The resulting technology would be a powerful tool for quantitative MRI tissue characterization in moving
organs, and would be promising as a tool for monitoring neoadjuvant therapies prior to pancreatic resection."
11143538,"The most prevalent primary brain tumor, glioblastoma, ranks among the most lethal of human cancers.
The brain tumor microenvironment (TME) is thought to play a critical role during tumor development and
treatment resistance. Unlike many other solid tumors, the glioblastoma TME is dominated by macrophages and
microglia—collectively known as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs are plastic in nature and can
polarize toward pro-inflammatory or immunosuppressive states. Many lines of evidence suggest that
immunosuppressive TAMs dominate the brain tumor microenvironment, which fosters tumor development,
contributes to tumor aggressiveness, and impedes the therapeutic effect of various treatment regimens. Through
the development of new therapeutic strategies, TAMs can potentially be shifted towards a proinflammatory state
to enhance anti-tumor immunity. The promise of TAM-targeted therapy has not yet been realized, due in part to
a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TAM behavior and function. My postdoctoral
work has elucidated novel mechanisms that govern the polarization of TAMs in the glioblastoma TME. Notably,
my preliminary data suggests that targeting the CARD9/BCL10/MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex represents a
promising therapeutic approach to shifting the glioblastoma TAM phenotype to favor anti-tumor immunity.
 The overall objectives of this application are to determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate TAM
immunoreactivity in glioblastoma and to utilize this information to inform the development of new and effective
therapeutic interventions to improve treatment outcomes. My central hypothesis is that CBM activation within
TAMs is required for glioblastoma-induced TAM polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype and this
CBM-dependent TAM polarization facilitates tumor growth, progression, and resistance to therapy. I first propose
to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which glioblastoma cells communicate with TAMs to drive CBM
activation (Aim 1). Second, I will evaluate how CBM activity within TAMs influences TAM function (Aim 2).
Finally, during the R00 phase of this proposal I will investigate how inhibiting the CARD9-CBM complex in TAMs
in vivo affects glioblastoma tumor progression and responsiveness to standard therapies (Aim 3). Collectively,
these studies will advance our understanding of the mechanisms governing the brain tumor immune
microenvironment of glioblastoma and inform the development of new approaches to manipulating this immune
microenvironment to improve treatment outcomes for glioblastoma. During the mentored K99 phase of this
award, I will greatly benefit from the expert mentoring world-class research resources available at Mayo Clinic
and the University of Pittsburgh. Completing the proposed project will allow me to build a strong scientific
foundation and then lead an innovative research program as an independent investigator. Overall, the K99/R00
award will be an indispensable support for my timely transition to a successful career as a multifaceted, cross-
disciplinary investigator in neuro-oncology."
11145429,"Project Summary
 At the heart of angiogenesis and biomaterial vascularization lies the inflammatory response, orchestrated
primarily by macrophages, which dramatically shift phenotype over time in response to microenvironmental cues.
In the normal response to injury, macrophages are initially pro-inflammatory (aka M1), and at later stages they
are replaced by a mixed population referred to collectively as M2 that upregulate factors associated with
resolution of the wound healing process. The extent of the diversity of this M2 population in particular is not
known. At later stages of angiogenesis and biomaterial vascularization, M2 macrophages are generated 1) via
transition from M1 macrophages, or 2) from direct differentiation of newly arriving monocytes. The differences
between the M2 macrophages arising from each population have not been investigated. Preliminary data
suggest that M1-derived M2 macrophages possess enhanced angiogenic functionality, and that biomaterials
that transiently stimulate the initial M1 phase may enhance the subsequent response to M2-promoting
biomaterials to achieve enhanced vascularization and healing. The overarching hypothesis of this project is that
biomaterials that promote sequential M1 and M2 activation of the same population of macrophages will enhance
vascularization. To test this hypothesis, this work has the following goals: 1) Determine the effects of M1 pre-
polarization on the functional phenotype of M2 macrophages in crosstalk with blood vessels in vitro, using
primary human macrophages, gene and protein expression profiling, and tissue-engineered models of
angiogenesis. 2) Determine the effects of pro-inflammatory pre-treatment on the regenerative effects of IL4-
releasing biomaterials in vivo, using biomaterials that temporally control the phenotype of host macrophages in
a murine hindlimb ischemia model. 3) Determine the angiogenic effects in vivo of a biomaterial-mediated
macrophage cell therapy strategy that intracellularly directs a single population of macrophages from M1 to M2.
This latter strategy may result in particularly beneficial biomaterials for patients who suffer from impaired
leukocyte trafficking, including patients with diabetes, autoimmune disease, or those undergoing
chemotherapeutic treatment for cancer. This work will advance our understanding of how biomaterials can be
designed to leverage both the inflammatory and regenerative functions of macrophages to enhance
angiogenesis, which will allow us to develop new strategies to treat numerous diseases characterized by
pathological angiogenesis, including heart and brain ischemia, atherosclerosis, and diabetes, among many
others. In addition, this project proposes a novel approach to direct tissue revascularization by controlling the
actions of both recruited and exogenously administered macrophages using biomaterials."
11145599,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a highly morbid cardiopulmonary disease characterized by an
obliterative vasculopathy involving distal pulmonary arterials that promotes right heart failure. Complex and
integrated pathobiological signaling pathways drive vascular remodeling in PAH: the arteriopathy includes
numerous endophenotypes (i.e., specific features, such as fibrosis, cellular proliferation, others) that occur to
differing extent across patients. Wide variability in the proteomic and genetic profile is also observed in PAH,
which accounts for phenotypic heterogeneity and inconsistent clinical response to drug therapies reported in
clinical trials and at point-of-care. Overall, these observations suggest that opportunity exists to improve clinical
outcome by individualizing the pathobiology-clinical phenotype relationship. Nonetheless, precision medicine in
PAH remains unrealized, which we postulate is due to limitations inherent in conventional analytical methods
that average biological data and overlook functionally important signaling pathways.
 Work from our laboratory and others has demonstrated the importance of studying functionally significant
signaling pathways using network medicine to discover novel and modifiable therapeutic targets in PAH. This
approach differs from classic reductionist methods that infer functionality based on transcript or protein quantity
alone, which may erroneously implicate molecular bystanders in the pathogenesis of disease. However we have
innovated a precision-based network medicine strategy that generates patient-specific protein-protein interaction
(PPI) networks (e.g., patient-level molecular wiring map). Our approach unmasks molecular interactions that
distinguish (and group together) individual patients with the same clinical phenotype. We present novel
preliminary data in the accompanying application to support the central hypothesis: Developing patient-
specific PPI networks will personalize clinical phenotyping and optimize prognosis in PAH. Our findings
will also clarify the relationship between PAH genetic risk and pathobiology on an individual-patient level, and
inform rationale and personalized drug selection using the PPI networks. To test our hypothesis, we will leverage
a rich dataset from the United Kingdom PAH Phenome Biobank. This dataset includes comprehensive
proteomic, genomic, clinical, and outcome data across two timepoints (1 yr apart) for idiopathic PAH, hereditary
PAH, asymptomatic family members of patients with PAH, including three patients that developed PAH during
the study, and healthy volunteer controls (N=500 total). The Aims are: (1) Profile patient-specific PPI networks
using proteomic and genetic data, and analyze temporal differences in network features by patient group, (2)
Develop, test, and validate a network score that informs phenotype and outcome of individual PAH patients. As
an exploratory aim, we will use the PPI networks to predict patient-specific drug therapies. Overall, findings from
this project will advance precision medicine in PAH with direct relevance to the clinical management of patients."

11160216,"Project Summary/Abstract
The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop the skills required to achieve my career goal of becoming an
independent investigator with a research focus on the role of blood coagulation factors in cell signaling during
tissue injury and inflammation. Accordingly, I have developed a Research Plan that will build a strong foundation
for conducting research across disciplines in hepatology, toxicology, and thrombosis and hemostasis. Strong
clinical and experimental evidence suggests that the blood coagulation cascade plays a pathologic role in the
progression of hepatic fibrosis, i.e., “scarring” of the chronically injured liver. One hypothesis linking coagulation
activity to hepatic fibrosis proposes that the coagulation protease thrombin drives hepatic stellate cells (HSCs)
to a collagen-expressing myofibroblast phenotype by activating its primary receptor, protease-activated receptor-
1 (PAR-1). However, the precise mechanisms linking PAR-1 activation to the HSC pro-fibrotic phenotype are
unknown. My central hypothesis is that thrombin activation of PAR-1 drives HSCs to a pro-fibrotic phenotype by
amplifying the signaling functions of tissue factor (TF), the transmembrane receptor for coagulation factor VIIa
(FVIIa). To test this hypothesis, I propose three Specific Aims. First, I will determine the mechanisms whereby
PAR-1 activation drives a pro-fibrotic phenotype in hepatic stellate cells. I hypothesize that PAR-1 activation
amplifies the HSC pro-fibrotic phenotype through induction of TF:FVIIa signaling. The role of TF:FVIIa signaling
in PAR-1-mediated HSC activation will be determined using a combination of in vitro approaches including
exogenous FVIIa treatment and HSCs lacking TF or PAR-2 (i.e., the receptor mediating TF:FVIIa signaling). The
role of HSC TF in experimental hepatic fibrosis will be determined using novel mice with HSC-specific TF
deficiency. Next, I will determine the role of thrombin:PAR-1 signaling in experimental hepatic fibrosis. The
precise role of thrombin-mediated PAR-1 activation in hepatic fibrosis has never been investigated in vivo
because PAR-1 can be cleaved by multiple proteases. I hypothesize that activation of PAR-1 by thrombin drives
experimental hepatic fibrosis. To test this hypothesis, I will use a combination of strategies including mice
expressing ~10% of normal prothrombin levels and novel mutant mice expressing PAR-1 that is selectively
insensitive to cleavage at specific residues by thrombin or by other agonist proteases. Finally, I will identify the
mechanisms driving coagulation activation in the injured liver. I hypothesize that coagulation activation in
experimental CCl4-induced chronic liver injury is driven by the intrinsic coagulation pathway. I will use
complementary genetic and pharmacologic approaches to determine the precise role of the extrinsic and intrinsic
pathways of coagulation cascade activation in hepatic fibrosis driven by experimental chronic liver injury. The
proposed studies will allow me to carve out a unique research niche investigating the cell signaling functions of
blood coagulation factors, and would ultimately drive development of novel therapeutics which target local
coagulation-mediated cell signaling events to reduce hepatic fibrosis with minimal impact on normal hemostasis."
11160901,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alcohol is the most commonly used and abused drug among youth in the US; prevalence of alcohol use is
disproportionately higher among sexual minority youth (SMY) than among their heterosexual peers, especially
among those at the intersections of multiple marginalized identities. Alcohol use and abuse are associated with
a multiplicity of short and long-term negative health outcomes, including HIV vulnerabilities, alcohol and other
substance use dependence, neurocognitive deficiencies, and psychological distress. Despite the fact that
alcohol use and abuse during adolescence has important consequences for downstream health outcomes and
adult patterns of substance use, the majority of research among sexual minorities to date has focused on
college-aged populations. This gap in research with SMY is critical to rectify, particularly for SMY who
experience multiple, intersecting forms of marginalization based on sex, race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation.
Building on our team’s prior work in this area, we propose to use pooled data from the Local Youth Risk
Behavior Survey (YRBS), a national biennial survey of high school students that assesses sexual identity and
behavior, as well as health behaviors including alcohol use, HIV vulnerability, and mental health. Our uniquely
large dataset, which currently contains data from 2005 to 2019 (253 jurisdiction-years) and 950,295 high
school youth, will expand to include 2021, 2023, and 2025 data, resulting in an estimated 1,668,078 youth.
This will allow us to apply an array of complex epidemiologic approaches to assess the impact of alcohol use
on the sexual, mental, and physical health of SMY living in the US, and the disparities that exist between
multiply marginalized SMY and their peers. This proposal is a natural extension of our prior work (R01
AA024409) that resulted in numerous publications in high-impact peer-reviewed journals (e.g., Pediatrics,
American Journal of Public Health) and a diverse array of interdisciplinary collaborations. The current proposal
will continue these successes, incorporating an intersectional lens as well as additional advanced methods of
inquiry, including use of multilevel modeling to determine jurisdictional and temporal associations with alcohol
use and disparities in HIV risk; latent class analysis to describe alcohol use classes and their association with
minority status; and the impact of regional, school, and structural level factors that influence alcohol use and its
role in increased HIV vulnerability among diverse SMY. These approaches will allow us to continue identifying
critical pathways for intervention to ensure equitable health outcomes and minimize the risks associated with
alcohol use and abuse among notably vulnerable populations of youth."
11160910,"Elder mistreatment (EM) is commonly defined as an intentional act, or failure to act, by a caregiver or another person in a relationship involving an expectation of trust that causes harm or creates a risk of harm to an older adult. EM may be intentional or unintentional and includes financial exploitation, neglect, emotional/psychological abuse, physical abuse, and sexual abuse. This is concerning as there is an estimated 11% annual prevalence among cognitively intact older adults, and a 30-75% annual prevalence among older adults with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias AD/ADRD. Further, EM is linked with increased risk of poor quality of life, loss of property and security, physical injury, hospitalizations, emergency room visits, psychological distress, morbidity, and early mortality. Nevertheless, EM is difficult to detect and often goes unrecognized. Effective and efficient EM screening tools are urgently needed to improve early detection efforts. This proposal will address this need by adapting an evidence-based EM screening tool for home-based primary care and rigorously evaluating its potential harms and benefits. In direct response to RFA-AG-22-024, we propose stage IA research (R61 phase) to adapt the DETECT screening tool for home-based primary care — with special emphasis on older adults who were recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer's disease-related dementias AD/ADRD — The DETECT Revision for Primary Care (DETECT-RPC). We also propose a stage III multi-site randomized (at the provider level) controlled efficacy trial (R33 phase) of DETECT-RPC. The specific aims of the R61 phase of the proposed project are: (1) Evaluate the potential impact of state-specific laws and site-specific policies on the reporting guidance that will be provided by the DETECT-PRC tool (mixed-methods); (2) Investigate provider-level barriers to recognizing and reporting EM in home-based primary care environments (qualitative - structured interviews, focus groups); and, (3) Adapt the DETECT screening tool for home-based primary care (qualitative - structured interviews, focus groups). The specific aims of the R33 phase of the proposed project are: (1) Rigorously evaluate the effect of DETECT-RPC on targeted mechanisms of action (i.e., current barriers to identification and reporting) elucidated in the R61 phase of the study (mixed-methods); (2) Rigorously evaluate the impact of DETECT-RPC on clinician identification and reporting of older adults with increased risk of EM to the appropriate authorities (RFA key question KQ3); and, (3) Rigorously evaluate the benefits (i.e., reduce exposure to abuse and neglect, reduced physical or mental morbidity, and reduced mortality) and harms of screening with DETECT-RPC (RFA key questions KQ1 and KQ4) (mixed-methods)."

A lack of visual experience may affect language development in the domains of word learning and vocabulary
development in ways that necessitate specific instructional approaches and interventions for blind children.
Compared to sighted children, blind children may learn more words from speech because they do not casually
perceive writing in their environment and often experience reading delays. They may also learn fewer words
from direct perceptual experience because they cannot acquire the meanings of words by perceiving their ref-
erents visually. Cumulatively, these word learning differences may affect the trajectory of vocabulary develop-
ment in early and middle childhood. An improved understanding of vocabulary development could improve ed-
ucation for this underserved population. Unfortunately, word learning and vocabulary are understudied within
the area of blind children’s language development. This observational analytic study employing a cross-sec-
tional design directly compares self-reported modes (perceptual or linguistic) and channels (spoken or written)
of word learning for individual words in blind and sighted children. It also compares their trajectories of vocabu-
lary development from age 5 to 12. Specific aims are 1) Determine whether vocabulary development in blind
children is delayed relative to sighted children; 2) Examine whether mode and channel of word learning in blind
children differ from those in sighted children; and 3) Present a dataset of age-of-acquisition (AoA), mode-of-
acquisition (MoA), and channel-of-acquisition (CoA) norms for future use in research. The approach is innova-
tive because objective age-of-acquisition norms (obtained from children themselves rather than subjective
adult estimates) are more reliable and valid than subjective norms and are exceptionally rare. The verbal ad-
ministration of tasks that are typically administered visually will make them accessible not only to blind children,
but to any child with a reading or learning disability. Finally, the virtual approach to data collection will allow the
researchers to reach more individuals from a population that is historically difficult to study. The project is an
instrumental part of the PI’s long-term goal of understanding how vocabulary develops without sight and apply-
ing this understanding to improve educational strategies and outcomes in blind children."

Critical gaps in neonatal research require multicenter involvement and innovative designs to study them.
NICHD views the next chapter of its Neonatal Research Network (NRN) as its “primary and first-line
infrastructure” for conducting definitive, rigorous, and reproducible multicenter clinical research in newborns
that generates evidence to guide clinical practice. There is a crucial need for an independent Data
Coordinating Center (DCC) to provide sophisticated and impartial biostatistical and operational expertise that
helps the NRN target its resources and optimize its scientific impact by (1) helping identify research topics of
high priority, (2) providing objective statistical expertise for the design and analyses of rigorous and feasible
studies, (3) developing processes and systems to increase efficiencies and optimize effective usage of
limited resources through external partnerships that amplify the NRN scientific goals, (4) ensuring
standardization of study design, development, data collection and analyses, and (5) disseminating results.
RTI has been the DCC for the NRN since 1998 and proposes to continue in this role for the next 7 years. We
will maximize the scientific impact of the NRN by (1) collaborating in the development of rigorous and
innovative trial designs and statistical methods to address the unique challenges in neonatal research; (2)
optimizing productivity by providing flexible and efficient data/project management and study monitoring, and
promote data sharing, integration, and harmonization; (3) vigorously pursuing external partnerships to
support and amplify NRN scientific goals; (4) protecting participant safety and study integrity; (5) providing
timely data analysis and collaborative dissemination for all NRN studies; and (6) providing the logistical,
communications, and regulatory support necessary to run an efficient and productive multicenter clinical
research network. Dr. Abhik Das, the proposed PI, has extensive experience in neonatal clinical studies,
leading the NRN DCC for the past 17 years. He will be assisted by Alternate PI, Dr. Carla Bann, and staff
with significant NRN experience. This application has unique strengths to help advance the NRN research
agenda: (1) a highly qualified and motivated PI and staff with in-depth knowledge and years of experience in
neonatal research needs, enabling seamless continuation of NRN research without additional training or
resources; (2) proven track record of scientific productivity documented in the quality and quantity of NRN
studies and publications supported by RTI that have changed clinical practice, and leveraging the NRN
infrastructure to advance NICHD and NRN scientific goals; (3) a state-of-the-art infrastructure of tools,
processes, and systems that are flexible and customized to the needs of the NRN; (4) multidisciplinary
experts who can collaborate with NRN Investigators to realize research goals; (5) robust data management
systems customized for the NRN that ensure data quality; and (6) an agile administrative structure providing
maximum flexibility in staffing and contractual operations to respond quickly to changing NRN needs."

The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program called the
Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and
professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the last
nine years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who will dedicate their research careers
to address the health problems that arise out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in informal human
settlements (slums). Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a comprehensive,
multidisciplinary and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human settlement health issues,
developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program. This program will comprise
four US partner institutions (Consortium)--Yale University, Stanford University, University of Arizona, and
University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health research with more than 10 years of
collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty mentors from these institutions conduct research at 25
institutions in 21 countries, representing regions of Africa, Central and South America, the Caribbean; Asia, the
Pacific, and Eastern Europe. The GHES program will address a wide range of health research topics including
HIV/AIDs, emerging and high- consequence infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCD), women's
health, environmental health, mental health, interpersonal violence, substance abuse, injuries, and the
interaction of all of these health issues within the framework of slum health. Training will target US postdoctoral
fellows and pre- doctoral students and low and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral fellows. We plan to
recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of them as US postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will spend 8-12-months at
an LMIC site under the supervision of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC mentors. Didactic workshops
on global health research methods will be conducted both in-person and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3
months at US institutions to undergo training in methods not provided at their institutions. All of the trainees will
be provided with research and career mentorship throughout their training and tracked for career development
after completion of their GHES-supported research work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to
be exposed to one important theme in global health research--health equity--through research that deals with
health concerns of vulnerable populations residing in informal human settlements and provide them with an
opportunity to become experts in this new global health discipline. The overall impact of this training program is,
therefore, to create a new cadre of global health researchers and leaders who address the emerging health
issues arising out of ever-expanding informal human settlements of LMICs."

 At this time, alcohol is the top substance used by US emerging adults under the legal drinking age
(underage emerging adults; U-EA; ages 18-19). While drinking rates had recently been trending downward,
2021 national data reflect rises in youth drinking across all metrics. This is highly consequential in terms of
youth safety and neurodevelopment. One of the central challenges of U-EA alcohol use is that youth are
unlikely to seek, receive, or complete indicated alcohol intervention. In turn, it is imperative to find brief,
effective interventions to impactfully intervene with U-EA hazardous alcohol use. Additionally, the
developmental neuroscience literature robustly reflects that peers hold higher neural salience during this
developmental window, as evidenced by youths’ differential neural response in conditions with real and/or
simulated peers, even when those peers were not friends, and particularly in the context of alcohol.
Furthermore, studies are recognizing that peers concomitantly activate positive (prosocial) neural and
behavioral responses in this age group, and this has been observed in conditions of negative and positive peer
feedback. The role of negative and positive peer feedback is consequential given that one of most widely-used
U-EA intervention service delivery methods are group-based formats. Here, we aim to build upon PI Feldstein
Ewing’s 15 year history of continuous NIH funding in youth translational (brain:behavioral) approaches
evaluating youth within-session factors, youth neural response, and subsequent behavior change. Across
independent samples, our team has found distinct developmental brain response to MI interventions, largely
localized to default mode network (DMN) regions [precuneus, posterior central cortex (PCC)]. Further, this
observed DMN activation to examined within-session factors (client language; therapist language) was
significantly associated with youth post-treatment behavior change. We thus respond to PAR-21-280: “Dyadic
Interpersonal Process and Biopsychosocial Outcomes” and propose functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) to evaluate U-EA brain response in the underexamined, but widely-utilized, group MI context.

The proposed research combines biophysics, molecular genetics, and genomics tools to provide high-resolution
mechanisms for RNA-dominated biological processes. Our study focuses on two central themes in RNA biology.
(1) RNA can serve as an information carrier to guide the action of proteins. Such systems are inherently precise
and programmable, therefore carry great potential in biotechnology and medicine, as exemplified by RNAi and
CRISPR-Cas. My lab spent more than ten years dissecting the mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas, and more recently
has been developing genome editing applications based on our mechanistic insights. (2) RNA can adopt defined
tertiary structures to exert important functions. My lab has elucidated the structure, function, and conformation
dynamics of many riboswitches. The high-resolution information may enable new antibiotics development. We
now aim to combine genetic screen with biochemical purification to systematically identify ligands for orphan
riboswitches. Such studies often reveal novel aspects of bacterial physiology, which may even be conserved in
eukaryotes. We propose to work on the following four areas of research: 1) Structure, mechanism, and genome
editing applications of Type I CRISPR (CRISPR-Cas3); 2) Mechanism of CRISPR immunity establishment by
Cas1-Cas2 integrase; 3) Mechanism and genome editing application of CRISPR-Tn7; 4) Dissecting riboswitch-
controlled mechanism and bacterial physiology."
11139247,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Spirochetes of the Borrelia genus are the cause of several prevalent vector-borne diseases. The most
well-known pathogen from this group is Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, which causes over 300,000 cases of
Lyme disease in the United States each year. B. garinii and B. afzelii, which belong to the B. burgdorferi sensu
lato complex, are the primary agent of Lyme disease in Europe and Asia. Borrelia spirochetes are also the
etiological agent of the ancient human disease relapsing fever, as well as a newly recognized infectious
condition called Borrelia miyamotoi disease. Lyme-associated, relapsing fever-associated, and B. miyamotoi
spirochetes have differing lifecycles and their infections are accompanied by distinct clinical presentations.
However, each of these pathogens are known to encode multifunctional surface-expressed lipoproteins that
interact with vertebrate host molecules. Among these proteins are a small arsenal of immunomodulators that
specifically target and inactivate a primary arm of innate immunity known as the complement system. We have
recently reported two independent lines of evidence that support the hypothesis that one of these pathways,
known as the classical pathway, is important in controlling B. burgdorferi infections. First, we have shown that
mice deficient in the pattern recognition molecule of the classical pathway, C1q, are significantly more
susceptible to B. burgdorferi infection. Secondly, we have shown that the lipoprotein B. burgdorferi BBK32 is a
high-affinity inhibitor of the initiating protease of the classical pathway, C1r.
 In Aim 1 of this project we seek to understand the C1r inhibitory activity of BBK32 sensu lato proteins at
the molecular level. In Aim 2 we will determine the immunomodulatory roles and virulence contribution of three
BBK32 orthologues known as FbpA, FbpB, and FbpC which are found uniquely in relapsing fever and B.
miyamotoi spirochetes. In Aim 3 we will delineate the role of C1r inhibition in borrelial pathogenesis using in
vivo models of disease. To achieve this, we propose a multi-disciplinary strategy that employs x-ray
crystallography, biophysical approaches, and complement functional assays to pinpoint key ‘hot-spot’ residues
on BBK32 that give rise to its potent anti-C1r activity. These data will inform the design of bbk32 mutants which
will be used in mouse infectivity studies to connect structural features of BBK32, at the amino-acid level, to an
in vivo phenotype. Parallel studies will use genetic deletion mutants of fbp genes from the relapsing fever-
associated spirochetes B. turicatae and B. hermsii. These studies will be paired with experimental models of
Lyme and relapsing fever borrelioses using C1r-/- mice to better understand the role of the classical pathway
initiating protease in the control of borrelial infections. By addressing fundamental questions of how medically
important Borrelia spirochetes recognize and evade host immunity, the studies proposed here stand to have a
broad and significant impact on the field of bacterial pathogenesis."

Although more than four years have passed since the initial virus appearance, nowadays, most of the population has been
vaccinated with multiple doses of mRNA-based vaccines and has endured multiple infection events. Still, SARS-CoV-2
continues to cause disproportionately higher morbidity and mortality in older adults from these communities, especially in
the Latino-origin population and other vulnerable populations like the hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT)
population. As newer versions of vaccines are adapted to recent SARS-CoV-2 variants (i.e., bivalent vaccines andXBB1.5),
we must continue to determine how effective these vaccines are overtime against emerging variants and establish how those
populations are still responding. We will characterizes the kinetics, magnitude, and durability of type-specific neutralizing
antibody and T cells responses to different current SARS-CoV-2 variants after natural infection or vaccination, designed to
reveal correlates associated with protective immunity or disease severity or progression to long COVID. We pursue to
implement the following new tasks: AIM 1: Task 1.3. Implementation of a third Community Assessment for Public Health
Emergency Response (CASPER) approach, we expect to collect about 2,000 new samples to expand the IDRB. During
prior funding periods, we also supported CASPER I and II. AIM 2: Task 2.5: To evaluate the current anti-SARS-Cov-2 IgG
levels in the population of Puerto Rico following the Community Assessment for Public Health Emergency Response
(CASPER) approach. Task 2.6: characterizes the kinetics, magnitude, and durability of type-specific neutralizing antibody
responses to different current SARS-CoV-2 variants designed to reveal correlates associated with protective immunity. Task
2.7: Supported in our prior findings, we propose determining whether such IgG4 levels induced by mRNA vaccination
could be associated with persistent COVID-19 symptoms (Long-COVID) in our population. Task 2.8: Interrogation of the
Antigen-Specific B Cell Response as described below in the approach section. Task 2.9: Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2
Infections: Investigate the relationship between breakthrough infections, vaccine immunogenicity, and long COVID
symptomatology by actively monitoring HSCT patients. AIM3: Task 3.2: Expand the Innate and Adaptive Immune
Response characterization in underrepresented populations: Investigate the phenotype and function of antigen-specific T
cells, including TFH cells, which support antigen-specific B cell responses. Measure CD4 TFH cells' ability to support
antigen-specific B cell antibody secretion using in vitro CD4-B cell cultures. Task 3.3: Define factors responsible for
decreased T cell help leading to altered antigen-specific antibody responses in patients with HSCTs. AIM 4: Task 4.3: We
will continue to focus on sequencing the circulating and emerging strains and variants and correlating them with the
immunological profile characterized under the new tasks in aims 1 to 3.
We will continue with our efforts directed to guarantee a proper representation of age, sex, gender, and socioeconomic
status as well as individuals with comorbidities including but not limited to obesity, cancer, and autoimmune diseases."

To guide decisions, visual information must flow from primary visual cortex (V1) to prefrontal cortex (PFC), via
multiple, parallel cortico-cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical connections. Both V1 and PFC have direct
connections with the pulvinar, a higher-order nucleus of the thalamus, but the role of this nucleus in sensory
processing is still largely mysterious. Importantly, much of the pulvinar has no homologue in rodents or
carnivores, which makes studying it in nonhuman primates all the more important. This goal of this project is to
uncover how direct connections between the cortex (V1 and PFC) and the pulvinar interact and impact visual
perception and visually-guided decisions in non-human primates. To achieve this goal, the project proposes a
novel method, using focused ultrasound to non-invasively open the blood brain barrier, in order to precisely
target cortico-thalamic projections for causal, optogenetic manipulations. Current evidence points to a critical
role for the pulvinar in redirecting visual attention, but its role in visually-guided decision-making and perception
is less clear. To directly test how these cortico-thalamic projections affect visual perception and decision-making,
these circuits will be optogenetically activated while monkeys perform challenging psychophysical tasks. We will
then be able to assess the contribution of individual, cell-type specific, components of these circuits, by
measuring changes in behavioral performance and differences in neural responses across multiple brain areas.
The proposed projects builds on my experience implementing multi-area electrophysiological recordings and
optogenetic manipulations in awake, behaving primates. The training phase will allow me to develop novel
approaches for transfecting larges areas with optogenetic constructs and practice targeting deep thalamic
structures in the primate brain electrophysiologically. The long-term goal for my research program is to resolve
the essential neural circuit that sensory information must pass through in order to become available for
perceptually-based decisions. The central hypothesis for this is work is that cortical-thalamic loops are necessary
for the subjective experience of sensory inputs, and a fundamental feature of perceptual decision-making. My
goal is to apply this circuit-level knowledge of perceptual representations to improve brain function in the disease
state or following damage to sensory organs, but also to use this knowledge to improve how we can effectively
communicate information to healthy brains."

In humans, neutralizing antibodies elicited by HIV-1 coevolve with viral Envs in distinctive patterns, in some
cases acquiring substantial breadth. We found that primary HIV-1 Envs, when expressed by simian-human
immunodeficiency viruses (SHIVs) in 22 rhesus macaques (RMs), elicited patterns of Env-Ab coevolution
strikingly similar to those in humans (Science 371:eabd2638, 2021). This included conserved immunogenetic,
structural and chemical solutions to epitope recognition and precise Env-amino acid substitutions, insertions and
deletions leading to virus persistence. The structure of one rhesus antibody, capable of neutralizing 49% of a
208-strain panel, revealed a V2-apex mode of recognition like that of human bNAbs PGT145 and PCT64. We
subsequently expanded this study to include 150 RMs infected by SHIVs bearing any of 15 different primary
HIV-1 Envs; 24 (16%) of these animals developed bNAbs targeting conserved V2 apex, V3 glycan, CD4bs or
fusion peptide epitopes. The V2 apex was the most common bNAb epitope targeted in RMs. We concluded that
Env-Ab coevolution in RMs recapitulates developmental features of human bNAbs and may serve to guide and
accelerate HIV-1 immunogen design for humans. From these preclinical data, we identified HIV-1 Q23.17 Env
as the immunogen that most consistently elicited V2 apex bNAbs. Here, we propose to elucidate the Env-Ab
coevolutionary pathways by which HIV-1 Q23.17 Env selectively primes, boosts and affinity-matures V2 apex
bNAb responses and to translate these findings into an all-SOSIP Env trimer vaccine regimen consisting of a
germline-targeted Q23.17 Env prime followed by boosts with lineage-designed Q23.17 Env “imunotypes”
capable of affinity-maturing B cells to achieve breadth. Specific aims are: (i) to decipher molecular pathways of
Env-Ab coevolution in SHIV.Q23.17 infected RMs that lead to the development of V2 apex bNAbs, including the
identification of inferred germline bNAb precursors and lineage intermediates and corresponding Env
immunotypes that bind to them; (ii) to use mammalian display saturation mutagenesis to generate Q23.17 Env
variants that exhibit enhanced binding affinity to multiple rhesus germline V2 apex bNAb B cell precursors and
to engineer these Envs as nanoparticle-delivered SOSIP trimers; (iii) to test the immunogenicity of germline-
targeted and lineage-designed Q23.17 Env SOSIP trimers in V2 apex bNAb UCA knockin mice and outbred
RMs and to advance the most promising combinations to a proof-of-concept preclinical vaccine trial in RMs; and
(iv) to conduct an appropriately powered preclinical vaccine trial in 28 RMs to test the hypothesis that reverse-
engineered, B lineage-designed Q23.17 SOSIP Env trimers can prime, boost and affinity mature V2 apex bNAb
responses in RMs to an extent that is superior to conventional SOSIP Env immunogens and that protects RMs
from heterologous virus challenge. The significance of these studies could be far-reaching: if we can demonstrate
consistent induction of bNAbs using germline-targeted, lineage-designed Q23.17 Env SOSIPs in RMs, it would
represent a new beachhead for HIV-1 vaccine research that could be translated rapidly into human clinical trials."

This is a request for an Administrative Supplement for the INCLUDE Project for R01 AI166835 “Mechanistic
and functional dissection of inflammaging in Down syndrome” in accordance with NOT-OD-22-137. The
overarching goal of the parent grant is to advance our understanding of immune aging and immune response
in DS. The proposed studies for the Administrative Supplement are within the scope of the active parent grant,
focused on Down syndrome (DS) and address INCLUDE Project priorities Component 1 (Targeted high risk –
high reward basic science studies highly relevant to DS) and Component 2 (Assembly of a large cohort of
individuals with DS across the lifespan to perform deep phenotyping and study co-existing conditions). Our
central hypothesis is that the immune features linked to impaired function in people with DS represent a subset
of globally dysregulated features and are driven by cell-intrinsic and/or cell-extrinsic mechanisms. This
hypothesis is based on the following: 1) Studies in vaccine response and in autoimmunity showing that the
phenotype of antigen-specific cells is a subset of memory cell phenotypes, and 2) our data showing that
immune features dysregulated in people with DS can be dysregulated by either cell-intrinsic mechanisms (e.g.
DYRK1A) or cell-extrinsic mechanisms (e.g. IL-6). We expect our proposed studies in people with DS to better
define vaccine-specific cells and the mechanisms underlying their dysregulation, thus providing key scientific
foundation to improve vaccine response and, more broadly, immune function in this group. Our objectives for
the Administrative Supplement are: 1) Enhance our existing DS biorepository by improving phenotypic data
collection and curation and including more individuals with mosaic DS (Component 2), 2) Use phenomics to
broadly identify CD4 T cell features dysregulated by cell-intrinsic vs cell-extrinsic mechanisms in people with
DS (Component 1), and 3) Define dysregulation of vaccine-specific B cells in people with DS (Component 1).
The proposed work leverages our group's published success in developing a cohort of individuals with DS and
in building new tools to interrogate immune landscape and antigen-specific cell phenotype. It leverages many
resources from the parent grant including cohorts (Aim 1a and 3), samples (Aim 3), postdoc effort (Aim 2 & 3),
and computational analysis effort (Aim 2 and 3A). The proposed studies take advantage of interim
experimental advances we have made to synergistically extend parent grant studies, thus promising
synergistic return on investment (Aims 2 and 3). This is particularly important considering the limited nature of
participants and samples. Importantly, we have built in plans to share tools and information from the proposed
studies via the INCLUDE Data Hub. Thus, all the proposed studies are directly responsive to the RFA and are
likely to significantly advance our understanding of immune dysregulation in people with DS as well as
facilitate sharing of our cutting-edge tools with the broader community."

 Histomonas meleagridis is an intracellular protozoan that can cause severe morbidity and mortality in birds,
particularly turkeys. Infection can lead to a high mortality rate of 70-100% in affected turkey populations.
Currently, no FDA-approved drugs are available to prevent, treat, or control H. meleagridis infections.
 H. meleagridis parasites can rapidly spread within turkey flocks in farms, but the infectious agent responsible
for transmission and the exact routes of transmission remain unclear. Our preliminary data indicate that, during
in vitro culture, the parasites can form a stage with an external chitin wall, resembling cyst-like structures found
in other eukaryotic pathogens. This chitin wall serves as a protective layer, helping H. meleagridis parasites
withstand various biological and environmental stresses, potentially aiding in their transmission. Our recent
findings demonstrate that these cyst-like structures can survive low pH conditions and remain viable, supporting
the hypothesis that they play a role in transmission. Additionally, our turkey trials revealed that oral inoculation
with in vitro H. meleagridis culture can initiate infection, suggesting that the cysts formed during in vitro culturing
can solely initiate infection in vivo. Based on these discoveries, we propose the central hypothesis that the chitin-
covered cyst-like form of H. meleagridis is crucial for transmission within turkeys due to its environmental
resistance, making it a potential therapeutic target. We will test this hypothesis through the following specific
aims: (1) Determine the infectivity and formation of cyst-like H. meleagridis in vitro and in vivo; (2) Identify the
cellular pathways mediating encystation in H. meleagridis; and (3) Screen and assess potent inhibitors against
encystation of H. meleagridis in vitro and in vivo.
 Investigating this understudied aspect of H. meleagridis biology will significantly impact the field by filling
critical knowledge gaps regarding the transmission mechanisms of H. meleagridis infection and the molecular
basis of encystation. Additionally, we will develop an RNA interference-based gene suppression system in the
parasites and generate transgenic parasite lines expressing fluorescent and luminescent proteins. These
technical innovations will facilitate the future characterization of key H. meleagridis genes involved in infection.
Notably, the FDA recently determined that controlling H. meleagridis infection qualifies as a ""minor use in a major
species,"" aligning our proposed work with the goals of this FDA funding mechanism."

Center” focused on research on IGAs in major livestock species to advance the use of gene
editing technologies in food animals, while generating and sharing both phenotypic and
bioinformatic data to support a science-based approach to the regulation of IGAs in food animals.
UC Davis has long been a leader in applying genetic technologies to farm animal species and we
are uniquely positioned to address issues surrounding the use of gene editing in animals destined
for the food chain due to the depth and breadth of extant food animals (cattle, pigs, sheep, and
goats) with IGAs we have generated, and the pipeline we have planned for the future. These
animals have been produced for both agricultural and biomedical purposes over the past 20
years, with gene edited animals predominating in the past 5 years. This inventory includes
genetically engineered and gene-edited knockout and knock-in animals resulting from both
microinjection and electroporation, some of which have multiple generations of offspring. The
specific aims of this Cooperative Agreement are:
Aim 1: To develop a gold standard workflow for assessing on- and off-target events as a
result of gene editing. Whole genome sequencing (WGS), in vitro and in silico approaches to
detect on- and off-target events will be compared to establish a strategy that will account for
natural sequence variability, sequencing depth and bioinformatics workflows to ensure accurate
identification of on- and off-target changes in the genome.
Aim 2: To document the genotypic and phenotypic durability of IGAs across generations
and species. Genotypic durability of on- and off-target events will be documented in gene edited
cattle, pigs, and sheep and, bovine embryonic stem cells (bESCs) and phenotypic durability
assessed including compiling information on known variation in nutrient profiles of products
derived from food animals to help inform design of experiments to explicitly evaluate alterations
in product composition.
Aim 3: To assess the reproducibility of various gene editing platforms including prime
editing in terms of efficacy of editing and presence of off-target cutting in different cell types.
We anticipate sharing the materials and data we produce with FDA scientific or program staff and
coordinating project activities with the FDA to provide evidence to address regulatory questions
to help advance the safe use of gene editing to improve the sustainability of animal agriculture,
and facilitate more FDA-regulated products coming to market."

The goals of my research program are to elucidate fundamental mechanisms underlying synapse and
axon development and maintenance. We take multi-tiered approaches to investigate these processes,
primarily using C. elegans because this animal model is well suited for in vivo imaging with high cellular
resolution and because mechanistic dissection is within physiological relevant contexts and coupled
with functional impacts. We examine the C. elegans locomotor circuit, because we can unambiguously
observe the stereotyped patterns of synapses in all developmental stages, an essential readout to
assess how synapses are dynamically regulated. We have consistently developed innovative
technologies enabling visualization of organelles and subcellular structures in axons and synapses for
in vivo analyses of dynamic cellular processes. We were the first to visualize synapse remodeling of
juvenile motor circuit in living animals, which set two decades of vibrant research that have revealed
multiple pathways coordinating temporal events and spatial organization of synaptic connections. We
established C. elegans axon regeneration model, and have used large-scale genetic screens to
discover genes that promote or repress axon regrowth in adults. Many pathways have been found to
have conserved roles in axon regeneration in other animal models. In this R35 application, we will
focus on mechanisms underlying both the developmental synapse plasticity in locomotor circuit
maturation and maintenance, and also neuronal stress response and axon regeneration in adults. We
will investigate how neuronal activity pattern coordinates with transcriptional regulation by combining in
vivo imaging of synapse and calcium with single-cell RNA sequencing analysis over the entire period of
circuit remodeling. We will gain a deep understanding of molecular dynamics associated with synapse
and circuit plasticity. We have long-standing interest in the multifaceted roles of the conserved MAP3K
DLK proteins, which have been shown to regulate diverse cellular processes from synapse formation
and remodeling to axon regeneration and neurodegeneration. We will cross-examine mechanistic
conservation between C. elegans and mice. Membraneless compartments generated through protein
phase separation are now widely shown to play key roles in organizing cellular activities, including axon
regeneration. We will take a holistic approach to investigate protein phase separation with
physiological relevant expression and contexts, and also to model how genetic mutations in human
homologs may alter protein phase separation properties. Overall, the findings will advance our
knowledge on the cellular signaling network underlying normal brain function and will also provide
insights into pathological processes associated with synapse dysfunction and axonal damage."
11140157,"Poor cardiovascular health (CVH) causes cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and there is growing 
evidence 
that inflammation links poor CVH to higher risk of CVD. In the United States, there are disparities 
in CVH and levels of inflammatory biomarkers by race, gender, and socio-economic status. According 
to the intersectionality theory, health inequities do not arise solely from individual social 
identities (i.e., race, gender, and socio-economic status) but result from interrelations of 
individual social identities and structural oppressions (structural racism, structural sexism, and 
structural classism). To date, no study we are aware of has used an intersectional perspective to 
investigate effects of structural oppressions, alongside individual social identities, on overall 
CVH or on inflammation. We will use intersectional approaches to understand associations of 
structural oppressions with CVH and inflammation in Black and White women and men of the REasons 
for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort study. REGARDS is a longitudinal 
study of 30,239 Black and White adults (45 and older) from 1,860 of 3,000 US counties. The proposed 
aims are to: 1) determine the intersectional impact of structural racism, structural sexism, and 
structural classism on CVH in Black and White men and women over 10 years; 2) Identify 
intersectional associations of structural racism, structural sexism, and structural classism with 
inflammatory biomarkers measured in Black and White men and women after 10 years. To complete these 
aims, we will create composite indices of structural oppressions at the REGARDS baseline visit and 
analyze their intersectional associations with longitudinal CVH data and 92 inflammatory biomarkers 
measured in Visit 2 samples. Inflammatory biomarkers will be measured using targeted proteomics in 
the VCCBH Study Design and Molecular Epidemiology Core (Core B). Results of this research may 
inform future preventive measures and policies to address CVH inequities and advance knowledge on 
the biological embodiment of structural oppressions."
11140140,"The brain requires constant delivery of oxygen (O2) and nutrients through the bloodstream to maintain healthy 
neuronal function. Indeed, local or global dips in O2, called hypoxia, can precipitate central nervous system 
damage and neurodegeneration. Critically, clinical manifestations of chronic hypoxia/ischemia primarily occur 
in deep brain structures such as the subcortical white matter and thalamus. Indeed, deep brain 
hypoxia/ischemia is a putative mechanism in ischemic small vessel disease, which is prevalent and 
debilitating, accounting for over ~40% of all dementia cases and is by far the leading cause of vascular 
dementia. Of the entire brain vascular landscape, over 90% of all vessels are exceptionally small capillaries, 
consisting of end-to-end endothelial cell tubes with complete coverage by embedded perivascular cells called 
pericytes. We have recently demonstrated that the capillaries provide a massive sensing surface area within 
the brain and can transduce environmental stimuli (such as neuronal activity) into reliable and robust 
increases in blood flow. We have also demonstrated that capillaries possess the molecular machinery 
required to transduce extracellular adenosine, a key hypoxia-induced signaling molecule, into vasodilation 
and increased blood flow. Additionally, capillaries are a critical locus for dysfunction in small vessel disease 
pathology. The main objectives of this proposal are to examine the role deep brain capillaries play in 
hypoxia-induced blood flow responses and to determine whether deep brain hypoxia-sensing is disrupted in 
an animal model of cerebral small vessel disease. Therefore, I hypothesize that capillary adenosine 
sensing mediates deep-brain blood flow responses during hypoxia. I further hypothesize that hypoxia 
sensing is diminished in cerebral small vessel disease, leading to vascular dysfunction and hypoxic damage 
in deep brain structures. I will test these hypotheses with two distinct aims. First, I will elucidate the role 
adenosine signaling and KATP channel activity play in hypoxia-induced deep brain blood flow responses. 
Second, I will determine whether cSVD pathology disrupts hypoxia-induced blood flow responses and 
capillary-mediated electrical signaling. This project will provide significant physiological and pathological 
insights into blood delivery mechanisms within the deep brain. This proposal is conceptually and 
technically innovative due to the capillary-centric examination of hypoxia-sensing and the use of 
sophisticated deep brain imaging in well-characterized models of cerebral small vessel disease."
11146955,"Project summary
Disruption of supraspinal regulation causes reduced sympathetic and unopposed parasympathetic activity,
leading to cardiac and hemodynamic disorders after high-level spinal cord injury (SCI). We recently reported that
renewal of serotonergic regulation over hemodynamics could be achieved with transplantation of embryonic
raphe nucleus-derived neural progenitors/stem cells (RN-NPCs) in a rat SCI model. It was previously showed
that exercise, a viable therapeutic intervention, heightens neuronal activity, axonal regrowth, and production of
neurotrophic factors after SCI. Accordingly, we posit that transplanting serotonergic NPCs in the injured spinal
cord will reestablish serotonin regulation to improve cardiac function, and combining RN-NPC grafts with
exercise will enhance the recovery of cardiac activity, hemodynamics, and autonomic dysreflexia after SCI. In
Aim 1, we will determine whether integration of transplanted serotonergic NPCs with spinal cord circuitry will
restore sympathetic regulation to improve cardiac electrical conduction following SCI. In Aim 2, we will test
whether combining RN-NPC transplants with exercise will further enhance the reconstitution of sympathetic
modulation to restore cardiac activity, hemodynamics, and autonomic dysreflexia. Overall, this project will
provide novel insight into therapeutic strategy following SCI."

In this administrative supplement we will be making a strong case to the NIH to enable funding
for key equipment needed for the completion of our development and scale-up efforts to
commercialize BioRMB™, formerly known as Continuous Countercurrent Tangential
Chromatography (CCTC), for next generation AAV vector manufacturing.
Summary
In our initial submission to the NIH in March 2024, we outlined four aims for the provided funds,
the first of which was to commercialize BioRMB™ for the purification of rAAV to significantly
improve recovery, product quality, and process productivity when compared with column
chromatography. Since receiving these funds, we have already begun the development of a
comprehensive analytical and process development toolkit for benchtop experimental design to
execute capture and polishing operations for rAAV purification on our BioRMB™ platform, and we
were able to execute purification of rAAV8 with excellent yield and product quality. For the capture
step, we started with 2.5 Liters of harvested material, and performed an elution buffer DoE study
on BioRMB™, screening different elution pHs. We achieved an overall 80% recovery during
steady-state operation, and considering only the lower pH condition, our AAV maximum recovery
was at 85%. Further analysis of impurities removal will be performed.
In addition, we have used a commercial rAAV harvest material provided by Spark Therapeutics,
concentrated 10 times, in an effort of process intensification to reduce the capture process time.
An initial bioreactor volume of 40 Liters was concentrated to 3.9 Liters and was captured using
AAVX affinity resin (Thermo Scientific) on Kascade™ BioRMB™, over a 5-hour capture process.
Titer analyses by qPCR showed an average of 89% rAAV recovery during steady-state.
Preliminary HEK293 HCP ELISA analyses revealed that host-cell protein was reduced below
detectable levels in eluted samples. This purified material has been used for initial AAV polishing
characterization bench studies, where a specific resin, target loading, and buffer conditions were
selected to design the polishing process to be used on the BioRMB™ platform. We are still
working on optimized elution conditions for this rAAV molecule, and will use the bench-scale data
to design the flow path and operational parameters for AAV polishing step on the Kascade™
BioRMB™.
Additionally, we have begun developing a suite of analytical assays and QC protocols to better
characterize crude and purified rAAV molecules. Furthermore, we have successfully
demonstrated that BioRMB™ can achieve up to 4 log reduction of viral contaminants (LRV) from
a mAb harvest spiked with a viral-like particle (RVLP). We have every reason to believe BioRMB™
can achieve similar results with AAV crude harvest.
However, the ability to demonstrate the integration of AAV capture and polishing, resulting in a
high purity product, is a key milestone that must also be achieved, and we have identified critical
gaps in our capabilities that prevent us from doing so. To that end, we are requesting additional
funds for equipment to allow us to address the following:
1. To evaluate the capacity of BioRMB™ to effectively remove impurities, such as HCPs, we
 require an Automated Immunoassay system. This technology will enable us to conduct, in
 a high throughput manner, in-depth impurity removal studies for rAAV, to demonstrate
 equivalent log reductions of such impurities. In addition, we will have an orthogonal
 technique for total AAV capsids titer.

11176724,"Background: Among the 146,000 Veterans released from correctional settings annually, approximately 60%
have a co-occurring mental health and substance use disorder (COD). These individuals often access
treatment inconsistently, resulting in increased antisocial activities and acceleration into unemployment and
homelessness – strong predictors of reoffending. VHA Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Treatment
Programs (MH RRTPs) commonly serve justice-involved Veterans (JIVs) with an estimated 50% annually. JIVs
receive assistance with their addiction and behavioral health needs, but MH RRTP programs do not directly
address their antisocial behaviors and cognitions. Furthermore, MH RRTP discharge is a vulnerable transition
and no national transitional approach facilitates Veteran engagement in prosocial community behaviors that
maintain MH RRTP gains, and ultimately reducing revolving door service use. Maintaining Independence and
Sobriety through Systems Integration, Outreach, and Networking-Criminal Justice version (MISSION-CJ) is a
new case manager and peer delivered team-based treatment for JIVs with a COD. Three recent open pilots of
MISSION-CJ showed reduced criminal recidivism, improved behavioral health outcomes and increased access
and engagement in care. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) is a critical next step prior to dissemination.
Significance/Impact: This application is responsive to the VHA MISSION Act, Veteran Care Priorities of
Access to Care, Mental Health, and Health Equity. The project aims to (a) increase access and engagement in
VHA and community-based care, (b) offer timely Veteran-centered care, and (c) improve the health and well-
being of JIVs while reducing disparities. It also includes an implementation aim to support VHA learning.
Innovation: While MISSION-CJ derives in part from an evidence-based treatment for homeless individuals
(MISSION), it includes a new conceptual framework and numerous new and differentiating features for a CJ
population including: (1) a treatment planning tool focused on criminogenic needs that monitors progress and
tunes service delivery elements, (2) a prosocial treatment curriculum, and (3) tools/resources to address
Veteran legal issues. With MISSION-CJ, this study attempts to change the practice paradigm and transform
care for JIVs by moving beyond the current model of linking Veterans to VA care and tracking behavioral
health outcomes, to a hybrid treatment/linkage approach that addresses criminogenic needs, supports
engagement in VA and non-VA care, and targets recidivism as an outcome–the gold standard for CJ research.
Specific Aims: Aim 1: An RCT will compare MISSION-CJ to EUC. We predict that those in MISSION-CJ will
have (1a) lower criminal recidivism; (1b) lower overall risk for criminal recidivism; (1c) better health-related
outcomes (substance use, mental health, housing, employment); and (1d) the effects of MISSION-CJ on 1a,
1b and 1c, will be mediated by (i) reductions antisocial attitudes, (ii) reductions in affiliations with antisocial
peers and increases in affiliations with prosocial peers, (iii) greater treatment engagement (i.e., MH RRTP
completion; substance use/mental health continuing care; 12-step group attendance), and (iv) increased
community reintegration. Aim 2: A formative evaluation will identify barriers and facilitators to future
implementation of MISSION-CJ in other MH RRTPs nationally.
Methodology: This project will use a Hybrid Type 1 design. First, we will test the effectiveness of MISSION-
CJ in a two-site RCT (Bedford and Palo Alto VAs) with 226 Veterans with a COD, admitted to an MH RRTP,
and previously arrested and charged and/or released from incarceration in the past 12 months. Next, we will
use the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation & Maintenance framework to conduct a formative
evaluation with 7 providers and 12 Veterans at each site to inform future MISSION-CJ implementation.
Next Steps/Implementation: Depending on the results of this study, we will work with our VACO operational
partners and two HSR&D Centers of Innovation to conduct a large multisite implementation trial."
11178144,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Pregnancy represents a unique challenge for the maternal-fetal immune interface, requiring the balance
between immunosuppression, essential for the maintenance of semi-allogeneic fetus and pro-inflammatory
host defense to protect the mother and fetus from invading organisms. Adaptation to repeated inflammatory
stimuli may be critical in preventing rejection of the fetus by the exaggerated maternal inflammatory responses
to mild/moderate infections that are common during human pregnancy.
 Immune tolerance/adaptation is a well-described phenomenon in which cells exposed to repeated
pathogens become less responsive to subsequent exposures. This adaptation suppresses an overly
aggressive inflammatory response to repeated infections that can be detrimental to the tissues rather than
protective. Dampened immune response to repeated infections has been associated with protection against
tissue injury and mortality in several human diseases. However, to date, the role of immune tolerance to
repeated infections in the context of human pregnancy, and the exact mechanisms that contribute to the
establishment of such immune adaptation to prevent inflammation-induced pathologic pregnancies are not
explored. There is now extensive evidence that miRNAs play an important role in the maintenance of a healthy
pregnancy, with a wide range of miRNAs implicated in endometrial receptivity, implantation, gestational tissues
function, and labor. Our preliminary results indicate that repeated LPS (gram negative bacterial toxins) or LTA
(gram-positive bacterial toxins) exposures to human placenta attenuates exaggerated inflammatory responses
known to contribute to inflammation-associated pathologic pregnancies. Our data also point to the involvement
of a human- and placenta-specific miRNA called miRNA-519c-3p (miR-519c) in the development of placental
immune tolerance. Our overriding hypothesis is that repeated exposure of the placenta to pathogens induces a
tolerant phenotype mediated by the miR-519c to guard the maternal-fetal interface from the exaggerated
inflammation associated with pathologic pregnancies. We hypothesize that LPS/LTA induce placental
trophoblasts to secrete miR-519c packaged within placental extracellular vesicles for delivery to nearby or
distant cells. The miR-519c within the EVs will mediate down-regulation of exaggerated pro-inflammatory
responses associated with repeated bacterial toxin exposures.
 We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: Investigate the role of miR-519c in mediating immune
adaptation in the human placenta after repeated infections and Aim 2: Investigate the molecular mechanisms
of placental miR-519c mediating immune adaptation. These studies will set the stage for future experiments to
test if decreased expression of miR-519c is linked to inflammation-associated pathologic pregnancies. This
unique human- and placenta-specific miR-519c can be an excellent biomarker candidate as well as a
therapeutic target for inflammatory diseases of pregnancy."
11178842,"The National Survey of Family Growth is a survey of U.S. men and women of reproductive age that has been conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) since 1973, using a continuous fieldwork design since 2006. The survey provides national estimates concerning factors related to fertility, family formation, family planning, and reproductive health including HIV infection and other sexually transmitted diseases. Prior to transitioning to a continuous fieldwork design, NCHS conducted 6 discrete cycles of the NSFG between 1973 and 2002; NICHD participated in funding four of these, starting in 1982 when the survey first included never-married women: Cycle 3 (1982), Cycle 4 (1988, with a 1990 telephone re-interview), Cycle 5 (1995), and Cycle 6 (2002, the first NSFG to include men). Beginning in 2004, NICHD began to support transition of NSFG from a periodically conducted survey to a continuous data collection design. Apart from a 15-month break in fieldwork to allow for awarding a new contract, NSFG collected data with this continuous fieldwork design from June 2006 through September 2019.  Data files were released on a regular basis once sufficient cases had been accumulated. This design benefited NICHD by providing larger samples at more frequent intervals than under the NSFG’s old periodic design, and at the same time maximizing cost efficiency. After a break to award another new contract, continuous data collection began again in January 2022 and is ongoing.  
Data collected by the NSFG provide essential information for NICHD’s program planning, particularly in program areas related to contraception, fertility and infertility, pregnancy planning, maternal and perinatal health, HIV/STI prevention, and family change. Since its inception, the NSFG has been conducted with women aged 15-44, and men 15-44 were added to the survey in 2002. Beginning in September 2015, the NSFG expanded its age range from 15-44 to 15-49.  This age range expansion to include men and women aged 45-49 enhances the substantive value of the survey for describing sexual/reproductive health and family-formation topics, and more closely keeps pace with the aging US population.  
The purpose of this Agreement is to enable the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) to contribute to the funding of the development, fielding, and data preparation for the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). A new contract for the upcoming 8-year period (2022-2029) of continuous interviewing began September 28, 2020.

The mission of the CCTN is to develop protocols and conduct clinical trials that assist in providing effective and safe contraception in obese women.The National Institutes of Health (NIH), Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), is the lead Federal agency for the conduct of basic and clinical research to develop new contraceptives and to evaluate existing methods of contraception and reproductive health. The Center for Population Research (CPR), within NICHD, was established in 1968 by the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, with the important goal of developing new contraceptives through the use of contracts and grants. Within CPR, the Contraception and Reproductive Health Branch (CRHB) has long supported several preclinical contraceptive testing facilities as well as 
facilities for synthetic chemical and synthetic peptide formulation. To further expand their contraceptive development capabilities, in 1996 CRHB established the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN). The current CCTN has conducted Phase I, II, and III clinical trials of both female and male contraceptive methods. With the recompetition of the CCTN, clinical sites will perform Phase I, II, III, and Phase IV clinical trials of a wide variety of new or existing obese female contraceptive methods."
11131477,"While vaccines are available for SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus, and RSV, and our laboratory has advanced mAbs
and vaccines for hMPV, there has been a lack of research on parainfluenza virus (PIV) disease prevention and
treatment, despite being the second highest cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in young children.
Globally, PIVs cause 18 million ALRI cases, 700,000 hospital admissions, and 34,000 deaths in children younger
than five years of age each year. As a comparison, RSV causes nearly 60,000 deaths in children under 5 years
of age each year, while hMPV causes approximately 12,000 deaths in the same age range. Among adults,
severe disease can occur in those with immuncompromising conditions, especially those with hematopoietic
stem cell and solid organ transplants, as well as those with hematologic malignancy, with high resulting mortality
rates. PIVs are members of the Paramyxoviridae family, which consists of both endemic viruses as well as
zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. This R01 proposal seeks to advance the development of monoclonal
antibodies (mAbs) for the treatment of infectious diseases, which is a major priority of NIAID and our research
laboratory. Our major objective is to define the structural and mechanistic determinants mediating the
neutralization and protection against paramyxoviruses. For this proposal, we will specifically focus on the PIV
fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) surface proteins. In Aim 1, we will define the human B cell
repertoire to PIV HN and F in adults and children. We will leverage recent advances in single B cell sequencing
for the generation of human mAbs, which will then be assessed for neutralization potency, epitope specificity,
and interfering with the viral life cycle. In Aim 2, we will determine the optimal therapeutic strategy for anti-PIV
mAbs. We will utilize two rodent models, including Syrian golden hamsters for mAb screening, followed by cotton
rats for verification of therapeutic value. In Aim 3, we will determine the structural epitopes mediating antibody
functionality and protective efficacy. We will define these protective mAb epitopes at the molecular level using
cryo-electron microscopy, which will be essential to advancing the mAb candidates and future vaccine
candidates by identifying the optimal epitopes for mAb efficacy. With the recent approval of the first RSV vaccine,
and the critical use of antibody guided structure-based vaccine design to stabilize the RSV F protein in the pre-
fusion conformation, this proposal is conceptually innovative as we will incorporate recently described PIV pre-
fusion F proteins in our strategies, conduct the first in-depth B cell repertoire studies for PIV infection, and by the
exciting collaborations. Furthermore, this proposal is technically innovative as we will leverage state of the art
tools, including high-throughput single B cell sequencing and cryo-electron microscopy for determination of
protective and non-protective epitopes on the PIV surface proteins. Our research will advance the field by
developing new human mAb therapeutics for the treatment of PIV infection, and by defining protective epitopes
important for vaccine development for PIVs, which will translate to additional paramyxoviruses."
11131483,"Measles (MeV) causes disease worldwide despite efforts towards eradication by vaccine,
primarily because it is readily spread between people. Acute MeV infection causes immune
amnesia, increasing susceptibility to other infectious diseases. In addition, rare but severe
neurological complications can develop several years after measles due to persistent MeV
infection of the central nervous system. People with impaired cellular immunity are at increased
risk of developing severe measles but often cannot be vaccinated since the vaccine virus itself
can lead to fatal illness. There is no specific therapy for acute or persistent MeV manifestations.
A successful vaccination campaign could have eradicated MeV more than 20 years ago. As of
today, eradication is not in sight, and the resurgence of measles highlights the need for a
vaccination strategy that is safe for immune-compromised people and easy to be delivered around
the world without the need for a cold chain. We have designed a thermostable measles fusion
protein and shown that it induces protective immunity and neutralizing antibodies in vivo. We have
obtained structural data showing that our stabilized MeV F is in the expected pre-fusion state.
The recent approval of a stabilized respiratory syncytial virus fusion protein as a subunit vaccine
highlights the clinical validity of our strategy. This application will test whether we can design a
thermostable measles F that elicits protection in immune-compromised individuals and that can
be delivered worldwide. We propose to capitalize on our structural and functional knowledge of
the MeV F to optimize and assess the efficacy of thermostable forms of the F to elicit neutralizing

11131504,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ribosomes carry out protein synthesis in all cells, interpreting the information contained in the mRNA to
produce the proper amount of the correct protein. In addition, ribosomes also mediate mRNA quality control.
Thus, misassembled ribosomes can affect the sequence and abundance of proteins and mRNAs, thereby
disrupting protein homeostasis. This can lead to a number of diseases, demonstrating the importance of
ensuring ribosomes are accurately assembled, and produced in the correct numbers.
Using a combination of biochemical, genetic, genomic and structural tools, we will (i) investigate mechanisms
that promote proper incorporation of ribosomal proteins and folding of the RNA, (ii) dissect quality control
pathways to identify and ultimately degrade misassembled intermediates and (iii) study how misassembled
ribosomes promote disease.
In the first part, we will build on our existing work and study the late assembly of the ribosomal head, as well
as combine insights from recent structures and our biochemical work to understand how DEAD-box proteins
are used to construct ATP-dependent regulatory switches to control major conformational transitions in early
40S biogenesis.
In the second part, we will extend our work on quality control to investigate a possible proofreading
mechanism and identify degradation pathways for misassembled intermediates, a novel frontier for the field.
In the last part, we will investigate how ribosomes containing substoichiometric levels of two ribosomal
proteins, Asc1 and Rps10, which are produced in cancer cells that lack sufficient amounts of the assembly
factor Ltv1, promote disease. This work builds on a genetic system we have developed to separate ribosomes
of distinct composition, and also takes into consideration the known roles of these proteins in mRNA quality
control. In addition, we will also investigate the effects from dysregulation of ribosome numbers in disease.
Together, the proposed work will link mechanistic insights into a fundamental problem of cell and molecular
biology – how ribosomes are assembled, to human disease."
11131505,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Human schistosomiasis is a disease caused by species of the genus Schistosoma,
which globally affects over 200 million people. The major species affecting humans are:
S. mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum. There is currently only one method of
treatment (monotherapy), the drug Praziquantel (PZQ). Constant selection pressure
through mass chemotherapy – this year alone will see the administration of over 250
million doses – has yielded evidence of resistance to PZQ. This has been observed in
both the laboratory and field. The goal of this research is to develop a second drug with
a different mode of action for use in conjunction with PZQ to improve the efficacy of
treatment and mitigate resistance. Previous treatment of S. mansoni included, among
others, the use of oxamniquine (OXA), a prodrug that is taken up by the schistosome
and enzymatically activated within S.mansoni but is ineffective against S. haematobium
and S. japonicum. The OXA activating enzyme was identified as a sulfotransferase
(SmSULT). The focus of this research was to reengineer OXA to be more effective
against S. mansoni and effective against S. haematobium and S. japonicum. We
employed an iterative process in which structural data is used to inform compound
design and chemical synthesis of derivatives, which are then tested in an in vitro killing
assay. The compounds that are best killers are soaked into new crystals and the
process repeated. Over 350 OXA derivatives have been synthesized including CIDD-
0150303 that will kill 100% S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum in an in vitro
assay. This derivative also will kill a significant number of schistosomes in an in vivo
model of schistosomiasis. We propose to optimize the leading/top derivative to improve
solubility, bioavailability, prolong it’s action and perform safety and toxicity studies.
These studies will also include determining the physical chemical properties of the
derivative and improvement of desirable drug properties. An additional major focus will
be on the impact of combination therapy with PZQ. The outcome of the proposed
studies will be a novel drug that in combination with PZQ will have a significant impact
on global human health and will lead to improved treatments for Schistosoma to reduce
the morbidity, morality, and transmission rates associated with schistosomiasis. The
Major deliverable will be an OXA derivative that results in a new anthelmintic
candidate ready for formulation, scale-up, and clinical studies."

 Under PAR-19-253, the NIGMS seeks new technologies that create a positive feedback loop that drives
science forward by allowing new questions to be asked and new discoveries to be made, which in turn drives
the development of new technologies. The Benner group has, for 30 years, contributed to this NIGMS vision,
developing new technologies for NextGen DNA sequencing and NextGen DNA synthesis, bioinformatic and
evolutionary analyses, dynamic combinatorial chemistry for drug discovery, protein engineering, and new
platforms that make multiplexed diagnostics easy, platforms used today to manage the COVID pandemic.
 Here, we offer the NIGMS another transformative tool, a platform to allow researchers to choose a
protein target and create a reagent (an AEGISZyme) that chemically transforms bound proteins. Such
reagents have been sought for 40 years with only limited success.
 We will focus on one transformation: AEGISZymes that add an acyl group to an amino group on a lysine of the
bound target, where the acylation reagent is an ester. This acylation may inactivate the targeted protein, allow-
ing researchers to test hypotheses about the role of that protein in biology. It may carry a payload which, when
internalized with the target protein, carry drugs or stabilized AEGISZymes into a cell. It may fluorescently tag
the protein to help clinicians cut away fluorescing cancer cells selectively as they resect a tumor.
 To achieve this transformative and innovative outcome, we will apply laboratory in vitro evolution (LIVE) to
artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS). The platform will be delivered by meeting 3 Aims:
Aim 1. We will use AEGIS-LIVE to deliver AEGISZymes that acylate lysines in target proteins with pass/fail
reaction times of <10 sec-1. To test this, we will create these AEGISZymes that use a co-substrate carrying an
ester group for three targets. Rates of the selected AEGISZymes will be quantitated, specificity will be metricked
against similar targets with slightly different amino acid sequences, and modification sites will be found,
Aim 2. We will use AEGIS-LIVE to deliver AEGISZymes that acylate lysines on researcher-chosen targets with
turnover, with pass/fail turnovers of >1000 and kcat/KM of >105 M-1 sec-1. Turnover rates will be metricked
under physiological and laboratory conditions, and correlated to duplex stability from thermodynamic data.
Aim 3. We will use AEGIS-LIVE to deliver mirror AEGISZymes that are stable in biological systems, including
transport into cells. This will allow AEGISZymes to be used in biological media, to support nanotrain toxin
delivery, and to set the stage to use these molecules in vivo.
Aim 4. We will test the scope of the platform to address design parameters, such as how long random regions
should be, how good loops are as full protein surrogates, and how sequence space is searched.
 Last, to lay to rest any view that AEGIS-LIVE is too ""cumbersome"", we will create distributable kits that allow
their recipients to make their own AEGISZymes. This is the ultimate in authentication and reproducibility."

the SCD population. To accomplish these objectives, CIBMTR’s data collection systems will require
expansion with minor modifications in the clinical data systems and more significant modifications to the
ePRO system to accommodate SCD pediatric patient PRO data collection. In a role of honest broker, CIBMTR
will create a separate, secure environment for ongoing linking of disparate data sources and a process to
create a Unique Study ID. CIBMTR will develop a robust plan for implementing the model that will document
project-specific requirements and describe patient inclusion, variable selection, statistical analytics, patient
level linking, dataset delivery, and other design considerations, including protocol development and additional
consent if necessary. Finally, CIBMTR will tailor its standard PRO measures and data collection system to
collect important information about the SCD patient population and will develop new processes to include
innovative techniques for long-term follow-up and patient engagement. The requested supplemental funds will
support the above efforts as well as additional forms reimbursement funding for centers, a center participation
incentive, and PRO survey reimbursement for participants. While the requested center and participant
reimbursement does not fully cover the true cost of data submission, it can be an important influence of
consistent and reliable engagement. The end product of this initiative will be ongoing collection and sharing
of reliable and validated, de-identified data, specifically designed for use in the CGT Access Model and
uniquely capable of understanding the patient care journey and clinical outcomes of the SCD population."

The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, has infected a reported
13,810,247 persons globally as of July 16, 2020 with a mortality rate of 4.2%. In the
State of Louisiana, over 7.3% of the 86,411 COVID-19 cases involve people living with
cancer. Treatment with convalescent serum or plasma is currently widely used in the
setting of experimental trials and ad hoc. Theoretically, convalescent plasma contains
protective antibodies that neutralizes virus and mitigates its pathogenic effects. Yet,
there remains a large gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that drive humoral
and cellular immune responses and how these responses correlate with disease course
and protection as well as the durability of those responses. Furthermore, there is a need
for serological assays that measure these responses accurately for serodiagnosis and
as correlates of immunity and protection. Without this knowledge, the true efficacy of
convalescent plasma as therapy for COVID-19 and our understanding of the humoral
immune response to SARS-CoV-2, especially in immunocompromised patients, will
remain unknown.
A central hypothesis of our proposal is that the humoral immune responses to SARS-
CoV-2 is protective in the short-term but appears to lack durability. However, a second
hypothesis is that some remnant of immunity will be retained which will prevent
recurrence of COVID19 but not necessarily re-infection. The overall mission of the
Tulane University Convalescent Antibody and Immunity Network (TUCAIN) is to
characterize this response with respect to functionality and durability.
We will achieve these goals by studying a diverse cohort of COVID-19 survivors and
minimally sick seroconverters. Using serial blood collections, we will apply several
immunological technologies to study the evolution and durability of the immune
response over time. We will also correlate these responses to patient outcomes and
disease pathogenesis using a “big data”, systems biology approach. An approach, such
as the one we propose, will allow us to determine if COVID-19 survivors develop long-
term, antibody-based protection and we can confirm if convalescent plasma has
therapeutic potential. This research will allow us to identify new targets for medicines
and vaccines, inform personalized treatment strategies such as those required by
immunocompromised patients with cance or HIV infection, and to provide novel
immunological algorithms applicable to a wide range of human pathogens."

Our parent R01 titled “Multi-parametric anthropomorphic MRI Phantoms technology for reliable and reproducible
structural and quantitative MRI” aims to develop materials, technology, tools and processes for manufacturing
quantitative anthropomorphic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) phantoms. Unlike existing solutions, which
often use discrete compartments or geometrical shapes filled with solutions representing a single physical
parameter, the aim is to enable fabrication of phantoms that truly mimic the contrast heterogeneity of tissue in
3D. Motivated by a rising need for quantitative measurements in MRI driven by precision medicine and the use
of data science tools for biomarker discovery. With the rise of methods such as fingerprinting, and accelerated
reconstruction, quantitative MRI (qMRI) is closer to the clinics than ever. However, quality control with a
quantitative MRI phantom that mimics the complexity of tissue structure and contrast mechanism is necessary
to ensure the accuracy of the results. Between 2014-17 the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) hosted workshops working towards standardizing qMRI. The recommendation paper lists outstanding
needs, which the parent grant aims to address, and will be partially addressed by this administrative
supplementary. The original parent grant lists two approaches: (a) Quantitative 3D stack of thin slices. This
approach is inexpensive and easy to reproduce by labs with moderate equipment and skills. (b) An advanced
approach of boundaryless fully 3D phantoms that will be fabricated via inkjet 3D printing of hydrogels and plastics
and would enable true high resolution 3D structures with heterogeneity that mimics human anatomy. Our
phantoms will be based on digital design (brain-web and the MGH phantom) and hence will have a digital twin
for comparison with the physical phantoms. The progress we made through Y1 of the parent grant is enabling
us to achieve a milestone of a phantom which is based on both brain-web and the MGH phantom, is made of a
few thick slabs which provide true 3D morphology and without boundaries. This phantom will mimic B0, B1, Brain
morphology and quantitative relaxation parameters for accurate contrast. Use cases include: protocol
development for research clinic and industry, system calibration validation and Q/A for morphology and qMRI,
MRI receive and transmitter coil development, Image reconstruction performance validation. Testing, validation
and Q/A of automatic prescription methods."

11160118,"Project summary:
 Chimeric antigen receptor T (CART) cells have transformed the cancer therapy paradigm by genetically
engineering a patient's own T cells to specifically kill cells expressing the targeted antigen, such as CD19 for B
cell malignancies. CART cell proliferation and formation of memory CART cells result in complete B cell
depletion and durable remission of otherwise refractory B cell cancers. We re-designed CART technology for
autoimmune disease therapy by utilizing an autoantigen as the extracellular domain of a chimeric autoantibody
receptor (CAAR), linked to cytoplasmic T cell receptor costimulatory and activation domains. CAARs direct T
cell cytotoxicity against autoantigen-specific B cells by targeting their B cell receptor, a surface-bound
autoantibody identical in specificity to the autoantibody the B cell will secrete once activated to mature into a
plasmablast. We established proof-of-concept for CAAR safety and efficacy in experimental models of
pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a potentially fatal blistering disease caused by autoantibodies to the epithelial
adhesion protein desmoglein 3 (DSG3). If CAARs for autoimmunity prove to be as effective as CARs for B cell
cancers, CAAR T cells could represent a one-time treatment leading to autoimmune disease cure.
 An open-label, dose-escalation, first-in-human phase 1 trial to determine the safety and tolerability of
DSG3 CAAR T cell therapy (DSG3-CAART) in mucosal-dominant pemphigus vulgaris has been initiated.
DSG3-CAART is the first precision cellular immunotherapy for autoimmune disease to enter clinical trials,
which presents a unique opportunity to define the immunomodulatory effects of this novel therapeutic approach
in humans. DSG3-CAART is designed to specifically eliminate DSG3-reactive memory B cells that replenish
the autoantibody-producing plasmablasts in PV. Depletion of anti-DSG3 memory B cells could remove a key
driver of DSG3-specific T cell activation, and DSG3-CAART persistence may induce changes in global T cell
subset composition and/or cytokine milieu, resulting in dual mechanisms for disease remission through both
the B and T cell compartments. The proposal will evaluate the hypothesis that DSG3-CAART will reset immune
tolerance in PV by depleting DSG3-reactive B cells and normalizing pathologic T cell subsets, potentially
leading to safe and lasting disease remission."

women’s cardiovascular health, and e) maternal health and impact on the life course. We propose to fund
three scholars annually, with initial appointments of two years with an option to be considered for a third year."
11127906,"Obesity is a chronic progressive disease that leads to the development of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes, which are among the top ten leading causes of death in the United States. The initiation and progression of obesity-related diseases is strongly associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, and the NLRP3 inflammasome is a key sensor that instigates inflammation in obesity. Targeting NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated inflammation should curb or prevent the disease progression and thus holds therapeutic promise to combat obesity-related diseases. However, effective and safe strategies that specifically inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome in obesity have not been developed for patient treatment. As such, the long- term goal of our research is to develop a new dietary strategy or therapeutic modality to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activity and inflammation in obesity and obesity-related diseases. As an initial step, this project will define the role of chive-derived exosome-like nanoparticles (C-ELNs) in suppressing inflammation in obesity. Our pilot studies found that C-ELNs strongly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in primary macrophages. One of their bioactive molecules, 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glcyero-3-phosphocholine, was identified as an inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Oral administration of C-ELNs, started concomitantly with high-fat diet feeding, reduced NLRP3 inflammasome activity and improved metabolic health in the C57BL/6J mice. Building on our preliminary work, this project will test the central hypothesis that C-ELNs contain active biomolecules that inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity and ameliorate inflammation in obesity. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1) identify active biomolecules in C-ELNs that inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activity and 2) define the role of C-ELNs and their active biomolecules in suppressing inflammation in obesity. Successful completion of the proposed research be the first step toward the translation of C-ELNs and active biomolecules into an intervention to suppress NLRP3 inflammasome activity and inflammation in obesity. Utilizing dietary ELNs to target the NLRP3 inflammasome is an innovative approach. The unique features of dietary ELNs, including tissue bioavailability, bioactivity, and biomolecule protection and delivery, as well as their abundance in edible plants confer upon them high translational potential."

Despite high global vaccination rates, pertussis caused by the gram-negative bacterial pathogen Bordetella
pertussis (Bp) is re-emerging in vaccinated individuals. This is correlated with the switch in the 1990s from whole
cell (wPV) to acellular vaccines (aPV). wPV elicit TH1/TH17 polarized immune responses and clear Bp from the
entire respiratory tract. In contrast, aPV elicit TH2 polarized immunity and do not prevent nasal colonization.
Thus, aPV immunized individuals serve as reservoirs for transmission to vulnerable populations.
While the importance of CD4+ T cells for long-term protection against Bp infection is established, the antigens
recognized by the T cells remain undefined. Using high dimensional mass spectrometry and functional T cell
assays we identified several new antigens from Bp that generate tissue-resident memory T cell responses in
mice and are recognized by CD4+ T cells from wPV immunized people. In this application we will test the efficacy
of a subunit vaccine containing these antigens and the TH1/TH17 polarizing adjuvants Bordetella Colonization
Factor A (BcfA) and double mutant heat-labile toxin (dmLT). These adjuvants activate immune responses through
different mechanisms and elicit mucosal immunity. We hypothesize that these vaccines will elicit long-lived
TH1/TH17 tissue-resident T cell responses in the nose and lungs, and clear Bp from the nose, thereby reducing
the likelihood of Bp transmission by vaccinated individuals.
Specific Aim 1: To test the ability of an intranasal subunit booster vaccine containing new T cell
recognized antigens to reduce Bp colonization in aPV primed adult mice.
We will test an intranasal (i.n) booster vaccine containing the TH1/TH17 polarizing adjuvant BcfA, admixed with
detoxified pertussis toxin and three new T cell antigens, in mice previously immunized intramuscularly (i.m) with
an approved aPV. The systemic and mucosal T cell and antibody responses will be quantified, along with the
phagocytes recruited to the respiratory tract, and the Bp bacterial load in the nose and lungs.
Specific Aim 2: To test the immunogenicity and protective efficacy in infant mice of a subunit vaccine
delivered by a heterologous immunization regimen.
We will test the novel T cell antigens combined with the adjuvants dmLT and BcfA, separately and together.
Vaccines containing dmLT will be tested by the i.d route and vaccines containing BcfA will be tested by the i.d or
i.n route. Immune responses, bacterial load and the longevity of protection will be determined.
IMPACT: There is a critical need for next generation pertussis vaccines that elicit mucosal immunity and prevent
nasal colonization. The proposed experiments will test a vaccine formulation containing novel MHC Class II
presented antigens that will provide sustained protection against Bp infection as a booster and as a pediatric
vaccine. These foundational studies will lead to a safe and effective next generation pertussis vaccine that will
prevent transmission and thereby reduce the burden of the disease pertussis."

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the fastest growing cause of liver cancer and liver transplant in the U.S.
There is currently no approved treatment for NASH and the mechanistic understanding of why some patients
with fatty liver maintain a benign condition while others progress to NASH is not clear. Macrophages play a
pivotal role in NASH pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence suggest that ‘triggering receptor expressed on
myeloid cells’ (TREM2) is overexpressed in NASH associated macrophages. Interestingly, even though TREM2
expression is increased during NASH, its absence exacerbates NASH and fibrosis development. This indicates
that TREM2 is protective in NASH and fibrosis progression. However, the mechanism of TREM2 signaling
remains poorly understood.
Moreover, upon ligand engagement, TREM2 gets cleaved from the cell surface into a soluble form (sTREM2)
that can be detected in the serum. We found that sTREM2 levels increase with NAFLD and NASH progression,
however, the trans-signaling axis of sTREM2 is an area that has not been addressed in the field yet. sTREM2
has the ability to soak up inflammatory ligands such as LPS and lipids as well as bind to macrophages. However,
whether sTREM2 can bind and influence downstream signaling in other cells remain unknown. We discovered
that sTREM2 itself has NASH protective as well as therapeutic abilities. Introduction of sTREM2 fragment into
mice that already had advanced NASH had profound effects on NASH and fibrosis resolution.
The goal of this proposal is to better understand how TREM2 exerts its protective functions and dissect the
intracellular and trans-signaling axes of TREM2.
We will use mouse models of NASH and HCC that closely mimics diet induced metabolic syndrome and human
NASH gene signature as well as primary cultures of both mouse and human liver cells in order to assess the
following 2 Specific Aims: Aim 1 will identify the key intracellular TREM2 signaling pathways that exerts its
protective actions in controlling NASH development. We will also identify the transcription factors responsible for
TREM2 expression in NASH associated macrophages. Aim 2 will elucidate the trans-signaling properties of
sTREM2 and whether sTREM2 is directly involved in disease progression. The proposed studies will provide
key insights into the mechanisms of NASH and HCC development. The findings from this study will lay the
foundation for future development and refinement of sTREM2 as a novel therapeutic agent for NASH-Fibrosis
and HCC."

The primary goal of this administrative supplement project is to characterize, optimize and disseminate the
optical phantoms mimicking microvascular cerebral blood flow (CBF). In our parent R15 study (EB034986)
entitled “Affordable Shortwave Infrared Spectroscopy for Stroke Risk Screening in Children with Sickle Cell
Disease“, we have proposed to construct the advanced multilayered microfluidic phantoms to verify our
prototyped optical flowmeter. Traditionally, the most common optical flow phantom is simply a bulk liquid wherein
blood flow is manipulated by adjusting temperature, viscosity or particle size. The proposed phantoms here
address the limitations of conventional laboratory-based optical phantoms by mimicking the multiple features of
brain flow models: 1) two-layer features: extracerebral and cerebral layer with varying thickness of the
extracerebral layer, 2) optical (scattering and absorption coefficients) properties and physiologically relevant flow
rate of each layer 3) micro-sized multi-channel flow mimicking the dimension of arterioles, capillaries and venules.
For this purpose, the overall objective of this administrative supplement is to characterize and optimize the
multilayered microfluidic phantoms built using both non-cleanroom and cleanroom methods. We envision the
proposed phantoms will be employed for 1) evaluation the basic performance of the developed optical flowmeter,
2) daily-basis quality check before any clinical measurements 3) benchmark reference for comparison of the
different technologies. Successful completion of this proposed project will pave the way towards the first-ever
standardized multilayered micro-sized flow phantoms to improve repeatability, reproducibility and quantification
of the diffuse optics technologies that have the potential for clinical translation as a bedside tool for CBF
monitoring."

will provide scientific advice in these areas. Training: Specific training in intervention design and evaluation –
specifically incorporating implementation science, social and behavioral methods, and patient preference – will
be achieved through intensive mentored training and formal coursework. This, combined with the experience
gained through implementing my research aims, will establish Dr. Phillips’ independent research career
investigating interventions to support lifelong HIV care. Research: The specific aims of this research are to: 1)
characterize existing practices for providing RTC ART support and patient experience following RTC, 2) refine
existing community-based and mHealth ART support interventions based on RTC patient preferences for
modifiable attributes, and 3) determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact of offering a choice
of ART support intervention to RTC patients. The results of this study will inform our understanding of RTC
ART support including the role of patient choice. They will provide preliminary data needed to apply for an R01

11128165,"Project Summary/Abstract:
Superoxide is a toxic molecule that all organisms exposed to oxygen must cope with. This is particularly true for
pathogenic microbes, as the host harnesses the toxic properties of superoxide to combat invaders via the
oxidative burst. To detoxify superoxide, nearly all forms of life, including strict anaerobes, produce superoxide
dismutase (SOD). Convergent evolution has led to the development of three independent SOD families, all of
which are dependent on metals for function. The most widely distributed family of SODs are those which depend
on iron (Fe) or manganese (Mn) for function. Members of the Fe/Mn superfamily are present in eukaryotes,
archaea, and bacteria. Despite over forty years of study, it is not possible to predict accurately the metal utilized
by members of the Fe/Mn superfamily of SODs. Difficulties in predicting metalloprotein metal utilization are not
confined to the Fe/Mn SOD superfamily but also occur with other classes of metalloenzymes. This deficiency is
driven by relatively low levels of protein sequence identity amongst SODs from different organisms that utilize
the same metal cofactor. Additionally, the environmental and molecular factors that dictate the metal used by
members of this protein superfamily are also unknown. Members of the Fe/Mn SOD superfamily are canonically
thought to use either Fe or Mn, but not both, as a cofactor. This idea arose despite early investigations that
identified Fe/Mn SOD family members that are active with both Fe and Mn. The ability of these “cambialistic”
SODs (able to use either Fe or Mn as a catalytic cofactor) was dismissed as a quirk of chemistry. At the time, it
was thought that intracellular metal concentrations did not change enough to alter the metal bound by a SOD.
S. aureus possesses two superoxide dismutases, SodA and SodM, which are ~75% identical. Initially, both
SODs were reported to be Mn-dependent. During infection, the host restricts the availability of Mn and inactivates
Mn-dependent SODs via the Mn-binding immune protein calprotectin. Recent work discovered that SodM
critically contributes to the ability of S. aureus to maintain a defense against oxidative stress when Mn-starved,
both in culture and during infection, while SodA is important when Mn is freely available. Biochemical analyses
revealed that SodM is not strictly Mn-dependent but is instead cambialistic, and the ability to use Fe enables it
to promote resistance to oxidative stress when S. aureus is Mn-limited by the host. These observations support
a physiological role for cambialism and the hypothesis that metal availability shapes the repertoire of SODs
possessed by an organism. The experiments in this proposal will evaluate this hypothesis and elucidate the
molecular features that dictate metal utilization in the Fe/Mn SOD superfamily. Aim I: Elucidate the molecular
features that dictate metal utilization of Fe/Mn SOD superfamily members. Aim II: Determine if environmental
metal availability promotes retention of a metal-specific and cambialistic SOD by S. aureus. Aim III: Elucidate
the broader contribution of cambialistic SODs to maintaining a defense against superoxide."

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), an advanced form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is one of
the major causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is currently no approved treatment for
NASH and patients with advanced fibrosis are at highest risk of mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD).
Furthermore, presence of NAFLD increases the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by about 80%. It is not
known how NASH and CKD influence each other, but together they can influence CVD and patient mortality.
Therefore, a therapeutic target that can improve NASH and its associated co-morbidities such as CKD and CVD
will be of great benefit in clinics.
 We found that Ubiquitin D (UBD) is highly upregulated in NASH livers (primarily in the hepatocytes), HCC
tumors and kidneys of CKD mice. Interestingly, UBD was recently found to be one of the six progression-related
genes that play a vital role in the progression of NAFLD and positively correlates with steatosis, ballooning,
inflammation, fibrosis and NAS score. Similarly, multiple reports link renal UBD to proteinuria and kidney disease.
UBD is known to participate in alternative ubiquitination pathway and interact with key cellular proteins such as
p53, p62 and MAD2 but the precise mechanism of its role in NASH/HCC and CKD remains unclear. Absence of
UBD (in Ubd-/- mice) improved overall metabolic health and extended the mouse lifespan. Despite all the
compelling evidences, UBD has not been tested as a therapeutic target for NASH and CKD. Here, we propose
to suppress UBD using anti-sense oligos (ASOs) as a therapeutic approach to treat NASH and CKD. We have
already developed a “GalNAc” conjugated ASO that is potent in suppressing UBD gene expression in the
hepatocytes. Our preliminary data indicates that anti-UBD GalNAc-ASO significantly improved NASH and
fibrosis. According to our knowledge, UBD pathway has not been investigated for its therapeutic potential before
and also is not a current focus of any industry or academia. Therefore, UBD is a novel target and anti-UBD ASOs
provide novel therapeutic leads with a potential to improve both NASH and CKD.
 We will take advantage of a unique pre-clinical mouse model of diet-induced NASH that also develop
CKD and CVD with mortality at later stages (established in our lab). We will address whether anti-UBD ASOs
could improve all three disease outcome along with survival benefit. We will supplement this model with
additional preclinical models of NASH, HCC and CKD. The following 2 Specific Aims will be addressed in this
proposal: Aim 1 will Identify whether UBD suppression prevents NASH and its progression to Cirrhosis and
HCC. Additionally, we will translate our findings to human using human primary cell derived 3-D spheroid cell
cultures. Aim 2 will investigate the effect of UBD suppression on CKD, CVD and survival benefit either in the
context of NASH and/or CKD. Successful completion of the proposed aims will establish UBD as a novel
therapeutic target for NASH and CKD."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that results in persistent and chronic lung infections which reduce
lung function over time. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), an opportunistic bacterial pathogen that infects
patient’s lungs at a young age and persists throughout life, is a major contributing factor. Why antibiotic
treatments against Pa ultimately fail remains unclear, but one plausible explanation is that the organism
resides in spatially organized aggregates within the CF lung, where cells adapt to the host environment and
evade immune responses and resist therapeutic interventions. It was recently shown that environmental
factors such as host derived polymers (e.g. mucin & eDNA) influence the organization of bacterial
aggregates, while changes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-specific antigen (OSA) structure drives the
formation of different aggregate-types and limit the physical impact of polymers due to alterations in cell
surface hydrophobicity. This suggests a crucial interplay between cell surface properties and the physical
features of the environment, which potentially sheds new light on the role of OSA in CF lungs in helping to
enhance or reduce cooperative and competitive interactions between cells. This study will therefore focus on
understanding how changes in LPS composition influences aggregate-type and cooperative interactions in
heterogenous populations of Pa sourced from CF lungs. The main goals are to (i) determine the changes in
frequency of Pa isolates with differential OSA structure in CF airways; (ii) investigate the role of LPS on cell
surface hydrophobicity, aggregate assembly type and spatial organization of Pa populations; (iii) assess how
aggregate-type and alginate production influence tolerance to antibiotics and (iv) evaluate the impact of
spatial organization on social dynamics in Pa populations. The research described in this project will provide
valuable insights into how the hydrophobicity of the bacterial cell surface which is dictated by the LPS-type,
influences aggregate formation and social interactions. A deeper understanding of this will help inform as to
how and why Pa variants co-exist in chronic infections and why social behaviors are maintained or lost. In the
future, these ideas and findings can be extended to other social traits and microbiome studies involving
multiple species."
11128283,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a unique example of a bone marrow failure disorder that improves with drug
treatment. Glucocorticoids increase red blood cell production in most DBA patients, but the underlying
mechanism of clinical efficacy was unclear until recently. I identified a phenomenon where mouse burst forming
unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cells progress through a continuum of developmental states during transit-amplification;
glucocorticoid treatment decreases the degree of developmental progression per cell cycle, resulting in a greater
number of transit-amplifying cell divisions before the onset of erythroid terminal differentiation (Developmental
Cell, 2019). Conversely, TGFβ treatment of BFU-Es increases rate of developmental progression and decreases
overall BFU-E proliferative capacity. My findings defined a novel developmental biology paradigm where rate of
progenitor cell developmental progression regulates balance of proliferation and differentiation, and total cellular
output. Insights into the mechanisms by which glucocorticoids and TGFβ regulate proliferative capacity remain
elusive, and the conclusions from my mouse erythropoiesis studies must be directly tested in human
erythropoiesis. I will identify the target genes of glucocorticoid and TGFβ signaling in BFU-Es using nascent
transcriptome profiling and chromatin occupancy and architecture profiling. Furthermore, I will use single cell
RNA sequencing of normal and DBA patient bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells to compare
glucocorticoid and TGFβ effects on mouse erythropoiesis and human erythropoiesis. My proposed studies will:
(i) contribute broadly to our understanding of pathophysiology and treatment principles in bone marrow failure,
(ii) further develop a novel field within developmental biology that arose from my earlier postdoctoral work, and
(iii) provide ample opportunities for mechanistic and translational follow-up for my transition to independence.
I am a physician-scientist seeking K08 support for mentored research under the guidance of Dr. Harvey Lodish

11129405,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The proposed K23 career development award in clinical and translational research will form a foundation for Dr.
Yuan Liu to become an independent clinician-scientist, with expertise on severe early childhood caries (S-ECC).
The K23 training objectives progress in a sequential fashion and will support her development of key expertise
in 3 areas: 1) developing advanced skills in designing and conducting clinical studies; 2) acquiring advanced
knowledge and methods in fungal biology and microbiome; 3) improving scientific communication, grant writing
skills and networking. The candidate will acquire experience in directing longitudinal study and essential training
by making the use of the extensive resources at the University of Pennsylvania and capitalizing on an
interdisciplinary mentoring committee with broad, complementary expertise in clinical research, epidemiology,
bioengineering, microbiome, and bioinformatics. S-ECC is a major public health problem characterized by
dysbiotic oral microbial burden leading to a persistent and virulent biofilm on the teeth of toddlers that causes
rampant tooth decay. This process not only destroys the dentition but can also have a negative impact on the
general health, such as complicated systemic infections, and the well-being of young children. Emerging clinical
evidence has spotlighted the potential role of Candida albicans in S-ECC. Furthermore, our retrospective study
using electronic health records (EHR) from six major children’s hospitals revealed that, oral thrush
(oropharyngeal candidiasis or OPC) detection in toddlers less than 12 months of age was strongly associated
with the development of dental caries soon after, particularly between 13 and 36 months. However, only cross-
sectional human studies have been performed thus far. Longitudinal studies are warranted to better assess the
causal association between OPC and S-ECC in toddlers. In parallel, further studies are needed to determine the
fungal role in caries and if Candida colonization in oral cavity could be a reliable clinical marker for risk of S-ECC.
To address this, the proposed research will be focused on conducting a 2-year prospective longitudinal study to
investigate the association between early OPC and the progression of S-ECC, and the impact of Candida
colonization on the functional plaque microbiome and biofilm virulence. Dr. Liu will investigate 3 specific aims:
(1) examine the association between early OPC and S-ECC development in a cohort of infants; (2) evaluate the
influence of OPC and Candida colonization on the plaque microbiome in infants; (3) study the role of Candida
on biofilm cariogenic properties. Results from this clinical and translational effort will further elucidate the causal
link between OPC and S-ECC, and enhance the understanding of fungal contributions to the etiopathogenesis
of S-ECC. Collectively, these results will provide future opportunities for mechanistic clinical studies and
developing targeted strategies for preventing S-ECC. This K23 award will provide Dr. Liu with new knowledge in
the areas essential to her career goals as a clinician-scientist, implement the proposed research plan and build
an independent research program with the goal of receiving an R01 prior to the end of the K23 award."
11161061,"PROJECT 2: OK-LUNG-SCAN OK: PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN)
populations, especially in rural Oklahoma where the AI/AN population has significantly worse lung cancer
incidence rates, survival, and death than the general population. In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial
demonstrated a 20% decrease in lung cancer mortality using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for lung
cancer screening (LCS). After more than two decades, LCS uptake remains slow in tribal communities,
particularly rural ones, that often have high rates of smoking and limited access to cancer diagnostic and
treatment services. To address this knowledge and implementation gap, we propose the Lung Cancer
Screening to Improve Equity in Tribal Communities in Oklahoma (Lung Screen Tribal OK) study, which seeks
to co-design, test, and implement a theory-driven, tribally informed health system-wide LCS program in
collaboration with Cherokee Nation Health Services (CNHS) and Cherokee Nation Public Health (CNPH).
CNHS is the largest tribal healthcare system in the US and operates nine health centers located in rural
northeastern Oklahoma. CNPH links CNHS with smoking cessation services and has resources to address
transportation and other social needs that can impede LCS receipt. Lung Screen Tribal OK features the
following specific aims: (1) Identify individual, community, socio-economic, tribally informed, and health system
facilitators and barriers that affect LCS implementation and access to smoking cessation services; (2) Co-
design and pilot test a tailored LCS program, including the key components of system-wide LCS navigators,
care process improvements, shared decision-making support, LCS registry with outreach functions, smoking
cessation/referral services, and patient access/transportation support; (3) Measure the impact of the improved
LCS program in a learning health system-based, sequential, pair-matched cluster implementation study,
assessing implementation process outcomes at the clinician-, practice-, and health system levels using the
PRISM-REAIM framework; and (4) Disseminate lessons learned and resources developed to other tribal
communities and health systems in Oklahoma and beyond. Lung Screen Tribal OK will bridge the gap between
evidence and clinical practice for LCS in a high-need setting by intervening at the level of the healthcare
system. System-level interventions for guideline implementation tend to be understudied compared to those
evaluating individual-level, behavioral interventions. However, the careful development and evaluation of an
LCS screening program at the level of the healthcare system is critical to ensuring that more patients will
receive LCS. Lung Screen Tribal OK will establish an effective LCS program in a tribal system and thus
provide a direct benefit to the Cherokee Nation by increasing LCS participation. By increasing screening for
early stage lung cancer, Lung Screen Tribal OK could ultimately reduce lung cancer mortality in AI/AN
communities, many of which are in great need of effective strategies to reduce longstanding cancer disparities."
11161062,"PROJECT 3: C3PO CARE COORDINATION: PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite significant improvements in their overall health, AI/AN populations continue to face marked disparities
in cancer outcomes. While reasons for this are multifactorial, suboptimal coordination of care contributes to
fragmented care, less comprehensive supportive services, and delayed access to cancer treatment.
Coordination of care between the AI/AN health care system and cancer care systems is particularly
challenging due to the need to coordinate health services for patients across multiple agencies, levels of
government, and the private sector. The AI/AN health care system comprises the federally operated Indian
Health Service, tribally operated health services, and Urban Indian Health Clinics, collectively known as the
ITU system. ITUs must generally refer their patients with cancer to non-ITU specialists, who may not
understand the nuances of the ITU referral processes, nor understand locally relevant Indigenous Knowledge
and values. These barriers lead to decreased access to cancer care services and delays in treatment. The
Care Coordination and Communication Program in Oncology for Tribal Health Systems (C3PO)
proposes to improve cancer outcomes for AI/AN patients by implementing a novel, navigation-based,
collaborative care model grounded in Indigenous Knowledge and centered on telehealth care coordination
meetings, or “Huddles,” between an NCI designated cancer center and ITU facilities. C3PO will test the
implementation and effectiveness of this patient-centered intervention comprising clinical and supportive staff
from the Stephenson Cancer Center and partnering ITU facilities in Oklahoma. This project features a hybrid
effectiveness-implementation type I randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving AI/AN patients to assess
C3PO's impact on patient-reported and clinical outcomes. Specific aims include: (1) Explore the unique needs
of AI/AN persons with cancer to inform C3PO's approaches to addressing these needs from the perspectives
of AI/AN patients, caregivers, referring ITU clinicians, and SCC clinicians; (2) Assess the impact of C3PO on
patient-reported and clinical outcomes in an RCT, hypothesizing that participants assigned to C3PO will have
higher patient-reported satisfaction, fewer missed visits, treatment initiation, and fewer treatment interruptions
compared with participants assigned to usual care; and (3) Identify facilitators and barriers for C3PO
implementation, adoption, and maintenance using the PRISM RE-AIM framework and cost of the
implementation and maintenance to assess sustainability. By bridging communication gaps between ITUs and
a large cancer center, C3PO seeks to improve cancer outcomes for AI/AN patients with cancer through a novel
and scalable collaborative care coordination to address the clinical, financial, social, and cultural needs of
AI/AN cancer patients."

The R-CASA contract, which is focused on HIV vaccine development, will provide an opportunity to develop new approaches to assess optimal HIV immunogens-adjuvants formulations prior to transitioning into clinical trials. R-CASA will 1) generate and propose standardized protocols and endpoint assays for rational and systematic down-screening of HIV immunogen-adjuvant formulations, 2) apply those protocols and assays to screen HIV immunogen-adjuvant formulations, and 3) screen additional immunogens and adjuvants at the direction of NIAID. These efforts will delineate a standardized set of assays for biochemical and immunological characterization of HIV immunogen-adjuvant formulations, down-selection workflow, and go-no-go criteria to maximize the successful transition of immunogen-adjuvant formulations from the pre-clinical testing to First in-Humans (FIH) trials."
11174125,"We aim to undertake an epidemiologic assessment of the SCD population in Delaware using statewide surveillance data. We will partner with the Delaware Sickle Cell Disease Collection Program (DSCDC) and leverage the surveillance data compiled by the program. The DSCDC brings together major healthcare systems, clinical experts, and data sources for patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) across the lifespan. Our collaboration will capture data for an estimated 90% of all patients with SCD within the program infrastructure. The data sources include the Delaware all-payer claims database anchored by the Delaware Health Information Network (DHIN), State Medicaid, vital records, newborn screening program (NBS), hospital discharge and emergency department records, and clinical records. We will use a validated case definition based on specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision - Clinical Modification (ICD-9 CM), and Tenth Revision codes (ICD-10) to identify persons with SCD from these sources. Specifically, we will require a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis to count an individual as a confirmed SCD case. In contrast, probable cases will be defined as those with no laboratory-confirmed diagnosis but with three or more inpatient, emergency department (ED), or outpatient healthcare encounters, including ICD-9 or ICD-10 diagnosis codes indicating SCD within five years. We will create a ten-year (2013-2022) record of confirmed and probable SCD individuals separately. We will describe the demographic characteristics of each group, including sex, race, ethnicity, age, and location (county and region). We will conduct a cross-sectional analysis of acute care utilization patterns of all individuals with SCD, focusing on individuals transitioning care from pediatrics to adult medicine. Additionally, we will evaluate the variability in access to comprehensive SCD care by exploring age and regional variability in emergency departments' reliance on the SCD population. The project will also boost local capacity in SCD research, preparing junior investigators to pursue further funding to investigate the epidemiology of chronic complications among persons with SCD. The overall findings from this project will provide the foundation for implementing intervention programs to improve access to care, reduce disparities, and enhance the overall quality of life for persons with SCD."

11131577,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Nucleoside analogs such as acyclovir and other drugs are available to treat HSV infections, but viral re-
sistance to the drugs can arise in certain situations, and genital herpes transmission is only partially prevented
by current drugs. Therefore, additional antiviral strategies are needed. These studies will identify potential new
antiviral strategies and generate new HSV gene therapy vectors and understanding of their mechanism of action.
Nuclear DNA viruses face various host responses that try to block the infection when their DNA genomes enter
the nucleus, and they have evolved various strategies for evading or neutralizing these host restrictions. The
host responses include epigenetic silencing, DNA damage responses (DDR), and innate responses. The her-
pesviruses have no chromatin on their genome in the virion, and the host cell recognizes the viral DNA as “for-
eign,” loads heterochromatin on the incoming viral genome, initiates DDR, and induces innate signaling. Viral
host factors that sense and respond to foreign DNA include both restriction factors and DDR factors. We have
Identified two new host factors, IFI16 and TRIM22, that sense input viral DNA and contribute to viral silencing.
We have also shown that Mre11, a DNA sensing factor for a DDR pathway restricts HSV-1 replication, connect-
ing a DDR component to DNA sensing and silencing. In this application we investigate three new areas of host
sensing of DNA virus infection: 1) the mechanisms by which IFN-induced levels of IFI16 can restrict wild-type
HSV-1 replication; 2) blebbing of nuclear DNA from the nucleus within one hour of HSV infection. Preliminary
results indicate that this dramatic effect on the cell nucleus requires the cellular ATM DDR component, suggest-
ing that this is a host response to the foreign viral DNA; and 3) epigenetic regulation of HSV gene therapy vectors.
As with lytic and latent infection HSV gene therapy vectors are also regulated by host cell epigenetic mechanisms
during transduction. Initial HSV gene vectors showed short-term expression due to cytotoxicity by HSV ICP0,
but recent gene therapy vectors that have all viral immediate-early genes and internal inverted repeat sequences
deleted and the transgene bounded by insulator sequences show long term expression of the transgene and low
cytotoxicity. We have found that the viral genomic internal repeats increase replication of HSV gene therapy
vectors in complementing cells and, surprisingly, increase expression of a transgene in normal cells. We will
investigate these three exciting new aspects of host responses to DNA virus infection through the following
specific aims: 1. Determine the mechanism(s) of viral restriction by IFN-induced levels of IFI16 in normal human
fibroblasts; 2. Determine the mechanism and effects of nuclear blebbing during HSV infection; and 3. Determine
the role of epigenetics and genome structure in replication of and transduction by HSV gene therapy vectors."
11136100,"Abstract
Circadian clocks orchestrate endogenous daily rhythms in physiology, metabolism, and behavior that
must be adjusted (i.e., entrained) to environmental cycles to maintain properly timed outputs. Post-
industrial environments have significantly reduced the reliability of the time cues that the circadian system
relies upon for entrainment and this has had widespread and negative consequences for human health.
Understanding the network properties of circadian timekeeping in the brain and the ways in which time
cues impinge upon it is required if we are to address the adverse effects of circadian misalignment and
dysfunction. The complexity of the brain’s clock center is a significant barrier to our understanding of the
daily adjustment of the circadian system. Work in relatively “simple” clock neuron networks can therefore
enrich and inform our understanding of circadian timekeeping and entrainment in the mammalian brain.
The goal of this competing renewal application is to continue a productive and impactful research program
on the network properties of circadian timekeeping and entrainment in Drosophila melanogaster, which,
despite its relative simplicity, shares molecular, anatomical, and physiological features that are
remarkably similar to those of mammalian clock networks. Within the fly’s clock neuron network, we will
determine how endogenous circadian timekeeping is supported by the network structure of the of the
brain’s clock center and how specific neural pathways and neurotransmitters mediate entrainment to
environmental cycles. The goals of our three specific aims are to elucidate: 1) the nature and timekeeping
functions of the synaptic and modulatory connections of the circadian clock neuron network, 2.) how the
CCNN integrates light input to entrain circadian rhythms, and 3) how neurons that do not themselves
express molecular clocks participate in the clock neuron network to support endogenous timekeeping.
The unifying goal of this research program is to advance our understanding of circadian timekeeping and
entrainment in the brain. The results of this work will inform future interventions for the alleviation of the
adverse health effects of circadian dysfunction in post-industrial environments."
11174594,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Scleroderma (SSc) patients have more than a 300% increased risk of lung cancer, or Cancerous Scleroderma
(CSc). SSc is a chronic autoimmune connective tissue disease of unknown etiology, and has the highest
morbidity of all rheumatologic diseases. Moreover, aging is a key risk factor in SSc patients for pathological
airway remodeling or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the leading cause of death in SSc patients. Intriguingly,
aging is associated with increased senescent cells, likely contributing to increased fibrosis. Published reports
show that fibroblasts from IPF patients are senescent and produce a pro-tumorigenic senescence associated
secretory phenotype (SASP), suggesting a potential key role for senescent myofibroblasts, the key cell type
responsible for fibrosis, in driving the pathogenesis of CSc. Although it is evident that there is a tight link
between fibrosis and cancer in CSc, the directionality of this progression and molecular circuits linking the two
are unknown. Published data by our lab show that the TNF superfamily member 14, LIGHT, signals through
LTβR expressed on myofibroblasts to drive collagen deposition and α-smooth muscle actin hypertrophy – the
hallmarks of fibrosis. Our novel preliminary data suggests that senescent myofibroblasts drive cancer in a
LIGHT dependent manner: In gain-of-function studies, intratracheal (I.T.) LIGHT led to enhanced fibrosis and
senescent myofibroblasts in aged mice, while in loss-of-function studies comparing aged to young mice given
lung adenocarcinoma cells I.T., LIGHT deletion abrogated cancer engraftment in aged mice, while young WT
and LIGHT-/- mice were protected from cancer engraftment. Additionally, in a mouse lung organoid system, we
showed that senescent myofibroblasts expressing LTβR increase tumor growth. Therefore, we hypothesize
that senescent myofibroblasts are responsible for driving pulmonary fibrosis in scleroderma and
promote lung cancer through expression of a SASP. Notably, in a novel model we established of CSc, LIGHT
deletion decreased fibrosis, cancer engraftment, and senescent myofibroblasts. One key question is how LIGHT
affects senescent myofibroblasts to drive cancer, therefore we will address this through the following Specific
Aims: 1) To identify the molecular circuits that LIGHT uses to drive cancerous scleroderma and 2) To directly
investigate the role of senescent myofibroblasts in promoting cancer ex vivo. For aim 1, we will modulate LIGHT
signaling and fibrosis in mice and induce our novel model of CSc, monitoring disease. For aim 2, we will use
RNA-sequencing and human lung organoids to identify the molecular pathways that drive CSc downstream of
LIGHT in senescent myofibroblasts to translate findings from mouse to human. The research described in aim 1
will provide an understanding as to how LIGHT signaling drives CSc pathogenesis, while the research described
in aim 2 will establish the role of senescent myofibroblasts as the key players in CSc and provide key insights
on how to target these cells. Upon completion of these aims, this project has the potential to identify a novel
therapeutic candidate, targeting senescent myofibroblasts to reverse CSc."
11176586,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are significant and persistent racial and socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) in
the United States. Growing evidence indicates that the perinatal period is a critical window for intergenerational
transmission of CVD disparities. Infants born preterm or small for gestational age are at greater risk of CVD
morbidity and mortality in adulthood. Further, disparities in preterm birth and small for gestational age infant
mirror those observed in CVD. As the organ at the maternal-fetal interface responsible for regulating fetal
development, the placenta is the key to understanding intergenerational transmission of disparities. Consistent
with this view, studies have reported that reduced placental size is associated with offspring CVD, though
placental size is a crude measure of function. Techniques to improve assessment of placental function include
histologic evaluation for vascular and inflammatory lesions and image analysis to evaluate vascular structure.
Studies leveraging these robust placental measures have important scientific and clinical implications.
Scientifically, they yield deeper mechanistic insights about the gestational origins of CVD risk, which can inform
development of gestational interventions. Clinically, they have the potential to mitigate CVD disparities by
improving risk stratification and informing treatment approaches. Accordingly, the goal of this proposal is to
understand the placental mechanisms underlying racial and socioeconomic disparities in offspring
cardiovascular health across the life course. Evaluating placental measures in relation to offspring
cardiovascular health will be accomplished by initiating pediatric cardiovascular follow up in offspring from the
Stress Pregnancy and Health study (SPAH; N=150). In addition, two complementary cohorts with routine
placental data collection and longitudinal follow up will be leveraged: the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP;
N=43,837) and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; N=799). These cohorts will be
used to address three aims. Aim 1: To determine whether placental dysfunction impacts CVD risk factor
disparities in childhood by (a) evaluating placental lesions and vascular structure and (b) leveraging a sibling
comparison design to control for parental and environmental confounding. Aim 2: To determine whether
placental lesions are associated with disparities in cardiovascular structure, function, and CVD risk factors in
adolescence and young adulthood. Aim 3: To determine whether placental lesions are associated with
disparities in offspring premature CVD mortality in adulthood. As a perinatal epidemiologist, this award will help
me extend my expertise to evaluating offspring cardiovascular outcomes. Through the process of conducting
this research, I will obtain mentorship and training in leading longitudinal studies, comprehensive placental
evaluation, and cardiovascular health across the life course. Collectively, this research and training will equip
me with the expertise necessary to develop a unique research career investigating placental contributions to
disparities in offspring cardiovascular health across the life course."

Children conceived by infertility include those born by assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and after non-ART treatments such as controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) or ovulation induction (OI). Treatment effects could arise either from the process of ovulation stimulation (which may be shared by both ART and non-ART treatments) or in vitro culture (which only occurs in ART).  Epigenetics may be the mechanism underlying treatment effects.

This study will re-recruit participants from t original Upstate KIDS cohort; approximately 1100 children (singletons or twins) conceived by infertility treatment and 2100 children conceived naturally.  A subgroup of children will undergo in-home or clinic examinations (~900 one-time with ~100 repeated for a total of 1000 visits) that include blood pressure, lipid testing, and adiposity measurement.

trauma care system; these systems are poor with limited services in LMICs like Tanzania.
Optimizing care at each step along this continuum requires implementation research strategies

11162618,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Pharmacologically targeting intracellular proteins is a key challenge of modern drug development, requiring
innovation and the development of new technologies. This challenge is made more difficult by the fact that many
protein targets remain beyond the reach of established drug discovery technologies because they lack easy-to-
find and unique binding pockets, possess large, and flat contact areas. Indeed, ~85-90% of the human genome
is considered “undruggable,” encoding proteins that are deemed too challenging to bind with conventional
molecules. Hence, new approaches are needed for drugging intracellular protein targets. To address this unmet
need, this project seeks to develop a new class of computationally-designed mRNA therapeutics that encode
peptide-guided protein degraders, known as ubiquibodies (uAbs), for potent and selective degradation of
historically undruggable targets not addressable by conventional drugs. Specifically, uAbs are modular,
programmable proteins consisting of a genetically engineered fusion between an E3 ubiquitin ligase, linker, and
protein/peptide guide. Following ectopic expression in cells, these heterobifunctional chimeras direct the activity
of an E3 to a protein of interest (POI), leading to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the POI by
the endogenous ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). The objective of this Phase I STTR is to design
customized uAbs against β-catenin and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), two
intracellular transcription factors that hold promise as drug targets for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), and other liver diseases. The hypothesis of this project is that uAbs can be
designed to selectively remove cytosolic/nuclear β-catenin and CHOP, with the potential to inhibit the tumorigenic
and proteotoxic potential, respectively, of these drug targets while also limiting toxicity. The plan to address these
hypotheses includes first leveraging an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-powered platform to
create designer uAbs that selectively degrade cytosolic/nuclear β-catenin and CHOP (Aim 1) and then to develop
and evaluate a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-based strategy for systemically delivering synthetic uAb-encoding
mRNAs in cultured cells and mice. The best performing mRNA-LNP formulations will then be evaluated in mice
to assess biodistribution, efficiency and duration of target degradation, and biological impacts. Overall, the
proposed studies will demonstrate a new paradigm for drugging the proteome based on computational design
of peptide-guided uAbs, with proof-of-concept studies in this Phase I proposal focused on accelerating the
removal of two key intracellular disease drivers through LNP-mediated delivery of mRNA encoding customized
uAbs. Successful completion of this project will lead to a future Phase II application that will explore the
therapeutic potential of uAbs following systemic delivery of optimized mRNA-LNP formulations in relevant animal
models of HCC and AATD. These studies will serve to advance the development and commercialization of
UbiquiTx’s proprietary therapeutic candidates towards an IND."
11129154,"Rates of risky alcohol and drug use and alcohol and substance use disorders (AUDs/SUDs) are highest among
women during their reproductive years compared to other periods of the life course. AUDs and SUDs are
associated with significant and lifelong behavioral, mental, physical, and sexual and reproductive health (SRH)
consequences for women and disproportionately for racially and ethnically minoritized women and those living
in poverty. There is an urgent need for innovative methods to address alcohol and substance use in preventive
healthcare settings. Family planning (FP) clinics are a trusted care source and primary point of access for
women and serve as a safety net for structurally marginalized groups in the U.S. FP clinics are uniquely well-
suited, but entirely understudied, contexts for implementing and scaling integrated alcohol/drug use services.
While screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is a widely accepted, evidence-based
intervention for alcohol use in primary care and mental health settings, little is known about the facilitators and
barriers to the uptake and sustainment of SBIRT in FP clinics. Even less is understood about telemedicine,
which has been rapidly rolled out for COVID-19, as a SBIRT delivery platform. Further, virtually no evidence
exists on effective organizational level implementation strategies to accelerate SBIRT’s adoption in FP.
 We propose an explanatory, sequential, mixed methods study to evaluate SBIRT in an expansive FP
clinic network of a national SRH organization – a novel and highly impactful setting with a reach of a diverse
and largely socially disadvantaged population of reproductive-aged women at greatest risk for AUDs/SUDs.
Our integrated study draws upon the evidence-based implementation approach, Implementation and
Sustainment Facilitation (ISF), guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and
Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance models. In Aim 1, to identify specific targets
for implementation, sustainment, and scale-up of SBIRT, we will conduct administrative surveys with clinic
stakeholders (clinic directors, providers, and staff n=153) and key informant interviews with stakeholders and
patients (n=40) to investigate organizational practices and perspectives on alcohol- and substance-related
services. In Aim 2, we will conduct a dual randomized Type 1 Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation trial testing
SBIRT (in-person and telemedicine) vs. usual care, within a large, high-volume Northeastern affiliate of the
national organization. We will randomize 600 patients across 4 clinics, collecting patient level data on alcohol
and substance use primary effectiveness outcomes, as well as secondary SRH, mental/physical health, quality
of life, and wellbeing outcomes at baseline, 30 days, and 3 months. Aim 3 will explore facilitators and barriers
to SBIRT adoption and the ISF implementation strategy via surveys and interviews with clinic directors,
providers, and staff (n=20) and patients (n=20) electronic medical records. Results will provide new, timely
evidence to inform scale-up of alcohol and substance related services in FP settings nationally."

Our proposed efforts align directly with a goal of RFA-NS-18-019: optimization of transformative technologies
for modulation in the nervous system. Specifically, we seek to optimize microelectrode arrays (MEAs) and
ultra-microelectrode arrays (UMEAs) for large-scale circuit manipulation that will control neural activity at
cellular resolution with high temporal resolution. Our goals are to 1) advance CNS MEA and UMEA electrical
microstimulation by testing the separate hypotheses that MEAs and UMEAs can deliver safe, effective levels of
cortical electrical stimulation and 2) advance research by generating transformative tools and technologies that
will be widely used throughout the research community. Here we propose combining computational modeling,
engineering optimization, and in vivo measurement to address these challenges and produce advances in
microstimulation and tools for the community. Our Aims are to 1) engineer approaches to non-damaging

document the performance of the innovations from Aim 1 and Aim 2. Via an outstanding team working together
to address this interdisciplinary problem, our innovative approach will result in 1) models to deliver non-

11131581,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heavy drinking and sexual assault co-occur, and bisexual women are at elevated risk for both. Approximately
25% of bisexual women relative to 11% of heterosexual women report engaging in heavy episodic drinking
(HED; 4+ drinks on one occasion). Bisexual women’s elevated risk for HED is believed to be driven largely by
lifetime exposure to multiple and chronic stressors, including sexual assault. Further, bisexual women’s
elevated risk for sexual assault is in part driven by alcohol use, making it even more critical to understand and
ultimately intervene upon heavy drinking in this group. Despite that bisexual women have the highest rates of
heavy drinking and lifetime sexual assault, there is no published research on event-level antecedents of heavy
drinking among bisexual women. Theoretically important antecedents of heavy drinking among bisexual
women with sexual assault histories include psychological distress, coping motives, and microaggressions. To
examine event-level influences of these constructs, a mixed-methods approach will be employed across four
aims. The specific aims of the K99 phase of this MOSAIC K99/R00 are to 1) gain an in-depth understanding of
antecedents of heavy drinking and how they differ between bisexual and heterosexual women who have been
sexually assaulted and 2) refine measures and methods for studying event-level predictors of heavy drinking
among bisexual and heterosexual women. To accomplish these aims, a qualitative approach (individual
interviews with 40 either bisexual or heterosexual women; exit interviews with 16 women who complete a pilot
ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study) will be used to develop and refine a full EMA study. The R00
phase will include a larger-scale EMA study that will assess heavy drinking antecedents among bisexual
women with (n = 50) and without (n = 50) histories of sexual assault and heterosexual women with (n = 50)
and without (n = 50) histories of sexual assault. The specific aims of the R00 phase include to 3) characterize
the extent to which heavier event-level drinking occurs as a result of psychological distress, coping motives,
and microaggression among bisexual versus heterosexual women and 4) examine how SA history further
increases risk of heavier drinking at the event level for bisexual women. The PI, Dr. López, will work with an
experienced and knowledgeable team of mentors (Drs. Jennifer Merrill, Kristina Jackson, Lindsay Orchowski)
to develop expertise in five areas of training: (1) EMA methods, (2) longitudinal data analysis, (3) qualitative
methods (4) intervention development, and (5) professional development skills. Successful completion of the
research and training detailed in this proposal will prepare the PI to become an independent clinical scientist
and develop a program of research on alcohol use disparities among bisexual women with histories of sexual
assault. Findings will inform an understanding of the most proximal risk factors for heavy drinking at the event-
level among bisexual and heterosexual women. Identifying risk factors will be the first step in the development
of just-in-time intervention to decrease heavy drinking."

 In the face of increasing antimicrobial resistance, understanding the mechanism of virulence factor(s)
characteristics in bacteria is critical for developing new therapeutics. For many pathogens, large multi-protein
molecular machines called injectisomes (also known as type III secretion systems) are central to pathogenesis.
Injectisomes are central to virulence by many human pathogens including Salmonella (gastroenteritis and
typhoid fever), Shigella (dysentery), Vibrio (gastroenteritis) Pseudomonas (diverse systemic infections), Yersinia
(plague), and Chlamydia (sexually transmitted diseases), presenting significant health burdens. By
understanding the mechanisms of injectisome biogenesis, function and coupled gene regulatory mechanisms,
we poise ourselves to develop novel antimicrobial therapeutics. Although these pathogens are common, a barrier
to fighting infections by injectisome-utilizing organisms has been incomplete structural insights into core
mechanisms of secretion. Understanding these core mechanisms is crucial to developing novel anti-pathogen
strategies. We propose experiments that provide fundamental knowledge about injectisome mechanisms for use
in combating these significant pathogens. Understanding the molecular mechanisms controlling effector
secretion will provide crucial knowledge toward combating injectisome-deploying pathogens.
 Type III secretion (T3S) is arguably the most important route through which gram-negative plant and
animal pathogens translocate effector proteins into host cells and is a key component in bacterial symbiosis with
eukaryotic organisms. There are beautiful structures lacking mechanisms of assembly with superficial knowledge
of coupled gene regulatory systems that we will uncover. Our track-record on the related flagellar systems leaves
no doubt that we are most qualified to do this. For more than twenty years, the selectivity of substrates for specific
secretion by the injectisome-associated T3S systems from thousands of proteins produced in the cell has been
an unsolvable mystery until now. T3S is the only secretion system in Biology that undergoes a secretion-
specificity switch from one class of secretion-substrates to a completely different class. Using newly devised
genetic selections and screens we will determine how specific substrates are recognized and targeted for
secretion by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 1 (SPI1) T3S systems in coordination with SPI1 injectisome
assembly and the secretion-specificity switch."
11139982,"ABSTRACT
In metazoans, gene expression is regulated in a tissue/cell-type-specific manner predominantly via stretches of
noncoding sequence referred to as cis regulatory modules (CRMs). CRMs contain 1 or more DNA binding sites
for 1 or more sequence-specific, regulatory transcription factors that function to modulate the expression of
target gene(s). CRMs that activate gene expression are typically referred to as enhancers, while those that
repress gene expression are referred to as silencers. Transcriptional enhancers activate gene expression in a
tissue-specific manner in development and also in adult cells in response to cellular or environmental stimuli.
Like enhancers, silencers can function in a cell-type-specific manner. Indeed, silencers may contribute a
crucial role in the specification of precise gene expression patterns, thus enabling the establishment of sharp
expression domains, such as during development.
Genomic and computational studies traditionally have focused primarily on predicting and characterizing
enhancers. Silencers have been investigated far less and are much less well understood. The overarching
goals of this project are to identify and quantify the activities of tissue-specific silencers and their potential
bifunctionality as enhancers in alternate cellular contexts, to identify the chromatin signature(s) of silencers, to
determine whether silencers exhibit specificity in terms of the promoter and/or enhancer context within which
they reduce gene expression, and to elucidate the regulatory roles of silencer-associated repressors,
corepressors and DNA sequence motifs. We will also characterize the chromosomal contacts of silencers that
are mediated by repressors bound at different classes of silencers. In pursuing these goals, we will develop
novel technology for quantitative assays of elements for tissue-specific silencer activity in the context of various
enhancer-promoter combinations, and novel technology for identification of proteins found in tissue-specific
chromatin assembled at specific cis-regulatory elements in cells where they act as silencers versus in cells
where they act as enhancers. We will focus on the developing embryonic mesoderm in Drosophila
melanogaster as our model system. We anticipate that the features and chromatin signatures of silencers
identified in this project will be evolutionarily conserved across metazoans, including human."

This proposal describes the framework of an NIAID New Innovators DP2 award for Kiera Clayton, PhD. Dr.
Clayton is currently a postdoctoral fellow under the supervision of Dr. Bruce Walker at the Ragon Institute of
MGH, MIT and Harvard, whose current research focuses on T cell and NK cell-mediated killing of HIV-infected
macrophages, and the implications for HIV reservoir persistence and macrophage-mediated inflammation. In
addition to Dr. Clayton’s published work suggesting that macrophages are resistant to T cell-mediated killing,
preliminary results included in this proposal suggest that HIV exploits macrophages to evade NK cell-mediated
killing, by mechanisms distinct from those used to evade T cell responses. As macrophages also act as the
primary cellular reservoir for other chronic pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the question
remains whether macrophages provide a common “Hide-Out” for immunoevasion. Thus, the overall goal of this
proposal is to characterize the mechanisms employed by macrophages infected by different chronic pathogens
to evade immune-mediated clearance and explore the possibility of targeting a common immunoevasion
pathway to enhance T cell and NK cell killing of infected macrophages. This proposal focuses on three Research
Areas. The first Research Area will build on preliminary data to define the mechanisms by which HIV-infected
macrophages prevent NK cell-mediated killing. To quantify the resistance of macrophages infected with Mtb to
T cell and NK cell-mediated elimination and characterize the accompanying immunoevasion mechanisms, the
second Research Area will characterize the interactions between Mtb-infected macrophage and antigen-specific
T cells and NK cells. Finally, as Dr. Clayton’s published work suggests that inefficient killing of macrophages is
a result of resistance to apoptosis-inducing T cell-derived granzymes, the third Research Area will probe for the
identities of granzyme inhibitors expressed by macrophages, and subsequently knockout candidate genes to
enhance T and NK cell-mediated killing of infected macrophages. Together, these studies will provide insight
into whether targeting natural granzyme inhibitors can provide a common method to enhance immune-mediated
clearance of macrophages infected by different pathogens. The goals of this proposal are highly relevant to the
mission of NIAID, and will enhance our understanding of distinct pathogen-specific immunoevasion mechanisms
and those inherently characteristic of macrophages that allow for pathogen persistence despite strong immune
responses. Ultimately, this work will aid the design and development of therapeutics to target HIV and Mtb
infection in macrophages, and will potentiate future studies to assess how macrophage-mediated
immunoevasion contributes to persistence of other pathogens, including human cytomegalovirus."

Our multidisciplinary and highly collaborative consortium identifies gene variants associated with increased
vulnerability to compulsive-like cocaine use by performing the first GWAS using an advanced model of chronic
intravenous cocaine self-administration. We have also created the first preclinical cocaine biobank which enables
researchers who do not have the resources to perform chronic intravenous self-administration or next-generation
genome sequencing to perform advanced genetic, molecular, and cellular studies to further our understanding
of the biological changes underlying addiction-like behaviors. We have obtained results suggesting that it is
critical to add brain and blood samples to measure cocaine levels in rats, however, the rising costs of supplies
and labor threaten the biobank's operations and the overall project. Indeed, our recent GWAS identified a gene,
carboxyl esterase (ces1), encoding an enzyme that degrades cocaine in tissue, but not in blood, underscores
the need for precise measurement of cocaine levels in both the brain and blood, which we did not plan to do in
the parent grant. We identified several coding variants for ces1a, 1c, 1, 1e, and 1g that may alter the ability of
the enzyme to metabolize cocaine. It is critical that we perform additional experiments to test the feasibility of
measuring the pharmacokinetics of cocaine in the brain in vivo within subjects to know if it is possible to expand
the Cocaine Biobank with brain and blood cocaine measurements. This dual measurement is crucial for
understanding individual differences in vulnerability to cocaine addiction. Previous research that relied solely on
blood cocaine levels would have missed significant insights into cocaine pharmacokinetics within the brain.
Therefore, incorporating these measurements into our experimental design is essential to advancing our
understanding of addiction mechanisms and individual vulnerabilities. The overall goal of the following two aims
for this 12-month supplement is to demonstrate the feasibility of integrating brain and blood cocaine
measurements to the biobank using DNA aptamer implanted in the brain and the jugular vein. In Specific Aim 1,
we will gather preliminary data that will allow us to identify individual differences in cocaine pharmacokinetics
between brain and blood in heterogeneous stock rats. In Specific Aim 2, we will ensure the continued viability
and expansion of the Cocaine Biobank, which has become an invaluable resource for addiction research. This
project will continue having a sustained and powerful impact on the field because it provides an exponential
increase in the number of genetic loci identified; establishes the first high-throughput behavioral motifs analysis
of addiction-like behaviors using parallel video-recording and automated machine learning analysis; identifies
novel behavioral endophenotypes of vulnerability/resistance to addiction-like behaviors; and expands and
improves the Cocaine Biobank offering and infrastructure."
11128085,"Postpartum hemorrhage is a complication of childbirth that affects 3-8% of births in the United States, each
year this represents a minimum of 120,000 births. Postpartum hemorrhage is also a primary cause of maternal
mortality worldwide. Rates of severe postpartum hemorrhage and hemorrhage requiring invasive treatments or
blood transfusions are on the rise, particularly for labors that are induced. Severe hemorrhage is also more
common among women of color, contributing to disparities in maternal health. Oxytocin is a naturally occurring
hormone as well as a medication used to stimulate labor, prevent or treat postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin
binds available oxytocin receptors in uterine muscle, stimulating contraction. While oxytocin is the first-line
hemorrhage treatment, people who have been given oxytocin to stimulate contractions during labor are more
likely to have a less effective uterine contraction response to oxytocin administered postpartum, leading to
more bleeding and the need for other medical treatments or procedures. Currently, 4 of 10 people who
hemorrhaged, did so despite not having been identified as high risk by current clinical prediction tools. This
inaccuracy and the rising rates of hemorrhage indicate that more research is needed to help identify possible
risks for this potentially life-threatening complication. Because people with ineffective labor contractions or a
personal/family history (of hemorrhage) are more likely to have postpartum hemorrhage, the role of innate
oxytocin function/ sensitivity is the primary focus of this investigation. As such, our lab has been researching
biomarkers that can help identify people at risk for hemorrhage by testing how genetic and epigenetic variation
of the oxytocin receptor gene is associated with oxytocin response and hemorrhage. In this proposal, we use a
biosocial framework to test the central hypothesis that maternal variation in the oxytocin receptor gene can be
useful for predicting pharmacologic oxytocin needs and hemorrhage. First, we will examine DNA methylation
(epigenetic differences) from blood samples using banked data as well as prospectively collected non-invasive
salivary samples in association with oxytocin needs in labor and postpartum hemorrhage. Social determinants
of health will be examined in association with DNA methylation differences; evaluating the role of adverse
environments in shaping the oxytocin receptor epigenotype. Furthermore, we will test how DNA methylation
affects gene expression and the oxytocin receptor availability in uterine tissues. Second, we will examine
genetic variants of the oxytocin receptor gene in association with the clinical endpoints with the aforementioned
specimens and test pharmacologic response by measuring contractility of uterine muscle specimens. Given
that clinicians have no method of predicting how well oxytocin will work in the emergency of postpartum
hemorrhage, we aim to develop a clinically useful biomarker measuring intrinsic oxytocin sensitivity before
labor or birth occurs. The long-range goal of this project is to use biomarker data to improve clinical decision-
making, test personalized interventions and lower maternal morbidity."
11178037,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) such as childhood neglect, abuse, and exposure to violence,
substance use, or mental health problems are estimated to be the root cause of 9 of the 10 leading causes of
death in the US. High levels of ACEs can lead to long-term disruptions in immune function and genetic
regulatory mechanisms. Sensitive parenting is essential for protecting infants and children from the impact of
ACEs. Yet parenting can be particularly challenging when parents themselves have a history of ACEs, which
can undermine their capacity to provide sensitive care. Nevertheless, many exposed to ACEs do not develop
poor health outcomes or become less sensitive parents. Positive childhood experiences (PCEs) often co-occur
with ACEs and can be an important source of resilience that buffers the deleterious effects of ACEs. However,
the positive effects of PCEs and the biobehavioral mechanisms through which parents' ACEs and PCEs
together shape child health remain poorly understood. The proposed K99/R00 study aims to elucidate the
relationships among mothers' ACEs and PCEs, maternal sensitivity, and immune regulation in infants (3
months) and toddlers (12-36 months) of mothers who are living with opioid dependence, a high-risk group that
often encounters a host of adversities. This study will build on an NICHD-funded randomized clinical trial
(R01HD098525) that tests the efficacy of the Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC) intervention
among mothers with opioid dependence and infants with perinatal opioid exposure. Assessment of child
immune regulation is not currently included in the parent study. Leveraging the parent study's pre-intervention
data, the K99 phase will investigate the associations between 100 mothers' ACEs and PCEs, maternal
sensitivity, and their 3-month-old infants' immune regulation, indicated by salivary C-reactive protein (CRP) and
secretory Immunoglobulin A (sIgA). My long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator who
integrates biological and behavioral concepts and methods to promote the health and well-being of families
and young children exposed to high levels of adversity. My prior work has focused on behavioral pathways by
which ACEs and PCEs may transmit across generations. To date, I have had limited training in research using
biological approaches and methods. I am motivated to expand my knowledge and skills in assessing immune
biomarkers and intervention research through the proposed training and research during the K99 phase. This
will build a strong foundation for the R00 phase and facilitate my transition to independence. Guided by the
established Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity genomic framework, the R00 phase aims to
determine how mothers' ACEs and PCEs are associated with toddlers' immune regulation as indicated by both
cellular (salivary CRP and sIgA) and transcriptomic (immune cell gene expression profile) biomarkers; this will
be accomplished by prospectively following at least 80 toddlers enrolled in the parent study at ages 12, 24, and
36 months."
11178790,"Project Summary/Abstract
Despite much effort to identify mechanisms underlying amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal
lobar degeneration dementia (FTLD or FTD), effective treatments remain elusive. Motoneuron (MN) excitability
dysfunction remains the most tightly linked to ALS disease pathology. Much research has reported on disease
alterations in the excitability mechanisms of MNs. However, these data often conflict, as hyperexcitability,
hypoexcitability, and normal excitability have all been seen in animal models of ALS. Such inconsistent data
obscure the role of these excitability changes (i.e., neuroprotective or detrimental). Most of these conflicting
reports are seen in mutant super-oxide dismutase (SOD) models of ALS, the most commonly studied mouse
model of ALS. Our data obtained (via our active grant) from the aggressive G93A SOD mouse model of ALS
suggests that both hypo- and hyperexcitability disease changes might take place concurrently within diseased
MNs. Here, we propose to examine a recent, novel rNLS8 mouse model that recapitulates pathologic
Transactive-response DNA-binding Protein 43 (TDP43) inclusions seen in upper and lower MNs in >90% of ALS
patients, leading to neuronal loss in the brain and spinal cord. TDP43 is specifically seen in most sporadic-onset
ALS cases; thus, between them, the G93A and rNLS8 models represent most ALS, and also FTD, cases.
However, to date, excitability dysregulation has not been examined in this model. Thus, our objective is to
characterize the novel rNLS8 TDP43 mouse model of ALS and compare this data to our existing data from G93A
mice. Both models demonstrate very different disease scenario and progression, yet ultimately both lead to MN
loss and death. By comparing and contrasting mechanisms of excitability dysregulation between these models,
we expect to parse the roles that individual alterations play in ALS/FTD disease pathology via 3 Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Determine MN and synaptic excitability in the rNLS8 model. It is currently unknown whether MN
excitability is altered in the rNLS8 model – as in other ALS models – and whether synaptic excitability dysfunction
is also involved. Thus, we will measure intrinsic MN and synaptic excitability in the rNLS8 model via
electrophysiology recordings, at early, middle, and late disease stages, then contrast them to G93A data.
Aim 2: Determine the roles of ion channels and synaptic inputs in the death of spinal MNs in rNLS8 mice.
We will measure expression levels of ion channels and synapses in spinal MNs of rNLS8 mice at early, middle,
and late disease stages, then contrast them to G93A data.
Aim 3: Determine the roles of ion channels & synaptic inputs in the death of cortical neurons in rNLS8
mice. Loss of cortical neurons in rNLS mice recapitulates key aspects of ALS-comorbid FTD. To examine if
excitability mechanisms involved in the death of spinal MNs are also involved in FTD dementia, we will measure
expression levels of ion channels and synapses in cortical/subcortical neurons of rNLS8 mice at early, mid, and
late disease stages."
11131615,"Importance: Despite effective vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 infection remains a major public health problem for
pregnant women and their newborns as they have increased morbidity and mortality. Studies on estimated
rates of in utero transmission are conflicting and reported on small numbers mostly limited to PCR testing at
birth. Critical Gaps include limited diagnostics to identify in utero infection and lack of understanding of factors
that impact MTCT and the pathogenesis of disease. From October 2021 through February 2023, we studied
1294 infant cord bloods for presence and level of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Overall, 89.9% had anti-RBD IgG,
indicating maternal vaccination and/or previous infection and 55.1% had both anti-N and anti-RBD IgG,
indicative of past infection. Fetal IgA and/or IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were found in 21.8% of 176/808
samples with anti-N, indicative of in utero transmission. The overall goal of this study is to identify newborns
with in utero SARS-CoV-2 and prospectively follow infants to identify clinical and neurodevelopment outcomes.
 Aim 1: Identify newborns with in utero SARS-CoV-2 infection using a multi-faceted approach and
assess relationship with inflammation, placental infection and pathology, and immunity. Hypothesis 1:
In utero infection will be associated with elevated soluble markers of inflammation in newborn cord blood and
evidence of placental infection and dysfunction. Using cord blood we will screen 3,600 newborns for anti-N, S,
and RBD IgG antibodies (Abs) and if anti-N+ we will assess for SARS-CoV-2 specific anti-IgM and anti-IgA
abs. Maternal SARS-CoV-2 qPCR testing will be done at delivery, and if qPCR+, newborn qPCR will be
performed at 24/48 hours. Variant type will be determined by ddPCR. Newborn meconium/stool samples will
have qPCR testing. Soluble biomarkers of inflammation and immune activation will be determined. Finally,
placentas will be evaluated for pathology and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
 Aim 2. Longitudinally assess for immune activation, dysregulation, and function among a subset
of infants with in utero infection and matched controls. Hypothesis 2: In utero infected infants will have
abnormal markers of inflammation, immune activation, and dysregulation that if sustained will be associated
with adverse clinical outcomes. In a subset of 100 infants with in utero SARS-CoV-2 and 50 uninfected controls
we will determine levels of CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation and dysregulation and assess for SARS-CoV-2
specific antibodies and T cell response in mother-infant dyads at birth and longitudinally. We will then correlate
with clinical and neurodevelopmental outcomes.
 At the end of this project, we will have developed a comprehensive algorithm to screen and follow
newborns with in-utero SARS-CoV-2 and will have determined if there are immunologic dysfunctions
impacting clinical, developmental, neurologic, and other abnormalities that may require long-term
follow-up, treatments and/or interventions."
11131626,"ABSTRACT
 In several high-income nations, including the United States, infectious syphilis has been resurgent
for over two decades now, while syphilis is still endemic in low- and middle-income countries. Syphilis is
therefore still a public global health concern, particularly in consideration that it can lead to neurological
sequelae such as dementia and stroke-like syndrome, as well as cardiovascular manifestations potentially
leading to death. Furthermore, every year, about half a million pregnancies are adversely affected by
congenital transmission of the pathogen. The partial success of recent syphilis control campaigns promoted
by the CDC and WHO clearly highlights the necessity of devising novel ways to control this serious infection.
Improving our understanding of syphilis pathogenesis and the virulence factors that allow the syphilis agent,
Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum) to establish infection and persist in the host despite a
robust immune response might be the key to new control strategies.
 However, two significant obstacles have hindered our ability to unravel the complexities of syphilis
pathogenesis since the first T. pallidum strain was isolated in 1912. These barriers were the inability to
propagate T. pallidum in vitro and, consequently, to genetically manipulate this difficult pathogen. In 2018,
the “in vitro propagation” barrier was overcome by the discovery that T. pallidum could be propagated in a
cell culture-based system. In 2021, for the first time, we overcame the “genetic manipulation” barrier and
derived a T. pallidum knock-out (KO) isolate, in which a functional kanamycin resistance (kanR) cassette
was used to successfully replace the non-essential T. pallidum tprA (tp0009) locus through homologous
recombination after transforming the syphilis agent with a suicide vector.
 This newly found ability to genetically alter T. pallidum will allow us to pinpoint more clearly the role
of putative virulence factors of this pathogen during infection. Here, by using an array of newly generated T.
pallidum KO strains lacking critical components of the pathogen`s antigenic variation system, we propose to
study the contribution of antigenic variation to T. pallidum ability for immune evasion and persistence during
infection.
 If successful, these studies will provide our research community with an array of T. pallidum mutants
to be used in comparative studies. Furthermore, our results will help settle ongoing controversies
surrounding the function of the T. pallidum TprK virulence factors that originated over the last two decades
due to working with a difficult pathogen that, until now, could not be genetically engineered."

In low-resource settings, undernutrition and infections during the first 1000 days of life are prevalent, modifiable
risk factors that may have lifelong effects on a child’s cognitive and psychological development. The rapidly
developing fetal brain has increased nutritional and metabolic demands and is highly susceptible to the effects
of inflammation. Protein, energy, and iron are key nutrients required for early brain development; yet, among
women of reproductive age in Sub-Saharan Africa, 10% are underweight and 20% have iron deficiency
anemia. Pregnancy infections are also common in Africa, where one in three women have a geo-helminthic
infection, contributing to iron deficiency and inflammation. Hepcidin, a regulator of iron homeostasis, is
stimulated by inflammation, yet there is limited research on hepcidin in pregnancy and how to optimize fetal
iron bioavailability in the context of inflammation. Understanding the complex relationship between nutrition,
inflammation, and neurodevelopment is a major research gap. The predominant approach to understanding
mechanisms of prenatal brain development is derived predominantly from animal and observational studies.
Here, we present an unprecedented opportunity to leverage an ongoing, independently funded randomized
controlled trial (RCT) to examine casual relationships and rigorously investigate biological pathways by which
prenatal nutrition and inflammation influence human fetal brain development in an undernourished and high-
risk population in rural Ethiopia. In the parent trial, women in early pregnancy are randomized to receive: 1)
standard prenatal care, 2) a package of strengthened nutritional support (iron-folate, iodized salt, fortified
balanced energy protein (BEP) supplement), 3) a package of infection management (deworming, treatment of
urinary tract infections), or 4) both packages. The proposed project will support advanced, multi-modal, infant
neurodevelopmental assessments (EEG/VEP, cranial ultrasound, neurologic exam, elicited imitation tasks) at 6
and 24 months of age, and analysis of maternal and newborn cord blood for inflammation biomarkers (C-
reactive protein, alpha-1 acid glycoprotein, Interleukin (IL)-6), neurotropic factors (IL-6 soluble receptor), iron
stores (serum ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor, total body iron), and hepcidin. Our specific aims are to: (1)
determine the effects of interventions on offspring neurodevelopment, (2) investigate the effects of
interventions on maternal-newborn iron and inflammation biomarkers, and (3) examine the role of maternal-
newborn iron status and inflammation on child neurodevelopment. Leveraging an ongoing RCT in Ethiopia, we
will determine the effects of iron, BEP, and inflammation on advanced measures of childhood neurobehavior
and function and will deepen the understanding of biological pathways and intervention targets. We will
elucidate the complex dynamics of iron and inflammation in pregnancy and their effects on neural networks,
brain structure, and behavior in childhood. Our work will help optimize prenatal intervention strategies to
improve early human brain development in high disease burden and vulnerable populations globally."

Hearing loss caused by noise, aging and chemotherapy affects seven hundred million people worldwide, but
there are no FDA-approved drugs to prevent it. This research will test the potential to repurpose a small
molecule BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib (TAFINLAR), an FDA-approved drug for several cancers, for new use in
preventing cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Dabrafenib was a top hit in our unbiased high-throughput screens of
4,385 bioactive compounds and 187 specific kinase inhibitors for cisplatin-induced cell-death protection in an
inner ear cell line. We found that dabrafenib fully protected the outer hair cells against cisplatin toxicity in
mouse cochlear explants with IC50 of 30 nM and an excellent therapeutic index (LD50/IC50) of >2000.
Mechanistically, we identified dabrafenib and three additional BRAF inhibitors, two MEK1/2 inhibitors, and an
ERK1/2 inhibitor immediately downstream of BRAF in the cellular pathway, supporting the role of BRAF in
cisplatin-induced hair cell death. Cisplatin treatment of the inner ear cell line caused upregulation of phospho-
BRAF, phospho-MEK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2 that was inhibited by co-treatment with dabrafenib. Moreover,
cisplatin treatment of cochlear explants or noise exposure in vivo caused up-regulation of phospho-ERK1/2
short time after damage in supporting cells (inner phalangeal and Deiters’ cells) that was mitigated by
dabrafenib treatment. Furthermore, at 100 nM dabrafenib protected zebrafish lateral line neuromasts from
cisplatin-induced death in vivo and, importantly, significant protection was achieved with oral delivery of
dabrafenib for three consecutive days in mouse models against cisplatin-induced hearing loss. The daily dose
of dabrafenib administered to the mice was in the range approved for long-term human treatment. In this
proposal, we will test the protection provided by dabrafenib for cisplatin-induced hearing loss in a multiple low
dose cisplatin regimen that mimics closely the cisplatin treatment of cancer patients in the clinic. Functional
auditory performance and inner ear morphology will be assessed. Two doses of dabrafenib will be tested to
evaluate the therapeutic window of the drug in vivo. We will also determine dabrafenib’s interference with
cisplatin tumor killing efficacy in tumor cell lines and mouse tumor models in which cisplatin is the standard
treatment, neuroblastoma and lung cancer. We will confirm BRAF kinase is the molecular target of dabrafenib
in cisplatin-induced hearing loss by generating a supporting cell specific conditional knockout mouse in which
BRAF is specifically deleted in the supporting cells of the inner ear starting at postnatal day 28 and testing its
resistance to cisplatin. Supporting cells’ ERK phosphorylation can serve as an in vivo biomarker for cisplatin
damage and evaluating treatment with BRAF inhibitors and can be utilized to determine dabrafenib’s PK/PD
properties. Our study will reveal a new cellular pathway and molecular target BRAF kinase for otoprotection
and will provide the crucial data needed for advancing dabrafenib to clinical trials in humans for prevention of
cisplatin-induced hearing loss."

Down Syndrome (DS) affects over 200,000 individuals in the United States and is the most common genetic
cause of intellectual and developmental disabilities in children and young adults. Down Syndrome arises from
an extra third copy of chromosome 21, encompassing over 200 genes, which leads to genome wide
transcriptional disruption. The brain cell-type specific contribution to DS neurodevelopmental deficits and the
interaction between cognitive and immune dysfunction in DS are poorly understood. DS has been difficult to
model due to limitations in murine orthologs and inadequacies of in vitro systems in modeling complex cellular
interactions. Microglial pathology has been identified in individuals with DS, but the extent to which microglial
dystrophy contributes to neurodevelopmental deficits is unknown. There is increasing evidence for the impact of
microglia on brain development and microglia have been suggested as a novel therapeutic target in DS. This
proposal is built around the central hypothesis that trisomy 21 causes microglial dysfunction and thereby
contributes to the pathogenesis of intellectual and developmental disability in DS. Motivated by our strong
preliminary data that in vitro microglia exhibit altered gene expression and functional phenotypes in
neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric disorders, we developed novel organoid microglia cocultures and
a chimeric human microglia mouse model, whereby 80% of microglia are human in origin. Here we apply
innovative in vitro and in vivo methods to ascertain the contribution of human DS microglia in neurodevelopment,
neuronal function, and cognition. The project goal is to test the hypothesis that isolated trisomy 21 in human
microglia and microglia-cerebral organoid cocultures in vitro (Aim 1) and in a xenotransplantation model of
human microglia in vivo (Aim 2) results in microglial pathology, neuropathological defects, and behavioral
deficits. Delineating genome wide transcriptional disruption and genome wide reorganization will uncover DS
associated transcriptional dysregulation and expand our knowledge of DS associated genes. The long-term
goal is to generate and validate in vitro and in vivo DS microglial models that can be employed for drug screening
and to generate preclinical data. A deeper understanding of the contribution and molecular regulation of microglia
in DS will lay the groundwork to ultimately identify novel potential therapeutic targets to improve the outcomes
for individuals with DS."
11128200,"Project Summary: Developing disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative diseases has been challenging, in part
because accurate statistical models to identify the optimal time for intervention do not exist. Models of how symptoms
worsen over time (i.e., the symptom trajectory) before and after a clinical diagnosis can help identify that optimal time.
These models can help pinpoint when a therapy could prevent a clinical diagnosis or slow the disease after a clinical
diagnosis. Yet modeling the symptom trajectory is not easy even for Huntington disease, where researchers can track
asymptomatic patients guaranteed to develop the disease and its symptoms. Like other neurodegenerative diseases,
Huntington disease progresses slowly over decades, so studies that track symptoms often end before clinical diagnosis.
This makes time to clinical diagnosis right-censored (i.e., a patient's motor abnormalities will merit a clinical diagnosis
sometime after the last study visit, but exactly when is unknown), leaving researchers with the challenge of trying to model
the symptom trajectory before and after clinical diagnosis without full information about when clinical diagnosis occurs.
The challenge creates a unique statistical problem of modeling the symptom trajectory as a function of a right-censored
covariate, time to clinical diagnosis (hereafter, simply “time to diagnosis”).
 Tackling this problem by modeling the distribution for time to diagnosis has long been thought to be the best strategy.
For years, we and others worked to develop reliable distribution models, but we found that if the model was even slightly
wrong, we would get biased estimates of how the symptom trajectory changes as a function of time to diagnosis. This
bias causes problems for clinical trials because they are incorrectly powered to determine if a therapy modiﬁes the disease
course. We began seeking a strategy that does not require us needing to accurately model the distribution for time to
diagnosis. Our team developed such a strategy for a related problem: estimating a regression model that has a covariate
measured with error. Like a right-censored covariate, when a covariate is measured with error, the covariate's true value
and distribution are unknown. Rather than ﬁnding the correct distribution, our model-free strategy accurately estimates
the regression model even when the distribution for the covariate is mismodeled.
 Our overarching objective is to develop a similarly robust, model-free strategy when we have a right-censored covariate,
which requires tackling challenges in three new areas: when the study ends before clinical diagnosis occurs (noninformative
censoring; Aim 1), when worsening symptoms lead to study dropout (informative censoring; Aim 2), and when the data
are longitudinal (Aim 3). This Landis Award Supplement will fund the training and development of a postdoctoral
researcher, allowing them to integrate all project aims into a new software package for right-censored covariate models.
It will also support career development activities for trainees and provide the PI with accredited coaching training to
improve mentorship and productivity."
11128201,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Food allergy (FA) is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects 8% of children in the United States.
Although racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence and severity of other atopic conditions such as
asthma and eczema have been well described, little is known about differences in FA. Black and Hispanic
children may have worse clinical outcomes than their White counterparts. Less is known about FA among
Asian populations in the US. Phenotypic and endotypic differences, including rates of sensitization and co-
morbidities are currently examined. Data on racial differences in FA management practices, especially as
children enter adolescence are incomplete. Families with food-allergic children may experience impaired
psychosocial outcomes, however, these data come primarily from White, privately insured families.
The goal of the parent R01 FORWARD award is to:
 1) Determine factors associated with differences in the development of tolerance and new FAs,
 2) Determine differences in FA management and outcomes during adolescence, and
 3) Identify phenotypic and endotypic differences in FA.
Multi-site data integration has lacked standardization as the FORWARD study relies on manual and electronic
data extraction. While electronic data extraction is more scalable, this approach has not been implemented at
all FORWARD sites and is limited by variation in underlying documentation approaches. This systematic
limitation has highlighted the need for the rigorous development of common data elements to advance the
goals of the FORWARD study. Currently, we are working with FA domain experts to develop a set of CDEs for
FA to standardize the way FA data is collected across multiple studies.
The supplement proposes to leverage ongoing common data elements (CDE) work to support the FORWARD
project’s prospective data collection for the remaining 3 years and beyond by accomplishing the following aims:
Aim 1: We will implement FA CDEs for data collection in a multicenter, prospective, observational study.
Aim 2: We will build on our ongoing FA CDE work and continue to develop a set of CDEs that can help provide
consistency in the way FA data are collected in FORWARD and beyond.
This project is fully within the scope of the FORWARD project’s aims regarding an understanding of the
development of clinical immune tolerance and new FAs as well as FA management and psychosocial
outcomes during two stages of development (middle childhood: ages 6-11 and adolescence: ages 12-18).
To accomplish study aims, CDEs related to “patient attributes” and “healthcare utilization and psycho-social
outcomes” domains will be implemented into surveys. An expert panel will be divided into workgroups and
tasked with defining each CDE including a structured set of responses to ensure consistent data collection.
Additional Delphi cycles will be executed within workgroups for the selection of individual value-set items."

The BIRCWH program at the University of Kentucky (UK) has been extremely successful in creating
a research environment to prepare early career scientists with necessary skills to become
independent NIH-supported researchers dedicated to improving women’s health. This supplement will
continue the training of a 4th BIRCWH scholar, Dr. Laneshia Conner who is from an underrepresented
racial minority group, with the goal of developing research skills necessary to become an independent
researcher engaged in intervention development for older Black women in real world settings. HIV
remains a major public health issue, with adults aged 50 and older experiencing an increase in HIV
diagnoses over the past two decades, and, 82% of HIV infections transmitted through heterosexual
contact. Black women continue to be disproportionately impacted by HIV, making up less than 15% of
the female population yet accounting for half of new HIV infections in women in the U.S. Older Black
women are often overlooked when it comes to HIV prevention services, due to ageism and stigma
about high-risk behaviors among older adults, and lack of an empirical base about older Black
women. Dr. Conner will continue to acquire skills to launch her research program in three areas:
intervention development, developing sustainable community programs for older adults, and
expanding methodological skills for a future RCT research. The proposed project will develop a
culturally relevant Woman 2 Woman (W2W) intervention that has been adapted to address unique
gaps in HIV prevention that target older Black women and provide data on the feasibility and
acceptability of the intervention in addition to the measuring behavioral and knowledge outcomes.
Working with two low-income housing complexes for adults over the age of 50, older Black women
will be recruited to participate in a multisession, group-level behavioral intervention adapted to
address both physiological risk as well as low perception of risk. High unknown serostatus suggest
that HIV prevalence may be higher than reported among older adults. Implementation, assessment
procedures, and protocols will inform a subsequent full-scale randomized clinical trial. The objective
of this innovative project is to develop and test the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and preliminary
efficacy of Woman to Woman (W2W) using a mixed methods approach. Specific aims are: (1) Adapt
the group-level intervention (W2W) focused on reducing HIV risk and increasing decision making
skills in older Black women to include reproductive health histories in exploring the impact on sexual
decision making and risk behaviors, and (2) Conduct a pilot study of the revised W2W intervention in
two community sites to evaluate acceptability and feasibility."
11176587,"Project Summary
 Immune suppression and bone marrow dysfunction are ubiquitous among critically ill patients. Short
term, this places an already vulnerable population at additional risk of life-threatening infections. Long term,
immune suppression can persist in the form of chronic critical illness which significantly worsens functional
outcomes. There is a need to rescue immune function early in the care of critically ill patients to avoid
detrimental short and long term consequences of critical illness. Many studies have attempted to do this but
have generally failed, and targetable therapies are still lacking. This may be in part due to lack of consideration
about the integral role of the gut microbiome in regulating hematopoiesis and immune function.
 Emerging research has identified fundamental links between immunity and the gut microbiome. An
onslaught of publications have shown the microbiome shapes the immune system at various stages, including
during hematopoiesis. Recent murine studies have illustrated antibiotic induced dysbiosis impairs
hematopoiesis and suppresses bone marrow function. Clinically, our group completed some of the first
genomic studies illustrating microbiota derangements in critically ill patients, likely as a result of liberal use of
antibiotics. In addition to antibiotics, most critically ill patients rely on enteral nutrition which shapes their
microbiome. Previously we have shown artificial enteral nutrition (AEN), the default and most commonly used
formula for patients requiring enteral nutrition promotes dysbiosis. In contrast, high fiber plant based enteral
nutrition is well tolerated, promotes the growth of healthy commensal gut anaerobes, and improves outcomes
in murine models. In this proposal, unpublished data demonstrates PBEN is superior to AEN in mitigating ABx
induced lymphopenia, anemia, and neutrophilia. We also provide evidence that critically ill patients randomized
to PBEN have higher lymphocyte and lower neutrophil counts than those that received AEN. Still, how
antibiotics and diet shape hematopoiesis after ABx induced bone marrow suppression has never been directly
tested. Here, we will test the hypothesis that PBEN expedites immune recovery from antibiotic-induced
bone marrow suppression via repopulation of the gut with SCFA producing commensals that mitigate
myeloid skewing by 1) evaluating if PBEN is superior to AEN in restoring steady state balance between
myelopoiesis and lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow during recovery from ABx induced bone marrow
suppression and 2) testing the hypothesis that expedited immune recovery from ABx induced bone marrow
suppression with PBEN is mediated by microbial production of short chain fatty acids. Completion of these
aims will highlight nutrition as a previously underappreciated therapeutic target for improving immune recovery
of critically ill patients."

REDS-IV-P is a seven-year multicenter program, in the US and in Brazil, charged with conducting epidemiologic and laboratory studies in blood donors and transfusion recipients. The REDS-IV-P Program is comprised of 4 domestic hubs and a Brazil transfusion program involving investigators from the U.S. and from the Brazilian blood centers. Each domestic hub has a blood center and transfusion services that serve several specialty care and community hospitals participating in REDS-IV-P (total of 22 hospitals). The domestic Hubs and the Brazil international programs are each supported by a Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and Center for Transfusion Laboratory Studies (CTLS). REDS-IV-P is divided into 3 phases: 1) Phase 1 (Years 1-2) includes development of the REDS-IV-P research protocols, the development and pilot of a linked donation-component-recipient (vein to vein) database, the conduct of phase 1 research studies, and the conduct of data analyses using existing transfusion databases; 2) Phase 2 (Years 3-5) includes the conduct of phase 2 research protocols, compilation of the vein to vein database and data analyses, and dissemination of findings through presentations and publications; and 3) Phase 3 (Years 6-7) includes dissemination of findings through presentations and publications, closure of databases, and provision of all deliverables to NHLBI.

(12%) in Africa.1 Evidence-based cancer control interventions such as vaccines for cancer control exist, but are
underutilized in Nigeria.2,3 To close this research-to-practice gap, we propose a US-Nigerian Cancer Control
Center for Research on Implementation Science and Equity (C3-RISE) capacity building core. The overall
goals are to increase the pipeline of early-career Nigerian-based investigators and practitioners who can lead
IS research for equitable cancer control in Nigeria. We will use participatory implementation science
approaches10 (such as crowdsourcing11 and apprenticeships) to develop sustained capacity for implementation
research at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research. Crowdsourcing asks a group to solve a problem
(through participatory activities such as open calls,12 designathons,13 or other activities) and then shares the
solutions with the public.14 Apprenticeships provide the practical skills, direct mentorship, and supportive
environment to increase the likelihood of launching successful IS interventions. In this capacity building core,
we propose a series of in-person and online training opportunities in IS methods to spur innovative, equitable
cancer control research pilot studies. Each year, open calls will be used to identify eight exceptional trainees
(as part of two-person teams) from participating Nigerian-based institutions (including academic, clinical, and
community-based organizations). Each cohort will join a two-week residential training experience focused on
IS for equitable cancer control. Trainees will also become part of a year-long virtual learning community and
mentoring program designed to facilitate and sustain careers in the IS and cancer workforces. Trainee teams
will compete for small seed Pilot Partner grants to launch pilot plans of their final IS cancer pilots at community
sites. They will receive mentorship from established faculty mentors to carry out pilots focused on enhancing
vaccines to prevent cancer (i.e., HPV and HBV vaccines). Our specific aims are: To identify and recruit
Nigerian trainees for the C3-RISE capacity building core ; 2) To develop IS research capacity building for equity
in cancer control among trainees; and 3) To initiate, sustain, and evaluate a virtual participatory learning
community to facilitate access to curated resources and collaboration between geographically dispersed
trainees. Our strong focus on cultivating local Nigerian mentors and trainees will have an enduring impact on
institutionalizing research mentorship and enhancing capacity for training at the organizational level. Our plan
aligns with Nigerian national, NIH, and strategic priorities related to building capacity for cancer research."

 The HBNU Fogarty Global Health Training Program (the HBNU Program) fosters the next generation of
global health scientists and enhance research capacity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) through a
rigorous mentored research training plan for trainees early in their career. Specifically, it aims to support
trainee research focused on reducing the mortality and morbidity associated with: HIV/AIDS and associated
co-infections; noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer;
mental health; and maternal and child health and nutrition (MCHN). In addition to mentored research, training
will include didactic components to develop competency in rigorous research design and methods, evaluation
and analytic capacity, regulatory issues, and cross-cultural collaboration.
 The Program brings together leading academic research institutions with longstanding relationships in
LMICs in a variety of disciplines and with multidisciplinary research capacities. The inclusion of institutions that
have shown a historical commitment to educating students from groups underrepresented in biomedical
research is prioritized. The four U.S. academic research institutions that will anchor our consortium are:
Harvard University (Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health); Boston University (School of Public Health);
Northwestern University (Institute for Global Health, Feinberg School of Medicine); and the University of New
Mexico (School of Medicine, Center for Global Health).
 Our consortium’s partner LMIC research sites are 18 well-qualified institutions in 14 LMICs. These sites
have strong pre-existing relationships with the Program’s principal investigators and institutions and have
demonstrated capacity to provide outstanding mentored experiences. Specific Aims include:
AIM 1: Recruit a diverse pool of qualified U.S. predoctoral and U.S. and LMICS postdoctoral applicants;
including at least 17 trainees per year for Years 1-2 and 16 trainees per year for Years 3-5, for a minimum of
82 trainees over the award period; AIM 2: Deliver a comprehensive education and research support program,
including Field Preparedness Training, Monthly Seminars, and U.S. based training for LMIC trainees, that will
combine in-person and online learning and access to collaboration tools to support trainee individual
professional development and research project implementation; AIM 3: Provide trainees with rigorous
mentored research experiences at LMIC research sites with a very strong track record of peer-reviewed
publications and NIH research outputs; AIM 4: Build LMIC and global health research capacity at consortium
member institutions and internationally through activities such as alumni mentors and the Mentor Symposium.
 Ultimately, the Program will prepare a future generation of leaders to tackle and solve the most
challenging global health problems through early investment in committed predoctoral and postdoctoral
trainees to foster scientific creativity at a transformative stage in their career.

The main goals of the Supplement Award are to (1) correlate immunoserological responses to early immune
reactions in local tissue environment of the vaccine injection site in healthy donors, and (2) the compare between
healthy controls and patients with hematological disorders or autoimmune disease. We will use a high plex
immuno-fluorescence CODEX imaging panel to profile these skin biopsy samples in the next year of the award.
Using this panel, we can confirm the expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-
2 Spike antigen was detected in the epidermis and dermis of both arms from two donors. Specifically, SARS-
CoV-2 Spike co-expressed with CD303 and CD63 of the unvaccinated arm tissue of a healthy donor and in
cluster 0 of the vaccinated arm of a BCD donor, indicating expression in dendritic cells and basophils. In the next
year to be supported by the Supplement Award, we will be imaging at least 13 more skin tissue sections and
plan to conduct deeper informatics analysis. Additionally, we are performing DBiT-based spatial CITE-seq on
adjacent slides from these 13 skin tissue sections and integrating the data with previously obtained sc-mRNA-
seq data. Furthermore, we have completed immunoserology assays with the serum samples of these donors
and patients. Therefore, once we complete the peripheral tissue spatial imaging and spatial omics sequencing,
the results will be compared to systemic immunological and serological responses over times to help understand
the role of early immune reaction in the development of an effective vaccine protection, in particular, in patients
with blood cancer or autoimmune disease."
11175134,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Women and men are at different risks for disorders that occur at different stages of the lifespan from
development through aging and their sex differences have critical implications for therapeutic efficacy.
However, many of the mechanisms that explain these sex differences or disorders specific to women are still
unclear. The mission of our Harvard BIRCWH is to develop the next generation of scientist-clinicians as
leaders in the field of women’s health and sex differences who will contribute to understanding sex-dependent
vulnerabilities to clinical disorders and those specific to women. This competing renewal application seeks
continued support of a successful integrated interdisciplinary training program that is based on a translational
approach to understanding conditions with a higher incidence or different expression in women than men. The
program is modeled in the context of a lifespan perspective to identify etiologic mechanisms during fetal
development, puberty, adulthood, and aging, including the child-bearing years and menopause. Further, an
underlying assumption of our BIRCWH program is that an understanding of the role of hormones and genes
will provide the basis for understanding sex-dependent vulnerabilities to clinical disorders. The Division of
Women’s Health at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and the Innovation Center on Sex Differences in
Medicine, ICON-X (MGH), are the home sites for this Harvard-wide training program. The program capitalizes
on the long tradition of interdisciplinary research in women’s health and sex differences with mentors across
Harvard institutions: BWH, MGH, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center, Boston Children’s Hospital, Dana
Farber Cancer Institute, McLean Hospital, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Harvard Medical School
and the Eli & Edythe Broad Institute. Each BIRCWH scholar is assigned a team of mentors to operationalize
translational thinking. Primary Mentors are in clinical or basic research and provide the site at which the
scholar works. Secondary Mentors are in basic or clinical research (as a counterpart to the Primary) and help
to guide thinking, coursework and readings, depending on the scholar’s interests. Career Mentors advise
scholars in the relevant departmental and academic structures for career advancement. Mentors in Health
Disparities expose scholars to thinking about disparities and how health processes are influenced by
socioenvironmental factors. The Harvard BIRCWH program focuses on disorders with differences in incidence
and/or expression in women than men, including: Cardiovascular Disorders; Reproductive Endocrine &
Neuroendocrine Disorders; Neuropsychiatric Disorders; Autoimmune Disorders; and Female Cancers. By
capitalizing on the vast resources and faculty at Harvard and our 19-year successful BIRCWH history, Harvard
is an ideal site for continuing to offer an integrated, interdisciplinary and truly translational program that will
continue to train the next generation of leaders in women’s health and sex differences in medicine."
11165490,"Visceral pain is a key feature of functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and obstructive bowel disorders (OBD). Notably, there is also a high comorbidity of chronic visceral pain with stress-related psychiatric disorders including anxiety, depression, and fatigue, significantly impairing patients' quality of life. However, the molecular and circuit mechanisms of visceral pain are poorly understood, and the resulting lack of effective clinical management represents a major unmet medical problem. 
Pilot studies showed that activation of the glutamatergic Tacr3+ neurons in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SDH) is sufficient to drive both sensory discriminative (visceromotor response) and affective (aversion) visceral pain responses. Additionally, the parabrachial nucleus of the pons (PBN) in the brainstem had the most abundant projections of the Tacr3+ SDH neurons. These observations led us to frame the hypothesis that the glutamatergic Tacr3+ SDH neurons are excitatory interneurons and projection neurons mediating visceral pain processing from the mouse colon to the brainstem. 
The objective of this R56 is to elucidate whether the neural circuits from the colon-innervating spinal visceral afferents form functional synaptic connections with the Tacr3+ SDH neurons and dissect the function of Tacr3+ spinal projections in the brainstem. We will demonstrate for the first time that the glutamatergic Tacr3+ neurons receive synaptic inputs from the colon-innervating spinal visceral afferents, and stimulation of the colon-innervating spinal afferents is sufficient to activate the Tacr3+ SDH neurons. We will also investigate whether activating the Tacr3+ spinal projections in the PBN drives aversive behavior. 
The outcomes of these studies will advance our understanding of the cellular and circuit mechanisms of visceral sensory processing in the lumbosacral"

The hallmark of cellular senescence is the inability of cells to progress through the cell cycle. With increasing
age, senescent cells accumulate in multiple tissues; their abundance increases in aging and several age-related
diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, lung disease, and many others. Senescence is both a physiologically
fundamental and pathologically relevant program, with its role depending on the context and the specific
situation. Evidence linking senescence to common age-associated human diseases has emerged. Despite these
advances, little is known about the abundance, spatial distribution, precise nature, and functional relevance of
senescent cells in human tissues. The main challenge is paused by the extraordinarily complex heterogeneity of
the 3D architecture of tissues like the pancreas, even in non-diseased conditions, which greatly complicates the
spatially resolved identification of senescent cells. In this project, we will use the pancreas as a testbed and will
expand our 3D spatial analysis of cellular senescence to the human breast and ovaries of similar complex
heterogeneity. The development of spatial -omics approaches such as spatial transcriptomics/proteomics may
help overcome the challenge paused by 3D tissue heterogeneity. But these approaches only provide high-
content molecular information in a spatially resolved manner in 2D tissue sections. Here, we propose to establish
a new integrated 3D imaging platform that can map both the 3D architecture of large volumes (> 1cm3) of tissues
and can determine the location of senescent cells within a 3D tissue sample. Given its versatility, our proposed
integrated platform could readily be used to study spatial senescence in other tissues (besides the pancreas,
breast, and ovaries studied here) and to incorporate protein-based and RNA-based senescence signatures that
will be discovered by other centers and projects of the SenNet network. To produce the first comprehensive 3D
multiscale senescence atlas of tissues across ages, we propose the following aims in the UG3 and the UH3
phases. In the UG3 phase, in a small set of pancreatic and breast tissues, we will first integrate our new AI-
based 3D tissue reconstruction platform CODA with immunofluorescence (the CODA+IF platform) for multiple
labeling of senescence markers in FFPE tissue samples of non-diseased human pancreas and breast. We will
then integrate CODA with DBiT-seq (the CODA+DBiT-seq platform) and apply this integrated platform in regions
of the tissue sample that are poor and rich in cellular senescence, as identified by CODA+IF. In the UH3 phase,
we will apply these 3D cellular senescence mapping methods to large cohorts of pancreatic, breast, and ovarian
tissue. We will measure the distribution and variability and associated molecular signatures of senescent cells
within different tissue compartments in non-diseased tissue volumes as a function of age."
11178122,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Aging is an increasingly emergent public health issue, in large part because it is accompanied by a higher
frequency of chronic age-related diseases. Aging occurs naturally as a consequence of time (upon repeated
cellular replication) and is influenced by a number of environmental factors. Human skin, like all other tissues,
undergoes an intrinsic aging process during an individual’s lifespan known as chronological aging. Additionally,
the skin is constantly exposed to environmental factors such as UV radiation (UVR), which is recognized as the
major risk factor for the development of many skin cancers and accelerated skin aging, known as photoaging,
which is associated with hyperpigmentation and accelerated melanoma formation. In the skin, there is an age-
associated accumulation of senescent melanocytes, keratinocytes and fibroblasts capable of expressing the
senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which promotes inflammation through a complex network
of auto- and paracrine reinforcement that modifies the tissue microenvironment and has a profound deleterious
effect on skin structure and integrity. Thus, it is necessary to determine the characteristics of the major skin-
resident cell types undergoing senescence, as well as their individual SASP profiles expressed during
chronological and extrinsically-induced aging that play a role in the establishment of a skin microenvironment
conducive to age-related disorders. Our lab has developed sophisticated 3D skin models that recapitulate
normal skin physiology within a microfluidic platform in vitro, which can combined with other organs in a modular
tissue-on-a-chip platform. 3D engineered tissues cultured in microfluidic platforms are powerful tools to
recapitulate physiological conditions and investigate physiological phenomena in a controlled environment. We
will generate 3D skin models that encompass critical biological variables for mapping senescent cells in tissues,
and will encompass: 1) both genders; 2) the full range of skin pigmentation phototypes; and 3) age ranges across
the human lifespan. Our skin microfluidic platform, combined with innovative techniques such as spatial
transcriptomics, represents a powerful new tool to investigate the mechanisms leading to senescence in the skin
and new approaches to revert age-related conditions. This proposal will have immediate and seamless
integration into the recently established CUSTMAP Center at Columbia University, which is one of the founding
Tissue Mapping Centers of the SenNet consortium. Microfluidic tissue models can be customized for many of
the tissues represented across the SenNet, enabling the generation of a wide range of senescence-on-a-chip
platforms for the Consortium."

Among ocular infections, recurrent herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) infection causes immune cell infiltration
and opacity in the cornea and triggers a severe immuno-inflammatory condition called herpetic stromal
keratitis (HSK). HSK is a painful condition and one of the leading causes of infectious blindness in the United
States and worldwide. Current HSK treatments, such as anti-virals combined with corticosteroids, are partially
effective, and prolonged use causes severe local and systemic side effects. Further, the emergence of multi-
drug-resistant HSV-1 strains in HSK patients is a major clinical challenge. Therefore, there is an unmet clinical
need to develop safe and effective immunotherapies to treat HSK. The selective induction of a potent anti-
viral state with minimal activation of inflammatory immune responses embodies a powerful means to treat
patients with recurrent HSK. In this application, we propose one such approach targeting IL-27, an
immunoregulatory cytokine, to induce endogenous anti-viral and anti-inflammatory responses after corneal
HSV-1 infection to suppress HSK progression. Macrophages (Mϕs) play a central role in initiating and
resolving inflammation during HSK progression. Intracellular dsDNA from HSV-1 is recognized by cyclic-
GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) and activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway to
promote anti-viral immunity. HSV-1 infected Mϕs promote glycolysis with compensatory downregulation of
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. We observed that the TCA cycle in activated Mϕs is disrupted with
increased immune-responsive gene 1 (Irg1) expression, an enzyme that converts citrate to itaconate.
Itaconate is an immunoregulatory mitochondrial metabolite that can play both pro- and anti-viral roles. Our
preliminary data suggest that ocular HSV-1 infection promotes Irg1 expression in the cornea and Mϕs to
suppress anti-viral immunity through negative regulation of the cGAS-STING pathway. Apart from pathogens,
cytokines regulate metabolism in Mϕs to modulate their effector functions. We show that HSV-1 induces IL-
27 expression in the cornea, and mice lacking the IL-27 receptor are highly susceptible to ocular HSV-1
infection with increased viral titers and HSK severity. We show that IL-27 attenuates HSV-1-induced glycolytic
metabolism in Mϕs and suppresses Irg1 expression to stimulate IFN-β and limit inflammatory cytokine
production. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that HSV-1 reprograms Mϕs to promote the Irg1 to
evade cGAS-STING-mediated anti-HSV-1 responses (Aim 1) and IL-27 attenuates HSV-1-induced glycolytic
metabolism in Mϕs to suppress inflammation and promote anti-viral immunity through inhibition of Irg1 to
activate cGAS-STING pathway (Aim 2). The primary outcome of this study will be to uncover how HSV-1
regulates Mϕ metabolism to evade anti-viral responses during HSK progression. Our proposed IL-27-based
approach will complement the current anti-viral and immunosuppressive HSK therapies to increase their
efficacy, thus lowering the risk of side effects."

In the US, people with HIV (PWH) experience elevated mortality and morbidity due to cancer compared to the
general population. In fact, PWH diagnosed with non-AIDS defining cancers including lung, breast, and colorectal
cancers, are more likely to die due to their cancer diagnosis compared to those without HIV. Factors contributing
to the disproportionate burden of poor cancer outcomes among PWH are likely multi-factorial, including inter-
connected clinical and social factors, such as advanced stage at cancer diagnosis and barriers to cancer
screening for timely diagnosis. It is known that PWH are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage at
cancer diagnosis compared to those without HIV. Inequities in access to cancer screening among PWH are likely
a key contributor to lower cancer-specific survival rates among PWH. However, limited research exists
comparing trends in non-AIDS defining cancer screening recommendations. Breast, colorectal, and lung cancers
each have screening recommendations outlined and are preventable with routine, timely, guideline-adherent
screening. Detecting these cancers at later stage leads to more complex treatment trajectories and poorer
cancer-related outcomes. It is urgent to understand trends in cancer screening uptake and follow-up in the
general population of PWH to facilitate intervention development. However, existing research on cancer
screening trends on PWH focuses on populations engaged in routine HIV care visits, which may not reflect the
real-world barriers to screening PWH in the US face. We therefore propose to leverage data from the All of Us
Research Program to carry out the following aims: (Aim 1) Compare serial cross-sectional screening prevalence
for breast, colorectal, and lung cancers by HIV status, stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity; (Aim 2) Evaluate
time to follow-up after an abnormal cancer screening results by HIV status, stratified by age, sex, and
race/ethnicity; and (Aim 3) Estimate associations of multi-level social determinants of health (SDoH) with cancer
screening behaviors among PWH. The All of Us Research Program is an ideal data source to conduct this study
given the national recruitment efforts, the diverse study population, the recruitment of patients who are largely
served by federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), the unique linkage of electronic health record data as well
as in-depth survey data to obtain SDoH information at an individual level, and the availability of zip code to link
to contextual SDoH. The linkage of electronic health record data is particularly critical given we will have access
to HIV disease and care/treatment status, and detailed information regarding cancer screening behaviors as well
as treatment for any abnormal findings. The present proposal will lead to two important outcomes: (1) insights
on real-world trends into cancer screening and prevention behaviors among PWH to facilitate intervention
development tailored to PWH; and (2) an establishment of a research team and the infrastructure necessary to
translate findings into intervention development."
11128434,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Inhalation of aerosolized dusts from urban, rural, and farming environments can trigger harmful airway
inflammation and injury; over time, continual exposure to these particulates increases one's risk for developing
inflammatory airway diseases. While dust exposures negatively impact lung health, factors contributing to
protection versus susceptibility to lung disease following these continual inhalational exposures are unclear. A
recently discovered class of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) derived from omega-3 fatty acids
regulate lung inflammation, immunity, and repair, and are likely key to the beneficial effects of diets high in
omega-3 fatty acids. Our previous investigations identified that the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) and its lipid metabolite maresin-1 (MaR1) mitigate airway inflammation from acute and repetitive organic
dust exposure, mediated in part by macrophage activation and pro-repair activities on the airway epithelium.
Our exciting new data identify that omega-3 fatty acids and MaR1 can activate IL-22 signaling in lung
macrophages. IL-22 signaling promotes mucosal immunity and epithelial barrier integrity, and its activation in
the presence of these bioactive lipids may be key to their protective effects. Furthermore, our novel finding of
IL-22 signaling in macrophages challenges current dogma regarding the activation and regulation of this
pathway. The goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of omega-3 fatty acids in promoting pro-repair IL-22
signaling in the lung following dust exposures. We hypothesize that omega-3 fatty acids and SPM promote
lung recovery following particulate matter exposures by inducing alveolar macrophage IL-22 production that
subsequently promotes alveolar macrophage pro-resolution polarization and lung epithelial repair. To test this
hypothesis, in Aim 1, we will establish the impact of omega-3 fatty acids and IL-22 on lung recovery following
dust exposure. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the role of omega-3 fatty acids and IL-22 in epithelial repair and
mucosal immunity during dust exposure. In Aim 3, we will identify how SPM and IL-22 signaling impacts lung
macrophage polarization. Together, our studies will identify how omega-3 fatty acids modulate susceptibility
versus resilience to dust exposures, including a novel protective mechanism via activation of macrophage IL-
22 signaling to promote tissue repair and mucosal immunity. We expect our studies' findings to guide novel
treatment strategies for lung disease."

 For decades, pregnant individuals who identify as Black have been considered at greatest risk for
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). HDP often follow individuals well past pregnancy, presenting as
accelerated cardiovascular disease (CVD), which also disproportionately affects Black females. Mechanisms
by which implications of race, a complex social structure, become biologically embedded and translate into
pathophysiology remain unknown. Allostatic Load (AL)
and is inclusive of race-related stress. The purpose of the proposed K99/R00 is to
provide the candidate with adequate training and experience to investigate health disparities, AL and omics-
based biomarkers, within the context of pregnancy and beyond. The K99 phase aims are to (1) evaluate the
effect of first-trimester AL on the association between self-identified race and HDP, (2) evaluate the association
between first-trimester AL index and genetic variation, and (3) investigate the effect of first-trimester DNA
methylation on the association between first-trimester AL index and preeclampsia, the HDP with the greatest
racial disparity. This project is ancillary to the Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-
be Heart Health Study (nuMoM2b-HHS) and leverages existing data previously collected for nuMoM2b-HHS.
Previously collected first-trimester clinical and GWAS data and recently generated DNA methylation data will
be utilized to accomplish aims 1, 2, and 3. The proposed K99 training plan includes expert mentorship,
meetings and seminars, coursework, and conferences, to achieve competency in (A) mechanisms of
HDP/post-pregnancy cardiovascular health, (B) health disparities research, (C) bioinformatics and analysis of
omics data, and (D) professional career development. The R00 phase extends this line of investigation to
cardiovascular health at two timepoints, 2-7 and 7-12 years, following pregnancy in the same cohort. The R00
phase aims are to (1) evaluate the effect of AL index trajectories on the relationship between self-identified
race and post-pregnancy cardiovascular health and (2) evaluate the association between DNA methylation
trajectory and post-pregnancy cardiovascular health. As with the K99 phase, previously collected data will be
utilized to execute aim 1, while aim 2 will employ existing DNA samples, data cleaning and quality control
pipelines. This innovative application provides several experimental opportunities to greatly impact multiple
fields of research including: AL, HDP, post-pregnancy CVD, and racial disparities of each. Findings will inform
the development of evidence-based interventions that focus on reducing health disparities and improving
pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular health in females."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Specialty registered nurse (RN) certifications can be a popular choice for practicing RNs to to advance their
knowledge and expertise and are one way hospitals invest in their nursing workforce. An estimated 40% of
acute care RNs hold specialty certification and as many as 55% of hospitals offer tuition reimbursement and
paid time off for completion potentially costing organizations several mission dollars annually. While RN
specialty certification is a multi-million dollar industry, surprisingly little evidence exists about the value added
by RN specialty certifications in terms of improved nurse performance and patient and organizational
outcomes. Evidence that does exist is inconclusive and judged as low quality due to cross-sectional study
designs, aggregation of data at the hospital- or unit-level, and poor quality of certifications data in most hospital
human resource databases. Lack of robust evidence may lead to broad-scale under- (or over-) investment in
specialty RN certification in the healthcare industry, potentially contributing to excessive costs and suboptimal
patient outcomes. In collaboration with the 4th largest healthcare system in the United States (CommonSpirit
Health, over 140 hospitals across 21 states), we will conduct nurse-patient linked analyses of the impact of RN
specialty certification on nurse performance, patient outcomes, and costs. Our proposal draws on our team’s
prior and current expertise in nurse-patient linked analyses of electronic health record data, individual nurse
value-added performance measurement, and quasi-experimental regression methods for causal inference (i.e.
difference-in-difference with time-varying treatment effects). In Aim 1, we will determine whether RN specialty
certifications improve nurse performance using a one-nurse-to-many-patients linking approach we developed,
allowing us to test the causal effect of obtaining a specialty certification on nurse performance and whether the
effect of specialty certification on nurse performance depends on the type of certification (e.g. critical care,
medical-surgical, wound/ostomy) and on nurse characteristics (education, experience). In Aim 2, using a one-
patient-to-many-nurses linking approach we have developed, we will determine if patient outcomes and
organizational financial outcome improve with a higher proportion of specialty-certified nurses; this Aim allow
us to examine whether patients who receive a greater proportion of care from specialty certified nurses have
improved outcomes and lower costs, and the financial impact (cost-benefit) of increasing the proportion of
specialty certified nurses in different types of organizations (e.g. Magnet/non-Magnet, teaching/non-teaching).
In Aim 3, we will explore the contexts and mechanisms that support or hinder the impact of specialty nurse
certification on patients, costs, and organizational outcomes, through focus groups and interviews with nurses
and nurse leaders. Taken together the aims of this mixed methods study will provide the most robust, causal,
and generalizable evidence to inform investments in nurse human capital to optimize nurse performance,
achieve targeted patient outcomes, and reduce costs of care.

American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities experience cancer incidence and mortality rates that
are strikingly worse than those of the overall US population. In Oklahoma, which has the second highest
population of AI/AN persons in the US and is the home to 39 Tribal Nations, the overall cancer incidence
among the AI/AN population is 36% higher and cancer mortality 73% higher than the US general population.
To reduce the major impact cancer has in the lives of AI/AN persons in Oklahoma and beyond, the Native
American Center for Cancer Health Equity (NACCHE) at Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) seeks to establish
the Improving Cancer Outcomes in Native American Communities (ICON) U19 Center. ICON includes
Indigenous investigators and community partners across all elements of the grant to support bidirectional,
meaningful, generalizable, and tribally-engaged research studies. NACCHE in close consultation with its Tribal
Advisory Council (TAC) has conducted an ongoing needs assessment of AI/AN community member
perceptions of cancer research priorities that has identified three leading priorities for AIAN cancer research –
prevention, screening, and care coordination. Thus, ICON is forwarding research projects that address each
priority area. Water for Health: Strengthening Tribal Action for Cancer Prevention proposes a comprehensive
drinking water exposure assessment for arsenic/uranium, followed by developing intervention plans with Tribes
to reduce these exposures. Lung Cancer Screening to Improve Equity in Tribal Communities in Oklahoma
extends and refines our community-engaged clinical trial implementing a multi-faceted lung cancer screening
(LCS) program (R01CA225439) to the nation's largest tribal health system. Care Coordination and
Communication Program in Oncology for Tribal Health Systems will enhance cancer care coordination
between SCC and referring Indian Health Service, Tribal, and urban Indian (ITU) facilities, and features a novel
collaborative care intervention centered on telehealth “Huddles” that jointly involve the patient's healthcare
teams at SCC and the ITU facility. ICON's Overall Component specific aims include: (1) To provide
administrative infrastructure, guided by the TAC, that will ensure the successful execution of ICON research
projects and career enhancement activities in ways that foster genuine tribal partnerships; (2) To engage Tribal
Nations and related organizations in ICON to enhance and sustain our long-term, trust-based relationships to
address cancer-related concerns; (3) To conduct tribally engaged research to improve cancer outcomes in
culturally respectful and practical ways among AI/AN persons living in Oklahoma and beyond; and (4) To
monitor and assess progress of ICON performance to ensure successful completion of each project

The introduction of clinical exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and metabolomics
has transformed our ability to diagnose patients with suspected genetic disease. With the introduction of these
technologies, a potential molecular DNA lesion can be identified in at least 25-30% of patients with a suspected
genetic diagnosis. These technologies have also led to the discovery of hundreds of new disease genes and to
phenotypic expansion within known genetic diagnoses. This continued discovery of new disease genes leads to
structure, function and mechanistic discoveries that assist personalized approaches for management and
therapy. However, up to 70% of patients with suspected genetic disease remain undiagnosed likely because
their disease-causing variant(s) has yet to be discovered or the clinical significance of identified variants remains
unclear. Precision models produced using various genome modification techniques in Drosophila melanogaster
(fly) and Mus musculus (mouse) are important tools aiding in the interpretation of these variants of uncertain
clinical significance and are critical for testing therapeutic paradigms. We will leverage the expertise,
infrastructures, and established collaborations between the rare, Mendelian disease clinical and gene discovery
programs; fly, mouse, and nonhuman primate animal modeling programs; and database infrastructure programs
within the Department of Molecular and Human Genetics (DMHG) at the Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) to
establish the BCM Center for Precision Medicine Modeling (BCPMM). The vision of our Center is to support
local, national, and international programs and individual researchers in the development of precision models
that will end the diagnostic odyssey of patients with undiagnosed, rare, and Mendelian diseases and serve as
resources for pre-clinical studies investigating personalized medicine approaches to their care. We will
achieve these goals by pursuing the following aims: (1) leverage existing multidisciplinary expertise within BCM
to design, generate, and identify precision animal models for studies that answer clinical questions with impact
on patient care; (2) conduct demonstration projects that showcase the Center’s capacity to model undiagnosed
and rare diseases and to translate model organism findings back to patient care; (3) Engage human genome
discovery programs, clinicians, and researchers to recruit disease-associated variant nominations for precision
model studies within the Center; (4) Perform bidirectional translation of findings from precision animal models
and from patient clinical studies for integration into clinical diagnostics, clinical care, or clinical trials; (5)
Implement bioinformatics platforms that optimize Center disease modeling and organizational activities.
Although our initial focus will build on our expertise in undiagnosed, rare, and Mendelian diseases, our long-term
goal is to broaden our scope by establishing collaborations with investigators and programs focused on
multigenic and common disease."
11178123,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The molecular and cellular heterogeneity of senescent cells remains poorly characterized. The knowledge gap
is mainly due to the lack of proper technology to characterize the cell states, types, and circuits in intact tissues.
Thus, we will need novel technologies to map the multidimensional parameters of senescence across diverse
tissue environments at molecular, cellular, and morphological levels and over longitudinal time frames. Single
cell multi-omics and molecular profiling assays (e.g., single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC-seq, single-cell
proteomics, methylomics, metabolomics) have opened new windows into understanding the properties,
regulation, dynamics, and function of cells at unprecedented resolution and scale. However, these assays are
inherently destructive. Cells need to be dissociated, fixed, or lysed for these molecular profiling assays. Raman
microscopy offers a unique opportunity to comprehensively report on the vibrational energy levels of molecules
in a label-free, nondestructive manner with subcellular spatial resolution. With recent advances in Raman
microscopy, single-cell and spatial multi-omics, and machine learning, we have developed “Raman2RNA” (R2R),
an experimental and computational framework to infer single-cell expression profiles in live cells through label-
free hyperspectral Raman microscopy images combined with multi-modal data integration and domain
translation. In this proposal, we aim to develop “SenNetRaman”, an innovative experimental and computational
platform to character the molecular heterogeneity of senescent cells through label-free hyperspectral Raman
microscopy, single cell and spatial genomics, and machine learning. In the UG3 phase, we aim to develop
“SenNetRaman” for characterizing single cells in lung tissues corresponding to young, naturally aged or stress-
induced senescence states from well-established mouse models. We will develop a high-throughput Raman
microscopy system for label-free characterization of the molecular heterogeneity of senescent cells and identify
Raman signals/markers predictive of gene expression and corresponding to various senescent cell states and
types. In the UH3 phase, we will demonstrate “SenNetRaman” for characterizing senescent cells across multiple
senescence model systems including human lungs, brains, and skins from an established human senescence
tissue mapping center. Overall, “SenNetRaman” is a modular and universal framework to link imaging data with
single-cell multi-omics data for building quantitative biomolecular tissue maps of human senescent cells. Our
application is innovative in the approach to study senescence by leveraging the recent advances in imaging,
single-cell genomics, and machine learning. The results of this project will help identify novel markers and reveal
new biology of senescence. “SenNetRaman” builds upon the SenNet Initiative and can be readily adapted to
existing NIH single-cell tissue mapping efforts, including the Human Tumor Atlas (HTAN), Human Biomolecular
Atlas Program (HuBMAP), and Human Cell Atlas (HCA) that will transform future biomedical and clinical research."

Mathematical Sciences in Cameroon, and the University of Cape Town in South Africa. This coalition is built
upon a long-term collaboration between Buea and UCLA focused on decreasing the burden of surgical
diseases in Cameroon and other sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. Injuries and other surgically treated
diseases comprise a significant burden of disease in SSA, but opportunities for research and funding are
sparse. Our work on injury and other surgical conditions has identified deep inequities that are particularly
unmasked in acute care settings. The intersection between injury and equity is our priority area of study, as the
inequities revealed by trauma are often symptomatic of larger, systemic, cross-cutting issues. Our mission is to
leverage data science to decrease the impact of trauma, surgical disease, and disparities on the populations of
Cameroon and SSA by promoting research, networking, and capacity building. We are accomplishing this
through three Center Cores and two Research Projects. These two projects rely on the Cameroon Trauma
Registry (CTR), a 10-hospital centralized data base that collects data on demographics, context, clinical care,
and outcomes for trauma patients. To date, the CTR has collected data on over 8000 Cameroonian trauma
patients and, at approximately 450 patients per month. The overall goal of D-SINE Africa’s Project 2 is to
optimize follow up care, which is done through an mHealth follow up program that currently collects data from
injured patients at two weeks, one month, three months, and six months after discharge, capturing rare
information on disability and economic consequences of trauma. As poor mental health and previous injury are
both risk factors for future injury, mental health issues have a compounding effect on trauma patients’ future
risk of injury and death. Consequently, our Project 2’s goal may be significantly affected by mental health
conditions, which are currently not being measured in the mHealth program. This supplement aims to mitigate
this unexpected challenge by modifying the existing follow up protocol. We aim to 1) adapt the existing follow
up mHealth app to screen patients for the mental health conditions most commonly associated with traumatic
injury; 2) estimate the prevalence of trauma patients who are at high risk for these conditions; and 3) evaluate
the acceptability of a candidate community-based mental health intervention using a rapid qualitative CFIR
framework-based deductive analysis. By achieving these aims, we will have a robust assessment of the
prevalence of mental health correlates of trauma in Cameroon, allowing us to incorporate them into our Project
2’s follow up optimization, and have a preliminary understanding of the acceptability of a promisingintervention."

for injured patients on approximately 450 patients per month. CTR analysis has revealed that improving access
to prehospital care is an important target for reducing injury death, as the few patients who receive prehospital
care are more likely to survive their injuries. However, lack of injury mapping capacity is currently a major
roadblock to developing a Cameroonian prehospital care system. In this supplement, we propose to leverage
the Data Science Africa Consortium to develop a data science solution to this critical barrier. Specifically, this
supplement proposes to adapt an existing INFORM application designed to map air quality to an application
capable of mapping injury in Cameroon and then to test usability in three candidate reporting populations:
commercial drivers, injury exposed communities, and high school students."
11142100,"PROJECT SUMMARY OF FUNDED R15 GRANT (R15CA254006-01A1)
A major component of many solid tumors, including lung cancers, are bone marrow (BM)-derived immune cells
that migrate to tumors and aid in their continued growth. While the activity of these cells including tumor
associated macrophages (TAMs) has been the subject of intense investigation, we recently identified that BM-
derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are also present in growing tumors and can be
functionally maintained intratumorally for long periods of time. Interestingly, the numbers of HSPCs present in
tumors directly correlates to the eventual regrowth rates of tumors following radiation therapy (RT). The data
suggests that HSPCs represent another important cell population involved in tumor biology, however; their
mechanism of action is still unclear. Filling this gap in knowledge will add to the ever-changing understanding of
tumor biology. The objective of this proposal is to determine how HSPCs are maintained in tumors and how
HSPCs promote tumor regrowth post-RT. Our preliminary data support the idea that HSPCs are maintained
through interactions of the integrin CD49f and laminins present within the tumor extracellular matrix. In Specific
Aim 1, we will show that this interaction is indeed responsible for HSPC maintenance using in vitro and in vivo
strategies that block or enhance this interaction followed by analysis of their effects on HSPC functionality. We
will also define the intracellular signaling pathways involved in this process with initial studies focusing on focal
adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. These studies will characterize for the first time a tumor specific niche capable
of maintaining HSPCs outside of the BM. In Specific Aim 2, we will demonstrate that tumor treatment with RT
exacerbates HSPC migration to tumors and concomitantly disrupts the interaction between CD49f and laminin.
We will also show that RT produces tumor microenvironments that favor the differentiation of these ‘released’
HSPCs into tumor supportive macrophages (specifically M2 polarized) to aid in tumor recovery. We will also test
the effects of blocking the activity of HSPCs on tumor growth and regrowth post-RT. By completing the proposed
studies, our long-term goal is to use the knowledge gained to make a significant contribution towards the
development of more robust treatment strategies for patients suffering with solid tumor based cancers."

Since achieving NCI designation in 2018, the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC) at the University of Oklahoma
has continued to grow and mature as an organization. The SCC’s vision to eliminate cancer in Oklahoma and
beyond is advanced through its mission to provide patient-centered, research-driven, multidisciplinary cancer
care to all Oklahomans. As Oklahoma’s only NCI-designated cancer center, the SCC serves a statewide
catchment area that presents unique challenges with social determinants of health and high disparities in
cancer incidence and mortality, especially for the state’s American Indian (AI), Black/African American, and
rural populations. The SCC has the ability to be impactful in its catchment area and nationally due to
strategically targeted recruitments and investments that have leveraged key differentiating factors: 1) the SCC
continues to invest in creating and sustaining health and research partnerships with AI tribal partners
throughout Oklahoma and currently has 22 NIH funded projects addressing AI cancer disparities; 2) the SCC
continues to be a national leader in the NCI/NCTN and has established a statewide network of affiliate sites to
ensure access to NCI-sponsored clinical trials throughout its catchment area; 3) the SCC has developed strong
team-based research across all of its programs with national leadership in gynecologic, colon, and pancreatic
cancers, cancer prevention, cancer therapeutics, gero-oncology, and tobacco control; and 4) the SCC is
building upon its national leadership in mobile health technologies to address the burden on cancer in rural and
vulnerable populations.
Multiple NCI CCSG metrics emphasize the growth and maturation of the SCC during the reporting period
(2017-21). SCC membership increased from 83 to 120 (45%), with 31 of these new members being externally
recruited to add expertise to programs. Annual, peer-reviewed research funding (DC) grew 61% ($14.28M 
$22.97M) and total annual research funding grew 42% ($30.13M  $43.09M). The overall five-year number of
scientific publications has increased by 54% since the last reporting period (945  1,454), with 16% having an
impact factor ≥10 (up from 7%). Team science has been emphasized resulting in 139 collaborative grants
(36% increase) and a 17% inter-programmatic publication rate (up from 4%) over the prior reporting period.
The number of annual active interventional IITs has doubled from 20 to 40 over the past five years, with annual
accruals to interventional IITs increasing from 661 (2017) to 927 (2021) – a 40% increase. This degree of
impactful growth has been possible due to the infrastructure made available through the CCSG and has
positioned the SCC for a successful renewal as a NCI-designated cancer center."

Through this proposed new supplemental award, the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center
Community Outreach and Engagement (JCCC COE) team will collaborate with community partners, the
Mixteco Indigena Community Organizing Project (MICOP) and Antelope Valley Partners for Health (AVPH) to
develop and disseminate tailored multi-channel communication campaigns to promote cancer screening and
tobacco control in predominately low-income Latinx communities in two high need regions served by the
JCCC. In keeping with Track 2 of this funding opportunity, campaigns will focus on the general population,
ages 30 and over, promoting breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening, and raising awareness about
lung cancer screening. MICOP works to aid and empower the Indigenous immigrant agricultural community in
Ventura County, California. This community faces many obstacles to accessing health care, including linguistic
barriers as many community members speak only their native non-written languages. MICOP's radio station
broadcasts in Indigenous languages, providing an important means of imparting information to the community.
The Antelope Valley (AV) is one of the least densely populated and most economically challenged areas of Los
Angeles County, with relatively few health and social service resources. AVPH is a non-profit community
collaborative dedicated to improving the lives of underserved residents in the AV. Building on the successes
and lessons learned through our collaborative efforts in the ongoing UCLA MICEO supplement, and with
continued guidance from our Project Advisory Committee, we will craft, disseminate and evaluate messages
tailored to meet the specific needs and preferences of the communities served by our partner organizations.
We expect to reach a total of 78,500 community members, including 70,000 residents via MICOP's radio
station and via social media campaigns incorporating audio overlay in Indigenous languages and 8,500
residents through AVPH, via social media and community health worker outreach. We will track campaign
reach and numbers of residents who seek screening because of our campaigns. Brief surveys with community
members will assess cancer screening knowledge and awareness and interviews with clinic staff and
community health workers will examine which aspects of campaigns were most impactful. The JCCC COE
team has decades of experience collaborating with community organizations, including MICOP and AVPH. We
are eager to build on lessons learned in the first project year and will utilize the extended project period to craft
toolkits for each campaign, to support sustained implementation by our partners and widespread dissemination
to other local partners as well as via state and national networks. The proposed work is closely aligned with the
mission of the JCCC and COE to reduce cancer disparities through outreach and engagement activities in the
most affected communities."
11161058,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: PROJECT SUMMARY
The Administrative Core (AC) provides the organizational nexus for the jointly conducted cancer research
and career enhancement activities of the proposed NIMHD U19 Center, Improving Outcomes in Native
American Communities (ICON). Years of community outreach and engagement with Tribal Nations, Tribal
Organizations and Indian Health Service, Tribal, and urban American Indian / Alaska Native (ITU) clinics have
taught the ICON Leadership Team (LT) that successful research collaborations flourish when researchers
focus from the outset on these partners interests and priorities rather than their own. Tribes, Tribal
Organizations and ITU healthcare systems are involved with ICON because they understand the impact that
this U19 Center promises to have on improving cancer health outcomes. Importantly for the AC, they also trust
that the robust governance structure proposed in the AC will guide use and sharing of data from the proposed
research studies. The Administrative Core (AC) LT, in close collaboration with the Community Engagement
Core, will create an ethical, acceptable and feasible framework for testing, data collection and data sharing in
partnership with Tribes, which as sovereign nations, have rights that are unique among underrepresented
groups in the United States. The AC LT, which will be guided by the Stephenson Cancer Center’s Native
American Center for Cancer Health Equity (NACCHE) Tribal Advisory Council (TAC), will establish procedures
for regular communication and decision making with our Tribal and ITU research project partners, the NIMHD
Program Office, and other funded U19 Center(s). ICON research projects and investigator career
enhancement activities are integrated and mutually reinforcing, with the ultimate goal of creating durable
capacity to improve cancer outcomes among American Indian / Alaska Native persons in Oklahoma and
beyond. Specific aims are: (1) To provide leadership, infrastructure and a management plan to ensure smooth
operational support for all proposed activities; (2) To provide career enhancement experiences for ICON
investigators, and (3) to conduct rigorous program evaluation to facilitate ongoing ICON performance and
ensure successful completion of each project component. A major goal of ICON is to build a secure foundation
for tribally engaged cancer research. The AC will support a governance structure fostering shared decision
making. It will provide fiscal oversight as well as oversight of Institutional Review Board (IRB) applications, as
each research project will require coordinated approvals by Tribal, Indian Health Service and/or academic
institution IRBs. The AC will conduct program evaluation for each project. Collectively, these management
functions will ensure that all aspects of ICON are integrated into a tribally engaged effort to improve cancer
health outcomes."
11161059,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CORE: SUMMARY
Community engagement is the foundation of our approach in ICON (the Improving Cancer Outcomes in Native
American Communities U19 Center). Each of our Projects is embedded in long-term collaborations, and our
Leadership Team has decades of experience in community-engaged research with tribes, which will help to
ensure that systematic and meaningful community engagement is woven into every aspect of ICON's work. By
integrating members of the CE Core in each Project team, as well as our Administrative Core, we position
ourselves to channel lessons learned from these established partnerships into more general guidance for
ICON community engagement, including the development of toolkits to support both university- and
community-based researchers in partnerships to advance cancer health equity. Specifically, we propose to 1)
establish a central Hub for community engagement on cancer; 2) support the continued development of
community-engaged research protocols through Engagement Studios; 3) translate ICON research into
improvements in health and health care for AI/AN patients, communities, and nations through Accelerators;
and 4) engage tribal communities in dialogues about ICON research through Community Forums. Our CE work
is embedded in frameworks that promote respectful inclusion of Indigenous American perspectives and
knowledge into existing and new models of cancer research and care, as well as articulations for achieving
health equity and systems transformation through community engagement. Of central importance is the
advancement of integrations of Indigenous and European American perspectives and knowledge in ways that
overcome simplistic oppositions and generate continued progress toward more authentic relationships based
on collaborative partnerships, multidirectional dialogue, co-learning, shared leadership, and an investment in
addressing community priorities in research. The CE Core will serve as the main resource for community
dissemination in ICON as we continue to move towards research that is not only responsive to community
priorities, but also applied successfully to them. Importantly, the quality and outcomes of our partnerships will
be an explicit component of our evaluation plan to ensure that all ICON endeavors will be regularly modified,
as needed, to improve the experience of community partners and the impact of our research in Oklahoma
Tribal Nations."
11161060,"PROJECT 2: WATER FOR HEALTH: PROJECT SUMMARY
For decades, the Strong Heart Study (SHS) has collaborated with American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN)
communities in the Northern Plains, Southern Plains, and Southwest to improve cardiovascular health through
various multi-level interventions and state-of-the-art epidemiologic research. AI/AN communities experience
significantly elevated drinking water arsenic and uranium exposures in both private wells and regulated public
drinking water systems. However, the contribution of these modifiable drinking water exposures to AI/AN
disparities in arsenic and uranium-associated cancer incidence mortality remains poorly characterized.
Arsenic- and uranium- associated cancers are of increasing concern for SHS communities and AI/AN
communities nationwide, as AI/AN communities experience increasing disparities in incidence for these
cancers (lung, bladder, kidney, pancreas, prostate). The objective of the proposed project is to support multi-
level interventions to reduce water arsenic and uranium for AI/AN communities, with the ultimate goal of
reducing arsenic and uranium associated cancers for AI/AN communities. The proposed project is grounded in
a conceptual model linking local social-ecological frameworks for health disparities and disparities in water
arsenic exposures with Indigenous frameworks weaving mainstream science with Indigenous Knowledge. In
Aim 1, we will comprehensively characterize exposure to arsenic and uranium in unregulated well and public
water systems across all SHS communities and disseminate individualized dashboards to tribal communities.
In addition to leveraging available resources that have not been compiled for stakeholder use, we will extend
process-based models for estimating groundwater arsenic and geospatial models of arsenic/uranium in
regulated public water to all SHS communities. In Aim 2, we will conduct state-of-the-art epidemiologic
analyses to evaluate the association between water arsenic and uranium with incident and fatal cancers of the
lung, bladder, kidney, pancreas, and prostate in the SHS, with a focus on estimating the impacts of potential
interventions on cancer rates. These data are critical because AI/AN populations remain unrepresented in
epidemiologic science driving federal drinking water standards. In Aim 3, we will conduct formative research
with eight SHS communities and comprehensively review successful multi-level intervention plans with
community priorities, needs, strengths, and challenges, with the ultimate goal of supporting communities to
develop culturally relevant and individualized intervention plans to reduce water arsenic and uranium. Our
proposal brings together a multi-disciplinary, multi-site team, and leverages decades of collaboration and
community engagement with SHS communities across all three SHS study sites. The proposed study
responds directly to the NIMHD-identified need for community-driven prevention strategies to reduce the
impact of arsenic and uranium-associated cancers for AI/AN populations."
11175145,"Novel strategies are needed when standard approaches fail to delineate mechanisms by which mutations
cause disease. This is the case for Progressive Pseudorheumatoid Arthropathy of Childhood (PPAC), a
degenerative joint disease caused by genetic deficiency of Wnt-inducible signaling pathway protein 3 (WISP3,
also known as CCN6). Patients appear normal at birth, but during childhood develop painful, polyarticular,
degenerative joint disease. In teenage years patients require hip and knee arthroplasties, and they have joints
that resemble end-stage osteoarthritis. Because it is unethical to obtain prospective cartilage biopsies from
children, an animal model is needed to understand the pathobiology that underlies PPAC. Wisp3 knockout
mice did not model PPAC. Therefore, we knocked out WISP3 in sheep, which are larger and longer-lived
animals and have cartilage that is more similar to human cartilage than mice. Like patients with PPAC, our KO
sheep appeared clinically normal at birth but developed altered gaits and joint tenderness with movement and
palpation by 5 months of age. Now that we have an animal model of PPAC, we propose to expand our flock
of KO sheep and prospectively evaluate them clinically, radiographically, histologically, transcriptomically,
Raman spectroscopically, biomechanically and biochemically. We will couple these studies with histologic
and transcriptomic data we obtain from articular-like cartilage tissues that we differentiate from PPAC patient-
derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We previously studied 2 isogenic pairs of WISP3-deficient
and WISP3-sufficient human PSCs, and observed WISP3 deficiency altered several biologically plausible
pathways involved in chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage homeostasis. We now want to determine if
these differences can be strengthened and refined by including 3 new PPAC patient-derived iPSC lines
and their isogenic controls. Pathways suggested by iPSC studies can be tested in KO sheep, and data
from KO sheep can be compared to that obtained from iPSCs. Successful completion of our sheep
experiments will provide insights into the genes and pathways that are altered by WISP3-deficiency in
vivo. Successful completion of our iPSC experiments will inform us about the utility of using patient iPSC-
derived articular-like cartilage tissue to model in vitro that which occurs in articular cartilage in vivo.
Together, these complementary approaches will provide important information about the function of WISP3
in cartilage. The KO sheep and the patient-derived iPSCs also can serve as preclinical models for testing
therapies to benefit patients with PPAC and, perhaps, be used to identify new approaches for protecting
cartilage from common degenerative joint disorders."
11178856,"ABSTRACT
Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive
research and medical efforts, we lack both the means to identify it early and the therapeutic options to prevent it
when identified. The vaginal microbiome is believed to have a causal role in a substantial fraction of sPTBs, and
multiple studies have shown that even when measured early in pregnancy, the microbiome is associated with
adverse pregnancy outcomes. Despite this great promise, robust microbiome-based predictors for sPTB have
not been developed yet, and we lack a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying its involvement in
sPTB. We attribute this to a small sample size in current studies; the aggregative definition of sPTB as a binary
variable, ignoring its heterogeneous presentations and etiologies; and a focus on microbial taxonomy instead of
data that is more functionally and mechanistically oriented. We propose to capitalize on one of the largest and
best-phenotyped pregnancy cohorts collected to date, the nuMoM2b study. This was a national, multi-center trial
that collected vaginal swabs at three time-points from women with diverse geographic and demographic
backgrounds. This study profiled nearly 500 women with sPTB, almost an order of magnitude more than any
previous microbiome study. We have compiled an interdisciplinary team with intimate knowledge of the
nuMoM2b study, ample experience in compiling, profiling, and analyzing large-scale microbiome and
metabolomic cohorts, and a track record of innovation in microbiome analysis and its clinical applications. We
will perform deep metagenomic sequencing, longitudinal sample sequencing, and matched metabolomic
analysis of a total of almost 6,000 samples from nearly 1,500 pregnant women, generating the largest such
dataset to date. This dataset would advance the microbiome community, drive discovery in the field, and enable
us and other researchers to study host-microbiome interactions, in general and specifically in the context of
sPTB, with an unprecedented depth. Our proposed data analysis offers a nuanced and high-resolution view of
both clinical and biological data. We will study sPTB while accounting for its various clinical presentations,
etiologies, and important maternal covariates. We will study the vaginal ecosystem from multiple angles,
investigating microbial genomic adaptations, levels of metabolites in the ecosystem, and dynamic changes to
the microbiome profile. We will devise an aggregative computational framework, based on state-of-the-art
methods and algorithms, that provides early prediction of sPTB based on microbiome-related features. We will
employ a combination of parametric and non-parametric methods to obtain mechanistic insights into host-
microbiome interactions that potentially contribute to sPTB and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Altogether,
this study will be transformative to our understanding of the vaginal microbiome in adverse pregnancy outcomes
and of host-microbiome interactions in general."
11178892,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In sub-Saharan Africa, heart failure (HF), a clinical syndrome that causes multiple debilitating symptoms and
results in poor health-related quality of life, has a 34% 1-year mortality rate, the highest of any region globally.
Major care gaps and sociodemographic disparities exist throughout the continuum of HF care. Self-care is an
evidence-based intervention that can improve clinical and patient-reported outcomes in HF and is widely
endorsed by international bodies. Self-care holds particular promise in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC)
because it shifts fundamental care tasks from providers and facilities to patients while empowering patients to
better care for themselves. However, self-care is underutilized in LMIC where providers lack knowledge, tools,
and time to support patients in self-care and where inequities in self-care implementation among patients and
providers are not well known. The overarching goal of our work is to improve HF care in LMIC. In this Type 2
hybrid study, we will implement a digital-first strategy (Medly Uganda) to improve self-care in HF at 6 Ugandan
Regional Referral Hospital outpatient departments and evaluate both implementation and clinical outcomes. All
study aims are guided by the RE-AIM framework and PRISM extension, involve mixed methods, and are
designed to prioritize health equity. First, we will assess the implementation and clinical effectiveness of Medly
Uganda to improve HF self-care in Uganda (Aim 1). To do this, we will conduct a stepped-wedge, cluster
randomized trial that includes a control period followed by a basic evidence-based package to support HF care,
followed by Medly Uganda. The co-primary outcomes will be the Self-Care of HF Index (implementation) and the
composite of mortality and HF hospitalization (clinical effectiveness). In parallel to this, we will conduct a mixed
methods process evaluation to inform iterative adjustments to the implementation processes (Sub-Aim 1.1) using
a community-engaged approach to systematically collect qualitative and quantitative process data at pre-
determined time points based on the Learn-As-You-Go design and make contextually appropriate
implementation adaptations. Next, we will evaluate the implementation fidelity and context of Medly Uganda with
a focus on reach, adoption, and maintenance (Aim 2) using a deviance approach based on Medly Uganda meta
data from patients and providers, focusing on how social determinants might shape equity in implementation.
We will also explore patient and provider impacts beyond HF, such as mental health and healthcare autonomy.
Then, we will explore cost, cost effectiveness, and sustainability factors for Medly Uganda (Aim 3), including an
examination of cost, cost-effectiveness, and equity of Medly Uganda from a financial and societal perspective
(Sub-Aim 3.1) and an exploration of patient and provider perspectives on the sustainability of Medly Uganda
(Sub-Aim 3.2). This study will generate important insights to support implementation of innovative, locally
relevant strategies to improve HF care in LMIC and aligns with NHLBI's Center for Translation Research and
Implementation Science priorities."

11122378,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer characterized by the absence of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), and HER2 receptors. Patients with TNBC have a significantly lower 5-year survival rate compared to other breast cancer types. Molecular studies have identified numerous genes overexpressed in TNBC, which could serve as potential targets for preventive vaccines.
Most existing vaccines target advanced disease stages, where immune suppression hinders efficacy. Preliminary data show that peptide vaccines targeting overexpressed self-antigens in TNBC can elicit strong immune responses. A multivalent vaccine, incorporating epitopes from multiple overexpressed proteins has shown greater efficacy in animal models than single-antigen vaccines.
This project will develop a multi-antigen vaccine targeting TOP2A, cyclin E2, and KIF15, all overexpressed in TNBC. The new vaccine will be tested in vivo in syngeneic transplantable and in orthotopic TNBC mouse models."
11141967,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Cancer continues to be the top cause of death for American Indians (AIs) in North Carolina. With higher rates
of colorectal cancer (CRC) late stage diagnosis and mortality and the highest smoking rate among all
race/ethnic groups in the state, there remains a critical need to reduce the use of tobacco among AIs while also
improving early detection of lung and CRC cancers in order to improve disparities and outcomes. The Atrium
Health Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center’s (AHWFBCCC) Community Outreach and
Engagement (COE) efforts are focused on addressing the disproportionate burden of cancer in the catchment
area. NC has the largest AI population east of the Mississippi River, making addressing the cancer-related
health needs of AI communities critical to this mission. Our recent integration with Atrium Health presents a
unique opportunity to leverage complementary strengths across both cancer campuses to expand our reach by
building on existing foundational collaborations and activities. Together, we propose to apply an innovative,
multi-channel outreach and educational campaign to increase cancer awareness, preventive behaviors, and
lifesaving screenings, to help address cultural and demographic issues contributing to disparities in health
literacy and cancer in AIs. To accomplish this, we have two Specific Aims that are an extension of our Year 1
MICEO project: 1) To build on the culturally sensitive communication campaign initiated in Year 1, we will
develop a comprehensive dissemination plan, including community and paid social media campaigns, and
expand our reach to all tribes in NC; and 2) Using the Audience-Channel-Message-Evaluation (ACME)
framework for health communications campaigns as a guide, we will enhance plans in Year 1 to conduct a
more comprehensive evaluation across campaign development, implementation and outcome measurement..
We will continue partnering with our tribal communities in an iterative process to create, implement, and
evaluate culturally tailored educational cancer communication messaging to increase cancer awareness,
preventive behaviors, and lifesaving screenings. Leveraging established infrastructure and foundational
collaborations will facilitate development of a community outreach and education intervention that is
sustainable and can disseminate best practice for future adaptation and implementation."
11142036,"Abstract
The proposed work will extend efforts originally funded in 2023 through the P30 Administrative Supplement for
Multi-Channel Communication Campaigns for Improvements in Cancer Education and Outcomes (MICEO) in
Underserved Populations. We will continue our work through the Karmanos Cancer Institute Office of Cancer
Health Equity and Community Engagement (KCI OCHECE) and Karmanos Academy, a major initiative to
build community capacity for improving cancer prevention and control throughout the KCI catchment area.
Over the past year, Karmanos Academy has coordinated Real Talk: Breast Cancer, led by lay health advisors
(LHAs) to increase breast cancer screening awareness and mammography adherence. Each LHA is required
to reach at least 12 individuals and this approach has been successful. To date, 25 Black/African American
LHAs have completed training and four Real Talk sessions have been conducted, reaching 64 people. At
present, LHAs have scheduled 11 more sessions through October 2024 that will reach over 100 individuals. As
part of the proposed work in the new funding cycle, we will train an additional 6 Black LHAs. Further, we will
adapt the Real Talk intervention for Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) women, a population strongly
represented in the KCI catchment area, and train 2 MENA LHAs. We will also continue creation,
dissemination, and tracking of related social media post/shareables related to the Real Talk intervention and
breast cancer screening. Our 2024 specific aims are similar to our 2023 aims, with revisions in italics: Aim 1:
Adapt an existing LHA-led psychoeducational program to increase mammography adherence among Black
and Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) women in the metropolitan Detroit area in collaboration with
community stakeholders; Aim 2: Collaborate with existing KCI OCHECE community partners to enlist and
train community members as LHAs who will deliver the adapted psychoeducational program; Aim 3: Partner
with KCI’s Marketing and Business Development Department and other community-based partners to develop
and implement a social media toolkit to promote mammography adherence among Black women in the
metropolitan Detroit area. Ultimately, the proposed work will increase breast cancer knowledge and screening
among Black and MENA women in metro Detroit through strategic use of multiple communication channels."
10848553,"In the two cycles of T32 support we have had to date, for our Comprehensive Musculoskeletal Training Program,
(CMTP) we have successfully trained 15 predoc, 14 postdoc, and 19 summer medical students, for careers in
musculoskeletal science. Most of those trainees have gone on to secure their own independent or semiindependent
funding, and all have remained in the MSK field in one form or another (faculty, government labs,
pharma/industry, or other MSK training opportunities for those who are still junior). We propose in this renewal application
to maintain the number of predoctoral trainee positions and short-term medical student positions at four
each, but reduce our postdoctoral slots from 4 to 3, to reflect the nationwide postdoctoral fellow shortage affecting
most programs. We will continue our highly successful strategy to dedicate of one postdoctoral slot to a one-year
research rotation for a resident in orthopaedic surgery, to bolster the orthopaedic physician-scientist footprint in
MSK research. Since the last submission, we have devised several new developments that strengthen the training
program, making it more multi-disciplinary, and providing greater opportunities for cross talk between basic, translational,
and dinical training and research. These include a ""flipped"" seminar series (trainee driven); a formal, nationally
administered mentor training program (to improve mentoring quality); two trainee exchange/internship programs;
trainee involvement in the incoming BioEngineering Institute, (launches in late 2024); a ""hands-on"" grant
review training program for postdocs; a wide selection of newly developed and approved MSK-focused courses as
part of the new Musculoskeletal PhD program; access to a newly hired, MSK-dedicated informatics/big data integration
faculty member; intensified DEi recruitment efforts/strategies; and many new skeletal muscle (and bone)
biologists/trainers on faculty. Continued assets for MSK training at IU include the Indiana Center for Musculoskeletal
Health (ICMH) (with a full-time Director), the creation of the ICMH MSK Clinical Research Core through an NIH
P30 grant award, and the nation's only Musculoskeletal Biology PhD program. The goals of the CMTP are to (1)
expand and integrate current musculoskeletal research and teaching programs in the basic, clinical, and engineering
sciences; (2) train young scientists at both the predoctoral and postdoctoral levels for research careers as
basic scientists, bioengineers, clinical and translational investigators pursuing the causes of, and solutions to,
musculoskeletal disease; and (3) train both predoctoral and postdoctoral students/fellows, according to the 6 Core
Competencies ouUined by the National Postdoctoral Association. Key activities will include the development of a
discipline-specific knowledge base, research skill development, and enhancement of communication skills, professionalism,
leadership and management skills, and training in the Responsible Conduct of Research. The program
includes 30 training faculty at multiple career stages, with a wide variety of scientific expertise. The training program
description includes a list of activities for the trainees, requirements for the mentors, didactic and career development
programs, as well as assessment programs for the trainees, mentors, and the overall training program."
11161842,"SUMMARY
The introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus of the Guangdong H5N1 lineage has resulted
in severe disease outbreaks with widespread mortality in wild birds and poultry in the United States. Current
control measures, including massive culling of infected flocks, vaccination efforts, and biosecurity procedures
have failed to stop the spread of avian viruses including HPAI viruses resulting in significant economic losses
and public health risks due to their zoonotic potential. There is a pressing need to explore alternative strategies
to combat viral pathogens that inflict massive losses on the poultry industry.
To tackle the susceptibility of chickens to avian viruses, we propose establishing the BRAVE (Building
Resistance Against Viral Entities) Innovation Center. This initiative aims to generate chickens with intentional
genome alterations that are resistant to viral pathogens of significant biological and economic importance.
To identify the host factors that will be targeted for intentional genome alterations in chickens, we will perform a
genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 study with a sgRNA library in Aim 1. These experiments will focus on identifying
pro-viral chicken genes that are essential for virus replication. We will begin with HPAI H5N1 virus, and then
expand the study to HPAI H7N9 virus and other avian viruses including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Aim 1
will also identify host factor targets for intentional genome alterations to identify unique and common antiviral
proteins that directly inhibit the replication of the viruses in this proposal. We will identify and rank the best host
factors when knocked out (pro-viral factors) or overexpressed (antiviral factors) for the greatest inhibitory effect
on virus replication. We will monitor cell viability and the lack of escape viruses that would mutate away from the
resistance profile.
Using the data collected in Aim 1, in Aim 2, we will generate an intentional genomically altered (IGA) chicken
line resistant to HPAI virus infection and second line that has a multi-virus resistance phenotype. We will employ
CRISPR/Cas9 or transposase methods to modify the genomes in chicken primordial germ cells (PGCs) and then
inject the modified PGCs into recipient chicken embryos to establish germline-modified chickens and eventually
flocks of birds for infection studies in Aim 3. Once an IGA chicken line is established, we will compare the
susceptibility of the altered birds with that of wild-type birds to HPAI H5N1 and H7N9 virus infections. Virus

infections will be assessed and compared to wild-type birds. We will also evaluate the susceptibility of the multi-
virus-resistant chicken line to H5N1 and H7N9 viruses, along with other avian viruses including IBV. Non-infected
IGA chicken lines will be characterized to ensure proper growth, longevity, and fertility along with any pathological
changes compared to their wild-type counterparts."
11139809,"Project Summary/Abstract
In 2020, with over 250 million debilitating cases and over half a million deaths, mostly in young children,
malaria is a persistent global health crisis. The malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Pf)
has developed resistance to most antimalarial drug deployed, including the backbone artemisinins
(ARTs). ART and its semi-synthetic analogs are considered essential for malaria treatment. ARTs are
prodrugs that are activated within the parasites to form a reactive radical that covalently attacks
proteins, lipids and other cellular constituents. ART resistance is widespread in Southeast Asia and has
been reported in Africa. ART combination therapy (ACT) is a mainstay for treatment of malaria, but its
efficacy can be derailed when a two-drug combination becomes de facto monotherapy. Moreover,
extended exposure of Pf to ACTs induces multidrug tolerance. We recently showed that inhibitors
specific for the Pf proteasome (Pf20S) kill Pf in each stage of its life cycle and synergize with ART,
overcoming ART resistance. This proposal builds on our discovery that a covalent hybrid of an ART
analogue and a Pf20S inhibitor that we call an artezomib (ATZ) can enhance ART action and overcome
resistance to each of its components. We have synthesized ATZs that are more potent Pf20S inhibitors
than their component Pf20S inhibitor. They not only kill wild type and ART-resistant (K13 mutant) Pf, Pf
with proteasome mutations that confer resistance to the Pf20S inhibitor, but also kill Pf that expresses
both ART-resistant and PI-resistant mutations. We propose the following mechanism by which ATZs
overcome resistance to the Pf20S inhibitor within them: We found that upon activation of ATZ in the
parasites, the ART component binds Pf proteins, like activated ART itself. The Pf ubiquitin proteasome
system digests ATZ-bound proteins into oligopeptides, some of which display the Pf inhibitor
component of the ATZ. We hypothesize that extended contact of ATZ-bearing peptides within the
Pf20S active site augments the binding of the Pf20S inhibitor component of the ATZ, overcoming the
decreased binding otherwise conferred by Pf20S point mutations. Thus, an ATZ can overcome
resistance to each of its components. In mouse models of malaria, an ATZ drove P. berghei below the
limit of detection and suppressed recrudescence of a P. berghei ART-resistant K13 mutant and doing
so better than ART. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we will conduct lead optimization to improve ATZs'
potency, selectivity and ATZs' pharmacokinetic properties. In Aim 2, we will explore ATZs' mechanism
of action; attempt to select for ATZ-resistant parasites; determine the frequency and mechanism of
resistance, if any; and study antimalarial activity of ATZs in stages of the Pf life cycle when ART alone
is ineffective. Aim 3 will test the efficacy of ATZs in mice, including humanized mice infected with Pf.

ABSTRACT
The central theme of our lab revolves around small molecules. We contribute to developing new methods and
strategies to access small molecules of biological and medicinal relevance and using them as tools to probe
biological questions or human diseases. This proposal outlines our ongoing efforts and future directions of two
seemingly disparate programs that we envision merging into a ligand-discovery platform using 19F NMR. One of
our research program's focus areas is on fluorinated alkenes with a fascinating chemical reactivity portfolio
primarily due to the polarity inversion feature. We are investigating the polarity inversion property of fluorinated
alkenes, which we recognize will solve the long-standing problem of regioselectivity in fluorinated heterocyclic
compounds. Our work demonstrated the applicability of FAs in generating regioselective access to nitrogen-
containing fluorinated heterocycles. The other research area is focused on seeking new chemical tools and
innovative strategies to address the evolution of antibiotic-resistance strains that have impeded antibiotic
treatment and rendered them ineffective, costing heavily on the healthcare industry. We are currently probing
the MraY enzyme, a key component of cell wall synthesis, using conventional structure-based rational design
strategy and unconventional discovery platforms of targeted protein degradation and 19F NMR-based ligand
screening. An R35 MIRA award would help accomplish our goals and enable the merger of our two research
themes. Successful completion of these studies will allow us to contribute broadly in gaining insights into the
function, structure, and mechanism of inhibition of antibacterial targets using fluorinated probes, small-molecule
degraders, and a 19F NMR-based screening platform. These studies will lead to antibacterials with new chemical
entities with novel mechanism of action that are urgently needed to replenish our arsenal of new and existing
antibiotics. An R35 MIRA award would also foster our existing and new collaborations within the university,
across the United States, and internationally. This research program will help the participating graduate, and
undergraduate students and postdoctoral scholars enhance and learn new skills in interdisciplinary sciences
while working in a highly collaborative and multidisciplinary environment."
11178914,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
This application is a competitive renewal of the University of Michigan's Program for Scientist Training in
Rheumatology Research (T32AR007080). Our Program, funded by NIAMS since 1975, is designed to
prepare four outstanding postdoctoral scientists per year, both MD and PhD, for investigative careers in
research related to the rheumatic diseases. Our Program is motivated by several key factors including (i) the
tremendous clinical need caused by the unrelenting burden of rheumatic diseases; (ii) an appreciation that
rheumatic diseases are propelled by complex processes in need of multidisciplinary approaches; and (iii) a
threatened pipeline of diverse investigators committed to careers that will be devoted to rheumatology
research. Fortunately, recent advances in biomedical and clinical sciences have created unprecedented
research opportunities to understand disease etiologies more deeply—and ultimately improve outcomes
through an approach personalized to the care of each individual living with a rheumatic disease. Our 22
Program faculty mentors are dedicated researcher-mentors who together bring broad interdisciplinary
expertise focused on rheumatic diseases. These investigators have established extensive collaborations with
research units nationally and internationally to effectively study rheumatic disease mechanisms and improve
management. Leveraging these historical strengths, our Program's themes have been updated to align with
NIAMS strategic mission “to transcend disease- and tissue-specific boundaries via cross-cutting scientific
themes.” For the upcoming cycle of our Program, major scientific themes will include (i) Biologic Underpinnings
of Clinical Heterogeneity; (ii) Immunological Mechanisms of Disease; (iii) Injury, Repair, and Fibrosis; and (iv)
Patient Outcomes/Experience and Innovative Trials. Trainees are also provided strong roots in the ethical
conduction of research, and in embracing a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Some additional
highlights of the Training Program include: (i) the availability of an award-winning 10-week research training
course offered to physician trainees with a strong interest in basic research; (ii) multiple paths for trainees to
earn a master's degree concurrent with their Program training, and (iii) outstanding state-of-the-art biomedical
cores that provide training, consultations, and scientific services commensurate with U-M's standing as the top
public research institution in the United States. It has been a longstanding mission of our Program to train
individuals from diverse backgrounds for careers in research. Of the 26 trainees since 2009, 17 (65%) are
women and eight (31%) come from underrepresented backgrounds (1 Black, 5 Hispanic or Latinx, and
2 from disadvantaged backgrounds); half of the current trainees identify as underrepresented minorities. Of
the 20 trainees (9 MD and 11 PhD) who have completed their participation in our Program since 2011, all 20
remain involved in research. Fourteen of the 20 (70%) are working in research-intensive careers, and ten have
successfully competed for grant funding (~70 grants have been awarded to the group as PI)."
11162108,"Development and validation of pain models in food animals
 Project Summary
Each year, more than 65 million piglets, 1 million goats and 15 million calves in the U.S. undergo painful
procedures such as tail docking, disbudding, and castration. Livestock also commonly develop painful
conditions such as lameness during the production cycle. Misalignment between industry guidelines and
on-farm analgesic use threatens consumer confidence in livestock production practices. One factor
contributing to the low adoption rate of pain mitigation protocols on farms is the lack of FDA-approved
analgesic drugs.
Our long-term goal is to improve on-farm animal welfare by controlling pain in a manner that is safe for
the animal and the consumer, and compliant with U.S. regulations. The specific objective of this proposal
is to develop models which reliably and consistently evaluate the efficacy of analgesics in food animals in
support of neww drug approvals. A central hypothesis of this proposal is that there are interactions
between measuring current standard behavioral outcomes and measuring analytical biomarkers which
affect how we perceive pain in animals, and therefore how efficacy of an analgesic is evaluated in the
approval process. We also hypothesize that more advanced analysis of analgesic pharmacokinetics and
pharmacodynamics in food animals will improve modeling of optimal regimens.
Painful processes addressed through the 5 specific aims of this proposal include footrot and castration in
goats, dehorning and castration in calves, and castration and tail docking in piglets. In goats and calves,
first we seek to establish the optimal pain biomarkers (behavioral and analytic) and evaluate the effect of
collecting concurrent behavioral and analytic biomarkers on the values determined for each. Secondly,
the efficacy of two doses of transdermal flunixin meglumine are evaluated for controlling pain associated
with the indicated pain process, and then the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics in relation to pain
biomarkers are characterized. In swine, the first phase seeks to create a pharmacokinetic/
pharmacodynamic model to describe the analgesic efficacy of flunixin meglumine in castration and tail
docking of swine. The second swine phase validates predictions made by this model.
This novel proposal will advance our understanding of measuring pain and create a more standardized
process to support investigation and approval of existing and candidate analgesic drugs for food animal
species. The novel pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic components of this project advance our
understanding of modeling analgesic drug efficacy and support optimal regimen development prior to
clinical studies."

Advances in the care of premature infants has resulted in younger and more premature infants surviving to
hospital discharge. Critical gaps in research regarding feeding in premature infants require multidisciplinary
involvement to better understand feeding problems alongside the long-term outcomes and healthcare needs of
these infants. NICHD established the Neonatal Research Network (NRN) to investigate persistent unanswered
questions regarding the safety and efficacy of treatment and management strategies for newborn infants. RTI,
as the NRN Data Coordinating Center (DCC) since 1988, is uniquely positioned to provide support to the
Feeding in Premature Infants Working Group. RTI will pull from a highly experienced bench of DCC
coordinators who are up-to-date on the latest advances in neonatal research. Dr. Abhik Das, NRN DCC PI for
the past 17 years, has extensive experience in neonatal clinical studies. He will be assisted by Task Lead, Dr.
Jamie Newman, who has served as the DCC NRN Follow-up Study Coordinator for the past 19 years. As Task
Lead, Dr. Jamie Newman will be supported by a mid-level DCC coordinator to accomplish the following

10890223,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
Bipolar Disorder (BD) is often misdiagnosed as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and poorly-treated. As 
risk for mental health problems increases in young adulthood, identifying objective neural marker predictors 
of future BD vs. MDD in young adults will provide neural markers for early risk identification and neural 
targets for new interventions to delay or prevent these debilitating disorders. The goal in the initial MERIT 
Award period was to adopt a transdiagnostic and dimensional approach to identify neural marker correlates 
and predictors of worsening manic/hypomanic vs. depressive symptoms in young adults, ultimately to 
distinguish BD from MDD risk. We showed that: elevated reward expectancy-related left ventrolateral 
prefrontal cortical (vlPFC) and prediction error-related left ventral striatal activity, lower PE-related right 
amygdala activity, and lower bilateral cingulum bundle fractional anisotropy (FA), a measure of white matter 
fiber collinearity, predicted current and/or future mania/hypomania; greater largescale (central executive 
[CEN], salience and default mode) network functional connectivity (FC) and greater CEN dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortical (dlPFC) activity during emotional regulation predicted current and future depression; 
while lower right uncinate fasciculus FA and greater left vlPFC and lower left inferior temporal cortical 
thickness were associated with greater mania/hypomania and depression. In the proposed MERIT 
extension, to yield robust neural markers of BD vs. MDD risk, we aim to examine: 1. an independent young 
adult sample (n=150 non mood disordered 18-30 year-olds) to test findings; 2. higher temporal resolution 
neural, and dopamine transmission, measures using fMRI-based source-localized electroencephalography 
(EEG) beta power/FC and midbrain neuromelanin contrast to noise ratio; 3. longitudinal neuroimaging to 
identify neural change predictors of worsening mania/hypomania and depression, and ultimately BD and 
MDD; 4. relationships among neural measures, response tendencies and symptom trajectories 
predisposing to BD and MDD, to better understand risk pathways for these disorders; and 5. young adults 
with 1st and/ or 2nd degree relatives with BD and MDD/ MDD, given their higher BD and MDD risk."

11139860,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 40% of lung allograft recipients succumb within five years of being transplanted, making it clear that there is an
urgent unmet need to address the inadequacies of chronic immunosuppression (IS) in these patients. Achieving a
robust state of tolerance in lung recipients would reduce or eliminate the major lung-specific and drug-related factors
that contribute to this dismal statistic. Tolerance of kidney allografts has been achieved in nonhuman primates (NHPs)
and humans by using a combination of nonmyeloablative conditioning and donor bone marrow transplantation that
results in transient mixed hematopoietic chimerism. However, identical protocols have failed to induce tolerance in
recipients of lung allografts. Despite the resistance of lung allografts to tolerance induction, we have now shown for
the first time, that achieving a state of durable (for the life of the organ) mixed chimerism in NHP recipients results in
long-term, IS-free survival of lung allografts. This remarkable result was achieved by modifying the mixed chimerism
conditioning to augment host regulatory mechanisms. While a significant advance, this modified mixed chimerism
protocol was only successful in recipients of MHC haplo-matched lung allografts and was associated with significant
toxicity in the form of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and
radiation-induced myelosuppression. Our goal now is to render this breakthrough clinically applicable by generating a
safer and more effective protocol that is capable of inducing long-term tolerance of unrelated, fully MHC mismatched
lung allografts using FDA-approved or soon-to-be-approved drugs. This Program’s unifying hypothesis is that inducing
durable chimerism and long-term tolerance in recipients of stringent lung allografts will require next-generation mixed
chimerism protocols that augment systemic and intra-graft adaptive and innate regulatory mechanisms. In Project 1,
we will test this hypothesis using intra-organ delivery of αIL-6R-specific and mTORi-specific nanotherapies to reduce
IS-related complications, block trained immunity, and promote intra-graft regulation. Bcl-2 inhibition will be used to
promote durable mixed chimerism while diminishing the toxicities related to total body irradiation (TBI)-driven
myelosuppression. These studies will be complemented by Project 2, which will test our unifying hypothesis using
novel strategies for antibody-based conditioning, regulatory T cells (Treg)-supportive immunomodulation, and gene-
modified Tregs, all poised for immediate clinical translation. State-of-the-art mechanistic assays coordinated by Core
A (The Molecular Immunology Core, ‘MIC’) will enable rapid cross-fertilization of insights gained in each project. We
anticipate that together, these highly interactive projects will generate one or more safe and effective durable mixed
chimerism tolerance protocols ready for clinical trials by the end of the funding period. If successful, these studies
could impact the entire field of transplantation and provide insights that could also be field-changing for bone marrow
transplantation and autoimmune disease."
11178124,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to generate a novel technological pipeline to phenotype senescent cell identity (defined
by biomarkers, function-related transcriptional profiles, morphology, and microenvironment) and composition
(defined by quantity, diversity, and distribution) across any mouse or human tissue. Use of diverse profiling
methods has revealed that senescent cells are highly heterogeneous and adversely influence tissue health and
function. However, due to biological heterogeneity and reliance on diverse methods, we do not comprehensively
understand the identities of senescent cells and extent to which they contribute to age-related decline. This limits
the ability to devise effective therapeutics that could have important societal benefit. To fill these significant
knowledge gaps, we require new technologies that accurately characterize heterogenous senescent cell states
in aged tissues. We will pioneer iterative and integrated use of imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and transcriptomic
digital spatial profiling (DSP) to molecularly phenotype senescent cells in aged tissues. Our preliminary data
generated from high-dimensional spatially-resolved and suspension-based mapping technologies demonstrate
that microglia, neurons, and additional cell types display distinct senescent profiles in the aged mouse brain.
Unique properties of the brain include substantial cell and regional heterogeneity, limited regenerative capacity,
age-vulnerability, and pleiotropic presentation of senescence-related biomarkers, all within well-defined micro-
environments. These features support an initial experimental focus on the brain for feasible and comprehensive
resolution of the anticipated panoply of senescent identities and contexts. Thus, we will develop this novel tech-
nology to map senescent cells, first, in the hippocampus and cortex of aged mice (UG3 phase) and subsequently,
across brain regions in female and male mice throughout the lifespan (UH3 phase). Critically, our innovative
technological pipeline, by design, will be broadly applicable to any tissues through customization of cell-identity
and senescence biomarkers. We will leverage experience studying cell senescence and the SASP in diverse
tissues to collaboratively adapt and scale IMC and DSP to generate mouse and human senescent cell atlases.
High-dimensional multimarker imaging and spatial transcriptomics are anticipated to revolutionize the ability to
rigorously and comprehensively characterize and map senescent cells in distinct tissue contexts. Ultimately, use
of this novel technology may fundamentally advance understanding of how cell senescence contributes to age-
related tissue dysfunction and may reveal new strategies to disrupt senescence-mediated pathology."

11139943,"Project Summary. Vulnerable (Medicaid enrolled, low-income, minoritized, urban/rural resident) children are at
high risk for severe early childhood caries (S-ECC). Treating young children for S-ECC often requires dental
surgery under general anesthesia (DGA). Unfortunately, surgery is not an effective cure. A DGA event does not
address underlying oral health behaviors such as tooth brushing and diet, so caries commonly recurs. Changing
oral health behaviors is challenging, as parents struggle with concurrent life stressors. However, parents want
to change their child’s oral health behaviors and identify that they need help to enact change at the time of a
DGA event. We propose a behavioral parenting intervention to support oral health behavior change within
families whose children experience the most severe disease burden at a critical point in their child’s oral health.
We will develop and test the efficacy of PROTECT (Preventing Recurrent Operations Targeting Early
Childhood Caries Treatment), a community health worker (CHW)-delivered, behavioral parenting intervention
for preschool-aged children scheduled for DGA. The primary outcomes are frequency of tooth brushing and
percent of total calorie intake from added sugar. The first session will occur in person at the time of surgery (60
minutes) and the remaining 10 sessions (30 minutes) will be delivered by phone to address barriers to
engagement. The intervention will take place over a 6-month period, starting with the surgical event, with
assessments measuring primary and secondary outcomes at baseline, 2 weeks, 6 months and 12-month follow
up. Our investigators are experts in clinical (anesthesiology, dentistry, pediatrics, psychology, nutrition) and
scientific realms (randomized controlled trials, management and analysis of longitudinal behavioral,
psychosocial, and clinical outcomes, nutrition science, development of clinical interventions, dissemination and
implementation). During the UG3 phase, we aim to develop PROTECT and test for feasibility and acceptability.
The development of PROTECT will be informed by behavior change mechanisms of Social Cognitive Theory
(SCT; e.g., positive parenting, self-efficacy, knowledge) and evidence-based behavioral parenting and dietary
interventions, along with stakeholder (caregivers, providers, CHWs) input. We will identify barriers to recruitment,
retention, intervention delivery, and outcome measurements. During the UH3 phase, we will test the efficacy of
PROTECT compared to Usual Care (UC) to improve oral health behaviors. Participants will be randomized to
receive PROTECT (n = 210) or UC (n = 210). We hypothesize that participants in the PROTECT group will
increase tooth brushing and decrease added sugar intake to a greater degree than those in the UC group.
Secondary outcomes and hypothesized SCT mechanisms of intervention effectiveness will also be tested. As
an exploratory aim, saliva samples will be collected to assess changes to the oral microbiome from baseline to
6 months. This work fits within our broad research goal to improve children’s oral health, starting with the surgical
population and potentially extending to children and adults within households."

 The overall goal of this 7-year UG3/UH3 collaborative project is to develop an interventional
training for oral healthcare professionals based on behavioral skills determined to positively
impact adult-child interactions in pediatric dental care. The goal of this line of research is
to measure the mechanisms involved in the effectiveness of this training on dental
provider utilization of these skills, and how skill utilization affects satisfaction,
adherence, and behaviors of very young children (under the age of 6) and their
parents/caregivers. Two years of funding will be required to align community partners,
develop a training protocol, test procedures, and prepare staff. The following five years will be
needed to recruit, deliver, and measure outcomes of this unique training.
 This project will align community- and university-based dental providers (dentists,
hygienists, assistants) with a research team to develop and test the effects of a training
workshop on outcomes related to provider implementation (acceptability, understanding,
feasibility, system climate, and system support), training (provider knowledge, fidelity, skill use,
acceptability, satisfaction), and caregiver-child experiences within a dental appointment (child
cooperation, distress, and pain, as well as family acceptability and satisfaction). With an
innovative training based on a well-established behavior management program for preschoolers,
Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), findings from this project will reveal if oral health
care providers’ responsivity to children’s developmental needs can be changed and effectively
impact the experience of dental care in very young children.
 The valuable connections with community partners in the states of West Virginia, Arkansas,
and North Carolina allow this study to be both feasible and representative of a large variety of
dental settings. The project is designed to train dental providers on a few key skills that could
greatly impact child comfort in the dental office and create a foundation for future curriculum
development for all dental staff. The long-term goal is to disseminate an effective training
package for students of dentistry and current dental providers on a large scale that helps dental
providers reduce child distress. Specifically, the ultimate intent is to disseminate this
concise, effective skills training framework to enhance the use of positive and
developmentally-sensitive strategies within the oral health treatment of the
youngest patients."
11180738,"Project Summary
People with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who represent over 15% of the population of the United States,
suffer a disproportionately high burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for reasons that are poorly
understood. Inflammation represents the major pathophysiologic process common to both atherosclerosis and
CKD. Recently, a novel pathway of inflammation was uncovered linking both CVD and CKD to bone marrow
myeloid cells which produce a circulating signaling molecule: soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor
(suPAR). SuPAR is released by immature myeloid cells in response to environmental exposures and CVD risk
factors. In circulation, suPAR alters glomerular and tubular function, with chronic exposure leading to
progressive kidney dysfunction. Pharmacologic inhibition of suPAR in experimental models prevented kidney
injury. SuPAR levels also predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes independently of kidney function, and
outperform well-established markers of CVD risk, such as coronary calcium, C-reactive protein, high sensitivity
troponin I and B-type natriuretic peptide. These compelling data reveal the potential for suPAR not only as an
excellent biomarker of risk, but also as a promising therapeutic target. The role of suPAR in CVD is however
poorly understood. The overall goal of this proposal is to elucidate suPAR’s potential causal role in the
progression of atherosclerosis and its link to decline in kidney function through epidemiologic insights. We will
achieve this goal by leveraging three of the most significant contributions to cardiovascular science: the
landmark Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA); an NIH-funded prospective cohort in which enrollees
underwent serial measurements of subclinical markers of atherosclerosis, the JUPITER trial, in which
participants with high C-reactive protein levels were randomized to statin or placebo, and the UK Biobank, a
data repository of over 500,000 volunteers. SuPAR levels will be measured in 5,620 participants of MESA to
determine whether levels correlate with early markers of CVD and predicts their progression independently of a
decline in kidney function. To assess potential causality, a gene-wide association study of suPAR levels in
MESA, followed by a Mendelian randomization analysis in the UK Biobank dataset will connect genetic
determinants of suPAR levels to CVD and CKD. Lastly, to establish whether suPAR is a modifiable risk factor
for CVD, levels will be measured serially in participants of the JUPITER trial randomized to rosuvastatin
(n=200) or placebo (n=200), and the change in suPAR will be compared between groups. Whether the benefits
of statins are dependent on suPAR levels will be assessed in the MESA cohort by comparing the survival of
participants started on statins across suPAR quartiles, and determining whether suPAR is a modifier of the
association between statins and outcomes. The proposed research has the potential to address the unmet
need of close to 50 million people with CKD in the United States alone, identifying sorely needed therapeutic
targets and management strategies in a field that has long been stagnant."

Neutrophils are white blood cells involved in the innate immune response. They are the
most abundant white blood cell in circulation and are involved in fighting infections as well
as initiating inflammatory immune responses and contribute to certain autoimmune
diseases. Therefore, regulation of neutrophil activity is crucial in maintaining homeostasis
in the immune system. Yet the specific mechanisms or which molecules are involved in
regulating neutrophil functions are still not fully understood. Previous studies in our lab
discovered microRNA-31 (miR-31) neutrophil motility in zebrafish. In this study we
propose to validate the function of miR-31 in human and uncover the underlying molecular
mechanism. We propose to discover key target genes of miR-31 that are important in
regulating neutrophil migration. Through a small-scale genetic screen using the
neutrophil-specific CRISPR/Cas9-based gene inactivation technique, I identified a
specific target gene of miR-31, efnb2b, involved in regulating neutrophil motility. Efnb2b
is a ligand for Eph receptors important for heart morphogenesis and angiogenesis via
regulation of cell adhesion and cell migration but not characterized in the immune system.
We propose to understand the signaling pathway regulated by efnb2 in neutrophils.
Completion of the proposed study will advance our understanding of neutrophils and
innate immunity, leading to possible therapeutic developments for neutrophil-related
diseases."
11183570,"FACULTY DEVELOPMENT CORE – Project Summary
The goal of the Faculty Development Core (FDC) of SDSU FUERTE or Faculty Unified towards Excellence in
Research and Transformational Engagement is to employ a comprehensive Faculty Development Model with
centralized and coordinated resources to support a newly hired FUERTE Faculty Cohort to establish their
research independence and thrive and advance at SDSU. The Faculty Cohort will benefit from multi-perspective,
team-based mentoring (Senior Faculty Mentor, Sponsor and Peer Mentor). Faculty Cohort members will
specialize in Latinx health disparities in the areas of Addiction Science, Environmental Health, and
Obesity/Physical Activity/Nutrition research. SDSU offers many important faculty development resources to
improve faculty research productivity and the climate of DEI excellence. However, these resources are delivered
by siloed units across the university, and SDSU does not currently have a comprehensive and centralized faculty
research training and Faculty Development Plan (FDP). To close this gap, the SDSU FUERTE FDC will develop
new activities as well as unify existing campus faculty development activities and resources in such a way as to
provide faculty with a structured approach to faculty development that will help them maximize efficiencies and
advance at an accelerated pace towards their research independence and professional advancement. The
SDSU FUERTE Faculty Development Model (FDM) will serve as the roadmap to guide all activities under the
FDP. The FDM integrates evidence-based and best practices for the comprehensive and unified promotion of
research and academic advancement, mentorship, wellbeing, and retention of diverse faculty. Through a
dedicated team of mentors who will support the Faculty Cohort starting from their transition and entry to SDSU
until they reach research independence and promotion to tenure status SDSU FUERTE will build in research
trajectory planning and an individual development plan developed by the Faculty Cohort with input from their
Mentoring Team that will guide them to reach milestones that should ensure their ability to be successfully
promoted and obtain tenure. The Faculty Cohort will have protected time coupled with research and faculty
development training in FUERTE’s structured Core Curriculum that will enhance and accelerate their
achievement of research independence and ability to become thriving faculty at SDSU. The SDSU FUERTE
FDP has strategically built-in efforts that will support the Faculty Cohort in fostering meaningful relationships with
peers and the campus community, specifically through the Core I seminars that include a new ‘Peers and
Pláticas’ (pláticas means ‘chats’ in Spanish) monthly peer gathering after the Core I “Community through
Diversity” session for the Faculty Cohort to meet and network with other peer faculty. SDSU FUERTE uses
evidence-based retention strategies including a mentoring team; providing requisite research and faculty
advancement knowledge, skills and supports; and building community to reduce isolation through peer
networking and team-building events to promote high satisfaction with academic life and retention at SDSU."
11179744,"PROJECT SUMMARY
People with schizophrenia have a broad range of cognitive impairments, which are major determinants of the
poor functional outcome observed in people with this disorder. Unfortunately, pharmacological and non-
pharmacological interventions have limited benefits for these impairments. In the absence of effective
treatments, cognitive impairments remain a critical unmet therapeutic need, and the development of novel
approaches for their treatment remains a central therapeutic challenge. Over the past 10 years, considerable
evidence has emerged to suggest that the gut microbiota has significant effects on brain development and
behavior, in part, through the regulation of immune system function. The gut microbiota affects immune system
function through the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other mechanisms. There are three
major SCFAs: butyrate, propionate, and acetate, of which, butyrate appears to have the most pronounced
effects on the immune system. Prebiotics are dietary fibers that promote the growth or activity of gut
microorganisms, which leads to enhanced well-being of the host; they have been shown to increase the activity
of multiple different bacteria species, including butyrate-producing bacteria. In light of the emerging evidence
that suggests schizophrenia is characterized by multiple abnormalities of the immune system, which lead to a
pro-inflammatory state, the proposed R61 and R33 projects are designed to evaluate the hypothesis that
prebiotic administration will lead to increased production of butyrate, through increased activity of butyrate-
producing bacteria in the gut microbiota; the increase in serum butyrate levels will be associated with changes
in cognitive function, symptoms, and metabolic measures. In the R61 project, we will conduct a 10-day,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine if the prebiotic: Prebiotin
(12g/day), an oligofructose-enriched inulin (FOS), alters the hypothesized biological signature, i.e., increases
serum butyrate levels. We will use an inulin-challenge paradigm to asses the effect of FOS on serum butyrate
levels. In the R33 project, we will conduct a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, RCT, to confirm the
ability of the prebiotic: FOS (12g/day), to alter the hypothesized biological signature: serum butyrate levels. We
will also examine the extent to which changes in serum butyrate levels are associated with changes in
cognitive function, symptoms, and metabolic measures. We will use the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive
Battery to assess change in cognitive function. The study will provide critical preliminary data on the clinical
utility of prebiotic treatment for the improvement of cognitive function in people with schizophrenia."
11180542,"Project Summary/Abstract
Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus is an emerging pathogen in dairy cattle with zoonotic
potential. Recently, HPAI H5N1 spilled over into dairy cattle and studies demonstrated the tropism of the virus
for the mammary gland with the virus replicating in milk secreting cells in this tissue, leading to high levels of
virus shedding in milk of affected cows. This property has caused major public health and consumer concerns,
as milk and dairy products are consumed in large scale by the population in the US. While pasteurization is
designed to reduce potential bacterial and viral pathogens in commercial shelf milk and have been shown to be
effective by us and others to inactivate HPAI, raw milk which is handled in large quantities in farms represents a
major risk factor for HPAI spread and transmission. Indeed, recent investigations by Dr. Diel’s group and others
have shown that raw milk can serve as a route of transmission of the virus to cats. The practice of feeding
unpasteurized raw milk to calves and other animals in dairy farms poses a risk for spread and dissemination of
the virus. Given the high levels of HPAI virus present in milk from affected animals, disposal of raw non-saleable
milk from those animals is a major problem, as the contaminated milk may serve as source of infection to other
animals, birds and potentially humans. This needs to be urgently addressed to minimize environmental
impact of HPAI and to prevent its spread between dairy farms and from affected dairy farms to other
susceptible species. In the present project we will address this significant issue and will perform studies to
improve our understanding of the risks posed by raw milk and raw milk cheeses, and to identify potential
mitigation strategies to inactivate HPAI in raw milk and raw milk products. To accomplish this, we propose four
specific aims: 1) to define efficacy of raw milk cheese aging on inactivation of HPAI; 2) to characterize the thermal
inactivation kinetics of HPAI H5N1 in dairy products; 3) to identify effective mitigation strategies to treat raw waste
milk prior to disposal or feeding to animals; and 4) to enhance capabilities and capacity for HPAI H5N1 testing
in support of FDA’s research agenda. To achieve these goals and establish a long-term partnership with FDA we
brought together a transdisciplinary team of investigators with complementary expertise in virology (Drs. Diel
and Nooruzzaman), food safety, microbiology and dairy product processing (Drs. Martin and Alcaine), and on
farm clinical and management practices (Dr. Mann). Successful completion of the study will provide a
comprehensive understanding of the inactivation kinetics and efficiency of inactivation of HPAI in milk and several
other dairy products, including high risk products such as raw milk cheeses. Thus, the project is directly aligned
with the FDA goals and mission."
11182850,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This goal of this project is to create a unique and comprehensive research repository of aging trajectory da-
tasets, related resources, and analytic methods that can be used to answer new and important questions in
aging and related sciences. Specifically, by harmonizing and merging multiple data sets this project will gener-
ate the data infrastructure needed to understand change over time in care settings, geriatric syndromes, physi-
cal functioning, and shared risk factors at multiple levels (patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and
society) and across multiple domains (biological, behavioral, sociocultural, and physical/built environments)
including chronic conditions and history of acute illness such as COVID-19, exposure to air pollution, neighbor-
hood socioeconomic, and health care system factors (Aim 1). Analytic strategies will be developed for user-
defined cohorts and their propensity score-matched controls, e.g., older adults who were living with chronic
conditions including Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), diabetes, heart failure, end-stage re-
nal disease, metastatic cancer, and HIV. State-of-the-art analytic methods are used to identify patterns of ag-
ing trajectories (care setting, geriatric syndromes, physical functioning) experienced by older adults during the
final years of life and their association with shared risk factors and distal outcomes (Aim 2). From the assem-
bled trajectory file in Aim 1, cohorts are derived by aligning an originating index time such as age cutoff point
and time at diagnosis (e.g., ADRD, stroke, chronic kidney disease). Both a model-based approach and ma-
chine learning algorithms are then used to discover multilevel and potentially interactive predictors of trajecto-
ries (e.g., rapid functional decline in independent living beneficiaries) and specific outcomes (e.g., respiratory
ventilator usage among Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with COVID-19) (Aim 3). The unique resources are
then shared to disseminate resources including datasets, documentation, source code, and methodology (Aim
4). At the end of this project, the research infrastructure to investigate the relationship between shared risk
factors and aging trajectories will be ready to use and replicate, giving investigators unprecedented ability to
solve new challenges in aging science. This will allow researchers to understand the underlying processes and
systems associated with reversible periods of disability across care settings, and interventions that may be
used to support recovery of function and reduction of geriatric syndromes including cognitive decline, for the
purpose of reducing burdensome care transitions, and maintenance of functional independence. This project
will also create the resources and methods needed to evaluate the impact of innovations and interventions im-
plemented at the patient, provider, community, healthcare system, and society/policy levels to improve care
quality and outcomes for older adults."
11183153,"Environmental exposures profoundly shape lifespan health and disease trajectories. Preconception and pre-
perinatal exposure can permanently alter the developing brain and associated regulatory systems to increase
susceptibility to a host of diseases and developmental challenges. Protective and promotive environmental
factors can promote well-being, even amidst adversity. The ECHO Consortium of Cohort Study Sites, Cores,
and Centers is dedicated to mapping the impact of early exposures on child health and development. Good
science depends on good measurement. Our proposed ECHO Measurement Core will advise, orchestrate, and
frame the coordinated, sensitive measurement of exposures, developmental processes, and health outcomes
central to achieving ECHO's objective. We propose three aims. Aim 1 is to develop and refine measures for the
ECHO Cohort Protocol (ECP), including methods to implement the measures. We will lead efforts to optimize
the measurement of exposures and outcomes, mindful of best measurement practices as well as respondent
and staff burden. We will lead the timely development of a preconception section for the Protocol by drawing on
diverse expertise across the ECHO Network to ensure feasible, robust, and culturally sensitive assessment of
critical data elements in the preconception period that have direct import for the primary ECHO child health
outcomes (pre-, peri-, post-natal, airways, obesity, neurodevelopment, and positive health). We will leverage
novel psychometric and technological methods such as computer adaptive tests, wearable sensors, and other
innovations in remote assessment, to reduce barriers to study participation and enhance participant retention.
Aim 2 is to assist the ECHO Consortium in implementing and evaluating the ECP. We will further collaborate
with everyone in the Consortium to finalize the protocol and establish a standard implementation strategy that
can be implemented across the diverse Cohort Study Sites, including determining optimal study visit structure
and choreography, developing Manual(s) of Operating Procedures (MOPs), and creating, supporting, and, when
appropriate, leading training. Aim 3 is to lead strategic decision-making and operational strategies to incorporate
new and revised measures to advance ECHO Cohort science while minimizing participant and staff burden. We
propose to optimize measurement decisions by maintaining collaborative communication, rapidly deploying data
and biospecimen collection for time-sensitive needs, identifying and evaluating important measurement
developments, creating a technology pipeline for rapid adoption of innovative approaches to data collection, and
ensuring data collection strategies are validated for diverse populations. Our measurement science expertise
within and outside of ECHO, paired with our participant-centered approach, enables us to bridge reliable and
valid assessment with practical feasibility and ultimately allows us to bring ECHO scientists together toward our
shared goal of mapping the impact of early exposures on child health and development."
11180930,"Comprehensive Resources for HIV Microbicides and Biomedical Prevention: The development of highly effective HIV prevention strategies, including a preventive vaccine and other non-vaccine biomedical prevention (nBP) products, remains one of the highest priorities for the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). With current global HIV infection estimates exceeding 33 million people, the development of safe, effective, and acceptable nBP products to prevent the sexual transmission of HIV could play a major role in the worldwide reduction of the estimated 5000 new HIV infections per day. As promising nBP products emerge (e.g., microbicides, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) agents, and Multipurpose Prevention Technologies (MPT’s), there is a critical need to rapidly and efficiently move these candidates into clinical testing. The scope of work encompasses preclinical activities that range from initial product discovery to those required to support clinical trials and/or product licensure.

11187521,"The female reproductive system—comprised of the uterus, fallopian tubes and the ovaries—undergoes
some of the most dynamic changes in structure and function of any adult human organ system on a
monthly basis and throughout life. Tissue organization in the female reproductive system is paramount
as it is responsible for the coordinated cyclic changes necessary not only for reproduction but also for the
maintenance of multiple other organ systems. Here, we propose to couple our unique access to the
entire normal female reproductive system with our expertise in single cell biology to establish a multi-
scale molecular map of the female reproductive system. We will collect and manage subject/donor
samples to generate a multi-scale molecular map: We will leverage our subject/donor population to
comprehensively sample up to 22 tissue locations from the same subject (16 donors), as well as sample
a single tissue over a large number of donors to collect temporal information. In total, we propose to
collect ~700 tissue samples over 22 locations from four female reproductive organs using multiple assay
modalities. We will generate a spatially coordinated multi-scale molecular map: We will collect scRNAseq
(3 different schemes), multiplex FISH (clampFISH), in situ open chromatin, as well as simultaneous
RNA/open chromatin assays and protein assays in collaboration with other TMCs for a total of six
different assay methods. We will also develop a 3D digital model of the female reproductive system using
subject/donor imaging data, and develop associated spatial annotation tools to index our clinical sample
collection in SA1 with anatomical coordinates. All assay data will be registered to our 3D anatomical map
that will be integrated with the HIVE Common Coordinate Framework. All metadata from subject records,
clinical procedures, molecular procedures, and informatics pipelines will be collected, curated, and
deposited as structured data. We will use well-validated protocols (e.g., 10X Chromium platform) or
validate and optimize molecular assays before moving them to production pipelines. We will work with
other TMCs as well as other HuBMAP groups to develop community standards and validation methods
for the molecular assays. For systematic data collection and production pipeline work, we will construct a
streamlined process from Clinical Sampling, to 3D Model Indexing, to Molecular Assays, to Data Analysis
and Coordination. The completion of our data collection activities will create an unprecedented public
resource that will enhance our understanding of human reproductive biology and impact women’s health."
11181779,"NICHD supports a broad range of contraceptive research, including efforts to develop male contraceptives and Multipurpose Prevention Technologies (MPTs).  MPT products that prevent both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) would increase sexual and reproductive health options for both women and men.
MPTs are composed of a combination of drugs that can target prevention of pregnancy, STIs and/or HIV, delivered using either an on-demand and event-driven or long-acting drug delivery system (DDS) with rheological/biophysical properties and product user perceptions (look, feel, effectiveness, safety and duration of action) that support user uptake (first use, subsequent use and habitual use). By combining prevention products for pregnancy and HIV or STI, the MPT may have a greater uptake and adherence than individual products. Key to the concept of MPTs is creation of DDS to support convenience of use, that not only are safe and deliver the drugs consistently but have durations of action relevant to the user needs. MPTs (contraceptive and non-contraceptive) may encompass a wide range of delivery durations and use patterns from on demand, event-driven or sustained/extended-release durations (months to years).
The objective of this contract is to obtain preclinical and/or clinical (e.g., Phase 1) multipurpose prevent technologies (MPT, contraceptives with anti-infective properties: e.g., anti-HIV) related consulting services for a range of product development considerations. This includes developing contraceptives technologies with anti-infective properties against pathogens such as HIV, Bacterial Vaginosis, Chlamydia, etc. supported by NICHD’s Contraception Research Branch. These services shall provide expert consultation to NICHD staff on pre-clinical, Phase 1 clinical, ethical, policy, and regulatory issues related to NICHD’s extramural contraceptive research portfolio and other related product development related areas, as directed by NICHD staff."

The IMPAACT network and its leadership group oversee the creation of all their studies, protocols, and clinical trials. The IMPAACT Network is a cooperative group of institutions, investigators, and other collaborators mainly focused on evaluating potential therapies for HIV infection and its related symptoms and co-infections in infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant women. This includes clinical trials of HIV/AIDS interventions for the prevention of mother to child transmission. The IMPAACT Network goal is to conduct high quality clinical trials and/or protocols that will advance the prevention and treatment of HIV and its complications for infants, children, adolescents, and pregnant/ postpartum women globally. The IMPAACT research agenda in this task order includes four scientific specific aims, which reflect the key areas of work. Those areas are HIV Treatment, HIV Prevention, HIV Cure, and HIV Complications. 

The Contractor shall coordinate, maintain and manage NICHD participating sites for a P1115 - Very Early Intensive Treatment of HIV-Infected Infants to Achieve HIV Remission: A Phase I/II Proof of Concept Study. IMPAACT P1115 is a Phase I/II, multi-center, proof-of-concept study that will explore the effects of early intensive antiretroviral therapy on achieving HIV remission in neonates. The study will also assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of early intensive antiretroviral therapy in neonates.

Career Goal: My long-time career goal is to become an independent investigator studying the effects of health
care policies on access and use of maternal and infant health care services among low-income populations.
With additional skills in claims data, subject matter expertise, and causal inference methods, I plan to build a
career focused on generating evidence to improve maternal and child health outcomes and reduce disparities
in the United States. Career Development: I will pursue the following training aims during the mentored (K99)
phase of the award: (1) clinical maternal and infant health content expertise; (2) claims data analysis skills; (3)
advanced causal methods, and; (4) professional development. Research Project: Extending postpartum
Medicaid has the potential to address poor maternal health in the United States, with additional implications for
infant care use and health.1 Approximately 63% of maternal deaths in the U.S. occur postpartum, and more
than half are considered to be preventable.2 However, despite high postpartum healthcare needs, pregnancy-
related Medicaid ends after 60 days postpartum. Medicaid pays for almost half of all births in the US and
disproportionately covers births to the low-income population and people of color.3–5 There has recently been
increased interest in postpartum Medicaid, including an American Rescue Plan (ARP) option to extend
Medicaid one-year postpartum.6 Prior to this, the March 2020 Families First Coronavirus Response Act
(FFCRA) prevented Medicaid disenrollment during the pandemic, thereby extending postpartum Medicaid
eligibility, which can inform current postpartum Medicaid policies under consideration. Using the Rhode Island
All-Payer claims data, this proposal's Specific Aims are: K99/1) To evaluate the effects of the FFCRA on
coverage and maternal and infant care in the postpartum period, R00/2) To evaluate the heterogeneous effects
of the FFCRA on outcomes by race and ethnicity, R00/3) To evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected
the effects of extended postpartum Medicaid eligibility on care use. Mentorship: I have assembled a highly
accomplished team of experts at Brown University to provide mentorship and guidance as I transition to
research independence, comprised of Dr. Trivedi, Professor in the Department of Health Services, Policy and
Practice and Department of Medicine; Dr. Steenland, Research Assistant Professor of Population Studies in
the Population Studies and Training Center; Dr. Vivier, Professor of Health Services, Policy and Practice and

Services, Policy and Practice, and Professor of Medicine; Dr. Savitz, Professor of Epidemiology and Professor
of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Pediatrics; and Dr. Tuuli, Chace-Joukowsky Professor and Chair of
Obstetrics & Gynecology. Future Directions: The training and research in this proposal will provide me with a
unique set of expertise and skills to prepare me to reach research independence and submit an R01
application to examine the effects of state variation in postpartum Medicaid policies using claims data."
11185340,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neurocristopathies are a class of syndromes that are predominately characterized by malformations in the
craniofacial complex. These defects are caused by aberrant development of the neural crest, a stem cell
population unique to vertebrates. One distinctive feature of the neural crest is their ability to give rise to both
ectomesenchymal (bone/cartilage) and non-ectomesenchymal (melanocytes and peripheral neurons/glia)
derivatives. SoxE transcription factors play important roles in both the formation and the diversification of the
neural crest. All three SoxE factors (Sox8, Sox9, and Sox10) function redundantly to promote neural crest
formation. Interestingly, individual SoxE factors direct the differentiation of the neural crest into distinct lineages.
Sox9 promotes chondrogenesis while Sox10 supports both the melanocyte and peripheral neuron/glial fates. An
outstanding question is how these highly similar SoxE factors lead to neural crest specialization. This proposal
utilizes omics-based approaches, gain and loss of function experiments, and Sox9-Sox10 chimera constructs to
assess how and when SoxE-mediated neural crest specialization occurs. Furthermore, mutations in SOX9 and
SOX10 are causative for Campomelic dysplasia and Waardenburg syndrome, respectively. The syndromes
present with very different craniofacial phenotypes which are reflective of SOX9/SOX10 specific defects during
neural crest specialization. Work from this study will lead to the identification of novel SoxE transcriptional targets,
determine when SoxE factors begin to promote neural crest specialization, and determine how specific patient
variants for Campomelic dysplasia/Waardenburg syndrome cause disease phenotypes. Overall, this work is of
high clinical significance and will provide evolutionary insights into the molecular origins of neural crest
diversification. My primary goal for the mentored phase of this proposal is to identify when SoxE factors begin to
promote lineage specialization within the neural crest and determine the functional domains that contribute to
SoxE family subfunctionalization. I plan to use my remaining time as a postdoctoral fellow to master new
experimental techniques and develop robust computational analyses. I will capitalize on the rich academic
environment of Northwestern University, especially the expertise in NSF-Simons Center for Quantitative Biology.
My long-term career goal is to establish an independent research program that uses multiple model systems to
investigate the cellular and molecular origins of syndromes characterized by craniofacial phenotypes. I plan to
use Sox transcription factors (and associated syndromes) as a starting point in my career, but then extend my
research interests to other gene families through collaboration with clinicians. My measurable experience with
various model organisms will allow me to investigate biochemical, molecular, cellular, and morphological aspects
of developmental disorders by exploiting the benefits of each model system."
11185474,"The objective of this proposal, called Access for aLL in ALS (ALL-ALS), is to establish 1) a Clinical and Data Coordinating Center, 2) an Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Clinical Research Consortium of 30 US ALS centers serving diverse populations, and 3) a robust, prospective, longitudinal observational and biomarker study of 2000+ people living with ALS and 500 healthy participants who harbor gene mutations known to cause ALS and are at high risk of developing the disease (“asymptomatic ALS gene carriers”). The ALL-ALS Coordinating Center activities will be carried out by the Neurological Clinical Research Institute (NCRI) of Mass General Hospital, MA as the Coordinating Center, Barrow Neurological Institute (BNI), AZ as the Site Monitoring and Outcomes Training Center and will be working with the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS) for consortium building. To ensure success of this proposal, MGH NCRI and BNI will bring their two decades of collaborative experience functioning as coordination center and leading scores of high-quality, multi-site ALS observational studies, biobanking projects and clinical trials, in partnership with industry, academic investigators, and not-for-profit research groups. The NEALS Consortium is the largest and geographically widespread consortium of sites in the ALS field; the multiple PIs of this project include the two current NEALS co-chairs, 2 executive committee members, and one founding co-chair. We will involve NEALS primarily to engage both established sites and also newer ALS clinical sites to include a mix of academic centers, community hospitals, and private practices across the US who are committed to conducting high quality and operationally complex ALS trials. A strong focus on underserved areas will be considered for site selection and consortium building. In addition, we will build upon existing NEALS educational, training and knowledge sharing activities for all sites, site staff and other stakeholders in the community. A new ALL-ALS Scholars Program will offer training in community engagement science and clinical trials to early-stage investigators to expand the number of culturally competent clinical ALS researchers. A comprehensive, evidence-based community engaged research (CER) team will guide a scalable and culturally informed plan to ensure recruitment and ALS community engagement consortium-wide. Our CER strategies will focus on ensuring geographic, ethnocultural, and socioeconomic diversity, equity, inclusion and offering educational training opportunities to the ALS patient and clinic community. The ALL-ALS consortium will conduct the largest observational/biobanking ALS study ever undertaken. This study will include prospective collection of clinical, biofluid, digital and imaging biomarker data, collected longitudinally from symptomatic and asymptomatic ALS-gene carrier populations. The ALL-ALS study will contribute large and harmonized longitudinal ALS datasets collected from the study to central NIH ALS data repositories for further study by the ALS research community as a part of open science, which would be valuable to drive clinical and therapeutic innovations in ALS. An adjunct study within this larger effort will recruit and longitudinally evaluate a large cohort of asymptomatic ALS gene carriers. The ALL-ALS Consortium is designed to run studies independently, or in conjunction with other funded consortia."
11185475,"Abstract
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressive, ultimately fatal, neurodegenerative
disease with approximately 32,000 cases in the United States (US). With an estimated lifetime
risk of 1/400, an average of 5,000 new US cases are diagnosed every year. A public private
partnership (PPP) can be leveraged to rapidly advance regulatory science and scientific research
to support and accelerate the development of effective, new drugs to extend life for people living
with ALS. Given the numerous failures in translating laboratory results into clinically effective
therapies, the generation of high quality, diverse and longitudinal patient-derived biosamples and
resulting downstream data is critical for our success. To this aim, our proposed ALS Clinical
Research Coordinating Center (ALSynCC) builds and expands upon the ongoing success of our
Target ALS Natural History study and consortium and will include five sample/data repositories
linked to detailed clinical information: 1) a biofluid repository that contains cross-sectional and
longitudinal biofluid sample from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients where samples are
linked to detailed clinical information, whole genome sequencing, at-home measures of speech
and respiratory function, 2) a longitudinal study of asymptomatic mutation carriers called the
PREVENT study that will be expanded to include participants across the country, 3) an MRI-
based neuroimaging repository to be newly implemented, 4) at-home measures of speech and
respiratory function, and 5) a large, well-annotated post-mortem tissue biobank containing brain,
spinal cord and muscle tissue from patients. Each of these repositories is led by highly trained
physicians and scientists, experts in the field. This use of multi-modal and multi-compartment
sampling from each patient is a powerful method to characterize disease processes and will
improve translation of diagnostics, therapies, and outcome measures to the clinic. These highly
curated biosamples and data resources are de-identified, linked to detailed clinical information,
and will be made immediately available to the research community through the Consortium data
portal. Our Target ALS natural history program is a successful public-private partnership between
academic and industry leaders and closely mirrors the overall goals of the proposed ALS Clinical
Research Consortium and functions of the Coordinating Center (CC). A unique aspect of our
model is to collect data and samples from asymptomatic individuals at risk for ALS, as well as
from symptom onset to autopsy to provide a comprehensive sample and dataset for future
research studies. We will utilize our knowledge and tremendous success to expand on this
existing infrastructure to maximize ALS patient enrollment in a highly synchronized research
platform called ALSync that is administered by the ALSynCC. This nationwide ALSync network
will work closely with NIH and other partners to coordinate and bridge ALS research and clinical
care across the country to: a) ensure inclusion of male and female patients of all racial and ethnic
backgrounds, b) to improve access to clinical research and trials, c) to generate high quality
patient samples and data, and d) to efficiently share data and analysis tools to accelerate research
in the broader ALS community."
11179534,"Over the last six years our project teams have demonstrated that neurophysiology abnormalities
are conserved across mice and humans in fragile X syndrome (FXS). These findings across
species provide a great opportunity to advance mechanistic understanding of clinically relevant
illness features and develop translational biomarkers and aid treatment discovery. These
advances can bridge the significant chasm between preclinical and clinical success in new
treatment development. We take mechanistic approaches to determining the drivers of
neurophysiology dysregulation across three integrated projects spanning human, in vivo, and ex
vivo mouse study. This allows for levels of analysis from whole brain network modeling to
microcircuit and molecular analysis to aid target discovery while improving translational
medicine efforts in FXS. In doing this we place emphasis on recognizing heterogeneity within
FXS and using this understanding to model how to best interpret and link preclinical and clinical
study. Out of this appreciation of the challenges to translational efforts in our field, we have
developed a synchronized approach to the analysis and interpretation of neurophysiology data
ensuring comparable results across research platforms. The striking consistency of findings
across levels of investigation and species offers an unprecedented opportunity to investigate
mechanisms of brain dysfunction across mouse and human study thus significantly improving
opportunities for translational medicine development in FXS- a multidisciplinary mission that is
ideal for a Center environment. Project 1 (Erickson/Sweeney; Cincinnati) will conduct human
FXS neurophysiology, behavior, and pharmacological probe studies to pursue advanced
neurophysiology modeling of cortical hyperexcitability and abnormal response to stimuli while
also seeking to resolve heterogeneity across FXS in humans. Project 2 (Binder/Razak;

11183295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
High dietary sodium intake is linked to incident hypertension (HTN) and cardiovascular events. Conversely,
lower sodium intake has been shown to reduce both blood pressure (BP) and prevent atherosclerotic
cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). American Heart Association guidelines advocate daily sodium intake of less
than 2,300 mg, but the estimated average sodium intake for Americans is 3,400 mg per day. In recent years,
consumption of pre-processed and restaurant foods has substantially increased, and more than 75% of sodium
in the average U.S. diet now comes from these sources.
Despite widespread knowledge of the harms of high dietary sodium intake, an ongoing challenge for clinicians
is engaging patients in lifestyle-based treatments to reverse these trends as well as promote ongoing self-
management and long-term adherence to low sodium diets. Although there is growing hope that digital health
platforms may help to overcome these issues, few empirical studies have demonstrated their efficacy over
time. Relying on a strong conceptual framework in health behavior theory, we recently demonstrated in early
work that a mobile application-based just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) reduces dietary sodium intake
(R21HS024567). This JITAI uses geofencing technology to provide tailored and contextual push notifications at
home, grocery stores, and restaurants with links to sodium-based nutrition information within the mobile
application. While our preliminary results were exciting, the critical gaps in knowledge that remain to be tested
are 1) whether a mobile application-based JITAI focused on lowering sodium intake will lead to a decrease in
BP, 2) which dietary components mediate the intervention's effect on BP, and 3) how to optimize participant
engagement to sustain both dietary and BP effects over time and prevent habituation.
The long-term goal of our research program is to develop successful mobile application-based strategies,
driven by adaptive technologies, that support patient self-management in common cardiovascular conditions.
Our overall objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of a dietary sodium JITAI on reducing BP, establish the
changes in diet that mediate improvement in BP, and optimize the JITAI for long-term patient engagement. Our
central hypothesis is that JITAIs targeting dietary sodium will reduce BP over time and that these effects will be
better sustained through optimization of JITAIs. Accordingly, we will perform a two-step sequential,
prospective, randomized controlled trial in 400 HTN patients to meet our overall objectives. In the first step, we
will investigate the effect of the JITAI on BP and perform a micro-randomized trial to optimize the JITAI for
patient engagement. In the second step, we will study the sustained effects of an optimized JITAI on BP."

11185736,"ABSTRACT
Prenatal genetic screening tests and diagnostic tests (PS&D) contribute to optimal fetal/neonatal outcomes
through the delivery of high-quality prenatal care. While PS&Ds are an important part of prenatal care delivery,
advances in PS&D present a challenge to ensure pregnant patients have the information and resources to
make informed decisions about their use. This complexity is due, in part, to significant advances in prenatal
genomics that continue to introduce new PS&D, increasing the number of conditions that can be detected be-
fore birth. It is also due to parallel changes in maternal-fetal medicine, pediatrics, and reproductive policy that
rapidly change the options available if a fetal genetic condition is diagnosed. Consequently, patients face a
growing challenge in making informed decisions about a moving target of testing and post-diagnosis options.
As a result, a serious and urgent unmet clinical problem has emerged: There is a lack of evidence-based guid-
ance to support an individualized informed decision-making process for patients amidst an increasingly com-
plex set of reproductive healthcare choices. The objective of our study is to generate strategies and resources
that will facilitate informed decision-making about PS&Ds by diverse populations of pregnant patients. This pro-
ject is a first step to identifying what strategies may be needed to best prepare patients for this increasingly
complex decision-making landscape. In Aim 1, we will determine how the rapid changes in PS&Ds and post-
diagnosis options affect the nature and timing of resources and support patients need to make informed PS&D
decisions. We will interview patients to identify their PS&D decision-making needs and clinicians to seek their
input on implementing strategies that address those needs. In Aim 2, we will measure patients' preferences for
informational content and delivery when considering whether, when, and how to utilize PS&Ds during pregnan-
cy. We will use a Discrete Choice Experiment to investigate patients' priorities and tradeoffs as they face in-
creasingly complex considerations regarding PS&D use. In Aim 3, we will identify strategies needed to support
the implementation of strategies to support patients’ informed decision-making in response to a changing
PS&D and post-diagnosis landscape. We will engage with key community, provider, and policymaker stake-
holders to identify interventions to effectively support patients with those decisions. This study is significant for
patient care as it will be a critical step toward establishing patient-centered practices to support evidence-
based reproductive healthcare in an increasingly complex healthcare setting. By achieving the aims of this
study, the study will have a high impact as it will fill the critical need of providing resources to patients as they
consider a changing array of PS&D and post-diagnosis options that have significant implications for their
health, their pregnancy, and their family."

11182967,"This U01 project leverages our expertise in the epidemiology of colorectal cancer (CRC); disparities; obesity;
metabolic dysregulation, an important manifestation of inflammation; the microbiome; animal CRC models; and
lifestyle intervention trials to address the growing problem of Early-Onset CRC (EOCRC) (i.e., <50 years).
Adiposity and diet drive metabolic dysregulation. So, understanding the interaction between diet and adiposity
are key to understanding the genesis of EOCRC – and an array of other obesity-related cancers). This project
will address the absence of critical clinical trials and mechanistic studies involving lifestyle interventions for
EOCRC. We intend to address this gap; and have the transdisciplinary team representing complementary
backgrounds to do so. We focus on dietary modulation of gut microbes to reduce metaflammation and
subsequent metabolic dysfunction in obesity, with a goal of preventing EOCRC. We will perform 1) an anti-
inflammatory dietary intervention trial in dyads of adults and children at elevated risk for CRC. We also will
conduct a complementary mechanistic animal study that builds on and leverages our expertise in mechanistic
studies on obesity and CRC. This work is supported by infrastructure that we have built over the past decades
in two key centers at the University of South Carolina (UofSC): (1) Center for Colon Cancer Research (CCCR,
2002 - present – which specializes in mouse models of CRC); and (2) the Cancer Prevention and Control
Program (CPCP, 2000 - present – which specializes in the epidemiology of cancer and lifestyle intervention
trials for cancer, with a focus on cancer disparities. The two projects that comprise the proposed grant address
two Specific Aims that are represented by the human study and laboratory animal experiment: i.e. ,1: To
establish the metabolic protective effects of an anti-inflammatory diet in obese, high-risk African-
American (AA) and European-American (EA) adults and children in reducing inflammation as indicated by
Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), IGF-1, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha
(TNFα), Interleukin 6 (IL-6), and C-Reactive Protein (CRP), and a creating more favorable microbiome
signature; 2: To establish gut microbes as mediators between anti-inflammatory dietary input and
reversal of metabolic dysfunction and associated CRC risk. This complements the human study by
carrying out pre-clinical murine model studies with similar inputs (diet), intermediate endpoints (inflammation,
microbiome), and outcomes (CRC-related). We hypothesize that an anti-inflammatory dietary intervention will
reduce metabolic dysfunction and metainflammation through regulatory effects on gut microbiota.
Results from this work will address the role of metabolic dysregulation in relation to factors that are known to
be important in carcinogenesis, that therefore could have profound effects on EOCRC, have implications for
other obesity-related cancers, and have great promise for moving the field forward by addressing mechanisms
that drive large health-related disparities that consistently disfavor African Americans."
11187801,"Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a major complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a leading cause of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). DKD is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia, hypertension, and systemic inflammation that impose deleterious effects on podocytes and proximal tubular cells (PTCs), which contributes to the onset and progression of DKD. Emerging evidence implicates the non-canonical NF-kB signaling pathway, induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) and its receptor fibroblast growth 
factor-inducible 14 (Fn14), in promoting these pathological features of DKD. However, despite advancements improving the outlook for DKD management, there remain essential gaps in understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive the pathophysiology of chronic low-grade inflammation and its contribution to progressive declining kidney function. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that hyperglycemia triggers impaired autophagy that exacerbates chronic inflammation in DKD through TWEAK-Fn14 signaling, which has distinct features in podocytes, PTCs, and kidney fibroblasts. This proposal seeks to 1) Define crosstalk signaling mechanisms in renal cells between autophagy and NF-kB under high glucose conditions, 2) Determine the impact of Fn14 ablation in attenuating kidney inflammation during DKD progression in mice, and 3) Determine the effectiveness of non-canonical 
NF-kB inhibitors in preventing inflammation and fibrosis in high glucose conditions. Successful completion of this study will elucidate the crosstalk mechanisms by which the autophagy and TWEAK/Fn14 signaling axis modulate chronic inflammation in DKD, identify potential therapeutic candidates, and address significant gaps in our understanding of persistent low-grade inflammation and declining kidney function in DKD."

The scope of work encompasses preclinical activities that range from initial product discovery to those required to support clinical trials and/or product licensure."
11181773,"The Division of Population Health Research (DiPHR) at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development conducts studies focusing on child health and human development. As part of DiPHR's mission, one area of interest is the investigation of the developmental origins of health disparities - i.e., differences in developmental outcomes between socially advantaged and disadvantaged groups. Here, we refer to unequal health outcomes between socioeconomic and race/ethnic groups, although disparities may also exist in the context of other socially disadvantaged statuses including intellectual disability and sexual minority status.
Health disparities in the United States - in life expectancy and chronic disease - have their origins as early as the prenatal period. Early life conditions including poverty and discrimination generate disparities in health over the life course that become further entrenched in the population through their transmission across generations. Parental mental health problems, which are strongly linked with social and economic disadvantage as well as child development, may play a key mediating role in the transmission of disparities across generations. However, maternal and paternal psychopathology have not been fully considered as mechanisms contributing to disparities nor have been measured using phenotypically validated approaches (e.g. through structured diagnostic interviews).
As a result, though disparities in health are well documented, the developmental mechanisms that impact disparities at the very beginning of life are not, particularly those which lead to developmental deficits that emerge long before disease states. The NICHD 2020 strategic plan highlights health disparities as a cross-cutting problem impacting the advancement of maternal health, birth outcomes, and child development; it emphasizes that “understanding the contribution of social, economic, structural, and regional factors is vital to advancing preventive, diagnostic, and intervention efforts” designed to mitigate health disparities. Advancing knowledge of the developmental mechanisms that generate disparities requires a more thorough understanding of how socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity influence the determinants of prenatal health and child development from gestation onward.
The Rhode Island Children’s Health Equity & Development Study (ENRICHED) includes a comprehensive set of social exposures potentially related to disparities, focuses on parental psychopathology as a main factor, and addresses limitations of previous studies that neither fully considered paternal or maternal psychopathology nor measured psychopathology using phenotypically validated approaches .  The purpose of this Task Order is to complete follow-up assessments on participants from Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the study. For Phase 1, this will include conducting 12-months home visits, maintaining retentions rates as listed below. For Phase 2, it will include prenatal and postnatal assessments of participants, their co-parents and infants, as well as the collection of biospecimens."

11178906,"Abstract
Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a highly heritable and complex neurodevelopmental disorder. Remarkable advances
have been made recently in SCZ genetic studies with an increasing number of risk loci reaching genome-wide
significance; however, gleaning biological insight from these loci has been challenging. The majority of SCZ risk
loci are located in non-coding regions. As such, it is hypothesized that they function by regulating distal gene
expression via 3D chromatin interactions. However, it has yet to be determined which loci are operational in
which cells, at what time points, and with what impact. Recent genomic analyses showed enriched SCZ
heritability in human fetal brains rather than adult brains, suggesting the role of SCZ risk loci in modulating fetal
development for increased SCZ risks. Thus, unraveling SCZ risk loci function during development will be critical
for understanding genetic influences on SCZ risks. Genetic influences on gene expression (e.g. expression
quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)) are cell-type-specific, and sometimes confer opposing effects depending on the
cell type, underscoring the importance of cell-type-specific studies using homogeneous cell populations for a
clear mechanistic understanding. Parvalbumin (PV)- or somatostatin (SST)-expressing medial ganglionic
eminence (MGE)-derived cortical interneurons (cINs) are consistently affected in SCZ brains. More importantly,
SCZ heritability is shown to be enriched in MGE cells in human fetal brains, necessitating the study of these
cells to understand the mechanisms of SCZ risk loci. Although there are no postmortem fetal SCZ tissues for
mechanistic study, in vitro differentiation of iPSC—which well recapitulates early embryonic development—
provides developmental SCZ brain cells with the same genetic makeup as patient brains. We established
methods for the efficient generation of homogeneous populations of MGE-derived cINs from healthy control
(HC) and SCZ iPSCs. We also extensively validated their functionality and authenticity both in vitro and in vivo,
including robust migration and synaptic integration into host brains that results in efficient inhibitory regulation of
host circuitry in transplanted mice. Using an unprecedentedly large number of iPSCs to provide homogeneous
populations of HC vs SCZ fetal cINs for mechanistic studies, we will address our hypothesis that SCZ risk loci
active in developmental MGE-type cINs regulate distal gene expression via 3D chromatin interactions.
Employing transcriptome analysis, PrediXcan analysis, and Micro-C analysis, we will map SCZ risk loci with
unknown functions to the risk genes they regulate in these vulnerable cell populations during development.
Developmental cIN-specific genetic influences on gene expression, identified based on multiple lines of
corroborating evidence, will be functionally validated using CRISPRi/CRISPRa approaches. This unbiased
genome-wide comprehensive data set from developmental MGE-type cINs with functional validation will provide
a road map for unravelling the genetic basis of developmental SCZ risks and help us identify mechanism-based
novel therapeutic targets."
11185622,"The hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid is a promising therapeutic target that could contribute to the elimination of viral hepatitis as a major public health threat. The capsid is an icosahedral shell that assembles from 120 copies of homodimeric core protein (Cp). Small molecules currently being explored for capsid disruption – called capsid assembly modulators (CAMs) – bind a hydrophobic pocket between two Cp dimers to interfere with core particle formation. However, despite the viability of anti-capsid therapeutics, no CAMs have yet been approved as drugs. This project will advance the search for HBV inhibitors by leveraging full-scale computational virology of the HBV capsid. Vast ensembles of HBV capsid protein (Cp) conformations derived from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the intact capsid will be used as a basis for high-throughput virtual screening and fragment-based inhibitor design. The ensembles contain numerous conformational states of the HBV Cp inter- and intra-dimer interfaces that have never been accessed by experimental structure determination methods and have, therefore, never been considered by previous structure-guided drug development efforts against the capsid. The specific aims of the project are: 1) Identify novel small molecules that target the highly dynamic CAM binding site at the Cp inter-dimer interface to inhibit capsid assembly, and 2) Design peptides that target a newly discovered cryptic pocket at the Cp intra-dimer interface, which can potentially inhibit capsid assembly, nuclear export, and secretion. Aim 1 will be accomplished via comprehensive characterization of the CAM binding site, which exhibits significant conformational variability. Results will inform a synthon-based, shape-aware virtual screening approach to identify new small molecule binders. Aim 2 will be accomplished via design of macrocyclic peptides to target the open-spike conformation of Cp, previously discovered by MD simulations. Both aims will benefit from experimental validation of binding and inhibitory effects of small molecules and peptides by collaborators who specialize in biochemistry and structural biology of the virus. Ultimately, this project addresses critical gaps in HBV antiviral development by targeting the structural dynamics of the capsid. The use of MD-derived ensembles of the intact capsid meaningfully expands the potential for discovering new inhibitors, underscoring the importance of full-scale computational virology in the fight against viral disease."

11180583,"Abstract
Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The cornerstone for management of diarrhea is rehydration, though
antimicrobials are beneficial in some instances. Unfortunately, given that treatment is frequently empiric, based
mostly on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes, antimicrobials are overused in management of diarrheal
illness worldwide. Thus, there is a need for clinical decision support tools to inform clinical management and
promote antimicrobial stewardship. In particular, frontline healthcare providers in rural areas, such as village
doctors in Bangladesh, often have inadequate knowledge for the basis of antimicrobial use, and may benefit
greatly from guidance. We have recently developed a mobile phone based electronic clinical decision-support
tool (eCDST), and shown the impact of etiological prediction on physician antibiotic prescription practices for
pediatric diarrhea in two LMICs. In this proposal, our overarching goal is to customize our eCDST into a
comprehensive mHealth application (Accessible Diarrhea Etiology Prediction Tool, ADEPT) to support rural
health care providers in the management of pediatric diarrhea (R21 phase), and to measure its impact through
the performance of a pilot before-after feasibility study (R33 phase). Our work will contribute to an evidence
base for mHealth-enabled antimicrobial stewardship, with potential to extend beyond diarrheal illness, and into
other syndromes, including respiratory illness and febrile illness."

11178913,"Abstract
GABAergic cortical interneurons (cINs) play critical roles in balancing, synchronizing, and gating brain activity
by inhibiting other neurons. Their malfunction, especially those of medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived
cINs, has been associated with various neurodevelopmental brain disorders, such as schizophrenia (SCZ) and
autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Considering the fact that the divergence between human brains and rodent
brains has resulted in the failure of many central nervous system (CNS) therapeutics validated in rodent
models, it is critical to study human neurons to better understand the mechanisms of these cIN-associated
brain disorders. Human fetal brain tissues are not accessible for mechanistic studies, but we have developed a
method to efficiently generate homogeneous populations of MGE-type human cINs from pluripotent stem cells
(PSCs) of healthy or diseased subjects. We have extensively characterized them and demonstrated their
authenticity and functionality, making it possible to study the converging functional consequences of complex
genetics in real patient neurons, which cannot be studied in mouse neurons due to a lack of conservation of
non-coding regions, where most of risk loci are present. However, in vitro cultured neurons lack other critical
components of the brain environment, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and blood vessels,
which can significantly impact their function. There have been efforts to optimize in vitro culture systems to
better recapitulate in vivo physiological environments by adding other brain cellular components, but there are
still limitations as to how closely they can simulate in vivo situations. To resolve this issue, in our previous
study, we pioneered human neuron-mouse brain chimeras to study the function of human SCZ neurons in
physiological environments. Although we were able to successfully identify SCZ cIN-intrinsic connectivity
deficits in mouse brains, we were not able to analyze the impacts of grafted neurons on brain circuits and
behaviors due to the presence of healthy mouse neurons in the grafted mice. Thus, in this proposed study, we
will perform brain-region-specific cIN-ablation in NodScid gamma (NSG) mice, followed by the replacement of
ablated host cINs with human cINs to generate region-specific humanized cIN chimeras. Based on previous
studies, including ours, that show successful restoration of compromised mouse inhibition by grafted human
cINs, these mice will allow us to analyze the functional impacts of grafted human cINs on the brain circuits and
behaviors in physiological in vivo environments. This novel physiological model system will help us tease apart
cell-type- and brain-region-specific disease mechanisms for complex brain disorders, and aid in developing
novel therapeutics."

Washington (UW), Seattle Children's Hospital and Research Institute, and the non-profit Smile Train. Approach:
KNUST graduate trainees will obtain a Master or PhD degree in data science from KNUST that will be bolstered
by a 3 month externship in Seattle with a thesis on a real world Ghana child health problem. KNUST faculty
trainees will participate in faculty exchanges with UW faculty. Select KNUST faculty will complete a UW
Professional Certificate Program in a data science domain. All trainees will participate in a monthly Zoom seminar
to enhance interdisciplinary effectiveness. Impact: We will train 13 graduate trainees and 16 faculty for a robust
biomedical data science graduate program at KNUST. Trainees will compete successfully for research funding,
will contribute to the evidence base in child health, and will take up positions as leaders in data science and child
health at KNUST and other Ghanaian institutions."
11181860,"Proposal Abstract
The AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR) is a biorepository sponsored by the NCI, with
a unique focus on cancer within the context of HIV/AIDS. Recent estimates indicate that 40.4
million people are living with HIV (PWH) worldwide, with two-thirds in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA)
(25.6 million), 2.1 million in Latin America (LATAM), and more than 1.1 million in the U.S. Elevated
rates of cancer have been observed among PWH since the beginning of the HIV pandemic. The
ACSR's central office, based at the George Washington University (GW), oversees 4 US-based
Regional Biorepositories (RBR), a site in Sub-Saharan Africa (South Africa), and a site in Latin
America (Brazil). The primary objectives of the ACSR in the current funding period are: [Aim 1]
to obtain, preserve, organize, and fairly distribute well-documented human cancer and control
biospecimens obtained from PWH; [Aim 2] to support the AIDS Malignancy Consortium (AMC)
clinical trials by maintaining biorepository functions in compliance with CAP accreditation
practices; and [Aim 3] to restructure the ACSR in response to criticisms in the Summary
Statement from review group ZCA1 RPRB-L (M2), National Cancer Institute Special Emphasis
Panel, AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource-UM1. While the traditional aims of the ACSR (i.e.,
Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal) will remain the same, structural, governance, and administrative
changes will be undertaken during this one-year extension. The proposed changes are designed
to [1] Acknowledge the effort required to maintain essential ACSR functions, including managing
current collections, acquiring new/annotated specimens, promoting ACSR for research, and
overseeing the AMC Biorepository Program; [2] Create a leadership structure that aligns with the
core functions of the ACSR as a biobanking resource to reduce efforts outside that scope; [3]
Establish increased accountability and transparency by connecting each core function to
individual members of the revised MPI team; [4] Minimize the repetition of activities among the
RBRs; and [5] Create a set of centralized metrics to track ACSR achievements. Finally, a primary
criticism of the Review Section was the absence of an inventory for RBRs. In this extension year,
there will be a special focus on managing ACSR specimens and annotation data by a newly
established informatics/inventory team based at Moffitt Cancer Center."

1. Background and Purpose
The Women’s Health Research Initiative (WHRI) recognizes that women have historically been 
underrepresented in biomedical research, and as a result, there is a lack of understanding of sex 
and gender-related differences in risk factors and health outcomes. The Initiative rightly 
emphasizes a need for the application of novel analytical approaches to rich datasets to elucidate 
these differences, improve our understanding of Women’s Health issues, and inform more effective 
medical interventions.
Initiated in 2014, the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program is part of the 
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI’s) broader precision medicine initiative which 
aims to improve the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders 
through tailored and individualized disease treatments. The TOPMed program generates whole 
genome sequencing (WGS) and other –omics data and integrates them with molecular, behavioral, 
imaging, environmental, and clinical data to better understand the biological processes that 
underlie HLBS disorders. Petabytes of –omics, phenotypic and environmental exposure data 
generated by TOPMed from approximately 200,000 research subjects across 90+ studies are fed 
into NHLBI’s BioData Catalyst (BDC) ecosystem and the Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes 
(dbGaP) for use by scientific investigators.
Data collected as part of the TOPMed Program have significant potential to improve women’s 
health outcomes, however, due to the complexity and multi-factorial nature of the data, novel 
methods are needed to discover and measure –omics-level sex differences. Recent advances in 
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methods have shown significant promise to 
uncover previously unknown statistical associations across a range of therapeutic areas, 
particularly when combining different types of data, such as whole genome sequences, clinical 
measures, and medical imaging. By bringing together TOPMed data, experienced AI and ML 
researchers, and subject matter experts in Women’s Health, with the analytical infrastructure 
provided by the BDC, we will be able to address the long-standing sex-related disparities in 
biomedical research. 
The NHLBI is establishing the Artificial Intelligence – 
Coordinating Center (AI-CC) to serve as a central hub for 
coordinating research projects and bringing together AI 
and scientific experts to collaborate on innovative 
approaches to analyze and interpret TOPMed data. 
Additionally, the AI-CC may support other areas of 
NHLBI’s research interest such as the use of AI on 
imaging and –omics data in the areas of radiomics and 
radiogenomics to advance the understanding of chronic 
lung disease, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
Westat is well-positioned to implement and operate the 
AI-CC due to the significant efficiencies that will be 
gained from our role as the TOPMed Administrative 
Coordinating Center (ACC). Our experience and 
capabilities include: (1) a strong team of staff that 
routinely collaborates with NHLBI, TOPMed investigators, and the BDC team; (2) established and 
effective processes, procedures, and systems that can easily and quickly be adapted and applied to 
the AI-CC; (3) familiarity with TOPMed data and associated analyses; (4) substantial experience 
and established processes for managing sub-Other Transaction Authority (OTA) awards; and 
(5) experience in AI and ML methods. Where feasible, to maximize synergy and to gain most 
efficiencies, we have selected the staff that currently support TOPMed, augmented with other 
relevant experts. Our approach will not only leverage the efficiencies afforded by the TOPMed 
program, but also provide an efficient and scalable mechanism to support additional research 
areas, beginning with a focus on lung disease."

11179559,"In Louisiana, those living in parishes that lack access to maternal care, referred to as “maternity care deserts”
experience a 91% increase in risk of death during pregnancy and up to 1 year postpartum. Black women are
already at higher risk independent of their residential status, and counties with larger numbers of non-Hispanic
Black women have higher odds of losing all hospital obstetric services. As obstetric care in these largely rural
parishes is unlikely, there is a critical need to develop interventions that will improve maternal health care in
these areas. The overall objective of this application is to examine the potential of enhanced remote care to
improve maternal health. The overall hypothesis is that innovative models of care, based in community
priorities and context, can mitigate the lack of high-level services located in these areas. When patients live far
from care sites, remote care has obvious advantages, reducing the need for long trips, limiting unnecessary
care, and identifying problems earlier. Ochsner’s Connected MOM program (at-home blood pressure and
weight monitoring) has been successfully implemented in southern Louisiana and been associated with a
reduction in preterm birth. However, Black and rural women were less likely to benefit from the program that
white and urban women. The project will be conducted in two phases: In the formative phase (years 1-2), the
project goal is to establish community needs, relationships, and infrastructure to conduct a remote care
intervention (Connected MOM+) that reflects the community’s leadership and priorities. This will be
accomplished by presenting Connected MOM to community groups and determining the service needs,
technological challenges, and barriers to implementation of the intervention, via interviews and focus groups.
Implementation phase project infrastructure, including protocols, manuals of procedures, data collection tools,
provider training, digital infrastructure, and staffing, will then be created. In the implementation phase (years 3-
7), a hybrid effectiveness-implementation stepped-wedge study will be conducted, testing implementation,
process, and health outcomes of the enhanced remote care package across 27 parishes in northern Louisiana.
Access to care, health, and implementation outcomes (reach/adoption/fidelity) will be examined via the
electronic health record system, and patient satisfaction and implementation outcomes
(acceptability/appropriateness) assessed in a sample. This project will have an important positive impact by
improving the health of, and empowering, a high-risk, underserved population."

Among PLWH, the odds of acquiring HCV are six times higher than for their HIV-negative counterparts, and acquiring viral hepatitis increases mortality and morbidity, including for PLWH on antiretroviral therapy. Compared with individuals who are only living with HCV, persons living with HIV and HCV have accelerated rates of liver fibrosis and a more aggressive course of liver disease, they typically develop hepatocellular carcinoma at a younger age with more aggressive tumors, and they have higher rates of death.

11120817,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
Advances in biomedical sciences are often driven by new tools, ranging from novel experimental
techniques, to innovative models, and new software. V\Jhile bibliographic data such as citation counts track
the impact of research discoveries, these metrics fail to capture the full extent to which specific tools are
used in science and beyond. Indeed, the impact of these tools on both the scientific community and
society at large is largely invisible to traditional metrics, along with the contributions of the researchers
who develop them. We need, therefore, novel databases and metrics to trace the true impact of tools,
bringing them within the scope of Science of Science. Three fundamental challenges impede this goal: a
data gap, i.e., a lack of a ""ground truth"" dataset on tools and their usage, a metrics gap, i.e., the absence
of meaningful impact indicators, and a mechanistic gap, i.e., a lack of theoretical foundation to understand
their adoption.
Our proposal aims to tackle these challenges, by developing a data-driven approach to automatically
identify the tools used in biomedicine, that we collectively call Bio Tools, and developing indicators to trace
the multiple dimensions of impact they have, offering a rigorous empirical foundation for the quantitative
study of Bio Tools. We start with developing a ground-truth corpus by extracting laboratory techniques,
software applications, and modeling methods from existing ontologies, and identifying their mentions in
the full-text of millions of documents, from publications and grants, to patents and clinical trials (Aim 1).
The recovered information, along with metadata, will be assembled into the knowledge base BioToolKB,
which will allow us to develop a multidimensional impact measures, and quantify the extent to which
traditional metrics track or underestimate Bio Tool impact (Aim 2). Finally, we rely on these indicators and
BioToolKB to understand the diffusion mechanisms of Bio Tools across biomedical fields and sectors,
identifying the conditions in which some Bio Tools are widely adopted and others overlooked (Aim 3). The
success of this proposal is ensured by an interdisciplinary team blending domain expertise in biomedical
sciences and the Science of Science with technical expertise in bibliometrics and network science, and
industry collaborators, supporting the creation of a robust technical foundation."

11182199,"Urine cadmium and risk of fracture and bone loss
Abstract
Osteoporosis and related fractures are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally.
Mechanistic studies from bone organ and cell culture systems suggest cadmium (Cd) mobilizes bone minerals
from skeletal tissue. Cd is a heavy metal and natural element found in soil, with increasing concentrations linked
to phosphate fertilizers and sewage sludge found in croplands. As a result, human dietary exposures have
increased over time by 26% dating from 1990 through 2003. In addition, Cd has increased in human bones ten-
fold since pre-industrial times. Following intake, Cd is stored in the kidney, where it remains for decades (half-
life: 10-30 years). A small portion of Cd is slowly excreted in the urine, making urinary Cd (U-Cd) a well-
established biomarker of long-term exposure. Cross-sectional studies have linked Cd to low bone mineral
density, osteoporosis, and fracture, suggesting a potential population attributable fraction of 30% assuming there
is a causal relationship. However, currently lacking are large prospective studies.
We propose to leverage existing samples and data from the two largest prospective US osteoporosis cohort
studies to perform an in depth study of U-Cd, bone loss, and fractures that will include long-term follow-up of
up to 20 years using: 1) The Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) Study and 2) the Study of Osteoporotic
Fractures (SOF). Aim 1: Using efficient case-cohort study designs we will investigate the prospective
association between U-Cd and incident fractures in 1,321 MrOS men and 1,578 SOF women who will be sex
matched with 1500 randomly selected persons from each respective cohort. Cd, creatinine, osmolality, and
cotinine will be analyzed in urine. Aim 2: Evaluate the prospective association between U-Cd and rate of loss
of total hip bone mineral density (BMD) in men and women from the subcohorts, and in incident fracture cases.
Aim 3: Utilize markers of bone metabolism and structure to provide novel insights into the cellular and structural
mechanisms by which Cd may adversely affect bone. Evaluate the association between U-Cd and markers of
bone formation (PINP) and bone resorption (CTX) in men and women. In a substudy using data already available
in men, evaluate the association between U-Cd and bone structure (HR-pQCT). Also, in an exploratory subAim,
apply mediation analyses using a counterfactual framework based approach to estimate the extent to which Cd’s
influence on bone loss might be mediated via biomarkers of bone metabolism (serum PINP, CTX).
A large fraction of older US men and women have documented Cd exposure. Highly accurate measures of Cd
exposure linked to powerful epidemiological cohorts provide a unique, cost effective approach to this important
public health issue. These studies will transform the field of Cd-bone research and have high potential to impact
policy decisions in the US and globally."

11196343,"Project Summary/Abstract
 As many as 10 million adults in the United States have temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Females
experience TMDs at higher rates compared to males and African Americans have higher TMD incidence, yet
lower prevalence compared to white Americans. Despite these findings, etiological mechanisms contributing to
prevalence and incidence disparities by sex and race are largely unknown. Given our recent reports on sexual
dimorphisms in incremental tensile stiffness and fixed charge density of the human temporomandibular disc, it
is hypothesized that additional sexual dimorphisms may exist in properties of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
Similar differences are also hypothesized to exist between racial groups, although this possibility has not yet
been explored, which may limit research translational confidence across racial groups. The lateral capsule-
ligament (LCL) complex, which spans the temporal bone and mandibular condyle, could impact
temporomandibular disc derangement (TMDD) risk through a ‘loose ligament’ mechanism affecting joint
articulation postulated in prior literature. Furthermore, sex- and race-specific differences in potential risk and
resiliency factors may contribute to differential risk of TMDD development and observed TMD prevalence and
incidence disparities. Our long-term goal is to enable individualized TMDD risk assessment to increase
applicability of generated risk estimates. The objective of this study is to describe sex- and race-specific
mechano-chemical LCL complex properties to investigate potential contributions to TMD disparities
between sexes and racial groups. The central hypothesis is that TMJ properties observed in females and
African Americans will be associated with higher risk of TMDD development compared to those of males and
white Americans. The proposed studies will enable the determination of sex- and race-specific differences in
potential mechanical and chemical risk factors for TMD development (Aims 1 and 2). This determination will
contribute to a better understanding of TMJ properties across diverse populations and is crucial to enabling
understanding of TMD incidence and prevalence disparities. Finite element models will also be used to
investigate how differences between sexes and racial groups impact the temporomandibular loading
environment, which will be developed, refined, and interpreted during the independent phase (Aim 3). This
proposal aims to further development of scientific expertise and skill acquisition in temporomandibular and
craniofacial biomechanics, with a plan to transition from mentored post-doctoral fellowship to independent
faculty. NIH T32 training and professional development resources, joint resources and network of the Clemson-
MUSC Bioengineering program, and the Clemson University Pathways Mentoring Program provide an ideal
inter-disciplinary training environment to prepare for and transition to independence following the postdoctoral
fellowship period."
11192952,"While the contribution of exposure of future fathers (paternal) to environmental factors, such as smoking, to the
pathogenesis of several disease states has been documented, that of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems
(ENDS), including in the context of occlusive cardiovascular disease (CVD), has not yet been investigated.
Therefore, the present application proposes experiments that address fundamental, mechanistic, and clinically-
relevant translational aspects of the adverse-health effects of ENDS, namely e-waterpipes and e-cigarettes,
which are increasingly popular forms of tobacco, in the context of paternal exposure on thrombotic disease and
platelet biology. These studies will be performed in a sex-dependent fashion. Specifically, the ramifications of
ENDS paternal exposure on normal hemostasis and the development of thrombosis disease will be determined.
Subsequent studies will examine whether ENDS modulate platelet function and/or counts. Experiments are also
designed to determine the effects of ENDS on clotting/thrombosis markers and the coagulation system. We will
also investigate if their effects involve inflammation and non-platelet cells (e.g., endothelial cells and neurtophils).
In addition, and in terms of the mechanistic experiments, the role of the platelet transcriptome (e.g., miRnome)
of the offspring and the epigenetic marks (e.g., histone modification) of the father's sperm in mediating ENDS
paternal effects will be determined. Finally, the impact of paternal ENDS on the placenta and the sperm non-
coding RNA will also be investigated. Collectively, these experiments will make significant contributions to the
understanding of the consequences of paternal ENDS exposure- an increasingly popular and underappreciated
health threat- on cardiovascular health, as well as the mechanism by which it exerts these effects, in a sex-
specific manner."
11194080,"This study aims to investigate the association between plasma volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and 
oxidative balance scores (OBS) as potential biomarkers for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in patients 
with substance use disorder (SUD). Using data from the National Center for Health Statistics (2000-2024) 
involving 101,316 participants, we will calculate OBS and examine the correlations between OBS and 
plasma VOC levels in individuals with and without SUD, as well as in patients with and without CVD. Our 
hypothesis is that substance use increases VOC exposure, disrupts oxidative balance, and elevates CVD 
risk. Additionally, we will explore the clinical significance of VOCs in relation to oxidative damage 
biomarkers and their impact on CVD risk in SUD patients. Utilizing plasma samples from 800 patients at 
our Center for Cardiovascular Diseases and Sciences, we will identify SUD cases and controls, measure 
oxidative damage biomarkers (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and protein carbonyls), and 
quantify VOC levels and oxidative stress biomarkers in plasma. We hypothesize that SUD increases VOC 
levels, induces oxidative stress, and contributes to CVD risk. This research will create a comprehensive 
data repository and generate preliminary data to support an R01 grant proposal. By leveraging 
epidemiological data and clinical data, we aim to establish a centralized database for managing 
information on plasma VOC levels, oxidative balance scores, oxidative stress biomarkers, and CVD risk in 
SUD patients. The preliminary data will highlight a novel approach linking VOC exposure, oxidative stress, 
and CVD risk, emphasizing the public health implications and potential for identifying new biomarkers and 
therapeutic targets. This work aims to enhance our understanding of the interplay between environmental

11194142,"Discogenic back pain, is a leading cause of disability, and involves degenerative changes of the
intervertebral disc (IVD), including structural defects that result in biomechanical instability and
inflammation. Since only a small subset of patients responds favorably to conventional treatments
which address the symptoms but not the disease, there is a need for regenerative therapies to
treat disc degeneration (DD). Treatment of DD with mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation
can restore disc height and tissue architecture likely through paracrine signaling. The
degenerative IVD niche represents a harsh microenvironment for cell based repair, characterized
by changes in intradiscal dynamic hydrostatic pressure (HP), increased levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, and accumulation of macrophages. While no consensus exists on the factors that
enhance treatment efficacy, studies suggest that the pro-inflammatory IVD milieu inhibits ECM
production. Our goal is to identify strategies to reduce the pro-inflammatory and enhance the anti-
inflammatory responses of bone marrow derived MSCs in IVD repair. Our hypothesis is that anti-
inflammatory macrophages and physiological dynamic mechanical loading augment MSC
immunomodulation and enhance IVD repair quality. In Aim 1, we will assess the contributions of
macrophage subpopulations and hydrostatic pressure on anti-inflammatory cross talk in IVD-
MSC-macrophage cultures. In Aim 2, we will investigate applied loading modulation as a strategy
to enhance MSC immunomodulation in an IVD compressive loading organ culture model. In Aim
3, we will evaluate the therapeutic potential of anti-inflammatory cells in vivo. Successful
completion of this research will identify role of loading on immunomodulation by MSCs and
macrophages and establish the response of DD, a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, to cell
based repair that is optimized to enhance anti-inflammatory activity."

the innervation and molecular subtypes of human pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and identify
the functional subsets in human lung, beginning with an investigation of functionally distinct
neuroendocrine stem cells. Using precision cut lung slice cultures to establish an injury model
inducing proliferation, we will identify the location of proliferative PNECs and measure their
complete transcriptomic profiles by scRNA-seq. In parallel, we will use multiplex single molecule
in situ hybridization methods to localize the human PNEC neuropeptides, identify their
combinations in situ, and their cognate receptors in human lung. Collectively, these studies will
comprehensively characterize the cellular and molecular features of human PNECs, their stem
cells and niches. PNEC expansions and ectopic pulmonary neuroendocrine cells are the
distinguishing pathologic features underlying a common form of pediatric diffuse lung disease,
neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI), which is characterized by diffuse obstructive
ventilatory defect. In adults, a pre-neoplastic condition called diffuse idiopathic pulmonary
neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) is also associated with airway obstruction and
prominent respiratory symptoms thought to be due to bioactive peptides from neuroendocrine
cells. We will identify the neuropeptide and receptor expression in pathological cell niches
during NE stem cell transformation in DIPNECH. This work establishes a molecular foundation
for the diverse clinical presentations associated with pulmonary neuroendocrine lesions and
identifies panels of neuropeptides and hormones localized to precise anatomic locations that will
provide the basis for developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches."

 Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a group of epigenetic enzymes that are important in regulating gene
transcription and other cellular processes. HDAC1 is implicated in various developmental program, including
hematopoiesis. We and others have showed the GATA-1 can interact with HDAC1 containing NuRD
corepressor complex in FOG-1 dependent manner for GATA-1 mediated gene activation and repression. We
have also established that GATA-1 can interact with HDAC1 through a FOG-1 independent manner. This
interaction is essential for GATA-1 deacetylation and erythrocyte differentiation in vitro, and erythrocyte and
megakaryocyte differentiation in mice. The repression function through this interaction can be two folds, it may
through constitutive acetylation of GATA-1 and it may also through loss of HDAC1 interacting proteins. We
have performed proteomic analysis and found that GATA-1 interacts with BCL11A through HDAC1 dependent
manner. Therefore, we hypothesize that HDAC1 regulates GATA-1 activity through deacetylation and
interacting with key regulators that mediates erythroid differentiation and globin gene expression. In
this proposal, we will first investigate the role of GATA-1 acetylation in GATA-1 mediated gene transcription
program and global GATA-1 recruitment and chromatin accessibility. We have identified key interacting
proteins with acetyl-mimicking and non-acetyl-mimicking proteins through LC-MS/MS. We will perform in-depth
studies on differential recruitment of other GATA-1 interacting proteins that potentially alter GATA-1 binding
landscape and target gene expression in vitro and in a mouse model. We will also study the importance of
HDAC1 mediated GATA-1 and BCL11A interaction in fetal globin gene expression and erythroid differentiation.
Preliminary Cut and run study showed that the BCL11A KD or mutation reduces GATA-1 recruitment at fetal
globin locus but not at adult globin locus, suggesting negative role of GATA-1 in fetal globin gene expression.
This claim is further supported by significantly upregulation of fetal globin gene expression in Mx1 cre GATA-
1cKO mice. We therefore will study the mechanism of how GATA-1 negatively regulates fetal globin gene
expression. We will study how BCL11A regulates GATA-1 recruitment and activity in fetal globin gene
expression and how GATA-1 collaborate with BCL11A for -globin gene repression. The role of GATA-
1/BCL11A interaction in globin gene promoter/enhancer interaction and global genome organization will also
be study to have a comprehensive view of the role of GATA-1 in regulating erythrocyte function through
interacting with BCL11A. Thus, this study will lead to novel in depth understanding of GATA-1 function in
erythropoiesis and beyond."

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect with complex CHD causing significant morbidity/
mortality. Therapies targeting adult heart failure have been ineffective in treating heart failure in patients with CHD,
which implies different pathomechanisms of congestive heart failure in patients with CHD compared with those with
structurally normal hearts. Therefore, there is an urgent need to understand the genetic basis of CHDs. Genetic analysis
in CHD patients is confounded by the genetic heterogeneity of the human population. Hence, we used large-scale
chemical/N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis in inbred mice to recover mutations that cause CHD. We recovered
mutations in ten vesicular/endocytic trafficking proteins, including a missense mutation (C4232R) in the highly
conserved epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeat domain encoding low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1
(LRP1). All Lrp1m/m mutant mice exhibited CHD comprising outflow tract (OFT) malalignment defects and/or
atrioventricular (AV) septal defects. Conditional knockout of Lrp1 in different cell lineages that are crucial in cardiac
development demonstrated ablation of cardiac neural crest cells (CNCC) using Wnt1-Cre driver recapitulate the
phenotypes of ENU-induced mutants. Interestingly, these Cre deletion experiments also showed Lrp1 deficiency in
other cell lineages along the CNCC migratory path generated with Nkx2-5+/cre, Tie2+/cre also yielded either double outlet
right ventricle (DORV), atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), or ventricular septal defect (VSD) phenotypes. As these are
observed with variable penetrance, they suggest CNCC migration to the heart is supported by redundant signaling to
ensure high fidelity of CNCC deployment to the heart. In addition, the combined double knockout of Nkx2-5+/cre Tie2+/cre:
Lrp1f/f mutants demonstrated synergistic effects which reflect the complex genetics in human CHD. Based on findings
from a large body of preliminary data, we hypothesize that LRP1 is required in the cardiac neural crest lineage and its
migratory path for proper OFT alignment and development of the atrioventricular cushions (AVC). We will investigate
this with a combination of in vivo and in vitro experiments conducted using Wnt1+/cre: Lrp1f/f mutant mice with Lrp1
deletion targeted to the CNCCs and double knockout of Nkx2-5+/cre Tie2+/cre: Lrp1f/f mutants. First, we will investigate the
deployment of CNCCs with in vitro migration studies in combination with in vivo cell lineage fate mapping analysis (Aim
1). We will further investigate the cellular and molecular basis for how Lrp1 deficiency in CNCCs can lead to OFT and AV
valve defects by conducting single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, as well as in vivo and in vitro analysis of endocytic
trafficking (Aim 2). This will include the examination of endocytic trafficking related to cell signaling pathways identified
in the CNCC and its migratory path. We will also investigate the clinical relevance of LRP1 mutations in human CHD by
generating CRISPR gene-edited mice bearing LRP1 mutations recovered from CHD patients (Aim 3). This will include an
analysis of heterozygous mutations to assess a dominant genetic model of disease, as well as compound heterozygous
mutations to investigate a recessive genetic model of disease. Together, these studies will provide novel mechanistic
insights into the role of endocytic trafficking in the pathogenesis of human CHD."

11192971,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are specified small-molecule inhibitors of the activity of tyrosine kinases and
have shown therapeutic impact on treating cancers. Despite being a prevalent class of drugs in the
pharmaceutical industry, their development and clinical application are frequently hindered by a wide range of
cardiovascular complications: QT prolongation/arrhythmia, left ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure,
ischemia, myocardial infarction, and hypertension. Cardiotoxicity's repercussions impede the advancement of
novel TKIs for cancer therapy and furthermore cause failures in preclinical drug discovery and clinical
development. Therefore, there is an urgent need to assess cardiotoxicity induced by TKIs used in cancer
patients' treatment. However, there is still no targeted and effective preclinical trial due to a) only focusing on
anti-tumor effects without systematic examination of coexisting cardiovascular effects, b) limited efficiency and
accuracy of cardiotoxicity prediction, and c) inter-species differences between animals and humans on
cardiotoxic responses. To address this unmet need, a new in vitro human model for comprehensively assessing
TKIs-indued cardiotoxicity is proposed here. Recently, human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived vascularized
cardiac organoids (VCOs) developed in PI’s and other labs have shown great promise in emulating the human
heart in both cardiovascular structure and function, which makes it an ideal in vitro drug toxicity evaluation system
targeting cardiovascular cells by TKIs. However, three significant challenges remain in applying hPSC-derived
VCOs to cardiotoxicity evaluation: 1) insufficient and uncoupled assessment of organoid structural and functional
properties; 2) continuous generation of large datasets from multifaceted characterizations that requires more
integrated analysis without human bias; 3) low efficiency with more individual hPSC lines. It is hypothesized that
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven biomedical data featuring and predicting address the challenges for accurately
assessing TKI-induced cardiotoxicity by phenotyping the cardiovascular structure and function of VCOs. The
central goal is to establish an organoid-AI system to assess TKI-induced cardiotoxicity efficiently and accurately
with three specific aims: Aim 1. Predict TKI-induced toxicity on cardiovascular structure in VCOs by Generative
AI algorithm; Aim 2. Phenotype TKI-induced cardiovascular dysfunction in VCOs; Aim 3. Establish a TKI-induced
cardiotoxicity assessment system with an organoid-AI system. Upon completion of the proposed project, a
comprehensive human organoid-AI system for assessing TKI-induced cardiotoxicity will be established to
increase the efficiency and accuracy of preclinical drug safety evaluation of TKIs on human cardiotoxicity on both
cardiovascular structure and function."

 Advances in synthetic biology provide powerful tools to interrogate the complex relationship between
network structure and function. In this study, we will combine synthetic biology with computational modeling to
investigate network-mediated regulation of cell damage and deterioration, a complex biological process. As
similar studies in mammals are prohibitively time- and resource-intensive, we choose to focus on
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has proven to be a genetically tractable model for many fundamental
processes in mitotic cells and has allowed identification of many conserved genes that regulate cell-fate
decisions in eukaryotes. Emerging questions include how these genes interact and how the interactions change
dynamically to drive multi-generational cell deterioration dynamics. We recently found two distinct phenotypes
in genetically identical yeast cells as they approach cell death: one with decreased ribosomal DNA (rDNA)
silencing and nucleolar decline (Mode 1) whereas the other with heme depletion and mitochondrial decline (Mode
2). We found that stochasticity plays an important role in choosing one of the two paths, but once the fate decision
is made, it is almost always irreversible. We identified a core molecular circuit, consisting of the lysine
deacetylase Sir2 and the heme-activated protein (HAP) transcriptional complex, that governs the decision to
select one of these two paths. Based on the model, we were able to engineer cells to follow a third path with a
dramatically extended period of growth and survival, free of deterioration (Mode 3). In this proposal, we will
expand these efforts and systematically perturb and rewire the core circuit that controls cell fate in order to
reprogram its decision-making process. In Aim 1, we will use chemically-inducible promoters to control
expression of Sir2 and HAP and thereby modulate cell-fate decisions in isogenic cells. We will use microfluidics
to generate distinct, dynamic patterns of Sir2 and HAP expression and evaluate their effects on damage
accumulation, physiological changes, and cellular decline. In Aim 2, we will genetically rewire the core Sir2-HAP
circuit under the guidance of computational modeling and examine how these engineered circuits govern cell-
fate decisions and cell deterioration dynamics. In Aim 3, we will use high-throughput microfluidics to identify the
gene expression programs associated with Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 3 and examine how perturbations of
these programs affect multi-generational deterioration dynamics. These analyses will uncover the genes and
processes that underlie the missing connections between the Sir2-HAP core circuit and downstream modules
that underlie cellular decline leading to cell death. They will enable us to expand our computational model and
improve its predictive power. Throughout the study, we will construct deterministic and stochastic models, which
will produce testable predictions and guide engineering of synthetic gene circuits. If successful, this research will
advance a quantitative and predictive understanding of cellular fate decisions and cell deterioration."

11192972,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Diabetes affects more than 463 million people worldwide and significantly increases the risk of stroke, as well
causing greater neurovascular injury in response to ischemia and compromising recovery. Cerebral vascular
integrity is critical for preventing stroke and ameliorating the lasting effects of brain ischemia, should it
unfortunately occur. Nonetheless, a critical barrier to our progress in reducing the morbidity and mortality of
diabetics is our lack of understanding of the mechanisms that predispose them to increased stroke risk,
exacerbated neurovascular injury, and impaired recovery. Mechanisms that underlie the vascular damage in
diabetes vary widely, but the O-linked β-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification (O-GlcNAcylation) is
significant given the perpetual state of hyperglycemia that is hallmark of the disease. O-GlcNAcylation is a
ubiquitous post-translational modification that alters target protein function, activity, subcellular localization, and
stability, and is executed by two enzymes: O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which add
and remove O-GlcNAc, respectively. Acutely, O-GlcNAcylation serves as a form of stress signaling. On the other
hand, chronic O-GlcNAc modifications are harmful to vascular function and have been reported in the
vasculature from wide range of pathological conditions including diabetes and obesity. Importantly, it has been
reported that a high fat diet augments basilar artery O-GlcNAc expression and this is associated with increased
neurovascular injury after middle cerebral artery occlusion. However, it is unknown whether cerebrovascular O-
GlcNAcylation, and the two O-GlcNAc enzymes, have a causal role in (i) predisposing diabetics to stroke, (ii)
worsening the stroke-induced neurovascular injury, and (iii) impairing functional recovery after stroke. To address
this gap in the literature, we have composed this Stephen Katz ESI R01 with the central hypothesis that
deficiency of OGT will protect against pre-stroke parenchymal arteriole dysfunction, post-stroke neurovascular
injury, and improve chronic recovery. On the other hand, insufficiency of OGA will exacerbate pre-stroke
parenchymal arteriole dysfunction, post-stroke neurovascular injury, and worsen chronic recovery. We will test
this hypothesis by executing the following approaches: In vitro we will culture primary cerebral microvascular
endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells with high glucose and palmitate. In vivo we will predominantly use
a high-fat diet/low-dose streptozotocin model of diabetes, and stroke will be induced via thromboembolization of
the middle cerebral artery. Measurements of cerebrovascular integrity, neurovascular injury, and behavior will
be executed pre-stroke and post-stroke. Some mice will also be maintained long-term after stroke to evaluate
chronic recovery. In summary, while this Stephen Katz ESI R01 application represents new research directions
for our lab, our fresh insights and rigorous application (including an excellent support team of co-investigators
and significant contributors) could potentially transform the fields of diabetes and stroke research by revealing
cerebrovascular O-GlcNAcylation as a causal mechanism and novel therapeutic target."

The goal of this Phase 2 COBRE for Computational Biology of Human Disease (CBHD) is to strengthen, expand, 
and sustain research programs focusing on computational approaches to the basic biology of human diseases. 
This involves support for faculty investigators that increases their competitiveness for peer-reviewed funding, as 
well as support for resources and infrastructure that enhances Brown’s broader biomedical research community. 
A key theme of this Center is to build upon the strengths of biomedical researchers whose individual questions 
may differ widely, but whose underlying analytical questions share common ground in computational analyses 
of large-scale genomic datasets that lead to discovery. The Administrative Core will lead, coordinate, and 
manage 1) the general activities of the Center including strategic planning, advisory committee meetings, fiscal 
accountability, regulatory compliance, communication, and reporting; 2) the career development activities of the 
junior investigators including the Research Projects and Pilot Project programs, mentoring activities, and the 
Computational Biology Core resource, and 3) activities that strengthen program sustainability including strategic 
partnerships, program integration, community building, program evaluation, and cost-center planning. The 
Administrative Core in Phase 2 will build upon the resources and infrastructure developed and implemented in 
Phase 1 with proven effectiveness. Brown University has invested heavily in facilities that generate data (e.g., 
the Genomics Core), the Center for Computation and Visualization (CCV) that maintains the super computer 
and staffs the Advanced Research Computing group that supports high performance computing, and research 
centers with targeted academic interests in biology and medicine. Our CBHD COBRE is distinct from research 
centers as the sole service Center focused on analysis of omics-enabled data. We will achieve the goals of 
strengthening and sustaining the COBRE in Phase 2 with the following Specific Aims. 1. Provide scientific 
leadership, administrative coordination, and fiscal management to support the continued integration, expansion 
and strengthening of the Center. 2. Provide junior faculty Project Leaders with research funding, career 
development mentoring, and computational resources to strengthen research competitiveness and achieve 
peer-reviewed, sustainably funded research programs. 3. Facilitate and ensure Center sustainability and 
responsiveness by integrative community building, establishing strategic collaborative partnerships, and 
responding to formative and summative program evaluation."

11192965,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Heart failure in the presence of diabetes is common, expensive, and growing in significance, with some
estimates suggesting that diabetic cardiomyopathy is present in up to 60% of patients with diabetes. While
typically thought of as a disease of the left ventricle, right ventricular (RV) remodeling also occurs and
contributes to disease pathogenesis. In multiple clinical conditions, RV dysfunction is the strongest predictor of
mortality, clearly highlighting the significance of maintaining RV function. Despite the strong link between RV
function and survival, understanding of the diabetic RV is limited and thus there is a critical need to identify
mechanisms of RV-specific remodeling in the diabetic heart. In the setting of diabetes, altered myocardial
substrate metabolism causes oxidative stress, which together contribute to LV dysfunction. However, despite
strong rationale for these mechanisms in the diabetic LV, they are unstudied in the RV. The purpose of this
Katz Early Stage Investigator proposal is to identify RV-specific mechanisms of diabetic myopathy. To achieve
this goal, we propose to 1) determine the mechanism by which fatty acid uptake contributes to RV lipotoxicity
and dysfunction, and 2) identify mechanisms of impaired reactive oxygen species signaling in the diabetic RV.
Together, we will demonstrate that RV dysfunction is significant in diabetes by a mechanism involving
lipotoxicity and oxidative stress. Identifying RV-centric mechanisms of disease is critical to advance our long-
term goal of identifying treatments for the failing RV. If RV mechanisms are distinct from those in the LV, then
current therapeutic approaches will be limited in improving RV function and patient outcomes. This novel and
innovative body of work will lay the groundwork for future larger efforts aimed at understanding the
mechanisms of diabetic RV cardiomyopathy and the identification of therapies for this unmet public health
need."

 Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) exhibits mitochondrial abnormalities. We and other
investigators have shown that mitochondrial dysfunction in SBMA involves both loss and gain of function from
the mutant androgen receptor (AR), acting as a critical driver to motor neuron (MN) degeneration. The
proposed project aims to implement mitochondrial transfer to treat SBMA MNs. Our specific aims for this
project will be as follows. In Specific Aim 1, we will develop an isogenic human neural stem cell (NSC) model,
consisting of isogenic control, disease, and AR knockout lines. We will isolate extracellular vesicles (EVs)
secreted from different isogenic NSC lines and specify biological characteristics of these vesicles for new
biomarker identification. In Specific Aim 2, we will culture disease MNs by supplementing mitochondrial EVs
derived from the isogenic control NSCs. We will examine the EV uptake potential of disease MNs, track the
intracellular fate of transferred mitochondria in recipient neurons, and evaluate whether EV-mediated
mitochondrial transfer will attenuate SBMA pathology. This project will establish the rationale and validate the
feasibility of mitochondrial transfer as a novel neuron-type-specific therapeutic intervention for SBMA and
other related neurodegenerative and neurologic disorders."

11192966,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The CNBD family of channels, encompassing hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) and
depolarization-activated KCNH members, plays a pivotal role in shaping the electrical properties of the heart.
The modulation of HCN channels presents a promising therapeutic avenue for the management of atrial and
ventricular arrhythmias by influencing the activity of the sinoatrial node pacemaker. In addition, the human
KCNH2 potassium channel (hERG) gene is linked to long QT syndrome (LQTS), an inherited cardiac condition
that substantially escalates the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. HCN and KCNH
channels share structural features, most notably their voltage-sensing domains (VSD). However, they display
divergent channel gating behaviors. Up to this point, a comprehensive mechanism that adequately explains the
diversity in their voltage-dependent gating has remained elusive. In particular, the VSD of HCN channels
undergoes distinct conformational changes during activation, whose dynamics, nature of intermediate
conformational states, and couplings to other domains remain largely uncharacterized. Moreover, like mutations
affecting the VSD of HCN channels, we recently uncovered that several LQTS-linked mutations the S4 helix
voltage sensor of hERG channels lead to distinctively altered voltage-dependent activation profiles. The
underlying mechanism of these disease-causing gating alterations remains unexplored, yet it is central to our
understanding of the mechanism of cardiac diseases related to CNBD channels. The overarching objective of
this application is to determine the VSD dynamics of recombinant CNBD channels expressed in human cell lines,
using an array of concerted biophysical techniques. We will improve the patch-clamp fluorometry (PCF) method
to study the structure-function correlation of cardiac voltage-gated channels, paving the way to new treatments
of myocardial diseases. Our primary goals also include studying how pivotal regulatory domains modulate
channel gating by altering VSD conformations. To quantitatively assess voltage-dependent structural
rearrangements, we will leverage transition metal ion Förster resonance energy transfer (tmFRET), noncanonical
amino acid integration, and click chemistry for site-specific fluorescence labeling. This strategy will enable us to
precisely translate FRET efficiencies into interatomic distances. In parallel, phasor-plot fluorescence lifetime
imaging (FLIM) in conjunction with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will be used to quantify the underlying
structural dynamics. Collectively, the proposed studies will delineate the energetics, allostery, and structural
foundations of cardiac pacemaking ion channels."
11192968,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Evidence from trials has established that 4 separate classes of guideline-directed medical therapies
(GDMT) for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) together reduce mortality by nearly two-thirds.
Conversely, for heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF), trials have produced only weaker
evidence, resulting in ambiguous guidelines. Our long-term goal is to build the largest echocardiography
registry in the world to generate comparative effectiveness evidence for questions for specific populations in
heart failure where trials have not been able to provide strong evidence. The overall objectives in this
application are to build the registry, test mathematical assumptions required for the application of strong causal
inference methods developed in economics, and then apply the strongest methods possible to measure
treatment effects for GDMT in HFmrEF. The central hypothesis is that “real-world” treatment decisions will
differ at guideline-suggested thresholds of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and patients on either side
of those immediate LVEF thresholds will be otherwise similar (“as good as random”), allowing the application of
regression discontinuity methods to measure treatment effects. We believe these methods will demonstrate
reduced mortality with GDMT for patients with HFmrEF. The rationale for this proposal is that (1) LVEF cutoffs
in guidelines are semi-arbitrary in the sense that LVEF exists on a physiological continuum but guideline
cutoffs are based on strict thresholds, and (2) our preliminary data demonstrates expected discontinuities in
treatment frequency at influential LVEF thresholds for other HF therapies (defibrillators) in real-world practice.
As such, the conditions for “as good as random” likely exist in small ranges around relevant LVEF thresholds,
allowing the application of regression discontinuity methods. Our central hypothesis will be tested with 2
specific aims. In Aim #1, we will use natural language processing to aggregate data from echocardiography
reports from 11 hospitals creating the largest echocardiography registry in the world, allowing clinical
adjudication of both clinical information and echocardiographic images. We will then systematically test
mathematical assumptions required for regression discontinuity. In Aim #2, we will create robust estimates of
each of the effects of each GDMT medication class on mortality in HFmrEF with fuzzy RDD and alternative
methods, including propensity score methods. The feasibility of propensity score methods does not depend on
the Aim 1 analyses, so at least 1 of the 2 proposed methods will be feasible. We therefore expect that these
results will upgrade evidence from the current class 2b (“usefulness is unknown”) in heart failure guidelines for
3 of the 4 GDMT medication classes. We think the proposed research is innovative because it combines
strong causal inference methods to observational data with the adjudication standards of trials to fill in
unanswered gaps in evidence. The research proposed here is significant because it will upgrade the current
ambiguous treatment guidelines for HFmrEF in ways that will reduce mortality for this growing population."

This application will study the effects of undernutrition on the development of the metabolic syndrome
(MetS) after refeeding. Studies showed that undernutrition in childhood leads to obesity, malnutrition-related
diabetes, insulin resistance, and metabolic abnormalities in adulthood. However, the causal factors and the
progression of this etiology are fairly unknown. My initial observations in the mouse model suggest that several
factors could be predetermining Mets progression after refeeding. These were characterized by impaired insulin
signaling, adipogenesis, ectopic lipid accumulation, and a dysregulated FGF21 / adiponectin axis in the bone
marrow. Since FGF21 prevents Mets and lipid accumulation, the hypothesis is that there is a FGF21 loss of
function that predetermines progressive Mets after undemutrition refeeding. This study compares the clinical
and metabolic consequences of refeedlng using wild type mice and FGF21 knockout mice. The first goal will be
to mimic the food-addiction behaviors seen in populations suffering from both obesity and malnutrition. As a
result, Aim 1 will determine whether the loss of FGF21 function is involved in either a) a sweet food preference
or b) overeating a high fat diet, both of which are known drivers of Mets. Aim2, will evaluate if the central
regulation from the bone marrow predetermines proclivity to progressive Mets after refeeding by establishing a)
if FGF21 participates in the regulatory shift that determines either osteogenesis or adipogenesis from MSC
precursors, or rather drives adipocyte browning; and b) if FGF21 engages in the mobilization of accumulated
triglycerides, inhibiting ROS signaling and consequences (by multiparametric flow cytometry). Aim 3: will identify
the transcriptional patterns imprinted in MSC and progeny during early malnutrition that persist later in life with
negative consequences after refeeding. Also, it will identify the gene network driven by the nature of the diet and
putative genes responsible for FGF21 and insulin dysfunction (by single cell-RNAseq).
The four-year training for this career reorientation is geared toward the acquisition of knowledge that
would contribute to my establishment as an independent researcher. First, academic studies specific to the
orientation of the career are aimed at learning concepts about bone marrow plasticity and how to apply them to
prevent Mets progression. Furthermore, for MSC and adipocyte metabolic reprograming strategies. Second, I
will acquire skills for a deeper understanding of the regulatory role of the musculoskeletal system in metabolism
and progressive Mets. As well, through training in cutting-edge technologies of single-cell sequencing and data
integration to propel the discovery of molecular medicine targets for Mets prevention. Third, acquisition of skills
to be involved in future collaborative studies and networking, including grant writing, ethics, and translational
research as an overarching theme. These interdisciplinary studies will empower me to compete for funding as
an independent investigator. Overall, the study will unravel the role of FGF21 sensitization in cellular and
metabolic dysregulations in undernutrition and refeeding linked to the severity of Mets components."

11193149,"Abstract
This project delves into the comprehensive study of the long-term neurobehavioral and cognitive impacts caused
by Prenatal Alcohol Exposure (PAE), aiming to shed light on potential therapeutic targets for Fetal Alcohol
Spectrum Disorders (FASD). During the previous funding period, crucial discoveries were made, particularly the
correlation between elevated levels of the potassium channel KCNN2 in the motor cortex and motor learning
deficits in PAE mice. Pharmacological interventions targeting KCNN2 showed promising improvements in these
learning deficits. Further investigations revealed significant alterations in the expression of Apolipoprotein E
(APOE) in both the cortex of PAE mice and the plasma of human PAE children. A specific single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) in the enhancer of APOE was identified as a potential risk factor for cognitive deficits in
human PAE subjects. Preliminary data suggested that postnatal administration of an APOE mimetic peptide
could mitigate motor learning deficits in PAE mice, and this effect was associated with the restoration of KCNN2
levels, adjustments in NMDAR decay time, and reduced phosphorylation of CREB. The hypothesis of this project
posits that dysregulated APOE expression in the brain contributes significantly to learning deficits observed in
FASD, and that treatment with APOE mimetics can alleviate these deficits. To validate and further explore this
hypothesis, the project is structured into three main objectives: 1. Understanding the underlying mechanisms
leading to reduced APOE expression in the cortex of PAE mice; 2. Identifying how decreased APOE levels
translate to learning and cognitive deficits in PAE mice; 3. Evaluating the effectiveness of APOE mimetic
treatment in improving learning and cognitive abnormalities in PAE mice. Through this multifaceted approach,
the project aims to contribute valuable insights to the field of neuroscience, specifically in understanding and
potentially treating the neurobehavioral sequelae of PAE and FASD."

Antibiotic-induced disruption (AID) of the gut microbiome can lead to severe conditions like C. diff colitis and 
may contribute to long-term health issues, including obesity and diabetes. There is an urgent need to develop 
interventions that mitigate these negative impacts while preserving the antibiotics' effectiveness. Our preliminary 
data suggest that dietary fiber reduces antibiotic disruption by decreasing the gut's redox potential, which in turn 
favors a low-energy, fermentative metabolic environment. This environment protects core microbiome members 
by reducing their metabolic rate and ATP production, which are linked to antibiotic susceptibility. In Aim 1, we 
will use an ex vivo microbiome culture approach to test endogenous redox sinks and small molecule regulators 
of bacterial redox as modulators of AID and determine the influence of these modulators on microbiome 
resilience, recovery, and pathobiont susceptibility. This research aims to identify mechanisms that can be 
translated into therapies for protecting the microbiome during antibiotic treatment, particularly for vulnerable 
populations."
11191754,"The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is rising more rapidly in the U.S. than any other malignancy, increasing over 350% in the past decades. Most cases of EAC are preceded by Barrett's esophagus (BE). Current guidelines recommend routine endoscopic surveillance followed by ablation or resection of high grade dysplasia (HGD) lesions. However, the standard white light endoscopic surveillance requires extensive random biopsies resulting in an inaccurate approach with up to 40% of patients with HGD having undetected EAC, despite undergoing this surveillance as indicated. This proposal develops a fluorescence-based endoscopic imaging platform to image a novel imaging agent, pegulicianine, that is activated by molecular alterations associated with cancer. This novel platform is aimed at accurately detect, in real-time and in-situ, dysplasia within a background of BE. This approach may obviate the need for repeated surveillance with random biopsies. Through this method of early detection of esophageal precancers, the incidence of EAC and cancer-related mortality may be reduced. This proposal will (1) develop an endoscope-agnostic solution that is compatible with the working channel of any therapeutic gastroscope and (2) generate the data package required to support regulatory approvals to conduct clinical testing and validation of the system in humans."
11191777,"Soil harbors many pathogens of public health concern, but the ecology of these pathogens in the context of the soil microbiome is 
far from clear. Amoeba-associated bacteria Legionella spp. are the causal agents of environmentally acquired pneumonia 
legionellosis. The exponential increase in legionellosis incidence rates in the past two decades correlated significantly with 
temperature and extreme precipitation events in the US, implying augmented risks due to interactions between environmental 
Legionella with climate change. However, how climate change affects Legionella’s abundance, distribution, association with 
amoeba host, and infectivity have not been systematically evaluated. 
Our long-term goal is to establish a framework for soil-borne pathogens’ risk assessment based on mechanistic understandings of 
microbiome (biotic) and environmental (abiotic) controls on their persistence and proliferation. The specific objectives of this 
project are to 1) investigate the distribution of Legionella and host amoeba in terrestrial environments along temperature and 
precipitation gradients for risk predictive mapping, and 2) test if these climate factors control Legionella–amoeba association, which 
contributes to infectivity. The central hypothesis is that climate/edaphic conditions and interaction with amoeba host co-determine 
Legionella’s persistence in terrestrial environments. We will test this hypothesis utilizing the broad range of soil types, ecozones, 
and environmental gradients on O‘ahu. This project addresses the following specific aims. 
Specific Aim 1. Map distributions of soil Legionella and host amoeba along environmental gradients. 
Approach: Soil samples from a temperature and precipitation gradient on O‘ahu will be collected and analyzed together with 
Hawai’i’s microbiome data archive for identification and quantification of Legionella and potential hosts. We will also acquire novel 
isolates of environmental Legionella. Legionella distribution and abundance will be linked to climate and edaphic environments. 
Specific Aim 2. Determine biotic and environmental influence on Legionella’s intracellular lifestyle. 
Approach: A size-filtering technique will be developed to concentrate free-living Legionella vs. host amoeba cells for community 
characterization. Legionella composition will be compared between the two groups to identify representative sequences and 
isolates. Comparative genomics will be performed on representative isolates to find differences in the two groups’ virulence factors. 
Representative sequences will be matched to environmental samples to connect Legionella’s lifestyle to environmental conditions. 
Specific Aim 3. Quantify effects of soil water connectivity on Legionella – amoeba association. 
Approach: A transparent micromodel reconstructed based on real soil’s pore structures will be kept at varied water saturation 
levels. Legionella and host amoeba cultures will be inoculated at separate locations on the micromodel. Movements of microbial 
cells and spatially resolved metabolomics will be used to monitor the timing and signaling of interactions."
11192537,"Pancreatic cancer is a lethal malignancy. Even with surgical resection, the recurrence rate is high, and chemotherapy is recommended for all patients due to the systemic nature of the disease. A major treatment challenge is the high rate of resistance to the available treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatment modalities with effective and durable responses. Immunotherapy has recently revolutionized the treatment of several malignancies. While these patients have a durable response to immunotherapy and benefit from improved survival, many solid tumors and in particular, pancreatic cancer, do not respond to standard immunotherapy. They do not elicit a significant immune response and are considered immunologically “cold” tumors. A dense tumor microenvironment is a physical barrier against treatment delivery. It also suppresses the immune system to fight against cancer. Therefore, a multi-modality approach targeting tumor cells and tumor microenvironment can overcome treatment resistance more effectively. Converting “cold” tumors to “hot” tumors is an area of great interest in immuno-oncology research. Oncolytic viruses are one of the desirable platforms for this purpose. Their anti-cancer activity is not only the direct killing of tumor cells but also modulating the immune response against cancer. In this project, we have designed novel oncolytic viruses, on a vesicular stomatitis virus backbone, that are bioengineered to express enzymes that target the stroma and tumor microenvironment. In addition, they express antibodies against the immune checkpoint LAG-3. Immune checkpoints inhibit immune response against tumors and by blocking them, they can prevent tumor evasion from the immune system. The combination of LAG-3 inhibition with conventional immune checkpoint inhibitors (PD-1 inhibitors) has been recently shown to enhance immunotherapy efficacy and reverse resistance to PD-1 inhibitors. We hypothesize that this multi-target design offers a comprehensive approach against important resistance mechanisms in pancreatic cancer and not only offers an effective immunotherapeutic approach but also improves the response to available conventional therapies. This study aims to investigate whether targeting the extracellular matrix with the oncolytic virus platform improves anti-tumor toxicity. It determines whether dual targeting of the tumor microenvironment and immune checkpoint inhibition with this oncolytic virus elicits an enhanced immune response. Finally, we will investigate whether combining this novel oncolytic virus with PD-1 inhibitors and standard chemotherapy can elicit safe and effective tumor toxicity and enhanced immune response and if the approach can convert the “cold” tumors to “hot” tumors. Validating our hypothesis in preclinical models provides the required evidence for designing clinical trials that investigate the treatment efficacy and safety of this approach in pancreatic cancer patients. Establishing a successful immunotherapeutic approach can revolutionize the treatment of pancreatic cancer."

11014165,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This is a study of neighborhood racial change and its impacts on trends in Black-white segregation over a
multi-decade time span. It will provide much new information about settlement patterns that continue to
impact residents' health, social class mobility, and quality of daily life. It will trace changes in population
composition at the neighborhood scale within constant geographic boundaries, and evaluate how different
patterns of neighborhood change contributed to increasing or declining segregation in the larger urban area. It
will compare the period 1930-1950, when white flight and minority “invasion and succession” were creating
more racially homogeneous neighborhoods and magnifying segregation in cities to two later phases. These are
1950-1980, when segregation within cities began to give way to the new divide between cities and suburbs, and
after 1980 when segregation declined in cities while remaining more persistent in suburbia.
An important contribution of this project is to develop a neighborhood-scale data base with consistent
boundaries over time for multiple decades to support the proposed analyses. It will use methods developed for
the Longitudinal Tract Data Base (LTDB) for 1970-2020 and the Urban Transition HGIS Project (1880-1940).
A major effort will be to incorporate data and map sources that are now becoming available. The project will
develop harmonized neighborhood data for 69 major cities for 1930-1950 and for them plus their surrounding
suburbs for 1950-2020, making possible detailed studies of suburban development after World War II."

A laser ablation system of cancerous solid tumors and groups of cell, with custom made handpieces equipped with camera systems for excitation of fluorophores and collection of emitted photons will further aid treatment. Completion of this Phase II will result in a marketable, pre-production laser system for photoablation of tumors in colorectal cancers. Each handpiece will have three cameras. Two CMOS cameras will provide high-def intraoperative visualization features, like having a microscope in the surgeon’s hand, while the ToF camera enhances CMOS performance by adding distance and depth to the software algorithms. After handpiece assembly, a laser system will be developed, mountable on a mobile cart, fully equipped with galvanometers and a CO2 (9.3 mm wavelength) beam delivery system compatible with each handpiece, resulting in a system that can be applied to colon cancer, and cervical and oral later, while being convenient to move and easy to use.

11191330,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
As the world’s leading regulatory authority, and the country’s largest research university, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and Johns Hopkins University are ideally suited to broaden and deepen their highly productive
partnership through the Johns Hopkins Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (JH-CERSI).
This program, launched in 2014, has produced fundamental and applied new knowledge impacting a breadth of
regulated products, ranging from COVID-19 therapeutics (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research) to
eCigarettes (Center for Tobacco Products) to upper extremity prostheses (Center for Devices and Radiologic
Health). The program has also undertaken vitally important inquiries relevant to many understudied groups,
including pregnant women, racial and ethnic minorities, children and individuals with opioid use disorder. This
knowledge has been used by the FDA to support rule-making, guidance-development, and the alignment of
strategic priorities, helping to ensure that the FDA remains a global leader in advancing the technical and
scientific foundations of product regulation. Since its inception, JH-CERSI has also leveraged the historically
close relationship between the FDA and Johns Hopkins, and our renewal builds upon the substantial
infrastructure developed together over the past eight years. JH-CERSI’s successes reflect many strengths
including remarkable commitment from the FDA’s Office of the Chief Scientist and Office of Regulatory Science
and Innovation, the University’s internationally renowned scholarship in regulatory science, an immense training
platform, close geographic proximity to the FDA, and a nimble and organic operational approach. In this renewal,
we propose to capitalize on these strengths and on the numerous structural improvements we have made since
inception. We also propose three new programmatic elements to amplify impact. First, we will appoint an
Associate Director of Artificial Intelligence and an Associate Director of Data Science and Informatics to expand
the depth and breadth of our activities across faculty, programs, centers and schools, including the world-
renowned Whiting School of Engineering and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Lab. Second, we will develop
new training, including in Preparedness and Public Health Communications, to address the major threat that
misinformation poses to the FDA’s regulatory success. We also propose new interchange with leading overseas
regulators, thereby enhancing global regulatory science. Finally, we will institute an External Partnerships
Initiative to serve as a force-multiplier by leveraging the remarkable scientific networks of Johns Hopkins faculty
in service of the FDA’s mission. Together, through these efforts, Johns Hopkins and the FDA will continue to
achieve remarkable gains that allow the FDA to maximize its effectiveness and impact through state-of-the-art
regulation in the 21st Century."
11191732,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Implantable electronics can provide a direct connection to the endogenous sensorimotor pathways, can offer
an exciting opportunity for intuitive and dexterous control of bionic devices. These implantable devices often
need to communicate with external equipment for data acquisition and signal generation. A wired connection
between the device and external equipment is traditionally used for this type of communication, but this is
fraught with surgical complications, infection, wire breakage, and device malfunction. Significant research has
been devoted to wireless biotelemetry systems for implantable electronics devices and these have been
implemented in many implantable medical devices. An antenna is an essential electronic component of a
wireless biotelemetry system. Antennas are typically included in or on the battery pack, thus limiting their
physical size. But advanced fabrication techniques, material synthesis, and device design are shrinking the
size of next-generation devices, reducing device footprint to minimize foreign body response. Antenna design
remains one of the major challenges in the miniaturization of implantable medical devices. The size of the
antenna is determined by the frequency of the transmitted signal. Long-term implants use the MedRadio band
(402-405MHz), where a half-wavelength antenna is ≈6 cm in the body. Even applying methods to miniaturize
these antennas, they are too large for next-generation (mm-scale) implants. Revolutionary antenna design is
much needed to enable the next-generation medical implant miniaturization strategy. This proposal will use
innovative antenna system design to create a remotely coupled and injectable antenna system. This new class
of implantable antenna can be injected into the body, where they transform into a soft, conductive antenna.
Once the antenna is injected, it will be able to remotely coupled with a much smaller antenna in the implantable
medical device without physical attachment. This approach will enable a new class of wireless biotelemetry
antennas and their associated medical applications."

It is striking and disheartening that Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders (AA-NHPI)
experience health disparities that are substantial, growing, and poorly understood. Our project entitled “Hawai‘i
Health Equity Research and Outreach Network (HAWAI‘I HERON)” will create an Administrative Core to allow
us to quickly respond and participate in multi-institutional studies that support three health equity pillars: equity
of voices, equitable data efforts, and equity in clinical trials. First, we will enhance equity of voices by 1) amplifying
the voices of our AA-NHPI stakeholder communities; 2) understanding diverse patient perspectives, preferences,
and unmet needs; and 3) supporting expansion of culturally and linguistically tailored health education. Second,
we will support equitable data efforts by expanding capacity to evaluate outcomes by 1) race/ethnicity; 2)
geography; and 3) other social determinants of health. Third, we will promote equity in clinical trials by 1)
identifying barriers; 2) employing innovative strategies to increase clinical trial enrollment for AA-NHPI; 3)
understanding the impact of the evolving multicultural landscape on trial participation; and 4) increasing training
for diverse students and investigators. The HAWAI‘I HERON Administrative Core will foster collaboration with
the Food and Drug Administration Office of Minority Health and Health Equity and other institutions that are part
of the Racial & Ethnic Minority Acceleration Consortium for Health Equity (REACH) network. In addition, we will
leverage the Administrative Core to conduct a pilot study involving a discrete choice experiment examining AA-
NHPI perceptions and preferences for diabetes medications. We will gain an understanding of AA-NHPI
preferences regarding attributes of diabetes medications through administering patient preference surveys to 50
AA and 50 NHPI with type 2 diabetes. Random utility theory will serve as the basis for analysis. This assumes
that individuals make choices to maximize their utility (or wellbeing), which they derive from different choices.
Mixed logit regression, which allows for heterogeneity in preferences across individuals, will be used to estimate
the random utility models. Results will enable us to better understand the importance of different attributes and
levels, as well as willingness to trade-off between attributes. We will compare findings for AA to those of NHPI
and describe similarities and differences. Sensitivity analysis will be used to test the robustness of the results to
different assumptions and model specifications. We will hire and train a Health Equity Fellow to support the
discrete choice experiment in diabetes medications and build expertise and scholarship for future work and
engagement. Achievement of these aims will enable HAWAI‘I HERON to be an active partner to the FDA Office
of Minority Health and Health Equity in collaborative research efforts to advance minority health and health equity
focused research, to improve outreach and communications, and to support training and mentoring of diverse
students and junior researchers."

11192962,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Adult human cardiomyocytes have poor capacity for proliferation and functional recovery after heart attack, thus
leading to the high morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, there is great need to under-
stand the underlying mechanisms of adult cardiomyocyte turnover and maturation. While screening for modula-
tors of TEAD1, a core component of the cardiac transcriptional network, my lab identified a novel factor—
C5ORF51/RIMOC1—as a potential cardiomyogenic modulator. C5ORF51 (hereinafter referred to as C5x) is a
previously uncharacterized protein of nearly unknown function, which appears to play critical roles in the regula-
tion of cardiomyocyte homeostasis and heart size. The overarching hypothesis is that C5x, as a novel TEAD1
cofactor, regulates cardiomyogenesis by functioning as a modulator of core cardiac transcription factors. The
rationale for the project is that both the ex vivo and in vivo C5x knockout models demonstrate significantly ac-
celerated cell cycle activity and cardiomyocyte endowment. Importantly, C5x-cardiomyocyte-knockout mice de-
velop massive cardiomegaly and premature mortality, demonstrating a critical role of C5x in maintaining normal
cardiac function. RNA sequencing analysis suggests C5x as a gatekeeper for the fetal gene program. We pro-
pose two aims to address our hypothesis: [Aim 1] Determine the mechanisms by which C5x modulates tran-
scription in cardiomyocytes. [Aim 2] Investigate the role of C5x in adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and matura-
tion. Under the first aim, we will investigate the molecular interactive model between C5x and TEAD1. We will
further determine the interacting partners of C5x in cardiomyocytes to understand its regulatory network. Under
the second aim, we will determine proliferation in the sub-aim 2A and function in sub-aim 2B. Specifically, we
will test whether C5x loss is sufficient to induce cell cycle reentry and fetal gene program reactivation in adult,
we will also test whether C5x loss is able to induce more cells to enter cell cycle in the cardiac injury models. We
will determine the necessity of C5x in cardiomyocyte maturation and function. The research proposed in this
application is innovative because this is the first study demonstrating the nonredundant role of C5x in vivo and
in heart and illustrating a novel transcriptional modulator in cardiomyocytes. The proposed study is significant
because it will uncover a novel regulatory mechanism leveraging cell cycling and maturation. Ultimately, this
knowledge has the potential of offering new opportunities for the development of innovative treatment modality
to induce cardiogenesis."
11192963,"Project Summary
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and accounts for 1 in every 5 deaths.
Sudden cardiac death is responsible for nearly half of all heart disease related mortality and is often attributed
to the occurrence of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular arrhythmias also are a major source of morbidity
and mortality in patients with structural heart disease. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy provides only limited efficacy
in preventing ventricular arrhythmias and while implantable cardioverter defibrillators provide life-saving therapy
to terminate the arrhythmia once it has occurred, they do not prevent them from occurring. For these reasons,
catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias has emerged as an additional therapy for many patients with
refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT). However, VT ablation procedures are complex and multiple procedures
are often required to achieve modest long-term success. Therefore, there is a critical need for additional VT
therapies. Cardiac stereotactic body radiation therapy (cSBRT) has emerged as an adjunctive noninvasive
approach that can be utilized to treat patients with VT that is refractory to standard antiarrhythmic drug therapy
and catheter ablation with clinical efficacy observed in some very complex patients. However, the clinical
response following cSBRT has been highly variable and the electrophysiologic mechanism is unclear. We
believe that better understanding the mechanisms of cSBRT will help refine and guide clinical cSBRT paradigms,
optimize patient selection, and better define the appropriate role this therapy should have in clinical practice. We
propose a series of experiments to investigate the association between cSBRT dose and structural and
electrophysiologic changes using longitudinal cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and high-resolution
electroanatomic mapping in a large animal model of chronic myocardial infarction and reentrant VT. In Aim 1,
we will investigate the impact of cSBRT dose (15Gy, 25Gy, and 35Gy) at short and intermediate follow-up
timepoints. We will also investigate the long-term impact of cSBRT delivered at the dose currently used clinically
(25Gy) out to 1 year. In Aim 2, we will similarly investigate structural and electrophysiologic changes that occur
in patients undergoing clinically indicated cSBRT compared to catheter ablation. This study will give a new
understanding of the dose and time relationship of cSBRT on the heart that will be essential in moving this field
forward."
11192964,"Project Summary
Cardiometabolic diseases contribute to more than 1 in 4 deaths in U.S. adults, including Asian Americans.
Psychosocial stress is believed to be a key risk factor leading to elevated risks of cardiometabolic diseases,
beyond traditional factors such as poor diet and physical inactivity. However, there is limited knowledge of how
psychosocial stress affects cardiometabolic health among Asian Americans, especially older foreign-born
Asian American who disproportionately encounter psychosocial stress due to racism, language barriers, and
low socioeconomic status. Notably, a lack of knowledge of key biopsychological mechanisms through which
psychosocial stress affects cardiometabolic health hampers public health efforts to develop effective
interventions to promote cardiometabolic health in the understudied Asian American population, which is
projected to reach 46 million by 2060. To address these important scientific gaps, the proposed study is to
investigate key biopsychological processes through which daily psychosocial stress affects cardiometabolic
health among 300 older foreign-born Chinese Americans. We will use a prospective design and harness the
power of ecological momentary assessment and biospecimen sampling to achieve three specific aims. We
propose to: (Aim 1) determine the mediation effects of biopsychological processes (daily negative emotion,
saliva cortisol secretion, daily sleep quality) on the associations between psychosocial stressors (e.g., social
isolation) and cardiometabolic health (e.g., blood pressure, Hemoglobin A1C); (Aim 2) investigate micro-level
day-to-day associations among psychosocial stressors, biopsychological processes, and blood pressure; and
(Aim 3) examine the moderation roles of sociocultural factors (e.g., acculturation, social cohesion) on the
longer-term effects of psychosocial stressors on cardiometabolic health. Completion of the proposed study will
provide new knowledge to facilitate the understanding of key psychosocial stressors and related
biopsychological processes contributing to poor cardiometabolic health in older Chinese Americans. As a
result, this project will guide the design of future culturally-tailored, time-sensitive, personalized psychosocial
interventions that aim to promote cardiometabolic health in this population."
11192956,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the top five causes of disability among middle-aged
US adults. Exercise-based pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs are often recommended for COPD patients
to alleviate symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, physical function, and overall quality of life. However, the
benefits of physical activity-based interventions are typically not sustained over a long period of time in COPD,
and adherence to physical activity interventions is poor. In addition, few longitudinal studies on physical activity
of COPD patients use objective measures of physical activity. Symptoms of COPD can lead to increased sleep
disturbances resulting in increased daily fatigue, lower physical activity, and negative mood, which in turn
worsen COPD symptoms. We recently demonstrated the effectiveness of our novel home-based PR program
consisting of 12 weeks of weekly health coaching calls and objective remote monitoring to increase the
physical activity of COPD patients. However, the underlying behavioral mechanisms that contribute to a higher
likelihood of successful and sustainable increases in daily physical activity in COPD patients participating in
such programs are not understood. With COPD prevalence and its’ associated co-morbidities quickly
accelerating in the aging population, it is critical to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for
improving health outcomes, and to translate that knowledge into clinical practice. It is our overarching
hypothesis that modifiable habitual behavioral patterns play a significant mitigating role in slowing the
progression of COPD symptoms. The proposed project will bridge these mechanistic gaps in knowledge and
allow us to better refine and individualize our novel PR program to optimize improvements in physical activity
and subsequent health benefits across the COPD population. The goal of this study is to investigate how
patterns of physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep and cognitive components of mood and self-efficacy
affect the physical activity outcomes produced by our home-based physical activity intervention (R01
HL140486, PI: Benzo) by applying algorithms to a wrist-worn accelerometer (developed in R21 AR66643, PI:
Fortune) in combination with daily survey-based measurements. The following steps will be taken to address
this important need: we will determine the associations of the underlying (1) patterns of physical activity and
sedentary behavior with changes in physical activity elicited through PR, (2) patterns of sleep behaviors with
changes in physical activity, fatigue and mood elicited through PR, and (3) behavioral processes with changes
in physical activity elicited through PR. This project is innovative in its approach of utilizing our novel wearable
sensor-based algorithms, and survey measurements combined with our novel home-based PR intervention to
further the understanding of the mechanistic interplay of multi-factorial behavioral aspects that lead to
increased likelihood of successful outcomes from participation in our novel PR program. Our results may
critically inform the optimization of PR programs for this prevalent condition."
11193362,"The development of effective HIV vaccines and other prevention strategies relies on the use of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in preclinical studies. To meet this need, the Simian Vaccine Evaluation Units (SVEUs) provide NHP resources that primarily support preclinical evaluation of AIDS vaccines and prevention modalities. The SVEU program will provide NIAID the ability to evaluate candidate AIDS vaccines using NHP models in which thorough evaluations of systemic and mucosal immune responses can be conducted, vaccine efficacy can easily be tested, correlates of reduced risk of virus acquisition can be identified, and approaches to enhance immunogenicity and efficacy of clinical vaccines can be conducted. The SVEUs will provide a responsive, flexible vaccine resource that is available to NIH-supported researchers and can support all stages of AIDS vaccine research, from preclinical evaluation or clinical testing of candidate AIDS vaccines, with the objective of identifying a vaccine that will generate immune responses able to prevent or control viral infection.

11192958,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Nearly half of the ~116 million Americans with hypertension are salt-sensitive and confer a 3-fold higher risk of
developing cardiovascular disease. Only 26% of hypertensive patients reach blood pressure (BP) control, which
may be due to lack of studies in females despite the growing evidence for sex differences in hypertensive
mechanisms. It is known that the gut microbiota and immune system are critical in hypertension in males; this is
largely unknown in females. The objective of this grant is to address this knowledge gap regarding the role of
the gut microbiota and immune system to mediate sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension. Mechanistic
studies will be performed in male and female Dahl Salt-Sensitive (SS) rats, with translational studies performed
in samples from opposite-sex twin pairs where the males have hypertension compared to females.
Dahl SS rats, a model consistent with human salt-sensitive hypertension, exhibit a greater degree of salt-
sensitivity and associated end-organ damage in males compared to females. We have observed stark sex
differences in gut microbiota composition and gut-derived metabolites. Through microbiota transfer studies, we
know the gut microbiota plays a causal role in the regulation of BP and renal damage. Linking the microbiota to
immunity, microbiota transfer also influences renal T cell infiltration. Genetic deletion of T cells (SSCD247–/–)
eliminates sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension, highlighting the role of T cells to mediate BP sex
differences. Since the gut microbiota influences renal T cell infiltration, and T cells amplify salt-sensitive
hypertension, we have strong rationale for studying how sex-specific microbiota impact T cell function and salt-
sensitivity. We will test the central hypothesis that gut microbiota-dependent T cell activation determines
the extent of salt-sensitive hypertension and mediates the sex differences in disease severity.
Our hypothesis will be rigorously tested with three aims: Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that the gut microbiota
drives sex differences in salt-sensitive hypertension. Sex-specific microbiota transfer and gonadectomy studies
will reveal whether the gut microbiota sex- and hormone-dependently contributes to salt-sensitive hypertension
in SS rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that the male versus female gut microbiota influences sex differences
in T cell function and activation. Microbiota transfer in SSCD247–/– rats lacking T cells will assess the impact of sex
and gut microbiota on T cell bioenergetics and cytokine production, and will address whether T cells are required
for gut microbiota-dependent salt-sensitive hypertension. Aim 3 will determine whether the sex-specific
observations in gut microbiota, gut metabolites, and T cell function in the SS rat similarly parallel humans from
a longitudinal opposite-sex twin cohort, where the males exhibit hypertension compared to their female twin pair.
These studies will reveal key mechanisms related to gut microbiota-immune-kidney crosstalk and provide the
preclinical and human basis for developing novel, sex-specific targets to improve BP control and kidney disease."

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 27% of all stroke-related years of potential life lost before 65
years of age. Sleep disturbance (insufficient sleep, poor quality) and daytime sleepiness (falling asleep during
activities) are highly prevalent following SAH. These symptoms negatively impact overall daily function and
quality of life and increase healthcare use, yet often go undetected or untreated during clinical care. This
proposed study builds upon our prior research, where we found that SAH survivors use patient activation and
self-management strategies in an attempt to improve sleep (e.g., seek knowledge and skills, exercise or relax),
but become frustrated when there is no support or structure to aid their strategies. Our findings suggest that
targeted sleep self-management interventions focusing on patient activation improve sleep in this population.
However, effective interventions focusing on sleep disturbance tailored to SAH have not been reported in the
literature. In this study, we will integrate input from SAH survivors and their caregivers, employ an iterative
human-centered design using a mixed methods approach, and develop a technology-based intervention to
improve self-management skills (patient activation and engagement) for SAH survivors with sleep disturbance.
We will tailor the face-to-face Sleep BETTER 4-week intervention, effective in improving sleep in other chronic
illness populations, to meet the unique needs of SAH survivors, and convert it to a technology-based format
using responsive-design web technology to support deployment over web, tablet, and mobile devices. This
program includes six components: 1) bedroom environment, 2) exercise, 3) tension, 4) time in bed, 5) eating
and drinking, and 6) rhythm for sleep-wake routines. In this study we aim to: 1) Tailor the Sleep BETTER
intervention to meet the unique needs of SAH survivors (e.g., enhanced social support and self-management
skills) to improve sleep disturbance (i.e., self-report sleep quality and daytime sleepiness; actigraphy total
sleep time and sleep efficiency) with 32 SAH survivors and their caregivers, 2) Develop a technology-based
intervention, using an iterative human-centered design and qualitative methods (i.e., iterative cycles of semi-
structured audio-recorded sessions) with 24 SAH survivors and their caregivers, 3) Refine and test the usability
of a technology-based intervention, employing think-aloud observation sessions, the System Usability Scale,
and semi-structured interviews with 32 SAH survivors and their caregivers, and 4) Assess the overall feasibility
and acceptability of collecting primary (i.e., self-report sleep quality and daytime sleepiness; actigraphy total
sleep time and sleep efficiency) and secondary measures (i.e., patient activation, motor or cognitive
impairments, and social support) to refine the intervention protocol. A technology-based intervention to improve
sleep has the potential to reduce health disparities by providing an intervention for SAH survivors who are
typically geographically dispersed with limited access to sleep specialists. Our results will provide critical data
for further development of a large scale randomized controlled trial to improve sleep in this population."

 Neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) is a significant issue that arises from vascular damage during interventions,
leading to arterial wall thickening and lumen loss. This condition is primarily caused by the phenotypic transition
of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Excessive migration and proliferation of these dysfunctional VSMCs
contribute to NIH, which ultimately causes stenosis and restricts blood flow. Preventing or reversing this
pathological transition in VSMCs could be a promising strategy to mitigate NIH following interventions.
 Recent studies have identified a long noncoding RNA called cardiac mesoderm enhancer-associated
noncoding RNA (CARMN), which plays a critical role in VSMC differentiation and maintenance of contractile
functions. Disruptions in CARMN regulation have been linked to VSMC dysfunction and NIH. Decreased
expression of CARMN has been observed in dedifferentiated VSMCs and diseased blood vessels. Furthermore,
studies have shown that genetic ablation of CARMN exacerbates neointima formation, while CARMN
overexpression attenuates NIH in mouse and rat models of vascular injury. These findings strongly suggest that
restoring CARMN regulation in dysfunctional VSMCs could be a viable strategy to mitigate NIH and improve the
outcomes of vascular interventions. Based on these insights, our research project aims to develop a lesion-
targeted nanotherapeutic that utilizes CARMN transcripts as the pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of VSMC
dysfunction and NIH. Building on our prior successful research with platelet membrane-cloaked nanoparticles
(PNP) as an efficient targeted delivery system for injured vasculature, we have integrated in vitro transcribed
(IVT) CARMN RNA into PNP, creating PNP-CARMN. Our preliminary findings demonstrate that PNP significantly
increases the uptake of CARMN by cultured VSMCs and improves targeted delivery of CARMN in the denuded
mouse artery. Importantly, in mice subjected to a wire-injury procedure, PNP-CARMN effectively mitigates arterial
wall thickening compared to those loaded with GFP mRNA. These preliminary results indicate that PNP-CARMN
has the potential to address VSMC dysfunction and prevent NIH.
 The research project will test the overall hypothesis that CARMN transcripts delivered by PNP would
selectively accumulate in the vascular injury sites and promote VSMC contractile gene expression and functions,
there mitigating NIH. The proposed studies involve three Specific Aims, including (1) optimize PNP-CARMN for
nuclear delivery and assess its in vitro effects, (2) investigate the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of PNP-CARMN,
and (3) evaluate the pharmacological responses and therapeutic efficacy of PNP-CARMN against VSMC
dysfunction and NIH. Successful completion of these Aims will provide insight into the therapeutic role of CARMN
and contribute to the development of a new avenue for CVD treatments that can benefit millions of Americans."

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a cardiovascular disorder characterized by high mortality, primarily due to right
ventricular (RV) failure (RVF) caused by increased pulmonary vascular resistance. RV fibrosis, a hallmark of
decompensated RVF, lacks targeted therapies, highlighting the need to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
underlying RV fibrosis and dysfunction.
Our research focuses on the role of alternative polyadenylation (APA), a process associated with excessive
production of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, in RV fibrosis. APA shortens the 3' untranslated region (UTR)
of transcripts, leading to loss of microRNA binding sites and increased transcript stability. We have identified
Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specific Factor 6 (CPSF6), a key regulator of APA, as being involved in end-
stage RVF. In RVF patients, CPSF6 exhibits lengthened 3' UTR and decreased protein expression. Silencing
CPSF6 in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) results in 3' UTR shortening and upregulation of major fibrotic mediators,
including TGF-β1 and its receptor, TGFβR1. Pathway analysis further supports 3' UTR shortening in mRNAs
encoding ECM proteins in CPSF6 knockdown CFs. Additionally, we have discovered the role of 4-hydroxy-2-
nonenal (4HNE), a reactive aldehyde generated during oxidative stress, in RVF. Increased 4HNE downregulates
CPSF6, inducing 3' UTR shortening in profibrotic genes and promoting RV fibrosis. The proposed research aims
to investigate these mechanisms and identify therapeutic targets for mitigating RV fibrosis. Our hypothesis posits
that CPSF6 depletion shortens the 3' UTRs of ECM genes, causing their escape from regulation, promoting their
expression, and leading to RV fibrosis. Specifically, we will: Investigate the impact of CPSF6 loss on the 3' UTR
landscape and profibrotic gene expression in RVF (Specific Aim 1). Uncover the mechanism underlying CPSF6
reduction-dependent 3' UTR shortening in CFs and its functional consequences in RVF (Specific Aim 2). Assess
the impact of ALDH2 restoration on alleviating RV fibrosis through CPSF6 regulation (Specific Aim 3).
The validation of our hypotheses and the completion of these aims will highlight the importance of 3' UTR
shortening in ECM deposition and fibrosis in RVF, potentially guiding the development of therapeutic
interventions. Given the limited treatment options and severe consequences of PH, our research holds significant
promise for improving public health."

The massive global pandemic with high morbidity and mortality makes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) one of the deadliest viruses in recent history. It is especially noteworthy for hijacking the normal operations of human cells. To develop effective therapies, we need a better understanding of the mechanisms that permit the virus to invade cells and evade host immune restriction. SARS-CoV-2 encodes the non-structural protein (nsp)16/nsp10 protein complex that transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to 2’-OH of the first transcribing nucleotide of the viral mRNA and thus converts the Cap-0 (m7GpppA) to Cap-1 (m7GpppAm). The resulting viral mRNA mimics host cell’s mRNA. In this way, a cell cannot distinguish between its own RNA and that of the virus. This modification of the virally encoded mRNA not only tricks the immune system and helps the virus to take over the host translation machinery for synthesis of its own proteins for survival and propagation. Ablation of nsp16 activity should trigger an immune response to viral infection and limit pathogenesis. Our recent paper in Nature Communications described atomic level details of the nsp16/nsp10 complex and how the enzyme is well adapted to bind the RNA cap and exert the 2’-OH methylation. We also discovered a distant pocket (located 25Å away from the catalytic center) in nsp16 that is unique to SARS-CoV-2. We also found that this pocket in nsp16 is partially composed of amino acids that are unique to SARS-CoV-
2. It can bind small molecules outside of the catalytic center. We propose to build a long-term research program aimed at deciphering the factors crucial to the maintenance of RNA genome and evasion from the host’s immune response. Our studies will reveal basic principles underlying SARS-CoV-2 RNA cap modification, the mode of nucleoprotein (NP) assembly, interplay with mRNA, and new approaches for therapeutic targeting. In Aim 1, we will resolve a series of new structures of nsp16/nsp10 proteins captured in every step of the methyl transfer by X-ray crystallography. The structural data will be validated by detailed biochemical and biophysical studies. We will resolve the biochemical and structural determinants of the assembly of viral RNA capping machinery, and identify factors underlying integrity of RNA genome. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel molecular tool to study temporal distribution of the RNA methylation during viral infection. We will examine new models for combinatorial inhibition of viral proteins by drug repurposing or novel small molecules. These small molecules will also be tested against other viruses, such as Ebola, Lassa, and MPox, for their broad utility as pan-antivirals. Finally, we will use our recently established reverse genetics approaches based on the use of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate recombinant (r)SARS-CoV2 containing mutations in nsp16 to determine their contribution in viral replication in cultured cells and pathogenesis in vivo using our recently described K18 human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)."

Uterine fibroids are the most prevalent noncancerous growths that form within the female body, present in 70 -
80% of women by age 50, and may result in severe pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, infertility, and preterm labor.
Uterine fibroids are characterized by stiff, collagen-dense masses of tissue that exhibit a large degree of
heterogeneity in terms of size, location, gross architecture, and composition, however, the mechanisms by which
uterine fibroids initially form and grow are poorly understood. As such, current treatments are limited, relying
primarily on surgical means of removal, which are associated with high recurrence rates. To address key
knowledge gaps in the literature, this proposal will take a multifaceted, engineering-based approach to
investigate uterine fibroid pathophysiology ex vivo and in vitro. I hypothesize that the altered mechanical
microenvironment of uterine fibroids highlights underlying structural and compositional changes to the tissue,
which in tum alters cell signaling pathways, namely mechanotransduction. In Aim 1, I seek to study the spatial
variation in mechanical, structural, and compositional properties of small, medium, and large fibroids at the
myometrium interface ex vivo to establish a categorization scheme for fibroids of all sizes. I expect uterine fibroids
to exhibit increased stiffness and collagen content relative to patient-matched myometrium, regardless of fibroid
size, demonstrating a significant degree of intra- and inter-fibroid variability with a sharp transition in material
properties at the interface. This data will be foundational in the development of a novel endoscope for improved
intrauterine detection and for drug delivery assessments. In Aim 2, I seek to elucidate the pathophysiology of
uterine fibroids on the cellular level and quantitatively assess the role of mechanotransduction through targeted
modulation in vitro. Specifically, I hypothesize that uterine smooth muscle cells (uSMCs) derived from fibroids
will exhibit reduced responsiveness to different substrate stiffnesses and overexpression of focal adhesion
kinase (FAK), a key mechanotransductive molecule, when compared to myometrial uSMCs. I further hypothesize
that FAK inhibition of fibroid uSMCs will alter the cell behavior in such a way as to mimic the healthy myometrial
phenotype. As such, this study will establish the validity of FAKi as a novel pharrnacologic treatment of uterine
fibroids. In summary, given our team's strong expertise in soft tissue biomechanics, mechanobiology, materials
science, ultrastructural imaging, and gynecologic health, the proposed study will generate foundational data in
the characterization of uterine fibroid heterogeneity and the mechanisms by which fibroids develop and grow.
Henceforth, I plan to leverage these findings in future work to develop clinically translatable diagnostic tools and
treatment approaches for uterine fibroids."

The number of people who qualify for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) genetic testing has outpaced
the number of genetic counselors qualified to provide these services in the United States. Due to this increase,
non-genetics professionals are increasingly ordering testing, with genetic counselors meeting patients/clients
only after test results are available - a shift from the traditional model of seeing clients for both pre- and posttest
counseling. The overall objectives of the proposed research are to characterize the content and process
of HBOC post-test genetic counseling when it is preceded by pre-test counseling with a genetic counselor versus
not (F99). observationally assess differences in client outcomes when HBOC post-test counseling is preceded
by pre-test counseling with a genetic counselor versus not (F99). and iteratively develop a novel. evidence-based
genetic counselor communication skills training program for improving HBOC post-test genetic counseling (KOO).
Effective genetic counseling is critical for ensuring clients understand key information about their genetic test
results, subsequent health management recommendations, and that they are equipped to begin psychologically
adapting to these results. The strength of the client-counselor therapeutic relationship is associated with better
psychological outcomes, including better quality of life, satisfaction with care, and decreased symptoms of
depression. Although effective communication is considered a key component of the genetic counseling process,
no research has sought to observe whether post-test counseling communication is associated with client
outcomes. Additionally, potential differences in client outcomes have not been assessed when post-test
counseling is preceded by pre-test counseling versus when it is not preceded. Without pre-test counseling, there
are fewer points of clinical contact to establish a therapeutic relationship, and therefore the relationship may be
weaker when post-test counseling is not preceded by pre-test counseling (thus potentially decreasing the quality
of care). Grounded in patient-centeredness frameworks for cancer communication and care, this proposal
seeks to understand whether there are differences in client outcomes. including client perceptions of genetic
counseling communication. the therapeutic relationship. psychological well-being. efficacy for follow-up.

counseling and optimize post-test counseling interactions to meet the needs of clients and support their wellbeing.
To optimally facilitate a therapeutic relationship, it is critical to understand the effect of providing post-test
genetic counseling with and without pre-test counseling. My long-term research goal is to sustainably improve
H BOC genetic counseling to meet the needs of clients and adapt to the changing landscape of precision
medicine. This research directly addresses NCI scientific priorities and Cancer Moonshot initiatives, and the

 Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, over 540,000
Americans survive with treatment, making it the 4th leading diagnosis of cancer survivors.1,2 Surveillance is an
essential part of survivorship care to detect recurrent disease and/or a second primary lung cancer, monitor
treatment toxicity, reinforce smoking cessation, and manage patient fear of potential recurrence.3,4 Given
recent advances in lung cancer treatment, the number of new lung cancer patients needing surveillance care is
expected to increase faster than for any other cancer with 20% more lung cancer survivors eligible for
surveillance in 2022 than the decade prior.2 Indeed, the importance of research to improve cancer surveillance
was recognized by the Institute of Medicine as a “top 25 priority” for comparative effectiveness research.5
 Consensus surveillance guidelines recommend surveillance visits, with a chest computed tomography (CT)
and symptom review, every 6 months for the first 2 years following resection and, then, yearly thereafter.
Unfortunately, only 26% of patients receive the guideline-recommended CT and 39% are lost to all
follow-up after lung cancer resection.9-11 Patients have identified numerous barriers to surveillance visits,
including travel distance, time away from work, cost, and inconvenience to family members, factors that
disproportionately affect minority and low income populations, and may exacerbate disparities.12
 However, signs and symptoms of recurrence can be gathered from patients and caregivers using remote
assessments of Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs), such as the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement
Information System (PROMIS), developed at our institution13-24 and travel and time barriers can be mitigated by
telehealth.25 However, use of PROs and telehealth for cancer surveillance remains poorly optimized. In
2019, our group implemented a REmote Telehealth User-Reported caNcer Surveillance (RETURNS) that uses
PROMIS instruments to remotely elicit select signs and symptoms,13-24 asynchronous review of electronically
submitted chest CT scans, followed by a telehealth visit. Preliminary data demonstrate considerable patient
enthusiasm for surveillance using telehealth, high degree of provider engagement, and economic feasibility.26
Nevertheless, “one size does not fit all” and it is, therefore, important to determine which patients are
appropriate candidates for remote PRO assessment and a telehealth visit. To do so, we will assess “end”
user (patients, caregivers, lung cancer clinicians) perspectives, at five diverse hospitals, to inform a user-
centered design of a Decision Aid to guide appropriate patient selection for RETURNS and to optimize the
delivery of RETURNS. Finally, we will evaluate the effect of RETURNS on patient and provider satisfaction and
its potential to improve adherence to surveillance guidelines, reduce surveillance disparities, and reduce
patient and healthcare system costs. The proposal aligns with NOT-HS-16-015 and will provide fundamental
information to facilitate appropriate, equitable, patient-centered, surveillance care for cancer survivors."
11192951,"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) inflicts a significant healthcare burden and high rate of mortality in the U.S.
Current treatment options can slow the rate of lung function decline, but the five-year survival remains low,
therefore there is clear unmet medical needs for novel therapeutics. Here, human genetics can catalyze drug
development process by identifying new biological targets and elucidating the underlying pathways. As a rare
polygenic disorder, however, IPF poses challenges to existing disease gene-mapping strategies due to the
extensive locus heterogeneity and difficulty of assembling massive sample sizes typical of common polygenic
disorders. This project aims to develop more effective gene-mapping methods for rare polygenic disorders
such as IPF. Our approach is motivated by three complementary strategies for small genetic studies: (i)
pleiotropy-informed SNP association tests, which can be extended to take advantage of the pleiotropy of
disease SNPs with gene expression traits and to further boost power by accounting for the network
connectivity to known disease genes; (ii) Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS), which can be highly useful for rare
disorders by capturing the effect of disease modifiers in the genetic background; and (iii) highly modular
network structure of disease genes, which can be leveraged to reduce genetic heterogeneity among cases. In
Aim 1, by extending a pleiotropy-informed association test we had previously proposed, we will develop a new
network model-based association test informed by pleiotropy to gene expression traits. We will apply this
method to publicly available IPF GWAS data and expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) of IPF-relevant
tissues and cell populations. In Aim 2, we will develop a new rare-variant association test directly accounting
for the contribution of genetic background using PRS. We will apply the new method to sequencing data of
~1,500 IPF cases and ~15,000 unaffected controls from CGS-PF and TOPMed studies. In Aim 3, we will
identify novel IPF genes by leveraging the association between disease gene modules and comorbidities.
Known IPF genes are clustered in multiple tightly inter-connected gene modules in biological networks, and
mutations disrupting each network modules cause a distinct set of comorbidities in IPF patients. We will
leverage the modularity of IPF genes and comorbidity to find novel IPF genes in exome data of UK Biobank
and MGB Biobank. In reverse, we also will test if genotypes of key IPF gene modules can inform the course of
comorbidity development in patients by inviting 10 CGS-PF study participants to a reverse genetics study.
Ultimately, the findings from these studies will uncover novel genes and pathways underlying IPF and develop
new computational strategies generally applicable to rare polygenic disorders."
11191065,"Abstract. Pain is the clinical hallmark of sickle cell disease (SCD), yet pain management remains inadequate
for many in this population due to lack of evidence-based pain treatment approaches for SCD, and due to
stigma and implicit bias in the healthcare system. Black adolescents and young adults (AYAs, ages 16-30) with
SCD are particularly vulnerable as they endure repeat hospitalizations due to pain crises while coping with
stigma and related stressors, as well as the other challenges of transitioning to adulthood. Opioids are the
primary agent used in chronic SCD pain management, despite evidence that they provide poor long-term relief
and lead to negative physical and psychological consequences. Psychosocial interventions that teach cognitive
and behavioral strategies can simultaneously reduce pain and stigma and enhance mood in patients with SCD.
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the primary behavioral health approach to managing pain in the general
population, and digital CBT has expanded its accessibility. In SCD and other minority populations, we have
demonstrated that a low-cost, scalable, technology-delivered version of CBT is feasible and can be effective
for addressing stress and pain. We have learned that personalized support can improve engagement with
digital CBT. We will now test a personalized approach customized for AYAs with SCD using peer support
delivered through community-based organizations (CBOs). We will conduct a multisite, randomized controlled
trial of digital CBT to understand the level of support needed to achieve benefits for reducing pain and stigma.
Our Peer suppoRt for adolescents and Emerging adults with Sickle cell pain: promoting ENgagement in
Cognitive behavioral thErapy (PRESENCE) study aims to reduce pain, opioid use, and healthcare utilization
among AYAs with SCD. During the UG3 phase, we will leverage an established infrastructure for delivering
virtual peer support interventions, existing digital CBT programs tailored by and for people with SCD, and
partnerships with CBOs to jointly refine the study design, digital CBT content, and peer support component and
work with the HEAL ERN CCC and DCC to prepare for the UH3 trial. After meeting UG3 milestones and
transitioning to the UH3 phase, we will randomize 470 AYAs with frequent pain (³4 days/wk) over the past ³3
months to one of 3 treatment groups: 1) a digital CBT program with weekly one-on-one peer support provided
via text and/or telephone based on participant preference (CBT+peer), 2) the same digital CBT program
without peer support (self-guided CBT), or 3) usual care (UC). We first hypothesize that AYAs receiving either
digital CBT treatment (CBT+ peer or self-guided CBT) will have better pain and mental health outcomes than
AYAs receiving UC at 6 months. Second, we hypothesize that CBT+peer will be associated with improved
program engagement and pain and mental health outcomes at 6 months compared with self-guided CBT. The
PRESENCE trial will determine effectiveness of digital CBT for pain management among AYAs with SCD, a
critical step toward future wide-scale deployment as part of routine SCD care."

Asthma is a lung disease caused by exaggerated lung inflammation leading to airway obstruction and
compromised airflow. Despite significant advances in its diagnosis and treatment, asthma continues to be a
significant health problem affecting more than 25 million patients in the US, and over 300 million around the
world. Well-characterized sex and gender differences in asthma have been reported, with changes in morbidity
throughout life. Starting around puberty and peaking during mid-life, women have increased asthma prevalence
and higher rates of asthma exacerbations than men. Causes of these disparities remain unclear; however,
studies have shown that sex-specific inflammatory mechanisms controlled by hormones contribute to differences
in airway reactivity in response to environmental stimuli. Despite this, experimental models of asthma have not
explored the contributions of sex hormones to inflammatory mechanisms in the female and male lung, and no
studies have explored the effects of feminizing hormone therapy with estrogen in the lungs of trans women. Prior
studies from our laboratory using mouse models have reported sex differences and influences of the estrous
cycle and circulating sex hormones in the inflammatory response to environmental exposures. Based on these
findings, we hypothesized that female sex hormones, specifically estrogens, contribute to asthma phenotypes
in the lung via activation of inflammatory mechanisms mediated by estrogen receptors. In the proposed study,
we will test this hypothesis by determining the mechanisms by which estrogen mediates sex and gender
influences in asthma. In Aim 1, we will determine the contributions of sex chromosome complement (XX vs. XY)
vs. gonadal hormones in asthma phenotypes, by developing a mouse house dust mite (HDM) asthma model on
the four core genotypes (FCG) model. In Aim 2, we will study the contributions of estrogens to HDM-induced
asthma outcomes using male and female gonadectomized mice treated with estradiol, as well as bronchial
epithelial cells from male and female healthy and asthma patients to exposed to HDM in the presence/absence
of estrogen receptor agonists/antagonists. In Aim 3, we will determine the roles of nuclear (ER) and membrane-
bound (GPER-1) estrogen receptors in estrogen-mediated mechanisms of inflammation in HDM-induced
asthma, using ER and GPER1 knockout mice. Our studies will be the first to characterize estrogen-mediated
mechanisms of inflammation in asthma phenotypes in the male and female lung, contributing to the
characterization of sex- and gender-specific factors accounting for inter-individual differences, as well as the
effects of feminizing hormone therapy in lung pathobiology. We expect that our studies would serve to develop
potential sex- and gender-specific treatments and recommendations for dosage of therapeutic agents to treat
and prevent asthma in cis and transgender women."

The goal of this proposal is to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in alcohol seeking and reward-related
decision-making. Alcohol is the leading risk factor for premature death and disability for individuals between 15
and 49 years old, accounting for 3 million deaths worldwide yearly. Chronic alcohol consumption results in
escalated alcohol seeking and impaired reward-related decision-making, which are core factors in perpetuating
alcohol consumption. Mounting evidence supports a role for the gut microbiota in alcohol consumption. However,
the role of the gut microbiota in alcohol seeking and in reward-related decision-making have not been
systematically evaluated. Prebiotics, indigestible fibers that feed beneficial gut microbes, ameliorate alcohol-
induced damage to the intestinal lining, enhance cognition, and may reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms,
suggesting that prebiotics may comprise a treatment target for the behavioral impact of alcohol. Here, we will
use operant conditioning approaches in mouse models to dissect the role of the gut microbiota in alcohol seeking
and alcohol-induced changes in reward-related decision-making. Aim 1 is to determine the role of the gut
microbiota in alcohol seeking using prebiotics to alter the microbiota (Aim 1a) and fecal microbial transplant from
prebiotic-receiving donor mice to determine a causal role for the microbiota (Aim 1b). Aim 2 is to determine the
role of the gut microbiota in alcohol-induced changes in reward-related decision-making. To test this, mice will
perform a novel, multi-stage decision-making task that we adapted directly from a human task to assess reward-
related decision-making using computational modeling. Mice will receive prebiotics (Aim 2a) or fecal transplant
from prebiotic receiving donors (Aim 2b) to determine whether prebiotics ameliorate alcohol-induced changes in
decision-making, and whether these effects are mediated by the gut microbiota. The profile of the gut microbiome
will be assessed using metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics to determine what aspects of behavior,
intestinal permeability, and inflammation correlate with the gut microbiota. Completion of these aims will test the
feasibility of mitigating alcohol seeking and decision-making impairments by manipulating the gut microbiota
using a putative alternative treatment target and determine whether the gut microbiota play a causal role.
Dr. Thompson’s main career goal is to investigate the potential of the gut microbiota to provide alternative
treatment options for psychiatric disorders. The proposed aims will provide Dr. Thompson with crucial training,
research experience, and data that will advance this career goal. Dr. Thompson’s integrated mentorship team is
comprised of experts in addiction models, clinical and translational alcohol research, host-microbe interactions,
and computational modeling of decision-making, ensuring successful completion of the research and training
aims. Dr. Thompson will expand this mentored training through didactic and technical coursework and
professional development activities. Together, the proposed experiments and training will prepare Dr. Thompson
for an independent career investigating the role of the gut microbiota in psychiatric disorders."

Obesity is a serious public health concern, largely because obesity and related disorders (e.g., cardiovascular
disease, type II diabetes, hypertension, cancers, etc.) add more than $200 billion annually to US health care
costs. The current clinical paradigm for obesity is one of energy intake versus energy expenditure, with clinical
management focused on diet and exercise. Diet and exercise are important factors in obesity, particularly the
energy dense Western dietary pattern, but they do not fully account for the obesity epidemic. US adults were
2.3 kg/m2 higher in BMI in 2006 than in 1988, even at comparable caloric intake and energy expenditure.
Emerging evidence supports an important role for exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs)in
obesity. We identified tributyltin (TBT) as an environmental “obesogen” - a chemical that leads to weight gain,
in vivo. In utero exposure to environmentally-relevant levels of TBT increased fat depot weight, reprogrammed
mesenchymal stem cells to favor the adipogenic fate and caused non alcoholic fatty liver disease in F1-F4
male offspring. We reproduced these transgenerational phenotypes in two independent experiments and found
that male F4 descendents of F0 TBT-treated animals became obese when dietary fat was increased. This fat
persisted after the animals were returned to normal low fat chow. TBT-treated animals and their descendents
were resistant to fasting-induced fat loss, indicating that these animals do not mobilize fat to the same extent
as controls during fasting. We found that fat in F4 male descendants of TBT treated dams showed persistent
DNA hypomethylation in regions encompassing important metabolic genes such as the Lep gene, increased
leptin mRNA expression, elevated plasma leptin levels, and that these hypomethylated regions in fat were less
accessible in sperm chromatin of F3/F4 males. We proposed that these animals exhibited a transgenerational
""thrifty phenotype"" caused by altered chromatin structure and accessibility. We hypothesize that TBT exposure
modifies the epigenome across multiple generations, sensitizing animals to weight gain and that this “thrifty
phenotype” is revealed or exacerbated by increased dietary fat. Two specific aims are proposed: 1) How does
TBT exposure exacerbate the effects of “Total Western Diet” leading to weight gain?, and 2) How does TBT
exposure make animals resistant to fat loss? Answering these key questions will address knowledge gaps in
the field that are relevant to human health. The proposed research will reveal which molecular mechanisms
may underlie the effects of obesogens and how a Western dietary pattern interacts with obesogen exposure to
predispose toward fat gain and promote the transgenerational programming of obesity. This will greatly inform
the thinking of clinicians and the public in understanding individual susceptibility to obesity and how best it may
be treated and prevented in individuals. The successful completion of this research will illuminate the molecular
mechanisms underlying the role of xenobiotic chemicals on obesity, and may provide insights into how the
obesity epidemic can be curtailed."
11191198,"ABSTRACT
The Hawaii Clinical Research Network for Health Equity (HICRN-HE) proposed 2 pilot projects
involving non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now more recently called metabolic
dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) using transient elastrography (TE)
[‘FibroScan’], a noninvasive ultrasound technique that can provide measurements of both liver
fat and fibrosis in a one-step evaluation. These 2 projects targeted urban primary care
community settings on the Island of Oahu where our medical school is located with the goal to
assess its relationship to social determinants of health and to see if FibroScan assessments
should be part of standard of care within primary care settings. This Administrative Supplement
application now proposes to expand the study to the rural neighbor islands – specifically to the
Big Island of Hawaii, Kauai and Molokai. We propose to increase the current target sample of
878 participants to an additional 600 participants – 200 at each site. In expanding the sample
size of the 2 projects, we seek to expand the study both from our current urban emphasis to
Hawaii’s rural population (our ‘neighbor’ islands) and to capture broadly the representative
ethnic diversity of the population in Hawaii. We will be able to obtain a more complete
understanding of the relationship between social determinants of health and NAFLD, and
whether ‘point of care’ testing with FibroScans should be advocated as a public health policy."
11047624,"Sudden Death in the Young (SDY) is a tragic event with longstanding impact on families and communities. Although the causes of SDY are myriad, sudden unexpected infant death (SUID), sudden cardiac death and sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) are three examples that have inspired public health efforts at prevention. Yet fundamental gaps in knowledge about incidence, mechanisms, and risk factors for SDY limit the identification of effective prevention efforts.

The Sudden Death in the Young (SDY) Case Registry is a collaboration between the National Institutes of Health (the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(NINDS)) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It was designed to address critical knowledge gaps in the epidemiology and causes of SDY and develop a resource for research that will enhance the evidence base to inform prevention efforts. The SDY Case Registry is the first prospective, population-based surveillance program that can comprehensively identify and gather data and DNA on cases of SDY in a large geographic area in the United States. Data can be used to determine the incidence of SUID, sudden cardiac death in the young, SUDEP and other causes of pediatric sudden death.  The SDY Case Registry was first funded in 2013 and was built on the CDCs existing SUID Case Registry. The CDC leads surveillance efforts to identify 100% of cases of SDY in funded states/jurisdictions of the SDY Case Registry. To do this, they provide technical assistance to states/jurisdictions to increase case ascertainment and ensure consistent categorization of cases. NHLBI and NINDS focus on developing a resource for research on SDY by supporting collection of a comprehensive battery of phenotypic data elements and DNA samples to enable genomic analysis."
10878953,"TL1 Abstract: NRSA Training Core
The purpose of the Penn NRSA Training Core is to enhance training in clinical translational science (CTS) to
expedite the translation of scientific discovery into therapy and improve the quality of patient care. The mission
of our TL1 program is to (i) recruit and train a next generation of CTS investigators who are equipped with the
awareness, knowledge and skills necessary to successfully translate discoveries into clinical care, and (ii) to
prepare them for a range of research careers. Penn’s TL1 program is designed to attract, train and support a
diverse cohort of predoctoral trainees from graduate research programs (PhD, MD/PhD, VMD/PhD) and clinical
training programs (MD, VMD, DMD) as well as postdoctoral research scientists (PhD) and clinicians (MD, VMD,
DMD). Appointees enter their CTS training from various educational trajectories and with diverse expectations
and career aspirations; for this reason the Penn TL1 is flexible and inclusive of cross-disciplinary coursework
and/or completion of a graduate-level certificate or Master’s degree. Appointment durations vary between one
year for predoctoral appointees and either one or 2-3 years for postdoctoral appointees. Predoctoral trainees will
complete the TL1 with a solid understanding of the discipline and core competencies for performing CTS
research. Postdoctoral trainees will have demonstrated CTS research independence in the form of publication
in peer-reviewed literature, appointment to a mentored career development award or other independent grant
funding and an academic or industry appointment with continued substantial engagement in CTS. Coupled with
a dedicated mentoring program and a robust diversity and inclusion effort, the objectives of the TL1 program are
based on the following:
1. (i) Continue to provide a comprehensive curriculum in discovery-, entrepreneurial-, and regulatory science,
translational therapeutics, and biomedical informatics; (ii) expand coursework to include data- and
implementation science, investigational pharmacy, and health care innovation; and (iii) continue to increase the
awareness of CTS training opportunities to recruit high caliber trainees.
2. (i) Continue development efforts on professional skills training, and (ii) add programs to support postdoctoral
trainees at points of transition and prepare postdoctoral PhDs for diverse career paths.
3. Develop skills-based workshops and labs for all TL1 trainees that are responsive to real-time innovations in
science, shifting health priorities and rapidly evolving learner needs.
4. Expand opportunities for pre- and postdoctoral trainees to immerse themselves in projects at the academic-
industry interface through the creation of shared training programs so that they may partake in real-world
scenarios of innovation being reduced to practice.

10834186,"Background: Black adolescent females are at increased risk for obesity-related morbidity and mortality as adults compared to non-Hispanic White adolescent females. Few interventions to prevent obesity in Black adolescent females have leveraged the relationship of the daughter/mother dyad. Studies that include mothers tend to use-theoretical frameworks that do not explicitly build on this important relationship and have not included mothers’ active participation. Additionally, these studies do not include girls older than 12 years. In response, we developed Black Girls Move, a school-linked obesity prevention intervention that addresses these limitations in the extant literature.
Method: This pilot randomized controlled trial examines the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of Black Girls Move (BGM), a 12-week obesity prevention intervention. Within four schools, 96 dyads will be randomized to either BGM or daughters-only comparison condition (DOCC) (12 per condition). All daughter/mother dyads (BGM and DOCC) complete self-report measures (i.e., PA, diet, family theoretical measures, racial identity, daughter/mother relationship, social cognitions) at baseline, post-intervention, and 3-months post-intervention. BGM incorporates content and processes derived from Public Health Critical Race Praxis, Family Systems Theory, and Social Cognitive Theory. Specific aims are to determine the feasibility of BGM compared to DOCC on change in PA and dietary intake, and the impact of BGM compared to daughters-only on racial identity, daughter/mother relationship, and social cognitions.
Implications: Our long-term goal is to decrease disparities in obesity and associated co-morbidities in Black women. The findings may inform a Phase III efficacy trial of BGM in Black daughter/mother dyads."
11002457,"Oral cavity-related cancers account for 53,000 cases and 10,860 deaths in the United States annually. The most common type is oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We have identified an epigenetic regulator, Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), upregulated in dysplasia and progression to malignant phenotype leading to OSCC. We showed that LSD1 attenuation inhibits patient-derived xenograft, EGFR and YAP signaling critical in OSCC. Recent preliminary studies showed that conditional LSD1 deletion in the tongue epithelium during dysplasia reduced invasive pathological lesions, downregulated EGFR, YAP-induced signaling network, and Pd- L1 expression. Interestingly, LSD1 inhibition attenuates IL-6-JAK-STAT3 novel signaling identified in two independent studies: 1) proteomics analysis of Lsd knockout mice preneoplasia and 2) single-cell RNAseq analysis using LSD1 inhibitor. Of note, IL-6-JAK-STAT3 is a specific target in breast and other cancer stem cells and immune cells. This indicates that LSD1 promoted the IL-6-JAK-STAT3 pathway, and stem cells and immune cells could be drivers of dysplasia to OSCC. We hypothesize that 1) LSD1 upregulation during dysplasia reprograms oral tissue to invasive phenotype by acting on IL6 -signaling and induced cell types and 2) pharmacological attenuation of LSD1 reset epigenome to reverse progressive malignant preneoplasia to a noninvasive phenotype. The specific aims are 1) to determine if LSD1 collaborates with YAP to promote IL6- JAK-STAT3 network-induced invasive phenotype in preneoplasia a) to determine if LSD1 collaborates with YAP to promote IL6-JAK-STAT3 network-induced invasive phenotype in preneoplasia is syngenic and humanized PDX mouse models. b) evaluate if LSD1 reprograms preneoplasia by acting directly on H3K4me2 or H3K9me2 at STAT3, YAP, and PD-L1 promoters or indirectly through YAP/ LSD1-PD-L1 feed-forward loop to promote invasive phenotype. Aim 2 is to determine pharmacological LSD1 inhibition reverse preneoplasia by inhibiting IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling-induced cancer stem and immune cells. We will determine if LSD1 inhibitor sensitizes clinical preneoplasia to Nivolumab in humanized PDX mice. Successful completion of the proposed project is expected to identify the mechanism by which LSD1 promotes preneoplasia via the IL6-JAK-STAT3 network or alternate pathway in genetic and clinically relevant animal models. Next, it is expected to identify if clinical anti- PD1 therapy could provide resistance to preneoplasia by inefficient blockade of LSD1 and LSD1-dependent feed-forward-loop. Overall, we expect to determine if resistant preneoplasia could be sensitized by the addition of LSD1 inhibitor."
11194543,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers in the US. Most lung cancers are not 
diagnosed until after the cancer has already metastasized; stage IV patients have 5-year survival rate of only 
8.2%. While in the past stage IV patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common 
histology, were treated with chemotherapy, in recent years novel systemic therapies, such as targeted therapy 
and immunotherapy, have been introduced and have substantially changed the landscape of late stage lung 
cancer outcomes. Early-stage, surgical patients have been shown to benefit from adjuvant targeted therapy as 
well. Targeted therapies work by inhibiting specific molecular pathways, the most commonly targeted of which 
is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase pathway. The anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK), KRAS, and BRAF pathways are other targetable oncogenic pathways. These novel therapies require 
genetic testing as a basis for treatment to ensure that a druggable target is present, as not all tumors present 
themselves with target mutations. About 30% of NSCLC patients will be eligible. Immunotherapies, specifically 
drugs that inhibit the protein 1–programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1–PD-L1) pathway, can also substantially 
improve survival in a subset of NSCLC patients, but are usually prescribed to only those patients with a high 
PD-1 tumor mutational burden (TMB). Preliminary evidence suggests that utilization of novel target therapies 
and immunotherapy is disproportionately different according to race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status, which 
may partially explain the disparate survival outcomes in these groups of patients. More specifically, Black 
NSCLC patients may be less likely to receive molecular testing compared to White patients, making them less 
likely to access targeted treatments. However, no studies have yet to investigate the prevalence of oncogenic 
panel testing, meaningful for both targeted or immunotherapy treatment, in a population-based dataset such as 
SEER-Medicare, overall and according to race and access to quality care. To address this critical research 
gap, we propose the following aims: Aim 1a) Use SEER-Medicare claims data to investigate the prevalence of 
molecular tests among Black vs White advanced NSCLC patients. Aim 1b) Investigate how NSLC genetic 
testing varies by urban vs rural clinical practice. We hypothesize that molecular testing is significantly less 
likely to be performed among Black and rural NSCLC patients. This project will give important information on 
one of the main reasons for the high mortality observed in minority and minoritized NSCLC patients, while 
offering an opportunity for training in health disparities research, statistical analysis of large datasets, analysis 
and interpretation of genetic data. Thus the proposed aims of this supplement complement well the scope and 
mission of the original parent grant which is to expand capacity in genetics and genomic cancer research."
10933323,"PROJECT SUMMARY: SHARED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) Shared Resources Management (SRM) provides critical
oversight of all the Sylvester Shared Resources (SRs), ensuring ready access to cost-effective, state-of-the-art
research instruments and services. SRM aims to 1) establish, evaluate, maintain, improve, and expand the
SRs; 2) ensure the SRs provide high-quality services and promote research rigor and reproducibility; 3)
facilitate implementation of innovative new SR services; and 4) support the education and training of Sylvester
members, trainees, and staff. With highly qualified leaders and staff, SRM ensures that the SRs are efficiently
operated, effectively advance collaborative and translational research, and successfully implement new
technologies and services. SRM enables the SRs to offer coordinated support for transdisciplinary research by
leveraging the high level of expertise, advanced technologies, and comprehensive array of SR services for
Onco-Genomics (OGSR), Flow Cytometry (FCSR), Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (BBSR), Cancer Modeling
(CMSR), Biospecimen (BSSR), and Behavioral and Community-Based Research (BCSR). SRM supports the
SRs in providing seminars, workshops, and training to optimize the use of SRs by members, trainees, and
staff. SRM performs a continuous review process that evaluates usage, operations, finances, and impact of the
SRs, and enables member feedback to ensure that SR capabilities align with Sylvester's Strategic Plan and
with member and catchment area needs. During the current reporting period (6/1/2018-5/31/2023), Sylvester
recruited George Grills as Associate Director Shared Resources, to provide expert oversight of the SRs and to
oversee SR improvement and growth, with input from SR Faculty Advisory Committees and Sylvester's
Scientific Steering Committee. SRM supported the growth of two developing SRs (CMSR and BSSR);
facilitated the implementation of 19 major instruments across three SRs (OGSR, FCSR, and CMSR); and
managed expansion in SR staffing (from 54 to 7 4 personnel) that was needed to match the increase in the
scale and scope of SR services. SRM supported the SRs in providing services to 83% (123 members) of the
current 148 members. Members comprised 84% of SR usage as measured by revenue, reflecting the critical
importance of the SRs to members' research. Each SR was used by all Research Programs. SRM facilitated
the SRs' support of 334 cancer-related publications by members, with 29% (98 publications) in high-Impact
journals (JIF ~10); 227 cancer-related grant awards to members, including 31 NCI awards; and 108 cancer-related
clinical research studies (75 by members). Aligned with the 2024-2028 Sylvester Strategic Plan's goals,
SRM future plans are to 1) implement emerging technologies and innovative services in existing SRs; 2)
establish new developing SRs and capabilities; 3) expand integrated multi-SR services; 4) enhance SR
support of population science and translational research; and 5) expand SR support for data management and
analysis of large-scale datasets to further meet the needs of the catchment area."

10991245,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cascade of brain changes involved in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) starts many years before diagnosis, 
suggesting that earlier interventions will be more successful. Alzheimer’s tau pathology follows a predictable 
path through the brain, starting with ‘pretangle’ tau in a small brainstem nucleus called the locus coeruleus 
decades before any diagnosis. Despite its small size, the locus coeruleus controls many aspects of activity in 
the brain and body. It is the brain’s arousal hub region, integrating all sorts of signals about arousal (e.g., 
wakefulness, emotion, novelty, stress) and shaping cortical activity to match current demands. Phasic bursts of 
LC activity promote synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and help make novel and emotional events 
memorable. However, during periods of on-going stress or anxiety, the LC fires steadily (tonically), preventing 
phasic bursts. LC activity patterns may also determine the impact of tau pathology. In rats with pretangle tau in 
the LC, stimulating the LC steadily increases cell death while stimulating it intermittently reduces the memory 
impairment and structural degeneration caused by pretangle tau. These findings in rats used invasive 
procedures to stimulate the LC, but noninvasive methods, such as breathing, can also influence LC activity. In 
the current R01 revision, we propose adding a task assessing LC responses to novelty to a stage II doubleblinded randomized trial with Black and White American adults aged 50-70 to test whether daily sessions 
involving breathing at around the baroreflex frequency (~10 s per breath, known as resonance frequency 
breathing) affects LC function. The baroreflex provides a negative feedback loop to maintain blood pressure at 
nearly constant levels. Elevated blood pressure stretches mechanical baroreceptors in arterial walls which 
signal the brainstem, causing the heart rate to decrease and blood vessels to dilate. As part of this feedback 
loop, baroreceptor activity inhibits ongoing activity in the LC. Previous intervention studies have found that 
regular sessions of resonance frequency breathing over the course of several weeks can reduce blood 
pressure and improve baroreflex sensitivity. In the proposed study, we examine whether the practice can also 
shift LC activity to a less tonic, more phasic, pattern. In our 10-week intervention, we will randomize 
participants to either resonance-paced breathing or to a control breathing condition. We will have participants 
do a task (both before and after the intervention) in which LC function is associated with tau pathology. The 
task requires subjects to match faces to names. In this task, older adults exhibiting larger phasic responses to 
novel face-name pairs show less tau pathology in the entorhinal cortex, one of the first places tau tangles  
emerge when brainstem tau spreads to the cortex. We predict that the daily resonance frequency breathing will 
downregulate tonic LC activity, allowing phasic LC signals to emerge more effectively. We predict that daily 
resonance frequency breathing will improve LC phasic activity in both groups, but more so in Black than in 
White Americans, given that initial findings suggest greater age-related LC decline in Blacks."

This is an application for years 21-25 of NIDA's CTN Florida Node Alliance (FNA). The FNA covers Florida, Georgia and Puerto Rico, areas of the US that continue to suffer from high rates of drug overdoses and unceasing opioid, cocaine and methamphetamine epidemics. These areas have unmet treatment needs and experience disparities in the implementation of evidence-based treatments. The FNA aims to build on our record of success in leading and implementing trials in healthcare settings and integrating substance use into mainstream of healthcare. We propose to bring to the CTN the FNA's considerable expertise in adolescent treatment, the HIV and HCV care continua in substance-using populations, mental health comorbidities, e- Health, data science, culturalized science, health economics, training, implementation/dissemination, and work with Hispanic populations. The FNA's research agenda will provide scientific leadership to develop, test, and implement interventions for the full spectrum of substance use in adolescents and adults, and strategies for the integration of SU prevention/screening/treatment services into mainstream adolescent and adult health care. The FNA also aims to apply our expertise in implementation science, data science, and use of electronic health records (EHRs) to promote learning health care systems that build on precision medicine principles by implementing and refining methods to predict individual response to treatment. Building on a foundation of bidirectional collaboration, the FNA proposes to develop, test and implement interventions that address the service delivery continuum in the FNA's clinical and research networks. These networks consist of SUD treatment and general medical settings, health systems, clinical research networks, and practice-based research networks. To achieve its aims, the FNA is proposing an innovative research agenda of concepts that (1) integrate behavioral health and family focused interventions in pediatric care with the use of e-technologies, (2) deliver integrative models of care for comorbid SU and HIV in hospital settings, (3) address the comorbidities of mental health and stimulant use, (4) use EHR, registry and environmental data to improve treatment precision, and (5) use context and culture to improve treatment outcomes. The FNA proposes to collaborate with other Nodes on the design and implementation of CTN trials and by providing the infrastructure and capabilities required for successful study execution. FNA network partners have demonstrated experience in conducting point of care trials and studies that leverage the use of EHR and claims data. The University of Miami CTSI, University of Florida CTSI, and the Georgia CTSA, will bring to the CTN the bioinformatics tools of the CTSA National Consortium. These CTSAs together with partners of the FNA, facilitate access to a diverse patient population of 16+ million patients across a numerous settings such as primary care, EDs, hospitals, FQHCs, school-based clinics, SUD treatment and harm reduction venues. Some of the protocols within this project are part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis.

The WSN tests novel interventions that expand access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). The overarching goal of the WSN's competing renewal application is to conduct collaborative research within the CTN that fills gaps in the Addiction Care Cascade and thereby enhances the lives of people living with drug use disorders. Our Addiction Care Cascade-focused research agenda developed through conversations with diverse investigators and stakeholders including people who use drugs. Two research themes (medication trials and hybrid implementation trials to close gaps in the Addiction Care Cascade) provide four examples of CTN studies that could help close treatment gaps. In Research Theme 1 (medication trials), Medication Trial 1 targets people with OUD who are not interested in currently available MOUD and randomizes them to receive long acting oral hydromorphone versus facilitated referral methadone or buprenorphine to improve engagement and retention in treatment. Medication Trial 2 is a multisite phase 3 trial of mirtazapine versus placebo for people with methamphetamine use disorder to reduce methamphetamine use. In Research Theme 2 (hybrid implementation trials), two trials compare strategies to enhance engagement and retention on MOUD. Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial 1 is a cluster- randomized trial of telephonic + mHealth behavioral support services to improve retention on buprenorphine in primary care. Hybrid Effectiveness-Implementation Trial 2 tests a telementoring peer support intervention versus weekly peer supervision to improve peer success in engaging and retaining people who use drugs in treatment. We suffuse this research agenda with the Node's infrastructure and expertise in vulnerable populations, health systems, electronic health records research, data science and clinical trials management. WSN offers these resources to the CTN network for use in future CTN protocols. Finally, WSN continues to use the CTN as a platform for training, dissemination, and research applications. Some of the protocols within this project are part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction."

11180642,"This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe. In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices.

11184653,"ABSTRACT Despite progress in the development of population-specific innovations and culturally-tailored interventions, disparities in access, receipt, use, and quality of health care delivery persist for populations that have historically been underserved, underrepresented, and marginalized in dissemination and implementation (D&I) research. This is partially due to a need for consistent language, methods, and data elements for characterizing determinants of health inequities and disparities in D&I research, which often vary based on population or issue studied. In addition, we lack systematic tools for identifying and mapping population- specific and culturally-relevant determinants onto existing implementation constructs (e.g., inner setting, innovation characteristics). The parent grant (U2CDA057717), the Research Adoption Support Center for the Helping to End Addiction Long-term® (HEAL) Data2Action (HD2A) Program, aims to increase the D&I capability of opioid use disorder and pain management treatment research. This supplement seeks to develop and validate a health equity taxonomy using mixed methods (i.e., stakeholder engagement, machine learning). The proposal breaks new ground in the D&I field by leveraging domain expertise (i.e., D&I and health equity/health disparities) and machine learning (ML) to develop and validate a taxonomy that will serve to prioritize the needs of those impacted by health disparities and inequities, articulate culturally-relevant and population-specific determinants known to influence implementation, and heighten researchers’ ability to assess which health equity issues are being addressed in D&I research and efforts. Specific aims include: 1) Develop and validate a taxonomy that serves to assess equity-focused D&I efforts; 2) Build, fine-tune, and evaluate topic models (i.e., unsupervised machine learning models) using off-the-shelf topic modeling algorithm tools to identify, extract, and describe the most important topics in a sample of HEAL research abstracts that address underserved populations; 3) Integrate taxonomy with topic modeling results via rapid feedback with a Board of Domain Experts and the Mentorship Team. The third aim involves collaborating with the Board of Domain Experts, including stakeholders, and the candidate’s mentorship team to 1) assess taxonomy completeness by comparing and contrasting taxonomy categories with themes uncovered via topic modeling, and 2) evaluate consistency between the taxonomy and uncovered topics in terms of co-occurrence and distribution of topics across categories. The candidate will refine the taxonomy categories based on feedback from the Board of Domain Experts and return to members for a final review. Results from this project will inform the development of a centralized public use product that can be utilized by future HD2A studies to assess key determinants of D&I related to health equity.

10886714,"Invasive cell behavior is a component of normal (blastocyst implantation, extravasation) and pathogenic 
processes (metastasis, endometriosis), and is initiated by heterotypic contacts between cells. There is strong 
evidence, particularly in metastatic cancer, that gap junction (GJ) mediated intercellular coupling (GJIC) between 
the invading cells and target tissue plays a critical role. Yet gap junctions have not been studied in the most 
common invasive pathogenesis  endometriosis. Endometriosis is thought to arise through retrograde 
menstruation of endometrial tissue to the peritoneum (occurring in most women), but there is active debate as 
to whether the disease is due to changes in the endometrium (the seed) or a permissive peritoneal environment 
(the soil). Project 1 demonstrated a striking downregulation of GJ genes in stromal cells (ESCs), and an inverse 
upregulation in epithelial cells (EECs) that follows the progression of the disease, and could serve as a diagnostic. 
Here we show that ESCs from endometriosis patients are unique in showing a large induction of GJIC upon 
interaction with peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs). This heterotypic GJIC was critical for the ESC invasiveness 
by inducing a disruption of the barrier function of the mesothelium. Conversely, PMCs also selectively affect 
ESCs from endometriosis patients by triggering Cx43 assembly into GJs, and by inducing a Mesenchymal to 
Epithelial Transition (MET). These results lend strong support the seed hypothesis. 
 The current proposal builds on these results within the collaborative environment of a P01 that will allow a 
comprehensive analysis of how intercellular interactions in endometriosis lead to lesion formation. This will 
include understanding: (a) How GJ, and related adhesive genes, are regulated in endometriosis (Project 1); (b) 
how ESCs and PMCs initially recognize and stably adhere to one another (Project 3), leading to GJ formation, 
and; (c) how these GJs induce both modification of the PMC barrier function and promote ESC invasive behavior 
(Project 2). The goals of Project 2 will be achieved through three aims: 
Aim 1: Establish what functions of Cx43 are important for initiating invasiveness (i.e. GJIC, hemichannels, 
protein scaffolds) (1.1) and identify the molecular changes induced in PMCs that disrupt barrier function (1.2).
Aim 2: Explore the converse effects of PMCs on endometriosis-derived ESCs by assessing if HA-CD44 
interactions (Proj. 3), or other signals, induce heterotypic GJ formation (2.1), exploring the dependence of 
molecular changes induced in ESCs by PMCs (e.g. MET) on heterotypic GJIC (2.2), and whether PMCs derived 
from the peritoneum of control or endometriosis patients (the soil) differ in the effects they elicit (2.3).
Aim 3: Validate the in vitro models for relevance to endometriotic lesion formation in a syngeneic mouse 
transplant model, exploring the roles of Cx43 in both endometrium (3.1) and peritoneal mesothelium (3.2). 
Results from Aims 1 and 2 will be guided by, and help inform, the genetic screens in Project 1, and cells isolated 
from lesions isolated in Aim 3 will be analyzed in Project 1, providing a direct comparison to patient samples.

10894930,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
This project proposes augmented reality eyeglasses that can be worn throughout the day by a person with 
Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing neurorehabilitation. The system enables (1) monitoring of and 
feedback to the patient during clinic visits, with provider-supervised physical therapy (PT) exercises, (2) 
display of immersive guidance and feedback to the patient during PT exercises at home that reference 
exercises supervised in the clinic, and (3) monitoring, analysis, and summarization of the patient’s activities 
of daily life (ADLs) between clinic visits, through cameras integrated into the eyeglasses and inertial 
sensors in shoes and wristbands. To develop such a system, we will advance the state-of-the-art in four 
research thrusts - egocentric tracking and reconstruction, egocentric visual perception, personalized 
reasoning models, and immersive analytics. In the first thrust, we will investigate the use of deep neural 
network architectures for highly accurate, clinically useful egocentric tracking and 3D reconstruction, 
enabling us to meaningfully record, playback, and evaluate rehabilitation activities. In the second thrust, we 
will develop a rich semantic understanding of contextualized activities using multimodal deep learning 
models that take into account short-term and long-term data from wearable inertial sensors and multiple 
egocentric cameras. In the third thrust, we will develop novel reasoning systems based on graphical 
models that leverage techniques such as partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to 
track and predict aspects of user performance during rehabilitation activities. In the fourth thrust, we will 
design an immersive analytics front-end interface that will integrate with our reasoning systems to provide 
customized user feedback and clinician summaries, enabling improved patient care. Developments across 
each of these thrusts will be integrated into an eyeglasses-based augmented reality system that will be 
iteratively evaluated and refined, first with able-bodied participants in a controlled lab setting, next with 
Parkinson’s patients in a clinical setting, then with able-bodied participants in home settings, and finally with 
Parkinson’s patients in their home environment."
11192462,"This proposal sets out to deliver a solution, EICON MULTIMODAL, that has three main objectives. Firstly, to facilitate access to multimodal clinical data in the public domain by providing a single Cloud-based multimodal search capability across a set of public domain Data Commons. Secondly, to enable healthcare and research organizations to integrate and harmonize their own clinical data into a unified Search Fabric and to adopt a Data Commons paradigm that enables their researchers to search across both public domain and in-house data in a single pass from our Cloud-based browser interface. As part of our security model, we will use the concept of a local ""punchout"" to keep browser-based in-house data and metadata within the user network and never send these data to the Cloud. Thirdly, to enable healthcare and hospital organizations who have aggregated their data using a Data Commons standard to participate in a marketplace for Real World Data. As part of this implementation, we will integrate EICON DEID, our clinical data de-identification solution, to address the data privacy issues inherent in sharing PHI-bearing data. For Phase I, we will develop a fully functional protptype to demonstrate a solution that meets the first two objectives. In Phase II, we will develop the prototype into a fully tested, validated, production-ready solution with full regulatory compliance, address the third objective, and deploy the solution into at least one research organization and one hospital. Our solution is targeted primarily at AI/ML development groups and will enable them to query, access and create cohorts of multimodal clinical data for use in training their models."
11146985,"Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly transformed the treatment of EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), their effectiveness is often limited by acquired drug resistance. In a significant portion of the cases, resistance arises without detectable mutations or changes in gene copy numbers, suggesting 
epigenetic mechanisms underlie resistance. Recent evidence indicates that the three-dimensional (3D) folding organization of the genome regulates the cancer cell epigenome, which can activate oncogenes, inactivate tumor suppressor genes, and promote metastasis and stemness. However, it remains unknown whether and how 3D genome alternations contribute to resistance to targeted therapies. To address this knowledge gap, we have developed a chromatin tracing strategy to visualize the 3D genome organization at the single-cell level in the native cancer tissue context. We applied this method to a reliable mouse model of LUAD driven by the oncogene 
Kras and identified characteristic alterations in the 3D genome during cancer development, including a notable structural bottleneck in LUAD progression. Moreover, we demonstrated that the 3D genome encodes distinct cancer states within individual cells and uncovers novel genetic dependencies in LUAD, highlighting the critical 
role of 3D genome reorganization in LUAD development. Based on these findings, we propose that structural changes in the 3D genome similarly mediate resistance to targeted therapies."
11187493,"Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is the major cause of death from colon cancer and is unresponsive to current approved immune checkpoint therapy. We have previously identified that tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of mCRCs are defined by high expression of the marker gene SPP1. These TAMs interact with fibroblasts and immune cells in the TME and generate a pro-tumorigenic niche that allows cancer to flourish at distant metastatic sites. However, our understanding of the functional mechanisms by which SPP1+ TAMs promote colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis is limited. Our study focuses on understanding the influence of SPP1+ TAMs in migration and invasion in mCRC. Leveraging sophisticated three-dimensional multi-cellular microfluidic devices, we will investigate TAM functions in physiological model systems that maintain the complexity of the metastatic TME. Our hypothesis is that SPP1+ TAMs can migrate into metastatic niches and further promote tumor cell invasion through physiological barriers such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB)."
11140085,"This Program Project grant will establish the fully integrated interdisciplinary programs of research and core facilities that are necessary to develop a fundamental understanding of the complex interplay between two rapidly emerging fields in cancer therapy: 1) targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) and 2) immunotherapy. Our 
overarching objectives are to develop a detailed mechanistic understanding of the immunomodulatory capacity of TRT agents and to evaluate and compare the ability of these agents to elicit cooperative therapeutic interactions in combination with immunotherapies. To achieve this, we will employ a representative variety of 
TRT agents to deliver radiation in vivo using clinically relevant murine tumor models and companion canines that have spontaneously developed cancers. We will determine the precise dosimetry for each radionuclide-,TRT vector-, and tumor model. This will facilitate studies of dose-, dose-rate-, and dose-range-dependent 
effects on the host immune system, tumor infiltrating immune cells, cytokine expression in the tumor microenvironment, immune susceptibility of tumor cells, mechanisms of immune suppression, and the development of antigenspecific adaptive immunity. We will determine the functional consequences of these 
effects by testing the broad hypothesis that, by modulating tumor immune tolerance and functional immunogenicity at all tumor sites, TRT will increase response to certain cancer immunotherapies."
10913397,"Treatment studies to date have shown pre-to-post changes in reading circuits with evidence-based 
remediation of reading disability (RD), establishing a neural signature of successful treatment outcome. 
However, insight into the neurobiological mechanisms by which treatment produces these changes 
requires monitoring modulations of key brain regions throughout the course of treatment. Moreover, in 
any cohort some RD children with highly similar profiles on standardized testing at the beginning of 
intervention will show large gains and others will not. In the previous grant-cycle we employed multimodal 
neuroimaging before, during, and after an in-school reading intervention and identified novel neurocognitive 
pre-treatment factors and dynamic brain/behavior changes that predict individual differences in treatment 
responsiveness. In the new cycle, we maintain the overarching goal of understanding variation in response 
to reading remediation in RD learners with dynamic brain/behavior tracking designed to yield novel insights 
into how remediation modifies brain organization for reading, and why it fails to do so adequately for some 
RD children, but in the proposed continuation, we leverage the discoveries from the initial phase (the how 
and why) to next examine what might constitute a more effective neurocognitive focus for treatment in 
minimal-responders to conventional content. With pre-learning fMRI/MRS and frequent fNIRS/EEG tracking 
and with both short-term adaptive learning experiments and longer-term Educational Technology based 
learning programs we vary emphasis on orthographic, phonological, and component process training as 
we seek to match learning content to individual differences in neurocognitive organization for these 
component processes.

The Integrated Virginia Research Training Centers in Kidney, Urology and Hematology (IGNITE
KUH) training program is being proposed to address an unmet need and major gap in prioritized
research training through development and integration of a statewide research program in the
Commonwealth of Virginia. The IGNITE KUH NRSA Training Core is an innovative and distinctive
multi-institutional, multi-departmental program comprising a team of 65 outstanding faculty from
the University of Virginia (UVA), Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU), and Virginia
Polytechnic Institute and State University (VT) with primary research programs anchored in the
basic research and clinical science of benign KUH diseases in six thematic areas: Systems
Biology and Functional Genomics, Immunity and Inflammation, Biomedical Engineering,
Nanotherapeutics and Drug Discovery, Clinical and Data Sciences, and Predictive Analytics. The
NRSA Training Core leverages existing strengths in kidney and hematological disease research,
uniting them with urological disease research in a cohesive, integrated and coordinated research
training program. The NRSA Training Core will be enhanced through participation and integration
of the Translational Health Research Institute of Virginia (iTHRIV), a component of the Clinical
and Translational Science Award (CTSA) partnership between UVA and VT, and the Wright
Center for Clinical and Translational Research (CCTR) at VCU. Three major goals of the IGNITE
KUH NRSA Training Core include: 1) increase training of PhD students, residents (urology) and
postdoctoral fellows in basic and translational aspects of KUH in health and disease using a
unified approach; 2) establish an integrated Virginia-wide research training program focused on
KUH-diseases; and 3) attract outstanding students and postdoctoral fellows with long-term career
interests in basic or clinical research into the IGNITE KUH Training Program. IGNITE KUH will
prioritize strategies to attract students from underrepresented populations at several partner
institutions, including three historically black universities in Virginia – Virginia State University
(VSU), Hampton University (HU), and Virginia Union Universities (VUU) – thereby further
enhancing development and training of both PhD researchers and physician scientists. The
IGNITE KUH NRSA Training Core will address human health issues through increased education
and training of the next generation of researchers and physician scientists in basic research or
clinical science who can guide and lead future research programs aiming to lessen human
disease and suffering in KUH-specific fields.
Project Summary/Abstract"
11110668,"Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section

Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is a common finding after primary cleft palate repair characterized by hypernasal sounding speech that can impact speech intelligibility. VPI requires surgical intervention to correct secondary to underlying anatomical differences. Nasopharyngoscopy is a widely used imaging modality for assessment of velopharyngeal variables in patients presenting for management of VPI. Imaging obtained on nasopharyngoscopy is used to develop a treatment plan and for surgical selection. However, there are inherent drawbacks to nasopharyngoscopy that limit interpretation of findings. Nasopharyngoscopy is invasive and uncomfortable. Proportion distortion exists depending on the size of the endoscope used and placement of the camera. There can be instances when the entire velopharyngeal port is not visible secondary to the angle of the scope. Other factors that interfere with assessment include the patient crying or screaming, not obtaining an adequate speech sample to accurately assess movement, and patients using speech sound errors that invalidate the assessment.

Compliance in obtaining a ratable nasopharyngoscopy exam is not well documented or defined in the literature. The lack of documented compliance with this procedure in the pediatric population is alarming given that 59% of team in the United States currently use nasopharyngoscopy for surgical decision making. Even when a patient is compliant and imaging can be interpreted, there is wide variation in interpretation practices. Some surgeons will use velar notching as the criteria to repair the underlying levator veli palatini (LVP) muscles, even though the LVP cannot be directly visualized from the scope. Other surgeons use closure pattern to determine a surgical intervention, while gap size is another driver. There is also no way on nasopharyngoscopy to directly measure anatomical structures that may be causing VPI such as a short velum.

The purpose of this supplement is to examine the utility of nasopharyngoscopy in surgical selection to treat VPI. Reliability for rating velopharyngeal variables among clinicians will be established. Once reliability is established, interpretation of findings to form a surgical plan will be assessed amongst surgeons across cleft teams. Finally, findings from nasopharyngoscopy will be compared to the imaging modality of MRI that is well documented to have high patient compliance and provides additional information not available from nasopharyngoscopy."

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) warn that viruses like H7N9 and H5N1, with fatality rates of approximately 40% and 60% respectively, could lead to catastrophic outcomes if they were to trigger a pandemic, with models predicting infection in one-third of the world’s population. This project focuses on advancing the development of CM-PW3, a broadly neutralizing, cross-reactive human monoclonal antibody for prophylactic use in high-risk populations, providing targeted, preemptive protection against both seasonal and pandemic influenza strains, including H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9. We will evaluate the most efficient and economic delivery of the antibody and determine the expected duration of protection. The overarching goal of this program is to develop CMPW3 to provide passive, immediate pre-exposure protection to at-risk individuals for an entire influenza season (or >4 months)."

10809602,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic, relapsing disease characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the colon and rectum that affects approximately 1.5 million people in the United States. While the precise etiology of UC is unknown, it is thought to result from an inappropriate inflammatory response to commensal gut bacteria in genetically susceptible individuals. All cases of UC are characterized by the overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators and the infiltration of activated immune cells leading to a prolonged inflammatory response. Inflammation resolution is actively controlled by a class of lipid autacoids known as Specialized Pro-resolving Mediators (SPMs). Resolvin E1 (RvE1) is an SPM that impacts multiple pathophysiological mechanisms underlying UC and has demonstrated efficacy in multiple animal models of UC.
Thetis Pharmaceuticals is developing TP-317, a first-in-class, oral Resolvin E1 (RvE1) therapy for the induction and maintenance of remission in UC patients. TP-317 is an innovative and patented new molecular entity with enhanced stability compared to RvE1 as the natural substance. Under a prior NIH SBIR Fast Track grant (RDK116460-01 and RDK116460-02) completed in 2021, Thetis successfully conducted multiple investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies with TP-317, including efficacy and pharmacokinetic studies, non-clinical toxicology and development and scale-up of a proprietary process for TP-317 synthesis. Following the completion of this research, TP-317 formulated as an enteric-coated tablet was investigated in healthy subjects in a single-blind, randomized, Phase 1a single ascending dose study that showed a favorable safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile. 
The goal of this Phase IIB SBIR program is to complete key non-clinical toxicology studies to enable rapid advancement of TP-317 into Phase 1b and Phase 2 clinical trials in UC patients as summarized below:
Aim 1: Investigate TP-317 in Sub-chronic Toxicology Study in Rat (Year 1). We will conduct a 13-week GLP toxicology and toxicokinetic (TK) study in Sprague Dawley Rat with TP-317 administered via oral gavage.
Aim 2: Investigate TP-317 in Sub-chronic Toxicology Study in Dog (Year 2). We will conduct a 13-week GLP toxicology and TK study in Beagle dog with TP-317 administered via oral gavage.
Aim 3: Investigate TP-317 in Chronic Toxicology Study in Dog (Year 3). We will conduct a 39-week GLP toxicology and TK study in Beagle dog with TP-317 administered via oral gavage."
10893476,"Project Summary: 
Dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) affects 1 in 8 Americans over the age of 65, and is currently not well
treated. While therapeutic development has largely focused on clearing brain amyloid via antibody approaches, brain
metabolism is also known to be substantially altered in the disease. Altering the metabolic state—for example, via
ketogenic diet—can improve cognition through incompletely understood mechanisms. Previous studies indicate that
acute supplementation with the metabolite β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), one of the ketone bodies produced as a result
of ketogenesis, improves cognitive function both in people with AD dementia and in mouse models of AD. However,
the factors—apart from diet—that impact BHB levels, as well as the specific mechanisms by which BHB may exert
positive impacts on the brain are unknown. Our research team has generated several important leads that better
inform the factors that impact BHB levels, as well as discovering that BHB impacts AD pathology through inhibition
of the inflammasome in microglia. While previously underappreciated in studies of ketogenic diet, gut microbiome
has a significant impact on BHB levels. Using gnotobiotic mice, we provide preliminary evidence brain levels of BHB
can be altered by precise manipulation of the gut microbiota. We have also found that modifying the abundance of
BHB through long-term direct administration in the drinking water results in remarkably diminished plaque burden
and microgliosis in 5XFAD mice. Further, in our studies of tissue from individuals in the Wisconsin ADRC with AD
dementia who came to autopsy, we found that brain levels of BHB levels were lower compared to individuals without
AD dementia at death. In the proposed study, we will follow up these findings to determine how BHB modulates
disease progression and address knowledge gaps that would facilitate therapeutic use of this metabolite. Answering
these questions has immediate translational implications and is expected to lead to novel strategies to prevent or
slow the course of AD. Here, we hypothesize that BHB protects against AD-associated pathology by inhibiting
Nlrp3 inflammasome activation through activation of Hcar2 in microglia. We will determine the features of the
inflammasome that mediate the effects of BHB on AD pathology in the 5XFAD mouse models of amyloid β plaque
deposition, determine the extent to which gut microbiome impacts BHB levels via butyrate producing bacteria, and
finally, using human metagenomic and biomarker data we will determine the extent to which gut microbiome
composition and BHB are associated with AD pathology using fluid biomarkers. The work proposed here will provide
a deeper understanding of the interplay between the innate immune system, gut microbes, and metabolism in AD,
generating the needed data that will support the development of novel strategies to prevent or slow the course of AD."

10887459,"PROJECT SUMMARY: TL1 TRAINING PROGRAM 
Addressing the shrinking clinician-scientist workforce depends on the early recruitment of potential trainees 
along the clinical and translational training continuum. To address the future workforce needs in the Midwest 
and across the nation, the Frontiers TL1 program will continue to provide high-quality training in clinical and 
translational research to a diverse group of trainees. This region needs additional researchers who can make 
national contributions to translational science while bringing new discoveries to the communities and patients, 
including those who are underserved and excluded. 
Aim 1. Reinforce the clinician-scientist pipeline by recruiting a highly qualified, dedicated and diverse 
pool of TL1 predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees to build the translational workforce
In Frontiers 1.0, we demonstrated success in recruiting pre-doctoral clinical trainees. During Frontiers 2.0, we 
expanded the training tracks to include 4 post-doctoral trainees per year. In Frontiers 3.0 we will focus on 
recruitment of trainees who are underrepresented in clinical and translational research and whose research 
focus is on underserved and excluded populations.
Aim 2. Enhance team science in translational science workforce development through the utilization of
experienced and skilled multidisciplinary mentorship teams across Frontiers partners
We have expanded the list of experienced and funded mentors from multiple programs across the Frontiers 
institutions who are willing and capable of providing mentorship. These senior and mid-career mentors, along 
with newly added junior mentors, already work in interdisciplinary, translational research teams and will 
effectively demonstrate to our TL1 trainees the values of team science and collaborations built between 
institutional partners.
Aim 3. Build upon our existing novel and competency-based clinical and translational research 
curricula
Our established, comprehensive, and successful Frontiers Training program will provide TL1 trainees with 
critical competencies to successfully conduct translational research. We will complement that degree program 
with a variety of innovative short term and non-degree training opportunities that address the needs of our 
trainees and map to skills needed to launch independent research careers. 
Aim 4. Implement more rigorous individualized evaluation methods integrated with trainee 
individualized development plans to track success and enrich the training environment with efficiency 
and precision
We will utilize a mixed methods evaluation plan that integrates the trainee individualized development plan to 
track short- and long-term success of our trainees."
10908453,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is a leading cause of
intellectual and other brain disabilities, contributing to an estimated prevalence of Fetal Alcohol
Spectrum Disorder (FASD) at between 1 and 5% of school-aged children in the US. Despite prevention
guidelines, alcohol use during pregnancy continues to be a problem, and consequently, FASD is
difficult to prevent. Behind every child with an FASD is an adult with unmet mental health needs that
result in risky patterns of alcohol consumption or an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUDs). Therefore,
preventing FASD requires preventing risky alcohol consumption in adults. Preventing AUDs is
challenging due to the paucity of effective medications. In this application, I propose a transitioning plan
in which I complement my passion for the study of FASD (the F99 phase) with the study of AUDs (the
K00 phase), with the expectation that the route to preventing FASD lies through preventing AUDs.
However, in both phases, I plan to pursue my interests in the mediating biology of non-protein-coding
RNAs. In the first phase of my predoctoral studies, I focused on Oct4/Pouf51, a transcription factor that 
is a key determinant of stem cell identity, and target of ethanol. I also identified a novel pseudo- gene
duplication of the Oct4/Pou5f1 locus, encoding a long non-coding RNA that I termed, Oc4pg9 lncRNA.
Oct4pg9 lncRNA is upregulated in neural stem cells (NSCs), following ethanol exposure. I found that
Oct4pg9 lncRNA mediates many maturational effects of ethanol on NSCs. In the F99 phase, I plan to
assess, using single-cell RNA sequencing, whether the expression of Oct4pg9 lncRNA and
Oct4/Pou5f1 marks unique non-overlapping NSC subpopulations. Using an in vivo murine model for
PAE, I plan to determine the extent to which ethanol exposure disrupts, at the cellular level, the
association between Oct4Pou5f1 and Oct4pg9, leading to the emergence of new NSC subpopulations
with aberrant maturation signatures. In the K00 phase, I will transition to the field of adult alcoholism
and continue studying the regulation and function of lncRNAs in the context of AUDs. This research
direction will focus on developing and behaviorally phenotyping mouse models of AUD-sensitive
lncRNAs. Additionally, I will utilize transcriptomic signatures and high-throughput behavioral screening
to identify and test candidate compounds that show promise in decreasing excessive alcohol
consumption. This proposal provides a research and training plan for a transition from predoctoral
FASD training to post-doctoral training in the biology of adult alcoholism, with the aim of developing an
independent research program in the field of adult alcoholism."

The Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center (Sylvester) Biospecimen Shared Resource (BSSR) provides
readily accessible, cost-effective, state-of-the-art biorepository resources, services, and expertise in support of
oncology research. The aims of the BSSR are to 1) provide collection, processing, storage, and distribution of
biospecimens; 2) maintain a clinically annotated database of the biorepository; 3) facilitate non-interventional
trials (NITs) that involve biospecimen collection; and 4) provide education and training on design and conduct
of biospecimen-focused projects. Proposed as a developing Shared Resource (SR) in Sylvester's 2018 CCSG,
the BSSR has grown in scale and scope during the current reporting period (6/1/2018 to 5/31/2023), maturing
into an essential research resource for members. The BSSR has a diverse collection of patient samples (e.g.,
tissue specimens, blood, and other biofluids), providing a readily accessible and cost-effective resource for
facilitating translational cancer research. BSSR services include 1) screening, consenting, and enrolling
patients for biospecimen collection studies; 2) plasma, buffy coat, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear
cell isolation and cryopreservation; 3) rapid acquisition of surgical tissue and fresh biopsies for development of
patient-derived xenografts, cell cultures, and organoids; 4) clinical annotation, quality assessment and quality
control of biospecimens; 5) construction of tissue microarrays; and 6) facilitating the retrieval and processing of
tissue. The BSSR maintains an online clinically annotated database of its stored biospecimens. The facility
also offers training, workshops, and seminars on best practices, innovative techniques, and the latest
advances in biospecimen collection methodologies. As part of the 2019-2023 Sylvester Strategic Plan, the
BSSR has continued to expand its services. In 2019, the BSSR expanded to facilitate NITs that involve
biospecimen collection, providing protocol development and regulatory support, data management, participant
recruitment and retention, and study-specific biospecimen acquisition, processing, and distribution. The BSSR
collects samples in both inpatient and outpatient settings. During the reporting period, the BSSR enrolled 5,183
participants and collected 10,909 clinically annotated specimens, resulting in 31,490 banked samples. BSSR
support for NITs resulted in 1,241 patients being enrolled into 11 investigator-initiated and ten collaborative
studies. The BSSR supported the research of 67 investigators, including 42 members from all Research
Programs, who comprised 74% of total BSSR usage by revenue. The BSSR supported 19 publications of
members, 42% of which were in high-impact journals (JIF~10) and facilitated 28 cancer-relevant extramural
grants awarded to members, including 9 NCI awards. In alignment with the 2024-2028 Sylvester Strategic
Plan, the BSSR will expand support for large-scale correlative studies, with an emphasis on biospecimen
collection of priority cancers; expand services to network facilities; continue to work with other SRs to expand
integrated multiomics services; and expand data and sample sharing to facilitate research and patient care."
10893457,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic pulmonary disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which
infects approximately one quarter of the world’s population. A variety of drugs have been identified that
rapidly kill Mtb and its relatives in vitro, yet clinical treatment requires at least 6 months of combination
therapy and resistance is rampant. Furthermore, the current state-of-the-art for detection of Mtb infection
employs cumbersome methods that were developed more than 80 years ago. Herein we propose to
develop new methods for detection of Mtb that can be employed in low resource settings, and to develop
new screens for potential TB drugs, as well as to perform fundamental studies on the role of mycobacterial
lipids in virulence.
In this renewal application of R37 AI051622 entitled “Chemical Mycobacteriology”, we propose the
following four Aims: (1) to develop probes based on the fluorogenic Nile Red and 3-hydroxychromone dyes,
which can be used to detect Mtb with low-power, low-cost microscopes; (2) to establish a magnetic bead-
based enrichment platform that can be deployed at the point-of-care to enhance detection of fluorescently
labeled Mtb cells; (3) to deploy metabolic labeling as a readout for high-throughput drug screens to
decrease time and expense in discovery of new TB drugs; and (4) to employ bioorthogonal labeling and
chemical biology approaches to elucidate the role of phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIM) lipids in

10814768,"PROJECT 4 – SUMMARY 
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are caused by abnormal development of molecular and synaptic 
networks in the brain and are characterized by developmental behavioral deficits with clear social and cognitive 
impairments. Approximately 15% of children in the United States ages 3 to 17 years are affected by NDDs which 
include autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy, intellectual 
disability (ID), hearing impairments, visual/motor impairments, among others. Interestingly, NDDs, in particular 
ASD and ID, are also marked by a number of memory-related deficits, such as face identity recognition, working 
memory, and episodic memory. Nevertheless, the link between genes, memory phenotypes, and NDDs is poorly 
understood. This project focuses on the function of the NDD risk gene, IL1RAPL2, in human iPSC-derived 
excitatory neurons and in ASD-like and memory behaviors using a newly developed mouse model. We 
hypothesize that IL1RAPL2 plays a key role in neurodevelopmental disorders and memory phenotypes by 
regulating synapse development on cortical excitatory neurons. Aim 1 will take advantage of human IPSC- 
derived deep layer excitatory neurons with IL1RAPL2 loss-of-function (LoF) to understand its function in the 
transcriptomic landscapes, in regulation of dendritic arborization and spine density, and in neuronal excitability 
and synaptic transmission. Aim 2 will take advantage of a new mouse model with a global Il1rapl2 LoF to mimic 
LoF mutations in humans, that will enable an understanding of its role in NDDs and memory related behaviors. 
The NIH COBRE in Neurodevelopment and Its Disorders (CNDD) will provide an ideal environment, critical 
resources and Cores, and career development opportunities to enable the successful transition of Dr. Berto to 
an established, independent investigator at MUSC. Moreover, the proposed studies, and approaches employed, 
are important and highly relevant to the mission and theme of the CNDD, and the Project data will prepare Dr. 
Berto for a future competitive R01 application."
10908590,"Increasing evidence suggests that the intestine plays an important role in sensing not only the presence
of pathogens but also changes in the microbiota, which ultimately result in changes in the regulation of
immune pathways and behaviors by communicating with neurons. However, the complexity of the
nervous and immune systems of mammals makes it difficult to dissect the mechanisms by which the
neural-gut axis communicates using bidirectional signals to control intestinal immunity. Studies in the
nematode Caenorhabditis elegans show that bacterial colonization of the intestine results in the
activation of the expression of innate immune genes in the gut and the activation of a neuroendocrine
signal that controls pathogen avoidance. The germline also plays a key role in the neural-gut axis not
only by transmitting the immunological memory to the next generation but also by communicating
pathogenic cues that travel from the gut to the nervous system to control innate immunity. The long-term
goal of this proposal is to elucidate the mechanism by which the neural-germline-gut axis communicates
to sense pathogens and/or infection-induced physiological changes to control innate immunity at the
whole animal level. Thus, we will explore the general hypothesis that the neural-germline-gut axis plays
a critical role in the organismal response against bacterial pathogens by helping the nervous system
integrate signals from infected sites and different tissues to coordinate the immune response. Specific
genes and neurons will be studied to dissect the neural circuits that regulate immune activation in
response to pathogen exposure and pathogen-induced alterations of the animal’s physiology. A
genetics approach will also be used to identify neurotransmitters and endocrine signals potentially
involved in the neural-immune communication that takes place between neurons and different tissues
and infected sites."

years of experience, deep community partnerships, data-driven operations, robust infrastructure,
lessons learned, and dedicated staffing to accelerate progress on achieving the enrollment of one
million diverse participants across the United States.
We have engaged communities and enrolled participants in 38 of the 67 counties in PA. As of
October 10, 2023, we enrolled 41,558 Core participants (8.5% of the national cohort), 72% of
whom are from underrepresented backgrounds in research.
New for AOU PA 2.0 will be the addition of community-based ambassadors - our AOU PA
Navigators - and partner organizations - our Community Research Hubs. Navigators and Hubs
will represent their communities on our Community Advisory Board, help develop messaging,
promote and host engagement and enrollment activities, and directly communicate through
personal connections with their friends and neighbors the value of All of Us.
Our long-term objective for AOU PA 2.0 is to maintain our successful operations and to
establish multiple AOU PA Navigators and Community Research Hubs who can operate
independently in their communities with the support of the AOU PA Platform. They will focus
on engaging and retaining participants with disabilities and participants who are from primarily
Black and Hispanic-Latino communities across PA, with new initiatives in the Philadelphia and
Harrisburg regions. At the same time, we will maintain current AOU PA enrollment activities in
western and central PA, including those in rural communities.
Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Conduct outreach and engagement activities designed in equitable
partnership with members of the communities of interest in which engagement and enrollment
will occur; and Aim 2. Engage, enroll, and retain participants from populations who are
historically underrepresented in biomedical research.
We will learn from members of diverse communities how All of Us can best establish and
communicate its trustworthiness and research reciprocity using human-centered design, which
emphasizes human perspective and empathy at every stage of a design process. We bring
community members together in Engagement Studios that provide a safe space, respectful
environment, and inclusive approach for co-creating messages and engagement strategies.
We will expand our current Engagement Team to include members from marginalized groups
who share lived experiences with the communities with whom we partner and the Engagement
Team at the Human Engineering Research Laboratories (HERL), which works to ensure that
individuals with disabilities from diverse backgrounds can participate in and contribute to
assistive technology research. Other partnerships include the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary,
several Black churches throughout the state, Casa San Jose, and independent community

the AOURP is the role of Regional Medical Centers (RMC), which provide their experienced staff 
and faculty, their resources, and their trusted relationships with patients and communities, to 
engage, enroll, and retain participants for the AOURP study. We have formed a consortium of such RMCs in the States of Florida, Georgia, and the Territory of Puerto Rico. We call this the SouthEast Enrollment Center (SEEC-2), led by University of Miami, University of Florida 
Gainesville, Morehouse School of Medicine, Emory University, and the University of Puerto Rico 
Comprehensive Cancer Center. These five prestigious academic regional medical centers are 
further allied with several public and private hospital systems and are working with dozens of 
regional partner organization to allow every individual in this geographic area access to the 
AOURP. Over the past five years, the SEEC team has registered more than 51,000 individuals 
and fully enrolled nearly 40,000 core participants into the AOURP study. At a closer look, 
these participants truly represent the diversity of people living in this region. More than 67% 
identify with a race or ethnicity that is historically not well represented in medical research 
studies, thus potentially missing out on the benefits of new treatments. Approximately 25% are of 
older age, and 18% have disabilities; together 93% of SEEC participants belong to the category 
of Underrepresented in Biomedical Research (UBR). More than 44% of SEEC enrolled 
participants have actively followed up with the Program after their initial enrollment activities.
The next phase, SEEC-2, will help push the national participant count to over 1 million AOURP 
individuals. We will more than double the above engagement and enrollment numbers, make 
AOURP a well-known mainstay in our communities, retain the majority of core participants, and 
foster the adoption of the researcher workbench. We plan to significantly expand our enrollment 
options and to implement novel activities, in order to make it easier for individuals to join AOURP. 
Examples include mobile enrollment with buses, partnerships with smaller hospital systems, and 
the development of regional networks of community organizations for outreach and engagement. 
We will expand digital and remote enrollment options for individuals unable to travel to our 
enrollment sites. Our community centered trained staff will use multiple measures of 
communication to keep participants engaged, including marketing, web and social media presence, phone calls, web calls, and assistance with ride share travel. Retention is already above 50% in several of the SEEC-2 regions. We will actively retain at least 55% of all SEEC participants, most of them UBR, by Year 5 of SEEC-2. The Southeastern region of the United States is home to a growing population of 36 million people, characterized by a rich history, a unique climate, and unmatched diversity. SEEC-2 investigators and institutions provide access to this diverse and distinctive population helping to achieve the overall goals of the national Program. With nearly six years of experience and a large, well-trained, and motivated team, SEEC-2 will continue our successful engagement, enrollment, and retention strategies in the coming five years.
This study is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions for the opioid crisis and overdose epidemic, including opioid use disorder and stimulant use disorder. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to address the national opioid public health crisis and improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction."
10873190,"Alcoholism is a chronically relapsing disorder that develops over time and is characterized by the transition 
from recreational alcohol use to abuse and dependence. Negative emotional states, such as posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) or anxiety, influenced by genetic factors or determined by environmental conditions 
contribute to shaping this transition. On the other hand, chronic exposure to alcohol is a major determinant 
for the occurrence of mood disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, PTSD) and negative emotional states (i.e., 
dysphoria, irritability). The amygdalar nuclei [both the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) and
basolateral amygdala (BLA)] are considered a hub for negative emotional circuitry, and the role of the stress
peptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in this brain structure is critical for both development of alcohol
dependence and mood disorders/negative affect. During the previous funding period we provided essential
new insight into the relationship between innate overexpression of the CRF1 receptor system, stress
hypersensitivity and excessive ethanol consumption in genetically selected Marchigian Sardinian (msP) 
rats. Our most recent results show that enhanced CRF signaling in msP rats is responsible for increased 
hydrolytic activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and blunted endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling in the 
CeA/BLA, leading to enhanced GABA and glutamate transmission in the amygdala. Our hypothesis is that 
such alterations contribute to enhance stress sensitivity and to exacerbate anxiety-like symptoms in the 
msP rats, which may increase drinking to alleviate these negative conditions. Understanding the 
mechanisms through with innate and environmental factors act/interact to dysregulate CRF/eCB 
transmission in the BLA and CeA will provide new insight into the etiopathology of alcoholism, aiding the 
development of new therapeutics for this still largely untreated medical condition. The research plan for this 
competitive renewal is to investigate how alteration of eCB signaling in the amygdala triggered by innate (in 
msP rats) or EtOH-induced (post-dependent Wistars) upregulation of the CRF1 system contributes to 
excessive alcohol drinking and exacerbates maladaptive conditioned fear responses, similar to symptoms 
of PTSD in humans. The ability to restore normal eCB function by FAAH inhibition, and therefore to 
counteract excessive drinking and normalize fear responses, will be also studied. A better understanding of 
the molecular mechanism underlying genotypic differences of the msP compared to outbred Wistar rats and 
of neuroadaptations following exposure to alcohol, will provide novel insight into the innate susceptibility to 
develop Alcohol Use Disorder and will be useful toward the development of new therapeutic agents to 
alleviate alcohol dependence."
10812240,"The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) program in Indiana will
continue to greatly aid our goal to reduce infant morbidity and mortality and to promote maternal
health by influencing maternal and child health programs, policies and maternal behaviors
during pregnancy and early infancy. In order to achieve this aim, Indiana needs statistically
representative, high quality data to monitor risk factors for maternal and infant health that
PRAMS offers. The Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) will continue to utilize these data
to inform public health programs and policies and health care system changes.
 The use of PRAMS data will help Indiana continue to track pregnancy outcomes to tailor
programming and follow-up in an effort to prevent preterm births and reduce infant mortality.
We have been able to determine whether target groups are receiving services, and better
understand the barriers to services for certain target groups by analyzing our first year of data.
By being able to assess changes in service use over time we will be able to more quickly
assess whether programs and policies in effect are working and/or require modification.
PRAMS data provide insight into maternal behaviors so that programs can be tweaked to reflect
the most current knowledge regarding the health and intentions of mothers and infants in
Indiana.
 The proposed activities in this application consist of conduct of all interviews for the
PRAMS data collection cycle on a monthly basis via mailed Indiana PRAMS questionnaires with
follow-up telephone call attempts for non-respondents when necessary. The Indiana PRAMS
program will continue to be housed in the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Division at the
Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH). In-house PRAMS staffing will consist of the MCH
Epidemiology Director who will also serve as the PI (10%) and the PRAMS Project
Coordinator/Epidemiologist (100%). ISDH/MCH has selected a contract entity, Kent State
University Survey Research Lab (KSU) through a bid process in order to assist with data
collection. KSU houses a Data Manager who contributes at least 60% of their time to PRAMS.
All staff work together to establish a stable program in order to meet all of the goals and objects
set forth by the CDC. The MCH Division collaborates with the Vital Records Division at ISDH to
ensure data are readily available for sampling through the ISDH/MCH Integrated System. This
system allows for real-time access to Vital Records data which will be provided for monthly
PRAMS sampling."
10912429,"Despite major advances in treatment and prevention of HIV infection, the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues
 to cause tremendous morbidity and mortality. Of the 37.7 million people living with HIV worldwide, only
 73% are receiving antiretroviral therapy. In 2020 alone, an estimated 680,000 people died from
 AIDS-related illness, and nearly two million people are newly infected with HIV each year. The HIV burden
 is highest in parts of the world that face the additional challenge of highly constrained resources. HIV
 testing and treatment guidelines have continually evolved; however, assessing the benefits associated
 with improved testing, more effective antiretroviral therapy, and increasingly effective prevention
 interventions is difficult. It is unclear which specific strategies and overall approach would be most
 effective for specific populations, given the critical reality of budget constraints.
 This competing continuation proposes to expand upon the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS
 Complications International (CEPAC-I) Model, a computer microsimulation of the natural history,
 management, outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of HIV clinical care. This proposal includes
 cutting-edge, guideline-informing studies of novel treatments and development of innovative modeling
 optimization methods to advance the field. There are two specific aims:
 Specific Aim 1: To expand the CEPAC-I microsimulation to address new clinical policy questions focused
 on key populations, using data from recent clinical trials and implementation research studies.
 Specific Aim 2: To expand upon the optimization model and better determine the combination of HIV care
 interventions that most decreases HIV incidence in countries with different epidemic characteristics and
 resource constraints.
 In close alignment with the 2022 research priorities of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, the goals of this
 proposal include reducing HIV incidence, identifying optimal prevention and treatment responses, and
 reducing health disparities by improving key population outcomes. The assembled research team has the
 ideal combination of skills and experience to address critical questions around the cost-effectiveness of
 new interventions for HIV in high-risk populations. The results will lead to new insights to inform clinicians
 and policymakers, leading to improved HIV treatment guidelines in multiple resource-limited settings."
10907552,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions):
This proposal works towards a deeper understanding of how the brain represents information across many
time scales using a combination of neurophysiological and computational approaches. State-of-the-art
recordings from non-human primates will track the flow of information across neurons and across time
scales in multiple brain regions. Computational data analyses will compare these results from predictions
of a theory for how the brain represents information across time scales. Computational work will study the
properties of artificial neural networks inspired by the theory and with properties of the observed
neurophysiological data."
10908313,"This proposal brings together two laboratories with complementary experimental and computational 
expertise to determine the complexity of the extracellular space (ECS) in the brain at nanoscopic 
resolution in live tissue and its effects on neuronal function. The Spanish laboratory has spearheaded the 
development of super-resolution shadow imaging (SUSHI). The US team will use computer models to 
study the consequences of using competing hypotheses of how the ECS complexity affects the diffusion 
of neurotransmitters, which they will test experimentally. Neuronal structural complexity can cause a 
breakdown of classical diffusion, resulting in anomalous diffusion. A molecule can experience anomalous 
and normal diffusion at different temporal scales. Depending on which diffusional process dominates will 
affect the spread and relative concentration of ECS diffusing signals, such as neurotransmitters. SUSHI 
experiments will measure the structure of the ECS in live hippocampal organotypic and acute slices 
focusing on perisynaptic excitatory and inhibitory areas of CA1 pyramidal neurons. The values of the ECS 
volume fraction and the pore-size of the interstitial fluid (ISF) will be determined as a function of age, 
which is known to affect the ECS structure. SUSHI will be used to measure diffusional properties of the 
ECS at nanoscopic resolution over microscopic regions. These measurements will determine whether 
diffusion is anomalous or normal and over which periods of time. Monte Carlo and differential equation 
models and theory will examine the anatomical properties that cause anomalous or normal diffusion. The 
models will be extended to predict the effects of ECS structure on biochemical signaling at different 
spatio-temporal scales. The team will test the hypothesis that modifying the ECS volume directly affects 
the relative strength of neurotransmitter signals. Experiments will use a combination of electrophysiology 
with pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations to determine the effects of changes in ECS volume 
on the relative strength of excitatory and inhibitory (tonic and phasic) synapses. The experimental 
manipulations will mimic pathological conditions such as epilepsy and gliosis. The experiments will be the 
basis to build biophysical detailed models of pyramidal hippocampal cells to determine how the excitability 
of these cell changes as a function of ECS structure."

10887564,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Through associative learning processes, cues in the
environment become predictors of biologically relevant stimuli (e.g. food). However, when attributed
with incentive value, such cues can become powerful motivators of maladaptive behavior. For example,
addicts often relapse upon exposure to cues (e.g. people, paraphernalia) previously associated with the
drug-taking experience. Using an animal model that captures individual variation in the propensity to
attribute incentive value to reward cues, we can investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying
cue-motivated psychopathologies like addiction. Rats that undergo Pavlovian training, consisting of cue
presentation followed by delivery of a food reward, will often develop either a sign- or goal-tracking
conditioned response. For both sign-trackers (ST) and goal-trackers (GT) the cue attains predictive
value, but for ST the cue also attains incentive value. The attribution of incentive value to the cue
transforms it into a “motivational magnet”, rendering it attractive and desirable for ST, but not GT. It has
been shown that different brain circuits are engaged in response to the cue in ST vs. GT, and that
dopamine (DA) is necessary for incentive (i.e. sign-tracking), but not predictive (i.e. goal-tracking)
learning processes. However, to date, little has been investigated beyond the traditional “motive” circuit
in ST and GT. To expand our knowledge in this regard, I will study the interaction between stress- and
reward-systems in ST and GT rats. DA has long been known to interact with corticosterone (CORT), a
primary mediator of the stress-response, and in turn potentiate motivated behaviors. Given that cue-elicited DA and CORT profiles differ between ST and GT, the overarching hypothesis of my work is that
DA- and CORT-integrative circuits mediate individual differences in the attribution of incentive value to
reward cues. The goal of the proposed work is to identify an intersection between stress- and reward-systems that drives distinct behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. To do so, I will combine and
become proficient with endocrine, neurochemical, pharmacological, genetic, and behavioral
approaches and analyses. This work will elucidate potential mechanisms that may render individuals
more susceptible to cue-driven psychopathologies, and provide comprehensive training towards my
independent scientific growth."
10746868,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI) has 
revealed two major principles of the functional organization of the ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in 
human adults. First, some regions of VTC respond selectively to a specific category of stimuli, such as 
the fusiform face area (FFA) which responds more to faces than to any other stimulus category. The 
second principle of organization is that different categories of stimuli have systematically distinct 
patterns of response across the entire VTC. How do these two key aspects of VTC functional 
organization in adults arise in development? The goal of my research program is to discover if these 
organizing principles are present in the infant brain (Aims 1 and 2) and design computational models to 
test different theories of cortical development (Aim 3). The dissertation work in this proposal will provide 
invaluable data toward the goal of refining theories of cortical development. In addition to innovations 
that enhance the quality of awake infant fMRI data, Aim 1 provides the first evidence that like adults, 
infants have face-selective responses in the FFA, scene-selective responses in the parahippocampal 
place area (PPA), and body-selective responses in the extrastriate body area (EBA). Aim 2 directly 
follows this up by asking if infants have systematically distinct patterns of response across higher- level 
visual areas that are similar to those found in the adult brain. The F99 phase of this proposal will 
provide training to optimize machine learning (ML) techniques that can withstand the unique challenges 
of infant fMRI data – specifically unbalanced and missing data. The F99 phase will be conducted at 
MIT, an intellectual environment with access to leaders in the fields of ML, cognitive neuroscience, and 
computational neuroscience. Finally, Aim 3 of this proposal is to build computational models designed 
to test current theories of cortical development. The K00 phase of this proposal will provide training on 
the design and implementation of artificial neural networks (ANNs) models as well as training on the 
best methods to test ANN models using infant fMRI data. Research for the K00 phase will provide a 
new mentorship experience with an established investigator in computational neuroscience and will 
take place at an institution with a thriving intellectual environment that has access to an MRI scanner 
and the computational resources necessary to build a variety of ANN models. In summary, the 
objective of the proposed research is to determine if the principles of functional organization in the adult 
brain are present in infants. Insights from this proposal will advance and refine theories of cortical 
development and have the potential to be applicable to other domains such audition and language. 
Further, by combining my predoctoral training in awake infant fMRI with my proposed postdoctoral 
training in computational modeling, the proposed research will enable me to become an independent 
investigator and leader in the field of computational developmental neuroscience."
10829472,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Opioid abuse remains a costly epidemic in the US, 
prompting research into new and effective interventions to curb addiction-like behavior. Amongst the 
therapeutic characteristics of opioids, their associated withdrawal effects are substantial and 
recognized to contribute to development of abuse and relapse. While acute somatic withdrawal 
symptoms are relatively well characterized, their prolonged affective counterparts are less understood. 
Regulating a broad array of affective behaviors, the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system has been 
demonstrated as both necessary and sufficient for reward-related behavior towards opioids and 
withdrawal- related negative affect, with a canonical hypodopaminergic state following opioid 
dependence at least partially responsible for drug craving and relapse vulnerability. Despite this, 
limitations of previous studies concerning heterogeneity of mesolimbic circuitry and a shortage of 
assessments of opioid-induced long-term changes to motivated behavior and subsequent drug intake 
following dependence have stifled clear demonstrations of protracted motivational dysfunction and 
detection of underlying mechanism for the associated hypodopaminergic state. Growing evidence 
indicates that cannabinoid (CB) signaling is highly influential in regulating mesoaccumbal dopamine 
and opioid systems, including dopamine and opioid control of reinforcement, and that CB-based 
therapies may hold efficacy in treating negative affective states during acute/somatic withdrawal and 
perhaps opioid intake. Despite these promising data, data regarding how CB signaling is altered during 
opioid withdrawal and whether CB-therapies are efficacious in countering dependence-related changes 
in motivation for and intake of opioids with more protracted withdrawal are almost non-existent. This 
proposal builds off my research to date demonstrating that 1) morphine dependence promotes a long-lasting elevation in GABAA- mediated inhibitory tone specific to DA neurons in the lateral ventral 
tegmental area projecting to the lateral nucleus accumbens shell (latVTA-latShell), 2) prior dependence 
increases motivation for and intake of morphine, and 3) elevations in GABA signaling align with an 
apparent tolerance to CB1-induced disinhibition of lateral VTA DA firing. In Aim2/Exp1, I will utilize ex 
vivo slice electrophysiology to assess alterations in synaptic strength and CB-dependent regulation of 
GABAergic afferents from the rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg) to latVTA- latShell DA cells. 
Behavior studies in Aim2/Exp2 will extend upon data demonstrating increased effort-based motivated 
responding for morphine under protracted withdrawal conditions by measuring cannabinoid-induced 
alteration of this effect. Completing these experiments will support my research development by adding 
technical skills in more sophisticated electrophysiology and behavioral approaches. Further, results will 
fill critical unknowns regarding mechanisms underlying ostensibly important changes in DA function and 
behavior that drive OUD and characterize the longer-lasting benefits and limitations of CB-based 
interventions."
10767181,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders are 
sex-biased in incidence or severity. To understand why one sex may be vulnerable to a disease, it is 
important to understand brain development in both sexes. Mood, cognition, and other processes are 
regulated by estrogen receptor (ER) α neurons. Female have increased number of ERα neurons in the 
hypothalamus, compared to males. This is an example of a sex difference in neurochemical phenotype, 
the most common type of sex difference in the brain. Despite this, little is known on the mechanisms 
controlling their development. Our research suggests that epigenetic mechanisms underlie sex 
differences in neurochemical phenotype that may contribute to sex biases in disease. Inhibiting DNA 
methylation in the brains of newborn mice reduces sex differences in ERα in the preoptic area (POA) 
and the ventrolateral area of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) at weaning. We recently reported 
that DNA methyltransferases (Dnmts; which add methyl marks) and ten eleven translocases (Tets; 
which remove methyl marks), peak shortly after birth in both sexes in the hypothalamus. Additionally, 
females have higher expression of Dnmts, while males have higher expression of Tets during this 
period. This suggests that DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation are dynamic and sex- biased 
during neonatal brain development. Interestingly, both sexes have an equally high number of ERα cells 
in the VMHvl at birth, but only in males, it decreases 50% by weaning. This proposal will test the 
hypothesis that ERα cells in males, but not females, accumulate DNA methylation marks during 
postnatal development which establishes the sex difference. The F99 phase will test 1) whether subpopulations of ERα cells with functional roles are sensitive to neonatal inhibition of DNA methylation 
using single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization and 2) whether specific sub-populations downregulate ERα expression across development (Aim 2a). Lastly, using methylated and 
hydroxymethylated DNA immunoprecipitation sequencing, it will test the hypotheses that there are 
global sex differences and developmental changes in the epigenome, and specifically, that the ERα
promoter in males has increased levels of DNA methylation compared to females (Aim 2b). The 
proposed study will help the candidate, Laura Cortes, achieve her goal of becoming a tenure-track 
professor at an R1 institution. This proposal will provide training in cutting-edge techniques, such as 
sm-FISH and epigenomic sequencing, to investigate how DNA methylation regulates neurochemical 
phenotype in both sexes. The Neuroscience Institute at Georgia State University is an ideal 
environment given the 1) access to the expertise of reputed neuroendocrinologists and state-of-the-art 
tools, 2) collaborative intra-departmental and inter-institutional atmosphere, and 3) the plethora of 
career development opportunities. Completion of the training plan described in this proposal will ensure 
the development of a well-rounded and successful scientist capable of transitioning into an independent 
investigator."
10894780,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Macular degeneration (MD) is retinal disease that causes
severe visual impairment in nearly 7 million people in the U.S. This disease causes the progressive
deterioration of photoreceptors in the center of the retina, known as the macula, and renders patients
unable to see in the center of the visual field. As a consequence, patients with MD must rely on
peripheral vision, making even the simplest everyday tasks, such as reading or recognizing faces,
much more difficult. Reliance on peripheral vision is extremely problematic, as it possesses
substantially lower resolution compared to central vision. In fact, many patients never fully adapt to
using peripheral vision effectively. Interestingly, however, some patients become particularly skilled at
using their spared peripheral vision. Prior work suggests that this adaptation to using peripheral vision
happens at a processing stage beyond the retina, specifically in visual cortex. There is debate in the
literature about whether or not brain regions that formerly responded to central (lost) vision remap their
function to respond to peripheral (spared) vision. We address a different form of plasticity here:
remodeling of the brain regions which originally responded to peripheral (spared) vision so that they are
more capable of taking on the functions of central vision. Our hypothesis is that peripherallyrepresenting visual cortex builds new connections after experience, and this changes the structure and
function of that region. Using neuroimaging (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in human participants, we
have generated preliminary evidence that suggests that some of these changes may exist in the form of
alterations to brain structure (neurite density and cortical thickness) and brain function (functional
connectivity). For example, we have observed that the parts of visual cortex that respond to peripheral
vision have greater cortical thickness in MD patients compared to healthy controls, suggesting a
possible compensatory mechanism that may be associated with enhanced use of peripheral vision.
Additionally, we have observed that peripheral regions of early visual cortex in MD patients are more
strongly functionally connected to later visual areas that selectively respond to specific types of visual
stimuli, such as facial features and words/letters. We will test the hypothesis that better use of
peripheral vision in MD is associated with enhanced functional connectivity and enhanced structure
(neurite density and cortical thickness). More specifically, we predict that enhanced visual function in
MD will be related to stronger functional connectivity between peripheral areas of primary visual cortex
and later visual areas that respond preferentially to categories of stimuli (i.e.- faces, and words).
Additionally, we predict that greater neurite density and cortical thickness in primary visual cortex will be
related to behavioral performance on visual processing tasks. These findings will help provide insight
towards improving therapeutic interventions for MD, as well as uncover knowledge about the adult
brain’s potential for adaptation to changes in experience."
10758589,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Manganese (Mn) is an essential metal required for normal 
neural development and function; however, at elevated levels, it is neurotoxic. Adults and children 
exposed to Mn through environmental or occupational sources exhibit incurable motor and cognitive 
deficits. Mn overexposure is also associated with a-synuclein aggregation and increased risk for 
developing Parkinson’s Disease. Mn presents an environmental health concern, but the mechanisms of 
brain Mn homeostasis and the effects of Mn on brain function remain are not fully understood. Upon 
overexposure, Mn builds up in the basal ganglia; however, the specific neuronal targets of Mn are 
unclear. A major question in the field is whether Mn primarily effects catecholaminergic, particularly 
dopaminergic, or GABAergic neurons in the basal ganglia. The proposed study aims to address this 
question by selectively increasing Mn in catecholaminergic and GABAergic neurons which was not 
previously possible. Homozygous mutations in the Mn efflux transporter, SLC30A10, resulted in 
increased brain Mn and Mn-induced parkinsonism. The current proposal leverages the discovery of 
SLC30A10 to understand the mechanisms of brain Mn homeostasis and the effects of increased Mn in 
all or some neurons. Using full-body, pan/neuronal/glial, liver-, and endoderm-specific Slc30a10 
knockout mice, we discovered that under basal conditions, brain Mn levels are primarily regulated by 
activity of SLC30A10 in the digestive system, while its activity in the brain protected against 
neurotoxicity during Mn overexposure. This work established the predominance of SLC30A10 in 
regulating brain Mn levels and presented a novel method for studying Mn neurotoxicity. Subsequent 
work will use pan-neuronal/glial, catecholaminergic, and GABAergic Slc30a10 knockouts to selectively 
increase Mn in all, catecholaminergic, or GABAergic neurons. This study will test the hypothesis that 
catecholaminergic, but not GABAergic, Slc30a10 knockouts mimic the phenotype observed in panneuronal/glial knockouts. Proposed experiments will assay for Mn-induced changes in motor function, 
neurodegeneration, neurotransmission, and gene expression under normal conditions and during an 
oral Mn exposure relevant to human disease. The proposed study uses a multidisciplinary approach to 
further elucidate how brain Mn homeostasis is regulated and how excess brain Mn impacts the 
catecholaminergic and GABAergic systems. Proposed studies will be performed under the supervision 
of sponsor, Dr. Somshuvra Mukhopadhyay and co-sponsor, Dr. Robert Messing at the University of 
Texas at Austin (UT Austin). Dr. Mukhopadhyay is an expert in Mn toxicology, and Dr. Messing has a 
well-established career in neuroscience. Their combined expertise and the collaborative environment at 
UT Austin are critical for the successful completion of the proposed study and for providing the training 
and mentorship necessary for the applicant’s goals of a career in academia and neuroscience 
research."
10928172,"There is increasing evidence for a profound and persistent impact of childhood stress and trauma on psychological and physical health outcomes over the lifespan. The strength and consistency of these associations has led to a paradigm shift in approaching adult disease in which addressing the early childhood origins of health and disease is considered to be equal to if not more critical than intervention efforts with adults. However, despite the magnitude of risk associated with adverse childhood experiences, there is limited understanding of the precise mechanisms by which early adversity impacts health. We propose to establish a Phase I Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) for Stress, Trauma, and Resilience (STAR) at The Miriam Hospital to address this critical gap. The STAR COBRE is unified by a conceptual framework focused on (a) isolating/disentangling specific stress exposures and traumas, and (b) identifying proximal mechanisms of risk and resilience with in-vivo ecological sampling that will lead rapidly to novel and actionable intervention targets to improve health. The COBRE incorporates a life course approach, with an emphasis on sensitive periods of development—pregnancy, childhood, and young adulthood. Three promising, early career Project Leaders, a junior faculty recruit with expertise in STAR, and a pilot project program funded by The Miriam Hospital form the nexus of the STAR COBRE. Co-mentorship by two leading NIH-funded scientists with complementary expertise will catalyze the transition of the Project Leaders to independent funding. Dr. Bublitz will utilize cutting-edge ecological methods to understand links between maternal history of childhood sexual abuse and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Dr. Evans will conduct a naturalistic experiment in children to elucidate the specific impact of food insecurity from other poverty-related stressors on diet, inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers and summer weight gain; Dr. Vergara-Lopez will utilize a novel dimensional approach to childhood maltreatment to contrast the impact of deprivation (neglect) vs. threat (abuse) on young adult emotion regulation strategies and mental health symptoms. To support Project Leaders and the STAR COBRE, we will establish an Administrative Core, including a community advisory board and a state-of-the art Mentoring and Education program, and two research cores: the Technology, Assessment, Data, and Analysis (TADA) Core will support methods harnessing cutting-edge technology, data management and statistics; the Community Collaborative (CC) Core will support recruitment/retention of underserved and diverse populations and community partnerships. The STAR COBRE will serve as the only research center in Rhode Island focused on stress, trauma, and resilience. Our long-term goal is to develop and sustain a critical mass of investigators to establish The Miriam Hospital as a vibrant regional and national hub for transformative research into mechanisms of risk and resilience following childhood exposure to stress, trauma, and adversity."
10895408,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Homeostasis is a feature of all bodily structures and
represents the maintenance of stability within these structures to facilitate optimal functioning. During
aging or with the development of diseases, homeostenosis or a narrowing of the functional reserves
necessary to preserve homeostasis, occurs. The loss of functional reserve in one system leads to the
body depleting other reserve systems to maintain function. Eventually, the continual use and depletion
of multiple reserve systems leads to frailty which greatly affects the ability of the body to function and
makes individuals more susceptible to negative health outcomes. Eating and drinking represent body
functions vital to achieving nutritional homeostasis which is necessary for survival. Dysphagia, or
swallowing impairment, is a threat to maintaining nutritional homeostasis as deficits in swallowing
safety (airway invasion) and efficiency (residue) can lead to malnutrition and dehydration. The loss of
functional reserves has been implicated to contribute to the development of dysphagia in diseases and
in the elderly, however, the dysregulation of homeostatic mechanisms and its’ effect on optimal
swallowing function is not understood. The overarching goal of this fellowship proposal is to investigate
mechanisms of homeostatic dysfunction as it relates to the development of swallowing impairments. In
the F99 phase of this proposed research, I will evaluate the impact of functional reserve depletion in
one structure important for swallowing (the tongue) on swallowing function in individuals with ALS.
Specifically, I will develop a novel lingual pressure protocol to determine patterns of lingual functional
reserve decline in ALS and examine potential relationships between lingual pressure patterns and
lingual reserve depletion with functional aspects of swallowing safety and efficiency. I will also evaluate
whether a critical threshold of homeostenotic lingual functional reserve depletion exists wherein lingual
and swallowing impairments ensue. During the K00 phase, I will move to a complementary laboratory
to investigate swallowing function in the frail elderly with multiple, diminished functional reserves and
evaluate the physiological differences in swallowing function that occur in the frail elderly versus normal
aging. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to generate the knowledge necessary for the future
development of biologically informed therapeutics to target swallowing dysfunction across various

homeostatic mechanisms and functional reserve in vulnerable populations (ALS and the elderly) and
will yield a novel lingual pressure testing protocol (F99 phase) and characterization of frail swallowing in

functions of eating and drinking."
10760267,"DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cerebrovascular dysfunction accompanies nearly all of the
known forms of tauopathies--a form of neurodegenerative disorders that result in impaired memory,
executive function, and general cognitive decline. Recent efforts to understand the mechanisms
underlying traumatic brain injury (TBI) have revealed several startling similarities between the
pathologies associated with neurodegenerative diseases and those following TBI. Combined, these
findings suggest a potential relationship between aberrant neural mechanical and stress cognitive
decline. Neurovasculature and the network of ventricles and aqueducts within the brain are known to
fluctuate in volume with changes in blood flow and age--both of which are risk factors for dementia.
Central neurons surrounding these dynamic structures are hypothesized to possess multiple types of
molecular protein sensors that respond to physical environmental changes, though few studies have
directly studied these receptors and their role in health and disease. To address this knowledge gap,
the work proposed here aims to quantify the effects of the extracellular mechanical environment on
neural function. To achieve this aim, the candidate will achieve two proposed scientific aims first as a
PhD student during the F-99 phase of the award, and then as a postdoctoral scholar during the K-00
phase of the award. The first aim of this proposal presents dissertation research completed to date by
the candidate in the sponsor’s lab. This completed research demonstrates the feasibility of the work
proposed in Aims 2 and 3. In Aim 2, the candidate will continue their research studying the effects of
extracellular mechanics on mechanosensory neuron function in an invertebrate model, C. elegans,
whose touch sensation mirrors touch receptors in the human peripheral nervous system. This work
combines state-of-the-art, correlative force spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy with neuronal
culture in three-dimensional, tunable, viscoelastic substrates. For the K-00 phase of this award, as
described in Aim 3, the candidate will extend the clinical relevance of this work by studying i n vitro
neural mechanics in vertebrate models of disease. Broadly, the candidate’s research interest for the
postdoctoral scholarship is to (1) identify intracranial sources of mechanical strain, (2) address how
these strains alter central neuron function, and (3) use these findings as a springboard for identifying
novel classes of mechanoreceptors in central neurons. The training support provided by this award will
serve as a springboard with which the candidate will launch their career as an independent
neuroscientist, working at the interface of engineering and neuroscience to identify
mechanotransduction signalling pathways in central neurons and their role in neurodegeneration. The
candidate’s long-term career goal is to establish a research program that will employ an understanding
of basic neurobiology to identify therapeutic targets."
10895601,"PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): 
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is one of the most common childhood disorders (1 in 44 ). Individuals 
with ASD have a higher prevalence of challenging behavior (e.g., aggression, self-injury, emotion 
dysregulation) that interferes with adaptive development, ranks among the most common causes for 
referral to behavioral healthcare services, and incurs high healthcare costs. Over the past four years, the 
team at Northeastern University has made significant research progress developing machine learning 
procedures that automate the detection of challenging behavior onsets in individuals with ASD using 
wearable biosensor data (cardiovascular, electrodermal, and physical activity). Despite our promising 
results, issues still need to be addressed to enable practical daily use in real-world contexts. This includes 
the need for extensively labeled data, individual calibration from population models to specific individuals, 
and handling the non-stationary nature of challenging behavior and physiological data. This project aims 
to advance fundamental machine learning theory and techniques that facilitate rapid model 
individualization and continuous online model adaptation with little or no labeled data. To this end, we will 
contribute to areas including domain adaptation, transfer learning, lifelong learning, and robust modeling 
and inference. Three Specific Aims guide the project: (1) Rapid physiological and behavioral data model 
individualization; (2) Continuous lifelong physiological and behavioral data model adaptation; and (3) 
Validation of model individualization and adaptation techniques with prospective data collected in a clinical 
setting from our partners at the Marcus Autism Center at Emory University who specialize in functional 
analysis of challenging behavior in individuals with ASD. Across these Aims, we will explore applications 
of semi-supervised learning theory, data importance weighting, Support Vector Machines, neural network 
models, Hierarchical Markov-Modulated Point Process Models, and Bayesian evidence fusion. The 
modeling and inference techniques we develop will be of general applicability to other health application 
contexts involving event prediction (e.g., seizure detection) and human action/decision-making (e.g., 
intensive care unit triage)."
11042070,"There is a demand for estrogen-free contraception in order to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), particularly for obese women. A new long-acting formulation of levonorgestrel butanoate (LB) delivered by injection has been developed. Levonorgestrel (LNG) has a long history of clinical use in a variety of contraceptives (pills, intrauterine devices, and implants) and its efficacy and safety are well recognized.  The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) has a mission to develop safe and effective contraceptives for women, including obese women. Obesity is the number one public health issue facing the US population and is an independent risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE).  Therefore, there is a public health need to develop effective contraception for obese woman that does not increase the risk of VTE. One Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved contraceptive method is the progestin-only pill (POP) or so-called ""mini pill"" which is used mainly by lactating women only for several months and requires strict adherence to taking the POP at the same time every day.  A long-acting injectable form of LB that is estrogen-free will provide a regimen that is easier to follow than a POP and have a theoretically lower risk of VTE especially for obese women. In order to provide preliminary evidence that LB could be effective for contraception, a clinical trial was initiated through the NICHD Contraceptive Clinical Trials Network (CCTN), in which LB was administered to women of reproductive age in order to evaluate its pharmacokinetics, mechanisms of  contraceptive efficacy, and safety. The enrolled subjects have received LB via intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of injection. Recruitment has included enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI >=30 kg/m2 but less than 40 kg/m2. Thus far, all activities related to Groups A,  B, and B2 have been completed. Out of concern for possible hepatotoxicity and safety, the FDA had placed a partial clinical hold on subcutaneous LB and suggested a single ascending dose study using 50mg and 60mg. Recruitment for Group C (50mg) has concluded and enrollment for this group is nearly  complete. This task will provide for the statistical and clinical coordination, for the follow-up, and monitoring of subjects currently enrolled in Group Caswell as supporting services for the recruitment, enrollment, coordination, follow-up, monitoring, and completion of all activities related to subjects in Group D."
11040135,"Project Summary/Abstract
The brain is composed of many densely interconnected regions, in constant communication and interaction
with each other; cognition and behavior emerge from this interacting network. Yet, to date the vast majority of
our knowledge regarding brain function, at cellular resolution, has come from studies focused on single brain
regions. Understanding the joint cellular-resolution dynamics of large sets of brain regions remains a major
challenge for two main reasons. The first is (a) experimental: simultaneous recordings, from many regions
across the brain, with sufficient power to identify neural dynamics at a fine timescale and cellular resolution
remain extremely rare, meaning that the joint dynamics are rarely even measured in spiking datasets. The
second obstacle is (b) analytical: even when recordings from multiple regions are available, analysis methods
for understanding communication and interactions across many regions, at cellular resolution, are limited and
still under development. We propose to address both of these challenges head on. We will develop methods
for chronic electrophysiological recordings from hundreds of neurons in each of tens of regions across the
brain. We expect to record from 6,000 to 12,000 neurons simultaneously in well-trained, freely-moving rats. We
will also develop modeling and analysis methods to understand the interactions between brain regions
contained in that data. We will do this in the context of elucidating the multi-region interactions underlying the
accumulation of sensory evidence for decision-making. Moreover, to begin to understand to what extent our
findings generalize to other types of decision-making, we will also apply our methods to a value-based
reward-guided task, and compare across the two tasks."

10848240,"Abstract
Despite remarkable progress in treating B cell malignancies, T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors
(CARs) remain largely ineffective in solid tumors. We demonstrated that unlike conventional T and CAR-T cells,
Vα24-invariant natural killer T cells (NKTs) and CAR-NKTs effectively traffic to tumor sites in xenogeneic models
of neuroblastoma (NB), which led to initiation of a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial evaluating autologous GD2-
specific CAR-NKTs in children with NB. Interim results from this trial have shown that the treatment is well-
tolerated and produces antitumor activity, underscoring the need for systematic investigation of NKTs as an
alternative cellular platform for CAR-redirected immunotherapy. We reported that repeated antigenic stimulation
of NKTs and CAR-NKTs leads to their effector-like differentiation, exhaustion, and loss of antitumor activity. Our
preliminary data demonstrate that Wnt signaling—specifically, activation of transcription factor LEF1—is required
and sufficient for maintenance of the CD62L+ central memory-like NKT subset and is associated with NKT
metabolic and functional fitness. These findings provide rationale for examining the role and potential therapeutic
targeting of LEF1 in CAR-NKTs for cancer immunotherapy. Pre-clinical in vivo studies of CAR-NKTs have been
limited to xenogeneic models, which do not allow for evaluation of the full spectrum of downstream innate and
adaptive immune responses. To address this gap, we have developed protocols to generate and expand highly
pure murine NKTs that express a murine CAR targeting the GD2 antigen expressed on human and murine NB
cells. We have also adapted a syngeneic NB model that faithfully recapitulates the clinical and pathological
characteristics of high-risk NB in children. We hypothesize that 1) LEF1 transcriptional activity is required for
and can be therapeutically enhanced to maintain CAR-NKT cell metabolic fitness, in vivo persistence, and
durable antitumor activity; and 2) CAR-NKT antitumor activity depends on direct targeting of tumor cells, control
of tumor-associated macrophages, transactivation of NK cells and induction of tumor-specific T cells. These
hypotheses will be tested in the following specific aims: 1) to examine and therapeutically explore the
mechanism responsible for maintenance of human central memory-like NKT and CAR-NKT cells, and 2) to
explore the mechanism by which CAR-NKTs mediate antitumor activity in a syngeneic NB model. We will use
genetic loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches to study the role of LEF1 in CAR-NKT functional
differentiation, metabolism, and antitumor activity using in vitro experimental systems with human cells and in
vivo xenogeneic NB models in mice. To study the mechanism by which CAR-NKTs mediate antitumor activity in
the syngeneic setting, we will perform a side-by-side comparison of murine NKTs and T cells expressing a GD2-
specifc CAR. The proposed experiments will mechanistically dissect the contributions of the native NKT cell
TCR, the tumor-specific CAR, and therapy-induced innate and adaptive immune responses. The results will
inform development of next-generation CAR-NKT immunotherapy for NB and other types of cancer."
11191354,"There is an urgent need for near physiological organ-on-chip models that can replace testing in animals for human drug development. The Organ-on-VascularNet platform is a 3D organoid tissue model with selfassembled vascular networks that enables pharmaceutical testing in both normal and malignant tissues. Organ-on-VascularNet models will be exposed to a combination of x-ray irradiation and interferon â (IFN-â) treatment, and the cellular and molecular responses will be compared to the outcomes observed in vivo. We expect that the Organ-on-VascularNet model will allow for the near-physiological interactions of components of the circulating immune system with the resident tissue, which characterize the responses observed in vivo. Thus, IFN-â treatment should protect normal intestinal tissue for radiation-induced damage and should sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Successful recapitulation of the in vivo responses suggests a role for the Organ-on-VascarNet model in drug development. We will discuss the potential of this technology with the FDA under their Drug Development Tool (DDT) and Innovative Science and Technology Approaches for New Drugs (ISTAND) programs."

This project has two main goals: measuring the impact of research data reuse on diversity and novelty, 
and identifying synergistic data-method-researcher combinations to spur scientific discovery. 
Access to scientific data is critical for advancing research quality and efficiency. Yet, bibliometric studies 
have uncovered biases in publication impact and citation patterns, raising concerns that such disparities 
might affect how researchers reuse data. Developing robust metrics to identify and rectify these 
imbalances is the focus of this work. 
The project will construct networks and graph databases that connect research objects such as 
publications, analysis code, datasets, and variables. These networks will provide insight into datasets' 
influence on research diversity, author interactions, and code reuse for scientific advancements. Focusing 
on biomedical research allows for a varied examination of the types of data, outputs, and potential 
high-impact findings, like new therapeutics or research methods. 
Initially, the project will create knowledge graphs from ICPSR and PhysioNet datasets, supplemented with 
author and code metadata from databases like Dimensions and OpenAlex. Subsequent phases will 
assess the impact of data through diversity and novelty metrics, refined in consultation with stakeholders. 
Finally, the project will recommend strategic partnerships to promote equitable data use and 
groundbreaking reuse applications."
10935953,"Project Summary
Linking genotype to phenotype is a unifying goal of genetics and is an important strategy for determining
how biological systems operate in health and disease. This project develops new computational tools in
the context of this FOA in computational genomics to link changes in genes and regulatory regions to the
evolution of specific organismal phenotypes. It then applies those tools to multiple biological traits in
mammals, birds, and fungi. The tools are present in our widely used comparative genomics package,
RERconverge. RERconverge uses the power of convergent evolution, in which different species have
repeatedly evolved the same phenotype or trait, to provide statistical repetition to locate genomic regions
whose evolutionary rates responded to a particular convergent phenotype. The first goal of this project
builds upon the RERconverge toolkit to analyze non-coding, potentially regulatory, regions of the
genome. Regulatory regions evolve in a modular way that could be better analyzed with methods that
operate at the scale of specific functional elements, such as transcription factor binding sites, and other
methods that do not require aligned nucleotides between species, such as models derived from machine
learning of regulatory elements. The aim then applies these methods to identify regulatory regions
responsible for the evolution of large body size in mammals and birds. The second aim creates a new
method to identify adaptive changes that led to a convergent phenotype, since adaptive change often
leads to novel organismal traits. Currently, our convergent evolution methods and others in the field do
not cleanly distinguish between regions experiencing adaptive evolution from those under reduced
constraint. This aim will create specific codon model tests to address that deficit and applies them in
primates and rodents to identify reproductive genes under positive selection in the context of sperm
competition. The third aim is to speed up key functions of the RERconverge platform to allow more
statistically robust analyses and to accommodate contemporary datasets of hundreds of species or more.
The project will also benchmark and apply these new methods to locate genes, non-coding regions, and
specific transcription factor sites responsible for convergent phenotypes of biomedical importance, such
as body size, fertilization, eyesight, metabolism, and transposable element activity. The culmination of
this research program will enable the rapid identification of genes and regulatory elements underlying
countless morphological and physiological traits, thereby propelling experimental and medical genetics
research with the power of evolutionary biology."
10928178,"The COBRE for Stress, Trauma, and Resilience (STAR) will establish a transformative, transdisciplinary Miriam Hospital research center focused on the biobehavioral mechanisms through which childhood stress, trauma, and adversity impact health outcomes across development. Childhood adversity is a major risk factor for physical and mental health problems across the lifespan, yet those with adverse exposures are highly likely to be underserved due to socioeconomic position. Children and adults from disadvantaged backgrounds, including racial and ethnic minorities, individuals living in poverty, and sexual minority and gender diverse populations are at substantially heightened risk of exposure to adversity. Further, although disadvantaged communities are most likely to experience adversity and trauma, they are often difficult to reach and engage in research as a result of societal discrimination, medical mistrust, marginalization, stigma, and economic and structural factors. Specialized infrastructure to address the practical, ethical, and clinical issues in research with underserved populations is critical for long-term success of the STAR COBRE. The Community Collaborative (CC) Core will support the overall goals of the STAR COBRE by building critical infrastructure to support clinically significant and highly innovative research with underserved children and adults with stress and trauma histories. The CC Core will provide resources and support targeted to developing capacity to successfully recruit and retain difficult to reach populations, while maintaining to standards in the ethical conduct of research with children and adults with stress and trauma histories. The CC Core will also provide support to enhance existing and build new community partnerships, and to increase competence of COBRE faculty and staff regarding issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Alongside prevention, treatment, and supply reduction, harm reduction is a cornerstone of the National Drug Control Strategy. However, there is a critical gap in research on the occupational health of Harm Reduction Workers (HRWs), who are exposed to high rates of lifetime and occupational stress and trauma. High rates of unaddressed occupational stress have been shown to have an adverse impact on patient care and are linked to unmet mental health needs, turnover, burnout, and relapse. HRWs need an occupational stress intervention program that addresses both systems and individual occupational challenges while promoting the capacity to engage with the complex demands of delivering safe high-quality harm reduction care to people who use drugs (PWUD). Stress First Aid is a promising intervention that has been implemented with several first responder groups and in healthcare settings, but it requires adaptation to HRWs and it needs to be studied against a control group in a rigorous clinical trial. In the R61 planning phase (Aims 1-4) of this proposal, focus groups comprised of HRWs and leaders from HROs will be convened to adapt the SFA training content and to inform the SFA training delivery methods that will be piloted in a field test (N = 15). Findings will be integrated into a clinical trial protocol. In the R33 phase of this proposal (Aims 5 and 6), we will conduct a cluster-randomized hybrid type I trial (N = 534) testing the effectiveness of participation in an Addiction Technology Transfer Center (ATTC)-facilitated SFA training and learning collaborative support compared to a no treatment control condition on the following primary outcomes: social-support, burnout and use of SFA
concepts. Secondary outcomes are secondary traumatic stress, use of mental health care, engagement, and turnover. The long-term goal of our work is to implement a sustainable and effective occupational stress intervention for HRWs nationally in order to strengthen their important role in the substance misuse work force. Key innovations include: 1) use of ATTCs to provide overarching structure to SFA trainings for HRWs in order to strengthen organizational capabilities to implement and to accelerate findings into practice; 2) first ever adaptation of Stress First Aid to unique occupational context and needs of HRWs; 3) use of qualitative methods to co-adapt and co-design Stress First Aid content, training methods and research methods with and
for HRWs; 4) potential to enhance trust and engagement with between ATTCs and HRWs which could enhance diffusion of best practices. If effective, widespread adoption of SFA could improve workforce capacity for high quality care for PWUD."

Moment-to-moment infant-parent interactions are a central context in which infants learn to regulate emotions. Investigating infant-parent interactions in which emotion regulation unfolds is particularly important for infants at risk for emotion dysregulation and/or relationship disturbance, including infants with prenatal substance exposure. Yet, current state-of-the art methods to assess infant emotion regulation and infant-parent interaction predominantly rely on brief laboratory tasks. These procedures pose burdens on participants, especially families
experiencing demographic and psychosocial risk, and place limits on generalizability and ecological validity of findings. Technological advances in (a) machine learning methods, including deep learning approaches that mine for complex patterns in raw unlabeled data, and (b) wearable sensors have the potential to transform our ability to capture infants’ moment-to-moment emotional experiences in their real-world environments, while also lowering burden on families participating in infant research. With these issues in mind, we will develop next-generation methods to assess infant emotion regulation and infant-parent interaction. In doing so, we will use
LittleBeats, an infant multimodal wearable device developed by our team, to collect time-synced data on infant and parent vocalizations (via microphone), infant motor activity (via motion sensor), and infant cardiac vagal tone (via electrocardiogram [ECG]) for extended periods of time (~8-10 hours per day) in the home. We propose three specific aims. First, we will validate a virtual visit protocol for the gold-standard Still Face Paradigm, which is typically conducted in a laboratory setting, for assessing emotion regulation among infants during the first year of life. Second, we will validate multimodal deep learning algorithms to detect infant emotional states in real time
using LittleBeats audio, ECG and motion data. Third, we will validate deep learning algorithms to detect and label vocalization types of infants (babble, fuss, cry, laugh) and parents (infant-direct speech, adult-directed speech, sing, laugh), which create the build blocks of infant-parent vocal interactions, such as turn taking. By bringing together innovative wearable technology with cutting-edge deep learning algorithms, we aim to advance understanding of the mechanisms through which prenatal substance exposures contribute to adverse outcomes. Further, prenatal substance exposure is a heterogeneous phenomena that transacts with environmental risk and
protective factors, thereby making a one-size-fits-all approach ineffective. By monitoring moment-to-moment changes in infants’ emotion regulation, combined with deep learning algorithms that detect and classify infant-parent interactions during moments when infant show signs of distress, the proposed methods have the potential to transform our understanding of the dynamic processes through which prenatal substance exposure leads to poor outcomes and pinpoint protective factors that promote optimal development."

Early childhood caries (ECC) disproportionately affects children from low-income households and ethnic minority communities. Dysbiosis of oral microbiota, including enrichment of cariogenic bacteria and yeast, increase the risk for ECC. Previous research indicated connections between in-utero and early-life nutrition intake and gut microbiome development. Yet, the impact of in-utero and early-life nutrition intake on maternal and children’s oral microbiome remains unclear. As an augmentation to the parent award R01DE031025 Oral Microbiome in Early Infancy (OMEI), we propose this supplement OMEI + Nutrition. The parent OMEI studies the early-life biological factors underlying ECC racial disparity via a valuable underserved birth cohort. In the OMEI+ Nutrition supplement, we expand the factors to include perinatal nutritive (such as dietary iron intake) and nonnutritive behavior (such as pica) to examine their potential relationships with oral microbiomes during pregnancy and early life.
Our central hypothesis is that mothers with nonnutritive eating behavior are associated with a distinct oral microbial community, which influences oral microbiome development in early childhood. We propose the following aims in the OMEI + Nutrition study. Aim 1: Assess the effect of nutritive and nonnutritive eating behavior on the oral microbiome of pregnant women. Aim 2: Assess the impact of maternal nutritive and nonnutritive eating behavior on infants' early-life (birth to 6 months) oral Candida colonization and yeast infection. Aim 3 (Exploratory): assess microbial compositions of pica substances.
The OMEI + Nutrition will be the first study that examines the relationship between nutritive (such as dietary iron intake) and nonnutritive (such as pica) factors on perinatal oral microbiome among underserved US pregnant women and their children. Data generated will strengthen the understanding of children’s oral microbiome development and their association to ECC. Additional risk factors revealed from this OMEI+ Nutrition would be used as targets for prenatal counselling, ECC early prediction and prevention, specifically suitable for underserved women and children.
This OMEI + Nutrition will be conducted by the diversity supplement applicant, Dr. Brenda Abu, a Nutritionist-Researcher, who will add her strong nutrition and dietetics background to the already integrated health disparities research team. Dr. Abu enthusiastically intends to develop her career in the interaction of nutrition and oral health among the underserved population. This OMEI + Nutrition supplement will advance her skills and expertise in oral health and oral microbiome research, which will build a solid foundation for a future R01 application that assesses eating behavior and oral microbiome on maternal and children’s oral and systemic health."
10841481,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT 
 TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology is associated with clinical dementia and occurs in more 
than half of clinically diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients (1, 2). The discovery of limbic-predominant 
TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) emphasized the importance of age-related TDP-43 proteinopathy, with or 
without co-morbid AD pathological hallmarks. The lack of disease-modifying agents against TDP-43 pathology 
creates an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic pathways against TDP-43 proteinopathy. Interestingly, 
regional disruption of glucose uptake and utilization is linked to the progression of AD neuropathology (3-5), and 
yet, there is no consensus on the effect of TDP-43 on glucose and energy homeostasis in the diseased brain (6). 
This proposal will address this significant gap in knowledge by studying the impact of the eIF5A hypusination 
pathway on the brain’s metabolic state in TDP-43 pathology. eIF5A is an initiation/elongation factor and the only 
protein undergoing hypusination (eIF5AHyp). Deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and deoxyhypusine hydroxylase 
(DOHH) activity convert a single lysine to a hypusine moiety. Our feasibility data finds that TDP-43 pathology in 
AD brain and TDP-43 mouse models induces DHS expression and hypusine levels. Additionally, we show that 
enhanced hypusination exacerbates TDP-43 pathology, dysregulates brain glucose homeostasis and exerts 
mitochondrial bioenergetic defects. Our central hypothesis states that DHS-targeted strategies reducing 
hypusine levels will ameliorate TDP-43 neuropathogenesis by restoring brain glucose metabolism and 
mitochondrial bioenergetics, upstream of cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. In Aim 1, we will 
establish how conditional deletion of the DHS (DHSko) in the adult forebrain of the TDP-43 transgenic mouse 
model will affect the brain metabolic transcriptomic profile via NanoString analysis and determine biological 
signatures that define the eIF5AHyp - TDP-43 phenotype. We will also utilize the CNS-Met Metabolomics Core to 
measure brain metabolite levels, while biochemically determining metabolic proteins, enzymes, and TDP-43 
pathology. We will further elucidate how DHSko can rescue LTP, cognitive performance, and neurodegeneration 
associated with TDP-43 phenotype of a novel TDP-43 animal model. In Aim 2, we will define the role of eIF5AHyp 
on the mitochondrial bioenergetics of neurons and astrocytic-responsive neurons. We will establish how DHS 
inhibition rescues mitochondrial bioenergetics and restores metabolite balance in primary cells. We will also 
determine the cellular and mitochondrial TDP-43 accumulation and mitochondrial structure integrity. Overall, the 
proposed studies will provide evidence that the eIF5AHyp pathway in the TDP-43 phenotype is upstream of 
irreversible stages of dementia. It also offers the first detailed mechanisms of how reducing hypusine restores 
glucose dysregulation and mitochondrial dysfunction, maintaining neuro-astrocytic support and healthy neuronal 
activity, while rescuing the pathological phenotype in animal models of TDP-43 proteinopathy."

multiomics (genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics/lipidomics), gene-editing, cellular assays, and imaging. 
The Core will continue to serve as a nucleus for the development of research and educational programs aimed 
at increasing the competitiveness of extramural research funding across MS through implementation of 
advanced technologies to answer important biomedical questions. During the previous funding period, the ISC 
had a major impact on supporting the MS INBRE and other MS researchers that overall involved 1,197 
projects, more than 64,000 samples, and culminated in 376 abstracts/presentations, 200 peer-reviewed 
publications, and submission of 222 extramural grants. The ISC is committed to enhancing and maintaining 
state-of-art instrumentation and initiating and coordinating the use of research technologies for basic and 
clinical research initiatives in the state of Mississippi. To accomplish this mission, it will provide exemplary 
technical expertise in the field of multiomics, cellular assays, and cutting-edge imaging technology to 
Mississippi investigators with a focus on researchers at undergraduate institutions. ISC will operate with the 
goal of offering timely, high-quality data and analyses at competitive costs, and provide opportunities to 
educate and train students, faculty, and staff at academic institutions that would not have the independent 
resources to implement cutting-edge research technologies. Under the umbrella of the ISC, five core facilities 
(three established and two new) will provide robust Core-facility support that will benefit of all MS investigators 
and provide a mechanism for Core facility directors to build strong interactions with investigators across 
various disciplines in the state. In the proposed project period, as part of enhancing current infrastructure, ICS 
will implement new high-throughput sequencing methods, such as single cell RNA sequencing, spatial 
transcriptomics, metabolomics, development of a new and innovative capability involving CRISPR/Cas9 gene- 
editing technology, along with new bioenergetic cellular assays to allow researchers a complete tool kit to 
interrogate gene function and biological mechanisms. The following aims were developed to accomplish the 
mission of ISC and to further the MS INBRE program: 1) to provide consultation, technical expertise on cutting- 
edge multiomics, gene-editing, bioenergetic assays, and imaging research services to MS INBRE 
investigators; 2) to provide education and training opportunities for students and faculty in the aforementioned 
technologies; and 3) to seek continuous improvement in existing assays, services, and enhance technological 
capabilities through acquisition of new cutting-edge instrumentation that will assist in the sustainability of cores. 
Synergistically, these objectives will cater to researcher needs, and together with the Data Science Core 
(DSC), the ISC will provide an innovative, state-of-the-art infrastructure to enhance and strengthen 
investigation into the molecular underpinnings of biomedically important processes, bolster success in 
extramural research funding, and collaboratively grow MS researcher capabilities."
10850657,"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND TRAINING CORE 
Project Summary/Abstract 
Mississippi is among the most medically underserved states in the nation and infamous for the poorest health 
outcomes. In states like Mississippi, the research workforce is limited by a lack of mentorship and training 
opportunities to conduct health research among underserved communities. The Community Engagement 
and Training Core (CETC) will leverage previously built community infrastructure to engage faculty, students, 
and the public in community-based participatory research (CBPR). It will enable collection of complex 
community data to answer critical biomedical and behavioral questions that will lead to actionable information 
that will translate discovery to practice through intervention research, clinical trials, and health innovations. The 
long-term goal is to improve the health of Mississippians by increasing representation of Mississippi 
communities in research through workforce development of scientists and health professionals. The CETC will 
foster opportunities for transparent and positive research interactions between academics and lay 
communities, increase the representation of Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) and city and state 
entities in research. The CETC will achieve this long term goals through the following specific aims: 1) Support 
pilot projects in CBPR through engaging CBOs with an emphasis on preventable conditions that influence chronic 
and infectious disease prevalence that disproportionately affect minorities, rural populations, and other medically 
underserved groups in Mississippi; 2) Augment biomedical and behavioral research projects at Primarily 
Undergraduate Institutes (PUIs) as well as other academic researchers with CETC infrastructure and 
community engagement initiatives to enhance communication between scientists and medically underserved 
groups; 3) Develop the next generation of scientists and practitioners through an intensive summer research 
program that emphasizes integrated, community participatory approaches to implement science in service of 
addressing health disparities in Mississippi. At the completion of the next award period, the CETC will have 
greatly increased the number of students, faculty and organizations involved in CBPR, furthering Mississippi's 
biomedical and behavioral research infrastructure to improve the health of underserved Mississippi 
communities."
10836544,"Summary
An estimated 6.2 million individuals have Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the US, which is projected to nearly triple
by 2050. Although genetic and several environmental factors help explain the etiology of AD, emerging reports
recognize significant associations between altered diversity, abundance, and composition of the intestinal
microbiota, intestinal dysfunction, loss of epithelial barrier integrity, and the progression of AD. However, it is
difficult to distinguish associations from causal relationships. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the dysbiotic gut
microbial community elicits inflammatory features extending beyond the enteric system and stimulates aberrant
and pathological brain changes. Intestinal homeostasis relies on secreted IgA that coats pathogenic bacteria
and blocks their contact with epithelial receptors to avert inflammatory responses. We will test the idea that
IgA-coated bacteria (IgA-biome) in the dysbiotic intestine are pathogenic and responsible for the direct
potentiation of AD. Our preliminary data using a transgenic AppNL-G-F mouse model of AD demonstrated a
significant increase in the levels of IgA-coated fecal bacteria in female mice. Moreover, 16s rRNA sequencing
of IgA sorted bacteria (IgA-seq) from 12-month-old female AppNL-G-F and C57BL/6 wild-type mice identified
distinct differences in the microbial taxa coated by IgA. These data were concomitant with behavior changes
seen only in the female AppNL-G-F mice suggesting a nexus between the IgA-biome, gut, and brain. We will fully
characterize the longitudinal changes in the IgA-biome by IgA-seq in Aim one and determine whether distinct
IgA coated bacteria correlate with changes in immune phenotype, memory, gliosis, and β-amyloid
accumulation. In Aim two, we will validate the role of IgA in the dysbiosed AD gut by oral gavage transfer of
IgA-biome from old into young mice and assess sex and genotype-dependent changes in behavior, gliosis, β-
amyloid accumulation, and peripheral and intestinal immunomodulatory changes. Our work will provide a new
understanding of the IgA-biome as a contributor to brain changes in AD and may be relevant to other
neurodegenerative conditions. We will also identify the unique age and disease patterns of IgA-biome taxa that
can be potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets."
10850656,"The mission of Ohio State’s MARC program is to train the next generation of biomedical scholars doing impactful research. This will be accomplished by providing undergraduate students at Ohio State with a research-focused training program that includes courses, experiential learning, faculty and graduate student mentoring, and peer support. The long-term goal of the Ohio State MARC program is to encourage students to pursue research careers in fields including, but not limited to, engineering, public health, life and physical sciences, and health sciences – all key to the biomedical sciences. The unifying theme of the Ohio State MARC program is impactful research from molecules to society. We have designed a comprehensive program with a student-level evaluation plan to assess specific and measurable objectives throughout our MARC program and for 15 years after students complete the program. The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework guides the evaluation that is planned to assess the short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes included in our logic model. Following completion of the MARC program, students will: 1) feel a sense of community with their peers and faculty and graduate student mentors; 2) feel a sense of belonging at Ohio State; and 3) increase their self-efficacy for research. We expect that 80% of students will publish at least one paper as co-author or first author, 50% will apply to a doctoral program at graduation and 80% in 3 years, and 80% will have a biomedical science career within 10 years. The MARC program will collect evaluation data annually, evaluate the data with its Internal Advisory Board, and make necessary changes with the goal of continuous program improvement. Despite excellence in research and teaching and dedicated programs for first- and second-year students, Ohio State currently lacks a mentored research program designed to train undergraduate students in the biomedical sciences. The MARC program is designed for students who are interested in engaging in biomedical research broadly defined from molecules to society."
10877657,"Project Abstract for Expanded Program in Chemical Exposure Surveillance
In 2018, 2.1 million poisoning exposures were reported to US Poison Control Centers; 31,316
reports listed the reason for the call as occupational. Workplace injuries and illness caused by
chemical exposures are preventable. Successful interventions to improve workplaces safety
begin with having the data necessary to understand the magnitude of the problem.
North Carolina uses a multipronged surveillance approach to respond to chemical releases and
exposures, with an emphasis on monitoring and preventing occupational injuries. Three
surveillance systems work together to monitor emergency chemical releases and exposures to
two ubiquitous and harmful substances – carbon monoxide and pesticides. This data is
leveraged to inform timely public health response and intervention for specific incidents.
North Carolina is seeking expanded funding in surveillance of chemical exposures to:
1. Integrate chemical exposure surveillance, include acute pesticide poisonings chemical
 releases, and occupational carbon monoxide poisonings into a unified software platform
 for more effective response.
2. Increase capacity to conduct follow-back interviews and referrals for chemical
 exposures, including occupational carbon monoxide poisonings, pesticide poisonings.
3. Provide emergency response support and multidisciplinary occupational health
 consultations to protect public health and employees.
4. Maintain, develop and promote collaborative projects focused on emerging occupational
 health surveillance priorities with a committed network of in-state partners.
5. Work with out-of-state regional and national partners to design and promote best
 practices for occupational surveillance.
Public health surveillance at the state levels has been greatly impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic. Our staff have been deployed to the response since January 2020, which has
delayed several of our routine surveillance activities. However, the recognition that occupation
impacts health has received more national attention and public awareness during the COVID-19
pandemic. Although the lack of industry, occupation, race, and ethnicity information in many
data sources has limited our ability as public health professionals to adequately respond to the
pandemic, we can build on the national recognition to innovate how we monitor and improve
occupational health in this county."
