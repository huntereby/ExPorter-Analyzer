10878426,"Six million Americans have heart failure (HF), a debilitating, progressively chronic disease that is difficult to
manage and profoundly impacts quality of life and survival. Racial and ethnic minorities (e.g., Black and
Hispanic patients) tend to have more HF-related risk factors (e.g., diabetes, hypertension) and
disproportionately higher HF prevalence. These populations are affected by significant disparities in HF care
and outcomes as they are more likely to have their incident HF diagnosed in acute care settings, less likely to
see an HF specialist or receive guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT), more likely to have poor health-
related quality of life, and more likely to have worse HF outcomes (e.g., mortality). Meanwhile, women have
underutilized appropriate non-pharmacologic therapies across the spectrum of HF severity, with Black women
most impacted by biases in the allocation of evidence-based HF therapies. Structural racism and discrimination
(SRD) are pervasive throughout the current system of HF care delivery in the U.S. and are key drivers of
differential HF care and outcomes that systematically disadvantages patients. This proposal focuses on
disadvantages related to patient race, ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, and other identities.
Our preliminary data suggest that the social structure of care delivery—the pattern of social relationships,
practices, and institutions determining the nature and context of care delivery—is a major contributor to SRD in
HF care. Our proposal focuses on examining HF care delivery networks within this structure (i.e., the social
relationships of providers supporting HF care delivery within and across organizations). While evidence-based
HF care and outcomes require robust care delivery networks, networks serving racial and ethnic minority
populations and others disproportionately affected by SRD in HF care delivery are systematically weaker,
contributing to poorer access, care coordination, and outcomes. Large-scale evaluations of the determinants of
these systematic differences are lacking. As care delivery networks are shaped by health system and payer
priorities and strategic plans, their evaluation would identify intervention points to reduce HF care and outcome
disparities. Moreover, the rigor and impact of interventions are enhanced by incorporating stakeholder
perspectives (health system and payers, patients, community) into the design of best practices.
Our long-term goal is to advance equitable care and outcomes for populations disproportionately affected by
SRD in healthcare delivery. This mixed methods proposal will address SRD in HF care by examining
determinants of disparities and identifying stakeholder-informed areas of intervention within care delivery
networks to inform a toolkit to enhance equitable HF care and outcomes. There are three aims: (1) Evaluate
the “social structure of care delivery” for populations disproportionately affected by SRD in HF care delivery
and outcomes; (2) Develop a comprehensive understanding of structural barriers and facilitators for equitable
HF care and outcomes; and (3) Develop a best practices toolkit to address SRD in HF care and outcomes."

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, neurodegenerative disease involving the destruction of myelin
sheaths on neurons resulting in axonal damage leading to permanent functional deficits including paralysis and
loss of vision. In MS, the blood-brain barrier is disrupted allowing fibrinogen to enter the brain and fibrinogen is
a driver of neuropathology. It prevents remyelination and repair of damaged neurons by blocking multipotent
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) from differentiating into myelin producing oligodendrocytes (OL) and
directs OPC cell fate to astrocytes. The rationale for our IGNITE (PAR-21-124) grant is to develop a novel high
throughput OPC-X screen to identify compounds that in the presence of fibrinogen promote OPC differentiation
to mature OLs and decrease the OPC fate-switch to astrocytes to facilitate remyelination of neurons in MS to
slow disease progression. We have already developed a medium throughput OPC-X screen in a 96 well format.
We made the novel finding that fibrinogen prevents remyelination by activating bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP) receptors in OPCs and showed in the assay that small molecule BMP receptor inhibitors (DMH1 and
LDN-212854) increase OL production >80% in a dose-dependent manner and suppressed differentiation to
astrocytes. To validate the utility of the assay we showed that LDN-212854 was effective in vivo in two EAE
animal models of MS; it significantly improved clinical scores, reduced fibrinogen deposition, demyelination, and
myelin damage and increased OPC differentiation to OLs. Our in vitro screening assay is unique because while
some compounds have been identified that increase myelination in MS by stimulating differentiation of OPCs to
OL, they are not designed to overcome the inhibition of remyelination caused by extrinsic factors such as
fibrinogen, are ineffective in our assay and may not promote remyelination under conditions that might be most
relevant to the disease. This is important because therapies to overcome extrinsic inhibition of remyelination are
not widely available and may be critical in the ultimate success in developing more effective treatments of MS.
In the R61 component of the IGNITE grant we will optimize our OPC-X screen for compound screening. In the
R33 component, we will screen 28,690 compounds that increase OPC differentiation to OL in the presence of
fibrinogen. These compounds consist of bio-annotated compounds, comprising FDA approved drugs and
compounds selected on the basis of structural diversity, physicochemical properties consistent with brain
permeability and drug-like properties, including Lipinsky criteria. Effective “hits” will be further screened in
secondary assays we have developed; a safety assay to exclude potential adverse hemorrhagic effects and
assays to identify compounds that may regulate BMP receptor activation, cholesterol synthesis or have
additional anti-inflammatory effects by blocking fibrin-induced inflammation. These compounds will be further
developed in future studies by us to improve drug like properties, with a goal of transitioning to future clinical
development to treat MS patients."

The Behavioral Intervention Development Core will develop innovative and scalable behavioral interventions to
improve healthcare delivery for aging adults. The Core will focus on systematic testing of mechanisms of
behavior change that drive intervention effectiveness. Following the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral
Interventions, the Core will carry out a series of 10 clinical trials. To ensure impactful research, the program
has established a network of six diverse health systems that support research on value-based care. The
External Advisory Committee, comprised of executives from these systems, along with scientific and
methodological experts, plays an integral role in informing the Center's funding priorities and ensuring the
translation of behavioral mechanisms into real-world applications. In the first year, two randomized trials will be
conducted to address barriers to the adoption of value-based practices and explore associated mechanisms of
behavior change. The first study involves adapting a multifaceted medication safety intervention that showed
mixed results in a Stage IV replication of a successful Stage III trial. This intervention will be modified to
incorporate recent findings from behavioral science and will test whether the identity of the messenger
moderates the effect of behavior change. The second trial aims to promote patient uptake of a healthcare
proxy and examines the mediating role of planning prompts. The specific aims of the trials are as follows: Aim
1 will establish an infrastructure for developing and testing potent, scalable interventions that advance scientific
mechanisms of behavior change and employ the NIH Stage Model. This includes maintaining and extending
our network of implementation partners, updating requests for applications and scoring based on scientific
evidence and implementation priorities, and providing support to awardees throughout the research and
intervention development process. Aim 2 will adapt and test a multifaceted medication safety intervention in a
Stage III cluster randomized trial, comparing the effectiveness of different forms of scalable feedback on the
overuse of potentially inappropriate medications. Hypotheses will explore the reduction of medication
prescribing through automated feedback messages based on aspirational social norms and the moderating
effect of different types of messengers. Aim 3 will conduct a Stage III randomized trial to assess the efficacy of
encouraging patients, prior to primary care provider appointments, to complete the health care proxy portion of
an advanced directive, with or without a planning prompt. Hypotheses will examine the impact of an
easy-to-use health care proxy form and the additional effect of a planning prompt on increasing health care
proxy designation. The Core's ultimate goal is to advance the behavioral science of value-based care and
improve the health and well-being of aging populations."
10875276,"A better understanding of the liver’s response to toxic injury, which includes hepatocyte proliferation,
and – unfortunately – an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is a prerequisite for the
development of novel clinical treatments for chronic liver disease and improved cancer prevention. Existing
drug therapies for HCC such as sorafenib extend patient survival by only three months. We recently developed
a massively parallel in vivo screening platform to test the impact of genetic factors such as full-length cDNAs or
miRNAs on liver repopulation and tumorigenesis. We have used this screening technology to build a map of all
miRNAs active in liver regeneration. Here, we propose to exploit this innovative paradigm to conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the effects of the 135 most abundant but evolutionarily conserved hepatic
miRNAs on the processes of recovery from toxic liver injury and HCC tumorigenesis. In Specific Aim 1, we will
determine the combined benefits of three miRNAs identified in our prior screen on liver repopulation following
toxic injuries, as a step toward using miRNA-mimetic drug therapies for liver diseases. This will be
accomplished through delivery of miRNA-encoding plasmids or nanoparticles singly and in all combination. In
Specific Aim 2, we will determine the impact of hepatic miRNAs and miRNA combinations on HCC tumor
development in vivo. To this end, we have developed two models of rapid HCC development in mice, in which
we will screen our library of 135 ‘tough decoys’ (“TuD’s”), or inhibitors of miRNA action, on tumor formation.
We will quantify the abundance of all TuD’s using high throughput sequencing in the tumor-loaded liver
compared to the input library. TuD’s enriched in after tumor formation target miRNAs that normally limit tumor
growth, and those found less abundant target miRNAs that promote tumorigenesis. We will then test the
combinations of the most potent miRNA effectors on tumor formation following systemic delivery. In Specific
Aim 3 we will perform a conditional screen of miRNAs that impact Sorafenib resistance to identify novel
combination treatments for the prevention or treatment of HCC. Together, our powerful genetic screens
promise to identify miRNA effectors that can be employed for the treatment of acute liver injury and, in
combination with Sorafenib, as a more effective treatment to prevent HCC initiation and progression."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for significant morbidity and mortality among persons living with HIV
(PWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Compared to HIV-seronegative individuals, PWH experience higher
risk of acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, and progression of subclinical carotid
atherosclerosis. Chronic inflammation plays a crucial role in increased CVD risk among PWH, as indicated by
elevated soluble and cellular biomarkers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypercoagulation. A
major contributor to this inflammation is the minimal restoration of CD4+ T cells in gut lamina propria and
disturbed CD4+ T cell homeostasis which results in immune dysregulation, compromised gut barrier integrity,
and microbial translocation. We showed that rectal tissue HIV RNA persists after 12 weeks of ART despite
sustained undetectable plasma viral loads and that this residual virus was replication-competent. Additionally,
rectal HIV RNA was associated with increased biomarkers of systemic inflammation, including TNF-𝛂, D-
Dimer, and interleukin-6. Using an integrated multi-OMICS approach including transcriptomal profiling,
metabolomics, pathogen sequencing, and high-density cytokine profiling and flow cytometry, we recently
identified cellular and molecular pathways that regulate immune reconstitution and HIV persistence in two
independent cohorts of ART-treated PWH. Using a similar multi-OMICs approach and complementary
expertise in HIV reservoirs and comorbidities, basic virology/immunology, and cardiovascular
clinical/translational research, we propose to define how rectal HIV persistence promotes mucosal immune
dysregulation and bacterial translocation to drive inflammation and subclinical cardiovascular disease,
providing a framework to identify new therapeutic targets. Three aims are proposed: 1) Assess association
between markers of rectal tissue persistence and systemic inflammation and immune activation; 2) Assess
association between markers of rectal tissue persistence and prevalence/progression of subclinical CVD; and
3) Define mechanisms by which HIV rectal persistence promotes mucosal immune dysregulation, bacterial
translocation, and systemic inflammation to increase CVD risk. To accomplish this, virally-suppressed
PWH on ART (n=100) recruited from the Atlanta MACS/WIHS Combined Cohort Study and Emory CFAR
clinical sites will undergo longitudinal cardiovascular imaging, vascular function assessments, and paired
sampling of blood and rectal tissue to measure: 1) viral persistence; 2) systemic inflammation/immune
activation; 3) gut gene signatures; and 4) circulating microbiome and metabolome. This study
will elucidate how the gut reservoir promotes mucosal immune dysregulation, bacterial translocation, and
systemic inflammation leading to comorbid CVD so that preventative and/or therapeutic intervention
targets can be identified."

Multicellular organisms use intercellular communication to coordinate cell function and maintain tissue
homeostasis. Recent work suggests that this communication is driven in part by the exchange of organelles (via
trans-endocytosis) and mechanical cues directly across cell-cell junctions. Dysregulation of this communication
leads to cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Despite its importance, we lack a fundamental molecular
understanding of how intercellular communication occurs because of the limited number of cell biological tools
capable of probing the molecular mechanisms at cell-cell contacts. This proposal seeks to elucidate the
regulatory mechanisms of the pathways thought to control intercellular communication by studying how they are
manipulated when under microbial control. The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes disseminates through human
tissues using a process called cell-to-cell spread, which is a vesicular-mediated form of intercellular exchange
that mimics host trans-endocytosis. Listeria spreads from cell to cell by mobilizing the host’s actin cytoskeleton
for intracellular motility and transport to the cell-cell junction. Once at the junction, it pushes against the
membrane and forms a double-membrane protrusion that is engulfed by a neighboring cell. Studying this
distinctive spreading process will allow us to examine several outstanding cell biological questions. First, are
specific endocytic pathways used at cell-cell junctions to engulf large cargo like microbes? Second, are
mechanically-sensitive membrane domains or membrane curvature proteins activated as Listeria pushes against
the junction during spread? To answer these questions, we used a high-content, image-based siRNA screen to
test if Listeria requires host intercellular communication pathways during spread. We discovered that the
endocytic and mechanoresponsive caveolar proteins CAV1, CAV2, and PACSIN2 promote Listeria spread. We
also revealed a putative role for 19 other host proteins, including those that regulate membrane curvature, trans-
endocytosis, and adhesion. Our preliminary findings suggest the overall hypothesis that Listeria subverts multiple
intercellular communication pathways to promote cell-to-cell spread. In Aim 1, we will determine how PACSIN2
and caveolins coordinate their activities to promote the engulfment stage of cell-to-cell spread. In Aim 2, we will
reveal which of the remaining hits regulate Listeria spread specifically, how they function, and if they work
independently or together with caveolae. In the end, our proposed studies will improve our fundamental
understanding of host-microbe interactions and basic cell biology, and may uncover how intercellular
communication goes awry in human disease."

 Emotion communication is a fundamental part of spoken language. For patients with hearing loss who use
cochlear implants (CIs), detecting emotions in speech presents a significant challenge. Deficits in vocal
emotion perception observed in both children and adults with CIs have been linked with poor self-reported
quality of life. For young children, learning to identify others’ emotions and express one’s own emotions is
fundamental to social development. For adults, social communication is key to developing and maintaining
social and professional networks and reducing the risk of social isolation. Yet, little is known about the
mechanisms and factors that shape vocal emotion communication by children and adults with CIs. Primary
cues to vocal emotions (voice characteristics such as pitch) are degraded in CI hearing, but secondary cues
such as duration and intensity remain accessible to patients. Large, unexplained intersubject variability has
been found in CI patients’ emotion identification and in emotions produced by children with CIs. Lack of
knowledge about the sources of such variability presents a significant barrier to progress in CIs. The focus of
this proposal is on the acoustic cues to emotion and how they are used by individual CI patients for the
perception and production of emotional speech. In this application, we propose to test the novel mechanistic
hypothesis that factors that may predict spoken emotion identification and production by CI patients – such as
how long they have had their device (duration of device experience), their age at implantation and their access
to residual acoustic hearing -- act by changing the relative use of primary/secondary acoustic cues (“cue-
weighting”) by the individual patient.
 Over the last decade, we have conducted foundational research that provided valuable information about
key predictors of vocal emotion perception and production by pediatric and adult CI recipients. The work
proposed here will build on this body of work and extend it by using novel methodologies to measure CI users’
reliance on different acoustic cues to emotion (“cue-weighting”). In Aim 1, we will test the following hypotheses:
[H1] that cue-weighting accounts significantly for inter-subject variations in vocal emotion identification by CI
users; [H2] that optimization of cue-weighting patterns is the mechanism by which predictors such as the
duration of device experience and age at implantation benefit vocal emotion identification, In Aim 2, we will test
the hypothesis [H3] that in children with CIs, perceptual cue-weighting, together with early auditory experience
(e.g., age at implantation and/or presence of usable hearing at birth) accounts significantly for inter-subject
variation in emotional productions.
 The knowledge gained from these studies will provide the evidence-base to support the development of
clinical protocols that support emotional communication by child and adult CI patients and will thus benefit
quality of life for CI users across the life span."

10875290,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Advances in cancer immunotherapy have great potential for treating tumors that are refractory to
conventional treatments, and T cells primed ex vivo by natural or artificial antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to
target and kill cancer cells have been shown clinically to improve survival in patients with highly aggressive
cancers. APCs normally prime T cells by presenting a tumor antigen-specific signal 1, consisting of a major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) I molecule with a tumor antigen peptide; a co-stimulatory signal 2 that directs
the action of the T cells upon recognition of the tumor; and a secreted signal 3 for recruitment and activation of
immune cells. Instead of engineering the patient's APCs to direct a T-cell response against a tumor or
fabricating artificial, synthetic APCs, both of which are costly, complex, and/or patient-specific processes, we
propose to reprogram cancer cells themselves to become tumor-derived APCs (tAPCs). Because tumor
cells already intrinsically express signal 1 (tumor antigen in the context of MHC I), they can be engineered in
situ to express the other necessary signals and therefore act as APCs, directing cytotoxic T-cell responses
against themselves. Tumor cells with low MHC I expression will stimulate natural killer (NK) cells to aid this
purpose. We have designed synthetic, non-viral nanoparticles that can deliver DNA to cancer cells with high
efficacy and specificity over healthy tissue, and we will inject these into a tumor mass to induce expression of
signal 2 and signal 3, using two different in vivo orthotopic tumor models (melanoma and triple-negative breast
cancer) and four in vitro tumor models as examples. Our proposed experiments will first optimize the
nanoparticle formulation for high expression and cancer specificity in vitro and in vivo. We will then
demonstrate activation and T and NK cells after reprogramming of cancer cells to express signals 2 and 3
along with signal 1 both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we will show anti-cancer efficacy after intratumoral injection
of these nanoparticles in immunocompetent murine cancer models, with a focus on models of metastasis, and
examine the immunological mechanisms underlying our technology. Importantly, because our goal is to use
DNA-delivery nanoparticles to stimulate the immune system to kill cancer cells, rather than directly killing the
melanoma cells by gene transfer, our strategy requires only a representative subset of malignant cells to be
successfully transfected. If successful, this could result in an affordable, fully synthetic, local, antigen-agnostic
therapy that nevertheless leads to antigen-specific systemic immune rejection of tumors."

The overarching goals of this project are to advance knowledge of the complex pathophysiology of distal
symmetric polyneuropathies (DSP) and frame future interventions for nutritional neuropathies in Zambia
through: 1) assessment of population-based estimates and risk factors for DSP in Zambia’s maize and
cassava staple food zones; 2) comparison of population-based estimates and risk factors to previous clinic-
based data from the same maize-staple districts; 3) and assessing the odds of specific micronutrient
deficiencies among DSP cases and age, gender, and HIV-matched controls from the same districts. To
accomplish these goals, Dr. Kvalsund will focus on acquisition of additional expertise and experience in the
following key areas: 1) advanced epidemiological methods and analysis; 2) clinical trials methodologies, 3)
global health policy; 4) neuropathy outcome assessments; and 5) HIV and nutrition. The needed skills will be
achieved through structured mentorship, coursework, and pragmatic clinical trials and health policy
experiences. The research-training plan will provide Dr. Kvalsund with the additional proficiency necessary to
undertake future intervention research aimed at reducing nutrition-associated neurologic morbidity in Zambia
and advancing scientific knowledge of the pathophysiologic mechanisms that generate DSP as a common
phenotype. The central hypothesis is that the high rate of DSP previously observed in clinic populations in
Zambia is equally prevalent outside healthcare settings owing to common endemic infectious diseases and
their neurotoxic treatments, food insecurity and low dietary diversity, recurrent nutritional challenges, specific
micronutrient deficiencies and their interactions, and possibly other unidentified latent factors. We hypothesize
that folate-deficiency will be highly associated with DSP in Zambian communities, as has been documented in
clinic populations, and may warrant a targeted public health intervention given the preventable nature and
range of other neurologic morbidities also associated with folate deficiencies. The specific aims are to: 1)
Determine population-based DSP estimates in Zambia; 2) Compare and contrast DSP estimates and risk
factors with those from clinical settings in Zambia; 3) to consider the relative contributions of urbanicity,
agroecological/staple food zone, and specific micronutrient deficiencies on DSP prevalence; and 4) Evaluate
for latent environmental or toxico-dietary factors as contributors to DSP in this environment. The research is
expected to provide the foundation for future R-01 intervention and observational research and to improve
scientific understanding of how diverse etiologies, multiple exposures and interactions lead to a common
clinicopathologic DSP phenotype, which remains poorly understood to date."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with significant costs to both the individual and society. Genetic and
environmental factors contribute to the risk of AUD and excessive drinking, and a better understanding of the
specific risk genes will allow for novel strategies for prevention and treatment. Recent well-powered human
genome wide association studies (GWAS) of AUD and alcohol consumption have begun to identify multiple
novel candidate genes. As increasing numbers of genes are implicated, it will be imperative to have
researchers trained to work at the interface between human and animal model research. This will allow for the
translation of genetic findings across organisms for follow-up and characterization of novel genetic
mechanisms. This proposal involves training in two converging strategies for translational genetic research in
AUD and excessive drinking. Aim 1 will provide training in prioritizing genetic hits from human GWAS for
follow-up in animal studies using new mutant mouse lines. The goal of Aim 1 is to move from identification of
genes in GWAS to mechanistic characterization using mouse models. Mutant mouse lines developed based on
GWAS hits will be evaluated on a variety of behavioral assays to identify which aspects of drinking behavior
are altered by the genetic manipulation; the ultimate goal of these studies will be to develop an optimized
behavioral framework for assessing gene effects on AUD-relevant behaviors. Behavioral assays will include a
measure of initiation of acute binge-like drinking and drinking microstructure (Drinking in the Dark), escalation
of drinking in post-dependent animals and negative affective changes in withdrawal (chronic intermittent
alcohol vapor exposure model), and sensitivity to the positive and negative motivational effects of alcohol
(alcohol effects on intracranial self-stimulation). Aim 2 will utilize a complementary translational genetic
approach that seeks to discover genes using a genetically diverse mouse population. Specifically, mice from
the LGxSM Advanced Intercross Line will be tested on a phenotypically-rich model of binge-like alcohol
drinking (Drinking in the dark with lickometers) to characterize consumption, blood alcohol levels, and detailed
characterization of drinking bout structure. The goal of this experiment is to identify novel genes associated
with not only overall consumption, but also specific aspects of the drinking pattern. This aim will provide
significant training in advanced statistical methods for bout analysis and in the quantitative genetics skills
needed for mouse GWAS. Together, the studies proposed here will yield critical biological insights into the
genetics of AUD and excessive drinking."

There is a global emphasis and critical need to close the patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) evidence
to practice gap. Forty percent of patients do not receive evidence-based practice, 20% receive unnecessary or
potentially harmful care, and sadly, the list continues. We believe interoperable clinical decision support (CDS)
is an indispensable solution to help close this gap; however, poor design, lack of interoperability, and
implementation barriers hinder broad adoption. At the University of Minnesota, we have extensive experience
implementing and scaling user-centered CDS systems, with over 20 use cases scaled each year. Importantly,
we have developed and implemented both interoperable and federally-funded CDS systems. Our healthcare
system leverages a rigorous approach, SCALED (SCaling AcceptabLE cDs), to guide CDS scaling across the
system. But, the current climate of each healthcare system developing “home-grown” CDS for the exact same
guidelines is not tenable. Building capabilities to rapidly translate PCOR to the bedside at scale and share
interoperable CDS routinely with an updated knowledge base (living evidence synthesis) is necessary. Given
this, we partnered with Apervita, developers of a healthcare technology platform for digital quality measurement
and decision support, to develop an interoperable clinical practice guideline leveraging CPG-on-FHIR (Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources) to prevent inpatient COVID-19 venous thromboembolism (VTE).
The proposed R18 project will adapt a currently deployed CDS system to also deliver a VTE prevention guideline
for adult patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). We believe this is an ideal PCOR use case given PCORI’s
continued effort to combat VTE in trauma and our experience previously implementing this guideline.
Our overall goal is to successfully scale, evaluate, and maintain an interoperable TBI CDS across our 4-institution
collaborative network. For Aim 1, we will conduct a Hybrid Type 2 randomized stepped wedge effectiveness-
implementation trial to scale the CDS across 4 heterogeneous healthcare systems. Trial outcomes will be
assessed using RE-AIM. Despite best efforts, it highly likely CDS adoption will vary across each site; Aim 2 will
allow us to understand why. In Aim 2, we will evaluate implementation processes across trial sites guided by the
EPIS implementation framework (determinant framework) using mixed-methods. Finally, it is critical that PCOR
CPGs are maintained as evidence evolves. To date an accepted process for evidence maintenance does not
exist. In Aim 3, we will pilot a “Living Guideline” process model for the VTE prevention CDS systems.
Ultimately, this project will scale CDS across a diverse collaborative CDS community serving as an important
demonstration of this critical healthcare challenge. We will integrate lessons learned for a planned national
scaling in collaboration with engagement of U.S. trauma societies. Importantly, we will develop electronic health

Innate lymphoid cells or ILCs are recently characterized constitutes of vertebrate immune system. They share a
common lymphoid progenitor in bone marrow with T and B cells but lack antigen-specific receptors. ILCs localize
in many tissues of both mice and humans but are enriched in barrier surfaces such as lung, gut and skin, where
they directly respond to ‘alarmin’ cytokine signals released from inflamed or injured tissues. By producing an
array of ‘effecter’ cytokines, ILCs initiate and amplify downstream immune reactions, thus are considered to be
critical early protectors in host defense. Increasing evidence indicates that ILCs also play important roles in tissue
remolding, metabolic homeostasis, inflammation and autoimmune disorders. My research vison is to understand
the biological principles and molecular basis of ILC activation, migration, and their immunological functions.
ILCs were generally believed to be tissue-resident cells and they don’t circulate even during infection. But this
major concept of ILC has been completely changed by my recent discovery of a new ILC population, termed
inflammatory or induced ILC2s, which migrate from the gut to the lung during helminth infection. Those findings
establish a new paradigm of ILC biology: though ILCs, or ILC2s at a minimum, are largely tissue resident in the
steady state, they become mobile during infection and contribute to distal immune protection. With this new
paradigm, many fundamental questions on ILCs are to be answered. In the proposed five-year project, we aim
to answer a few: 1) Do intestine-derived ILC2s modulate asthma? We hypothesize that repositioning of gut-
derived iILC2s to the lung during parasitic infection dampens the allergic responses by conferring ‘innate
tolerance’ to stronger asthmatic allergens. 2) Does microbiota modulate ILC2 activation and migration? We
hypothesize that intestinal microbiota is essential for cytokine-induced ILC2 responses and commensal bacteria-
derived metabolites provide a secondary signal that facilitates ILC2 activation and subsequent inter-organ
trafficking. 3) Do existing drugs that target T cells have the capability to regulate the ILC function? We will perform
a screening assay to identify such candidate drugs by using a gene reporter system that we have generated.
Successful completion of the proposed studies will lead to a fundamental understanding of molecular
mechanisms that underlie ILC2 activation, ILC2 migration, ILC2 repositioning-mediated protection against
allergic asthma, and microbiota-ILC2 interaction. The knowledge to be gained will contribute to the development
of novel therapeutic approaches for asthma and other inflammatory and infectious diseases. The existing drug
screening will enhance the reconsideration of drug usage in clinic. Multi-disciplinary approaches will be employed
including high-parameter flow cytometry, single-cell(sc) RNA-Seq, scATAC-Seq, multiplex 3D tissue imaging
and genetic mouse models. This is a research complex of immune cell biology, molecular biology, system
immunology and host-pathogen interaction. Columbia University Medical Center provides enormous research
resources and great opportunities for collaborations that will make it possible."
10893634,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There are significant knowledge gaps in understanding the mechanisms and biological predictors of low drug
exposures and treatment failure in patients with tuberculosis (TB) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). To address
the impact of DM on poor TB outcomes, we propose an interdisciplinary mentored research and training plan to
investigate gut microbiome-mediated variation of anti-TB drug pharmacokinetics (PK) in DM and non-DM TB
patients in an ongoing prospective, observational PK trial investigating isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide in
TB patients. Specific Aim 1 will quantify the effect of DM and gut microbiota alpha diversity on the
bioavailability of oral anti-TB drugs in patients treated for active TB, by linking pharmacometric modeling
with DM and measures of the gut dysbiosis in active TB patients with and without DM. Specific Aim 2 will
characterize the relationship of gut microbiota alpha diversity and diabetes in patients with active TB,
by conducting a comprehensive prospective analysis of the human gut microbiome from clinical stool specimens.
Upon successful completion of the proposed K23 research, we expect our contribution to 1) establish the
previously undescribed impact of the human gut microbiome as a significant covariate to explain the
heterogeneity of drug PK in patients receiving active TB treatment and, 2) demonstrate the distinctive relationship
between DM and gut microbiome diversity and composition among patients with TB. These contributions will be
significant because they are expected to provide strong scientific justification for a novel mechanism for the
previously unexplained variability of anti-TB drug PK and TB treatment response among patients with TB/DM.
The proposed research is innovative because it aims to identify the gut microbiome as a novel mechanism
underlying the heterogeneity of anti-TB drug PK. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to train Navaneeth
Narayanan, PharmD, MPH for a career as an independent investigator in pharmacomicrobiomics, the study of
the effect of microbiome variation on therapeutic response by regulating drug PK and pharmacodynamics (PD),
with a specific career emphasis on the treatment and outcomes of TB and other infectious diseases. The career
development plan includes training in human microbiome research, under the mentorship of Dr. Martin Blaser,
and pharmacometrics, an interdisciplinary science of quantitative clinical pharmacology and systems biology that
involves expertise in mathematical modeling to characterize and predict drug PK and PD. Dr. Narayanan will
also be mentored by Dr. Scott Heysell, an international expert in anti-TB pharmacology and TB clinical research.
The proposed K23 project will provide an integrated plan of mentored patient-oriented research, career
development activities, and formal training in microbiome research and pharmacometrics. Guided by expert
mentors and collaborators, the research and training activities outlined in this application will enable Dr.
Narayanan to mature into an independent clinical/translational researcher. These opportunities will equip this
investigator with a larger set of skills to answer important and novel questions about global infectious diseases."

10886355,"ABSTRACT
This Mentored Research Career Development Award (K01) proposal includes a coordinated training plan
and research project that will facilitate the candidate's transition to independent investigator at the
intersection of adolescent substance use, in particular marijuana use, sleep disturbances and chronic pain.
Adolescent marijuana exposure predicts many negative outcomes, particularly for early, heavy users.
Chronic pain is an under-recognized, yet highly prevalent adolescent health problem. Evidence suggests
that chronic pain potentiates risk factors for substance use, in particular those related to sleep disturbances
and diminished inhibitory control. However, the interplay among sleep, pain, and inhibitory control, as it
relates to marijuana use in adolescence, remains minimally explored, which is significant given the unique
risk for frequent and heavy marijuana use in this population.
 The proposed research project utilizes mobile health (mHealth) measurement techniques, combining
mobile phones and wearable devices, to enhance our understanding of the longitudinal interplay among
these mechanisms in patient’s natural settings. The long-term goal of this K01 award is for the candidate to
establish an independent research career aimed at developing and implementing mechanistically informed
interventions for marijuana use disorders in youth with chronic pain and sleep disturbances using mHealth
approaches. To do so,
specific short-term training is required in: 1) conducting adolescent substance use
research, with a focus on marijuana use;
2) conducting randomized controlled trials; 3) sleep and circadian
biology and sleep measurement techniques; 4) the use of mHealth technologies and protocols and 5) the
responsible conduct of research.
Two independent, yet related studies are proposed to characterize the relation among sleep, pain,
inhibitory control, and marijuana use
in an adolescent chronic pain population. A first study will interrogate a
large cross-sectional sample of youth with chronic pain to understand the association that particular pain
dimensions (i.e. intensity, frequency and interference) show with marijuana use, both directly and through
associations with sleep and inhibitory control. Given the potentially complex interplay among factors, a
longitudinal assessment is vital to map the unfolding of pathophysiological processes. The second study will
therefore combine ecological momentary assessments, mobile app-based cognitive tests, and passive
collection of sleep data to provide time-sensitive and ecologically valid models of the longitudinal interplay
among risk factors within the context of the individual’s daily life.
 Such methods are vital for mapping temporal sequences of events and developing specific interventions
to interrupt this perpetual cycle and reduce risks, which will be the goal of a subsequent R01 grant."

African trypanosomiasis, also known as African sleeping sickness, is considered a neglected tropical disease. If left untreated, African sleeping sickness is 100% fatal. Treatments for African sleeping sickness are notorious for causing adverse effects in patients and some of the side effects can result in patient death. The transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1 function to remove intracellular cholesterol via participating in cholesterol efflux, resulting in the disruption of lipid-rafts. This process is anti-inflammatory, since activated toll-like receptors need to first translocate into lipid-rafts to trigger a pro-inflammatory immune response. Therefore, manipulating expression of ABCA1 and/or ABCG1 may influence parasite pathologenicity and virulence through modulating toll-like receptor-mediated activation upon T. brucei infection."
10898814,"Summary
Atypical sensory-based behaviors are a common feature of a number of human conditions, including autism
spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, etc. Despite this, little is known about how the genes associated with these
conditions affect sensory behavior. A complete understanding of this process requires a thorough
characterization of the underlying neural circuitry, along with the ability to measure and perturb the activity of
these circuits. The nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, provides a unique opportunity to analyze genes, cells,
and circuits regulating complex behaviors, as its nervous system consists of just 302 neurons interconnected via
identified synapses that utilize highly conserved synaptic machinery. The Chalasani, Hart, and Pierce labs have
shown that loss-of-function mutants in C. elegans homologs of the human autism-associated genes (neurexin
(NRX) and neuroligin (NLG)) greatly attenuate aggregation behavior in both wild and lab strains. In addition, the
Chalasani and Hart labs have found that NRX is required in specific chemosensory neurons and intact glutamate
signaling to modify aggregation behavior. They propose to map the synaptic signaling pathways that are modified
by NRX-NLG signaling to regulate aggregation behavior (Aim 1). The Pierce lab has recently found evidence for
natural genetic variation that interacts with NRX and NLG to modify aggregation deficits. They propose to identify
the relevant genes and validate them using QTL mapping, revealing insights into the NRX-, and NLG-genome
interactions critical for animal behavior and intestine physiology (Aim 2). The Chalasani lab has discovered that
NRX, but not NLG loss-of-function mutants have leaky intestines. Next, they obtained intestinal-specific
transcriptomes to identify candidate genes whose expression is selectively altered in NRX mutants. They
propose to use genetic methods to confirm roles for these genes in affecting intestinal integrity. Notably, these
signaling pathways, whose mammalian homologs might be relevant to gastrointestinal issues observed in
individuals with an ASD diagnosis (Aim 3). These studies will reveal the genes, neurons, synapses, and signaling
pathways by which NRX-NLG signaling drives sensory behavior and animal physiology. Importantly, this
proposal brings together three labs with complementary expertise to make rapid progress toward revealing the
mechanisms underlying the complex NRX-NLG phenotypes."
10915660,"PROJECT ABSTRACT:
Proton channel proteins potentiate the flow of protons across cell membranes, and have evolved fine control
over proton selectivity and conductivity to efficiently achieve their function, while maintaining cellular integrity.
Through formation of dynamic proton conduction pathways which mimic the water wires observed in dilute acid
for proton diffusion, protons move rapidly and selectively along a hydrogen-bonding network composed of
confined water and ionizable sidechains scattered within the lumen of proton channel proteins. One way proton
channels mediate proton conductivity is through guide water wires, which are stable lumenal waters organized
by polar protein groups. Guide water wires are well-studied as they are observed in high-resolution crystal
structures, but whether they are mobile or static and how their dynamics affects proton conductivity remains
unclear. Another way to modulate proton selectivity and conductivity is through transient water wires, which are
thought to form and dissipate to allow for proton flux through well-packed apolar segments. While transient water
wires have been hypothesized in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, they are fundamentally difficult to test
experimentally. Finally, proton channels also use proton shuttle mechanisms of protonation and deprotonation
through an ionizable sidechain, such as His, Glu, and Asp, to tune proton conductance, but it is unclear the
extent these sidechains mediate pore solvation, and whether the proton shuttle mechanism leads to a net transit
of water. This work will address these mechanisms by which proton channel proteins mediate proton flux: the
(1) seemingly stable hydrogen-bonding networks of guide water wires and protein polar groups, (2) transient
water wires, and (3) proton shuttles composed of ionizable sidechains.
Through our proposed study of a natural proton channel, the influenza A matrix protein 2 (M2), and de novo
designed proton channels, we will test the hypotheses that (1) guide and transient water wires within proton
channel proteins confer their selectivity and dictate their capacity to conduct protons, and (2) proton shuttles are
not only necessary in defining the conduction rates of these proton channels, but also play critical roles in
modulating proton and water permeability. In Aim 1, we will examine whether guide water wires are mobile or
static by multidimensional infrared spectroscopy on M2 proton channels and the disease-relative mutants. Our
measurements in the presence and absence of drugs will allow us to determine how the dynamics of these
networks affect proton conductance, and how they change with drug binding and resistance mutations, which is
critical to identifying new antiviral strategies. In Aim 2, we test the hypothesis of transient water wires through
the de novo design and characterization of novel proton channels with varying lengths of apolar regions. In the
R00 phase (Aim 3), we examine how ionizable sidechains potentiate pore hydration and investigate whether
protonation/deprotonation events lead to the cotranslocation of protons and water."

To ensure that each dividing cell receives a complete set of the correct genome, cell cycle
checkpoints are in place throughout the cell cycle. Yet, less is known about whether similar
checkpoints exist for division of the cytoplasmic components or organelles of the cell. The
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a gateway for the secretory pathway, generating almost all of the
secreted and cell surface membrane proteins as well as synthesizing cellular lipids. Previously,
we identified a cell cycle checkpoint, termed the ER stress surveillance (ERSU) pathway, that
ensures the inheritance of sufficient levels of functional ER in the model organism S. cerevisiae.
In response to ER stress, the ERSU pathway (1) blocks the inheritance of the stressed ER into
the daughter cell, (2) mislocalizes the septin ring from the bud neck, the site of cytokinesis, and
ultimately, (3) leads to temporary cell cycle arrest at cytokinesis until ER functional homeostasis
is re-established. Cells that lack components of the ERSU, and thus cannot mount the ERSU
pathway, die upon ER stress, underscoring the importance of this checkpoint. The ERSU pathway
is distinct from the well-studied unfolded protein response. We have found that levels of
phytosphingosine (PHS), an early intermediate of sphingolipid biosynthesis, increase upon ER
stress, setting in motion the ERSU hallmark events. Moreover, we defined a PHS binding motif
that is found within two different transmembrane domains of reticulon family proteins (i.e., Rtn1
and Yop1), leading to the activation of the ERSU events. In the current proposal, in AIM 1, we will
apply molecular and cell biological approaches to dissect how PHS binding to Rtn1 or Yop1
results in ERSU activation. In AIM 2, we will extend the scope of the ERSU by dissecting the
impact of ER lipotoxic stress induced by ER morphological changes, on the ERSU molecular
events. In AIM 3, we will investigate how ER stress impacts the mammalian cell cycle. As the
nuclear membrane breaks down during mitosis in mammalian cells, the division of functional ER
may be even more tightly choreographed with the nuclear mitotic mechanisms. Our preliminary
result of a mammalian septin subunit holds great promise for the presence of regulatory events
that may share similarity to the yeast ERSU. Thus, we will fully investigate the impact of ER stress
on (A) the mammalian septin subunits and cytokinetic components, and (B) major mitotic cell
cycle structural changes that involve the ER, such as ER clearing from the “mitotic exclusion
zone” and nuclear disassembly and reassembly. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that
integrate ER homeostasis with cell cycle events will provide unprecedented insights into human
diseases caused by the failure of ER regulation."

 Chronic infection by viruses such as HIV, HBV, and HCV remains a major global health challenge. During
chronic viral infection, CD8 T cells fail to eradicate the virus and develop into a dysfunctional state, termed
exhaustion. Exhausted CD8 T cells, which were first characterized in mouse model of chronic lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, progressively lose effector function, upregulate inhibitory receptors, and
exhibit dysregulated metabolism. Immunotherapies fail to completely reverse T-cell exhaustion or achieve
sustained viral control during chronic viral infection. Thus, there is an unmet need to develop new strategies to
overcome T-cell exhaustion and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy against chronic viral infection. Although
exhausted CD8 T cells were initially thought to be a homogeneous population, we and others have recently
shown that a TCF1high antiviral CD8 T cell subset maintains long-term antiviral immunity through self-renewal
and replenishing TCF1low terminally exhausted CD8 T cells during chronic viral infection. Importantly, these stem-
like CD8 T cells are less exhausted and mediate the response induced by various immunotherapies. Our
published studies have demonstrated stem-like CD8 T cells as a separate CD8 lineage with transcriptional and
epigenetic programs that are distinct from those of terminally exhausted CD8 T cells and are tightly regulated by
transcription factors, epigenetic regulators, and cytokines. The goal of this proposal is to define the molecular
and cellular mechanisms regulating the immune response of stem-like CD8 T cells against chronic viral infection
and evaluate strategies to improve antiviral immunity by targeting these pathways. Using chronic LCMV infection
model, cutting-edge metabolic assay, multispectral quantitative imaging, and unique mouse genetic tools, we
will identify the metabolic pathways and cell-cell interactions that endow stem-like CD8 T cells with their superior
antiviral immunity and responsiveness to immunotherapies. These results will lay the foundation for the

 Tauopathies are a growing group of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and mul-
tiple related dementias, and are characterized by intracellular deposition of tau aggregates. Absence of tau
mutations in the vast majority of tauopathy patients, and all of Alzheimer’s disease cases, highlights a critical
need to understand why the tau protein fails to retain its native conformation, and forms pathogenic aggre-
gates. The objective of the proposed research is to identify a common molecular mechanism underlying tau
proteostasis, and to determine in vivo how this mechanism modifies tau aggregation and neurodegeneration:
Chaperones are key mediators of proteostasis, and the chaperone protein Hsc70 is known to bind tau directly.
However, the fate of Hsc70-bound clients is determined by co-chaperones, assembled into chaperone com-
plexes. We have identified two chaperone-complexes that affect tau in diametrically opposite directions:
CSPα/Hsc70/SGT/Hsp90 containing “foldase” complex and Hsj1/Hsc70/CHIP containing “degradase” complex.
This study will test the hypothesis that tau protein levels, aggregation and neurodegeneration are regulated by
these two chaperone machines/complexes: the foldase complex stabilizes tau and the degradase complex tar-
gets tau for degradation, and tau pathology can be manipulated by these activities. We will test this hypothesis
in vitro, in primary neurons, and in mouse models of tauopathies in vivo. Completion of these studies is ex-
pected to identify two new molecular processes which affect tau aggregation, as well as to reveal how these
proteostatic activities affect tau pathology in vivo. The proposed study is innovative, because two new func-
tions of the foldase and degradase chaperone complexes on their new client tau are proposed, and because of
the use of a comprehensive experimental approach, including: a) a new primary neuron tau aggregation
model, b) viral approaches for CRISPR/Cas9-knockout of co-chaperones in primary neurons, c) stereotactic
injections to virally regulate the co-chaperone levels in vivo, d) using patient brain samples to establish rele-
vance of our findings to tauopathy in Alzheimer’s disease. The proposed study is significant because a) the
concept of multifaceted proteostasis, where tau aggregation is affected by the equilibrium between
“degradase” and “foldase” mechanisms, can be readily translated to other proteins related to Alzheimer’s dis-
ease and related dementias (e.g. TDP43 or α-synuclein), b) understanding how neurons prevent tau from ag-
gregating will establish novel targets for treating tauopathies, and c) understanding cellular proteostasis mech-
anisms of misfolding-prone proteins may reveal clues common to the sporadic versions of tauopathies, includ-
ing Alzheimer’s disease, for which tau mutations are not the most robust or common risk factor. This grant thus
addresses the Notice of Special Interest NOT-AG-21-037: Common Mechanisms and Interactions in Neuro-
degenerative Diseases."

This K23 award will support the candidate’s training and development towards an independent clinical
research career focused on behavioral sleep medicine and the use of remote technology-based
delivery/assessment of mindfulness meditation (MM) to facilitate self-sleep management in patients with
chronic insomnia disorder. BACKGROUND. Insomnia is highly prevalent and associated with a wide range of
deleterious health consequences. According to well-established disease models, insomnia is characterized by
bedtime stress, pre-sleep hyperarousal, or high sleep reactivity. MM is a promising intervention for patients
with insomnia. The delivery of MM via mobile health has largely increased access to such interventions.
Technology has allowed both remote delivery of intervention and home assessment with physiological
recordings that increase access to real-world data. Existing studies have mostly focused on daytime MM
practice and subjective sleep quality at night. It is not clear whether the temporal relationship of bedtime MM
practice is important to sleep outcomes, what is the most effective way to deliver app-based MM for patients
with insomnia disorder, or whether physiological changes correlated with mindfulness practice contribute to
sleep improvement. SPECIFIC AIMS. This K23 proposes a proof-of-concept feasibility study with aims to: (1)
refine content delivery of an app-based MM intervention (specifically for bedtime use); (2) evaluate the
feasibility and acceptability of the app-based intervention in a pilot randomized controlled trial; and (3) explore
patterns of change in sleep-related subjective/objective outcomes, including remote assessment. TRAINING.
To develop expertise critical to the candidate’s overall career goals, Dr. Ma will receive training in three areas:
(1) behavioral sleep medicine and clinical trials; (2) qualitative and mixed methods research; and (3) mobile
health (mHealth), technology-based sleep interventions and assessment. These training aims will be supported
by strong institutional resources, as well as coursework, trainings, research seminars/meetings, and scientific
conferences. MENTORSHIP. The candidate will be supported by an expert mentoring team including primary
mentors Janet Mullington, PhD and Gloria Yeh, MD, MPH, co-mentor/collaborators Peter Wayne, PhD,
Suzanne Bertisch, MD, MPH, Ana-Maria Vranceanu, PhD, John Torous, MD, MBI, Pamela Rist, ScD, and
Karen Kilgore, PhD. IMPACT. Findings from the pilot study will inform the design of a larger trial and form the
necessary foundation to further investigate mobile-health MM approaches for insomnia disorder and
understand links between pre-sleep MM and sleep quality. Building on the candidate’s existing skills in
physiological signal analysis, this K23 award will allow the candidate’s development as a clinical/translational
researcher with expertise in mobile technology-based MM intervention and assessment for management of
sleep, and complex physiological signals to elucidate the effects of MM on sleep."

 Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hypertension is one of the most
important risk factors of HF. Despite paramount interests and urgent needs, our understanding of the
mechanisms of HF development remains limited. To accommodate the elevated demand of cardiac contractility
under high blood pressure, the heart mounts an acute reaction through hypertrophic growth. This once adaptive
response may decompensate and progress into HF. The overall goal of this renewal application is to delineate
the role of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in HF under pressure overload.
 Cumulative evidence shows that the UPR is activated in the heart under pressure overload and in cultured
cardiomyocytes by growth stimulation. During the previous funding period of this project, both gain- and loss-of-
function studies have demonstrated that spliced XBP1 (sXBP1), a downstream transcriptional factor of the UPR,
is critical for adaptive cardiac hypertrophy under hemodynamic stress, which is partly mediated by its target
GFAT1. sXBP1 is produced by IRE1α, one of the three signaling transducers of the UPR, under protein-folding
stress. In the course of the previous funding studies, a novel role of IRE1α in translation, not sXBP1-controlled
transcription, was uncovered. This action, not mediated by sXBP1, may open a new research direction of IRE1α
and the UPR in cardiac hypertrophy and HF.
 Preliminary results through an unbiased pulse SILAC assay demonstrate that UPR proteins are enriched
under cell growth conditions. Importantly, only the IRE1α, not PERK or ATF6, branch of the UPR is required for
protein synthesis and cell growth. This new action of IRE1α is independent of sXBP1 since sXBP1 restoration
does not rescue growth defect from IRE1α silencing. Moreover, age-matched IRE1α conditional knockout (cKO)
mice present more severe cardiomyopathy and HF compared to sXBP1 cKO animals. Further pilot data from a
proteomic assay suggest that IRE1α directly binds components of the translation initiation complex. Based on
these findings, a central hypothesis has been proposed: IRE1α exerts a new role in translational regulation,
which is essential for the heart to mount an adaptive growth response and antagonize HF under pressure
overload. Ribosome profiling has been conducted to identify translation-only targets of IRE1α. The role of IRE1α
in translation initiation will be delineated by testing the assembly and functionality of the translation initiation
complex. Next, the mechanism of targeting of IRE1α on 5’- and 3’-UTRs of its targets will be determined by
deducing secondary mRNA structures and validation at the molecular level. Finally, effectors of IRE1α,
particularly membrane proteins, will be evaluated for their contributions to cardiac hypertrophy and HF in vivo.
Elucidation of the novel role of IRE1α and the UPR in cardiac remodeling and HF will advance our understanding
of the pathophysiology of hypertensive heart disease and pave a way for novel, more effective therapeutic design."
10875433,"Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) occurs when the pancreas is unable to secrete enzymes and fluids adequate for digestion. Acute recurrent (ARP) and chronic pancreatitis (CP) are increasingly recognized in children and are an increasingly important cause of EPI. EPI results in malabsorption which can lead to malnutrition and growth failure in children. If EPI can be recognized or even predicted, its deleterious effects can be reversed with pancreatic enzyme replacement. 
Accepted diagnostic criteria for CP rely on subjective imaging findings which are limited by interobserver disagreement and accurate, non-invasive diagnosis of EPI is challenging, if not impossible. Currently diagnosis of EPI requires invasive testing in the form of endoscopy under anesthesia (ePFTs). Thus, there is an unmet need for validated, non-invasive measures of pancreatic health and function in children. Quantitative MRI techniques, including MR pancreatic function testing (MR-PFTs), pancreas parenchymal volume, and parenchymal signal mapping are showing promise as non-invasive markers of pancreatic health and function. The overall aim of this study is to define associations between non-invasive, non-contrast, quantitative MRI measures and established measures of pancreas health and function (including EPI diagnosed by a reference standard of endoscopic PFTs [ePFTs]) in children. 
We propose to test multiple non-invasive, non-contrast, quantitative MRI techniques for their ability to identify EPI and stage pancreatitis (acute pancreatitis to ARP to CP) in children. Our central hypothesis is that the quantitative MRI techniques under study will have diagnostic performance for changes in pancreatic health, allowing detection of EPI and quantification of changes of pancreatitis. 
Our preliminary studies show that we can successfully apply quantitative MRI techniques, inclusive of MR-PFTs, volumetric imaging, and parenchymal signal mapping in children. We have defined normal values for these MRI measures with preliminary data suggesting that threshold values derived from normal children can non-invasively identify EPI with excellent sensitivity. This application aims to: 1) Evaluate the diagnostic performance of MRI markers for EPI as an indicator of pancreas health in children, 2) Develop processing pipelines for quantitative MRI of the pancreas, and 3) Define quantitative MRI markers that can distinguish stages of pancreatitis and identify early CP. 
The successful completion of this study will generate unique, valuable data regarding non-invasive staging of pancreatitis and diagnosis of EPI. This study will generate protocols and processing pipelines to facilitate future clinical decision making and research use of MRI as a non-invasive test for EPI and pancreatic disease. Data from this study will set the stage for future studies of non-invasive imaging of pancreatitis and EPI in children."
10875554,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Obesity is the number one and most preventable Type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk factor yet despite a $20 billion
annual expenditure on diet and weight loss efforts, 87% of US adults are overweight or obese. Disparities also
persist, as Non-Hispanic Black adults have a higher obesity prevalence (46.8%) than non-Hispanic Whites
(37.9%) and suffer higher rates of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle
intervention (LI) demonstrated the clinical benefits of lifestyle intervention and garnered the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) endorsement as the gold standard LI program for US adults. Reimbursable by the Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the DPP LI is currently disseminated nationally and the national DPP.
While the DPP LI is effective, critical populations don’t achieve clinically significant weight loss in the current
group-based translation paradigm. This is particularly true for Black DPP participants, who show the lowest
adjusted percent weight loss across (3.2%) among all racial/ethnic groups. A lack of weight loss in the early
weeks of intervention is a known predictor of post-treatment outcomes and continues to be a major barrier to
weight loss for Black participants. Additional research on early intervention, with a focus on populations that
experience disparities, is urgently needed as the new CMS payment structure (based on weight loss metrics)
may further limit access to the DPP for Blacks. This project proposes a cluster randomized control trial with
500 Black participants who are nested in 20 community sites, primarily churches. Trained community health
workers will deliver a group-based, 6-month long DPP Group Lifestyle Balance (DPP-GLB) over 18 sessions
and nonresponders will be identified at four weeks. Nonresponders in the intervention group only will receive
weekly telephone support from the CHWs to provide individual-level enhanced treatment to help them
overcome barriers to adherence to the program goals. These activities will meet the following Specific Aims: 1)
To evaluate differences over time in the primary outcome of weight, and secondary outcomes (i.e., physical
activity level, blood pressure, and dietary behaviors) between nonresponders in the intervention group
compared to nonresponders in the active control group. 2) To examine potential mediators (social support,
self-efficacy, motivation, stress) and moderators (age, sex, socioeconomic status) of the relationship between
treatment group and early weight loss response in the both nonresponders and responders.3) To evaluate the
cost of the intervention arm by comparing the incremental cost and weight loss with the active control arm.
Outcome measures include weight (primary); secondary outcomes include blood pressure, physical activity,
dietary behaviors, mediation and moderator effects and cost. If found to efficacious, the enhanced strategies
for nonresponders could be standardized as a supplement for use with the national DPP and may be
supported by current DPP payers."
10877146,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A pressing challenge in the treatment of retinal diseases is to restore vision in the retina with irreversible
photoreceptor degeneration. In theory, even in the absence of rods and cones, such diseased retina should still
be able to sense light through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) using a photopigment
named melanopsin. However, the kinetics of melanopsin-mediated light response is slow, thus giving only very
poor temporal resolution and therefore largely limiting its ability to provide image-forming information. For the
same reason, a vision restoration approach previously proposed – which made use of virally expressed
melanopsin to endow light sensitivity to conventional retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) – is also limited by the slow
response kinetics of melanopsin. Our recent study has firmly established that melanopsin-mediated
phototransduction is rate-limited by its downstream components and that it can be accelerated by virally
expressed ion channels with faster kinetics. We propose to develop a novel vision restoration strategy by
accelerating melanopsin signaling via manipulating downstream transduction components in photoreceptor
degenerated mouse models. We have two major aims. In Aim 1, we shall focus on enhancing the light response
of endogenous melanopsin in M4- and M5-subtypes of ipRGCs because they have been shown to project to
image-forming brain centers, allowing them to contribute to the image-forming vision. We have discovered that
M4-cells respond to melanopsin photoactivation by elevating intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides (cNMP) and
subsequent opening of cNMP-sensitive HCN channels. Our new preliminary data suggest that M5 cells also use
the HCN pathway. We have further shown that the response of the HCN-dependent signaling pathway can be
sped up by introducing a member of the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel family, CNGA2, resulting in faster
response kinetics and larger amplitudes, proving the concept of our strategy. In Aim 2, we shall restore light
response in conventional retinal ganglion cells using virally expressed melanopsin together with faster signaling
molecules. Our multielectrode array results show that simultaneously expressing melanopsin and CNGA2 in
cRGCs provides higher light sensitivities and faster rising phases than expressing melanopsin alone. Using
water-based vision-guided maze tests, we have further found that exogenous melanopsin and CNGA2 not only
restore light sensitivity but also confer pattern vision in photoreceptor-degenerated animals. Together, these
exciting preliminary observations raise the prospect of using CNG channels and/or modifications to other
phototransduction components of melanopsin as a therapeutic modality to restore vision following photoreceptor
degeneration. Innovation. All optogenetic approaches proposed thus far focus on finding a better light-sensing
protein with higher expression, better light sensitivity, and faster response kinetics. We are the first to exploit
downstream components and novel signaling molecules of melanopsin for vision restoration purposes. This
represents a conceptual innovation and an out-of-the-box strategy for vision restoration."
10877147,"ABSTRACT
Parasitic protist Trypanosoma brucei causes African human and animal trypanosomiasis, a spectrum of diseases
affecting the population and economy in sub-Saharan Africa. These digenetic hemoflagellates belong to
Kinetoplastea, a taxonomic class distinguished by possession of a kinetoplast. This nucleoprotein body contains
mitochondrial DNA (kDNA) of two kinds: ~25 maxicircles (each ~23 kb) encoding rRNAs, ribosomal proteins and
subunits of respiratory complexes, and approximately 5000 of ~1 kb minicircles bearing guide RNA genes.
Relaxed maxicircles and minicircles are interlinked and packed into a dense disc-shaped network by association
with histone-like proteins. Decades of kDNA studies have unraveled fascinating phenomena of general biological
significance, such as DNA bending and mRNA editing, and revealed exquisite details of replication and RNA
processing. However, the molecular mechanisms of transcription remain virtually unexplored and arguably
constitute the most critical gap in understanding mitochondrial gene expression. The historically enduring view
of polycistronic RNA synthesis has abridged efforts to investigate transcription's contribution to regulating
genome activity. In contrast, this proposal presents evidence that maxicircle and minicircle genes are individually
transcribed into 3′ extended precursors. The transcription start site defines pre-mRNA 5′ terminus, which is
subsequently converted into monophosphorylated state by a pyrophosphohydrolase complex, termed the
PPsome. Most guide RNAs lack PPsome recognition sites and remain triphosphorylated. Furthermore, we
establish that antisense transcripts delimit the 3′ boundaries of mature RNAs by blocking 3′-5′ degradation of
precursors by the 3′ processome (MPsome). It follows that transcription start sites on sense and antisense
strands define 5′ and 3′ mRNA termini, respectively. These findings support a concept of mitochondrial gene-
specific transcriptional control with broad implications in parasite development and pathogenesis. We posit that
elucidating transcription complex composition, DNA template requirements and functions of specific factors will
build a foundation for this nascent research area. We propose to: 1) Characterize RNA polymerase complex
from bloodstream and insect parasite forms, and assess transcription factors' contributions to RNA synthesis; 2)
Map maxicircle and minicircle promoters; and 3) Reconstitute the active transcription complex."
10877149,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of the proposed project is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel pharmacological
treatment of myocardial infarction (MI) using quantitative multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI).
MI is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Urgent reperfusion of the occluded artery to restore
myocardial blood flow is central to the clinical management of acute thrombotic MI (AMI). However,
recanalization of the culprit artery may also result in unintended injury by causing microvascular obstruction
(MVO), intramyocardial hemorrhage (IMH), and edema during the acute phase. In the setting of chronic MI, iron
deposition and fat accumulation (lipomatous metaplasia, LM) are frequently observed in infarcted myocardium.
All these biomarkers are strong predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events such as heart failure. To date,
however, there have been no effective therapeutic strategies for attenuating either MVO, IMH, chronic iron
deposition, or LM post-reperfusion. Mast cells (MC) are derived from blood-borne, multipotent hematopoietic
progenitor cells that, once located in tissue, differentiate to a final phenotype under the influence of the local
microenvironment. In general, MC exert their physiological and pathological functions by releasing cytoplasmic
granules (degranulation) containing a variety of biologically active mediators. Recent experimental studies have
shown that hematoma growth, edema expansion and overall neurological damage after cerebral ischemia-
reperfusion can be reduced by early treatment with MC stabilizers, which are known to suppress MC
degranulation. Equally important, atherosclerosis research over the last two decades has provided strong
evidence for MC involvement in foam cell formation and plaque development. Based on these studies, we
hypothesized that MC stabilization via the administration of over-the-counter anti-allergy medication loratadine
reduces myocardial edema, IMH volume and improves myocardial microcirculation in the acute MI setting; and
attenuates LM of infarcted myocardium in the chronic phase. Quantitative cardiovascular MR (qCMR) imaging
has been widely used to characterize myocardial ischemia, hemorrhage, edema, inflammation, iron deposition,
fat accumulation and other pathological conditions. In this proposal, we aim to validate the effectiveness of MC
stabilizer loratadine on structural and functional cardiac remodeling post-pharmacotherapy in a porcine model of
MI by temporally following imaging biomarkers of acute and chronic MI using well-established qCMR techniques.
Successful completion of the project will provide initial validation that early loratadine intervention has the
potential to be a novel therapeutic strategy for prevention of heart failure post-MI as evaluated by our quantitative
multiparametric MRI approach."

The symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) typically wax and
wane. Our objective in this project is to identify biomarkers that correlate with fluctuations in clinical
status and have the potential to yield insights into pathogenesis that enable interventions.
Sixty people with ME/CFS followed in a large New York City practice and 60 healthy controls matched
+/- 5 years for age, sex, and socioeconomic status, will use a smartphone application to regularly report
the severity of their symptoms, and whether they are having a particularly good or bad day. Immediately
after a person enters data, the information will be sent to the study server and (on good and bad days)
to a study coordinator/phlebotomist who will contact the individual to visit the subject’s location to obtain
blood, saliva, and feces within 24 hours. We will pursue biomarker discovery on good and bad days.
We will profile multiple cytokines previously found to be abnormal in ME/CFS; quantitate the prevalence
and abundance of microbial sequences in plasma, saliva, and feces using capture sequencing; assay
levels of antibodies to specific target epitopes using a state-of-the-art phage display system; and
perform single cell RNASeq analyses of B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, NK cells and the recently
discovered Kir+CD8+ regulatory T cells.
Metabolomic and lipidomic studies will be conducted in plasma, saliva, and feces to determine if
abnormalities, that we and others have previously identified, improve on good days and worsen on bad
days. These include evidence of peroxisomal dysfunction (decreased levels of plasmalogens,
unsaturated phospholipid ethers and carnitines and increased levels of polyunsaturated long-chain
triacylglycerides); consistently reduced plasma levels of prostaglandin F2 alpha, the oxylipin resolvin
D1 and phosphatidylcholines (PCs); significant elevations in α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) and succinate (TCA
cycle intermediates). Collectively, these changes may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction/impaired
ATP generation and the pro-inflammatory state that have been found in ME/CFS. Fecal metabolomics
allow measurement of very short chain fatty acids, a clear indicator of differences in fermentative energy
metabolism, and measurement of physiologically relevant microbial products that impact carbohydrate
metabolism and immune function. In collaboration with Alain Moreau at ICanCME in Montreal, we will
assess microRNA expression to determine whether previously identified abnormalities improve on good
days and worsen on bad days."
10877722,"The severity of lung injury that develops within the first several days after lung transplantation (LT) is a key
indicator of which LT recipients are at greatest risk of death or early development of chronic lung allograft
dysfunction. The fact that 30% of lungs deemed suitable for LT rapidly develop severe lung injury suggests that
there may be unrecognized subclinical injury already present in donor lungs that renders the lung allograft
susceptible to further injury at the time of LT. A critical unmet need is improved ability to detect and interpret
the consequences of subclinical donor lung injury that may drive poor clinical outcomes after LT. In this Katz
R01 proposal, an accomplished physician scientist will develop a new area of research investigating how
subclinical donor lung injury triggers a cascade of events that ultimately results in CLAD. Recent studies have
identified donor-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a biomarker of lung allograft injury, with increased cfDNA
detected prior to clinical recognition of acute rejection. However, it is unknown which specific cells and injury
mechanisms cause cfDNA release from the donor lung. cfDNA can also mechanistically exacerbate lung
inflammation. In models of non-LT lung injury, cfDNA detection in bronchoalveolar lavage or plasma activates
the stimulator of interferon genes (STING). STING then promotes ongoing dysregulated inflammation by
activating inflammatory pathways previously implicated in lung injury after LT, including NF-B, NLRP3, and
MKLK. In this Katz R01 proposal, an ESI physician scientist with clinical expertise in LT and scientific expertise
in animal models of ARDS proposes an integrated approach to define mechanisms of donor lung injury that
drive cfDNA release and poor outcomes after LT. Using single-cell genomics and CyTOF-based immune cell
profiling of serial samples from human donor lungs coupled with a new multi-hit murine model of subclinical
donor lung injury, we will determine the specific cellular and molecular mechanisms through which donor lung
injury affects early allograft dysfunction. We hypothesize that subclinical donor lung injury drives severe
allograft injury through release of donor-derived cfDNA into the allograft airspace, triggering a feed-forward
cycle of inflammation and ongoing cellular injury that results in poor clinical outcomes. The Specific Aims are:
(1) to test whether subclinical donor lung injury is associated with release of donor-derived cfDNA and poor
clinical outcomes in humans, using single-cell RNA sequencing and mass cytometry on donor lung biopsies
collected before and after LT and (2) to use a novel animal model of sequential subclinical lung injury prior to
ischemia reperfusion to determine how subclinical donor lung injury releases cfDNA to prime the donor lung to
develop excessive STING-dependent inflammation after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Together, the
combination of longitudinal human observational data and mechanistic murine experimentation fulfills a major
gap in LT research and will provide a broad foundational knowledge to understand how subclinical donor lung
injury affects clinical outcomes at the cellular and molecular level."

clinical research projects to design well-powered studies; assist in data management; and provide rigorous
statistical analysis, including the appropriate methodology to deal with the intricacies of the correlation of two
eyes. Aim 2. Provide consultation, training, and access to specialized software for genetic analyses of
vision research data. The BBGA Core Director and staff will provide tailored consultations to users for
planning and conducting their genetics research and analyses. Best practices will be promoted for study
design, sample size estimation, and power calculation for bioinformatic and genetic components of grant

The Analytical Services Core
The Analytical Services Core is based on the former Histology, Microscopy & Imaging Core, whose functions
and equipment have been expanded. Yet, the goal of the Core remained the same, which is to enhance the
capabilities of individual vision research laboratories by enabling them to conduct studies that require
understanding the ocular tissue structure and function in normal and pathological conditions as well as upon
pharmacologic treatments. This goal is accomplished by providing the resources and expertise for histology,
microscopy, and mass spectrometry services as well as access to the tissue culture equipment. The Core also
offers an incentive (vouchers) for using state-of-the art technologies at the Case Western Reserve University
Cores. The histology services of the Core prepare in a timely fashion cryo or paraffin sections of eyes and mounts
them on slides for histo/immunohistochemistry analyses. If requested, routine histological stains are also
performed. The microscopy services of the Core help investigators acquire and produce publication quality
images or videos from histological slides, fixed or live cells. The mass spectrometry services of the Core provide
an equipment, support in experiment design, and training on quantitative analyses of pharmaceutical molecules,
metabolites, and proteins. All tissues culture equipment, which was previously available through the Tissue
Culture and Hybridoma Core, still remains available through the Analytical Services Core. Finally, access to
state-of-the art technologies at the University cores is encouraged via vouchers that help offset some of the cost
of these services. A physical space, resources, and expertise of the Core, operated and supervised by highly
experienced personnel, serve as the basis for the following Specific Aims: 1) to process, embed, and section
eyes followed by section mounting on slides and staining (if requested); 2) to guide users in the proper dissection,
fixation and staining techniques, thus ensuring the production of high quality histological specimens; 3) to provide
access to the Core’s microscopes along with training and consultation in all aspects of a microscopy-based
experiments; 4) to provide access to and training on the use of Metamorph and microscope-specific imaging
software to properly analyze and generate relevant data from images; 5) to assist in production of publication
quality images and/or videos; 6) to provide access to and training on the use of a mass spectrometer to detect
or quantify molecules of interest; 7) to provide access to the tissue culture equipment and incentive for use of
the University Core facilities for the services that are currently unavailable at the P30 grant Cores. The former
Histology, Microscopy & Imaging Core had the heaviest usage of all P30 grant Cores. Hence we expect that the
Analytical Services Core will have usage at the same or higher levels and continue assisting VSRC investigators

The Customer Service and PR/Marketing personnel are often the first point of contact and serve as MMRRC
ambassadors to cultivate a collaborative community of scientific investigators working with mouse models.
Through web-based interaction and various face to face activities, Customer Service and PR/Marketing
personnel strive to make all touchpoints with the MMRRC easy, accessible, dependable and resourceful. These
touchpoints involve donating investigators and their staff, repeat customers seeking to order products or
services, inquiries from the four MMRRC Centers, fielding questions from prospective users, as well as educating
those at conferences who have no prior knowledge of the MMRRC. As such, the ICSC will provide and maintain
a free public website that offers a current state-of-the-art catalog of mutant mice and valuable outside research
resources links. The website allows investigators to easily search for strains of interest or learn how to donate a
strain. Having a thorough knowledge of all repository content and related services, Customer Service personnel
will function as concierges, providing the option of guiding donating investigators through the submission process
and customers through the ordering and service options. The ICSC will conduct PR/Marketing-focused outreach
activities to raise awareness of the MMRRC as a valuable research resource and to increase repository
donations. Marketing and outreach activities will include targeted broadcasting of MMRRC holdings and services
to the international biomedical research community through monthly email push campaigns, hosting an
education/information booth at scientific conferences, producing marketing informational materials to promote
the value and services offered through the MMRRC, securing research service listings in journal buyers guides,
collaborating with other NIH supported initiatives to leverage branding efforts, supporting other NIH sponsored
efforts (e.g. RRIDs), and engaging within the scientific community via social media channels. The ICSC
Customer Service and PR/Marketing core will also provide mechanisms that solicit regular feedback from donors
and requestors, along with analyzing and summarizing findings to present to the MMRRC consortium."
10878978,"PROJECT SUMMARY – CORE/INFORMATICS
The ICSC Informatics Core is the information technology backbone of the NIH Mutant Mouse Resource and
Research Centers (MMRRC). As such, the Informatics Core maintains the MMRRC website and databases, it
provides all communication services, generates metrics, and it optimizes the MMRRC marketing effort through
targeted analyses. This is accomplished with the following IT solutions: [1] a secure MySQL relational database
that centralizes all information pertaining to archive holdings, customer accounts, acquisition/order processing,
and service requests; [2] an electronic archive of MMRRC documents to secure organizational process assets
(SOPs, policies), reports & summaries (meeting minutes, metric reports), and legal agreements (COUs, MTAs);
[3] an expert-curated catalog of MMRRC holdings with deep-annotated information on gene(s), allele(s), genetic
background, nomenclature, unique identifiers, phenotype, publications, licensing information, husbandry, health,
as well as availability & pricing in convenient strain data sheets; [4] data tracking and process refinement to log
all information on any one record while simplifying data curation and removing risks to data quality; [5] MMRRC
metrics systems that interactively visualizes MMRRC performance in terms of holdings, orders, user access,
traffic, and outreach campaign responses; and [6] internal and external data exchanges to enable efficient
information sharing between the four MMRRC Centers as well as networking with remote authoritative databases
(e.g., PubMed, RRID, MGI, IMSR, Monarch, OMIMM, etc.). The Informatics, furthermore, provides all
programming and information technology for the ICSC Applied Research Project. The Informatics Core, hence,
takes responsibility for all IT-related development, implementation, expansion, and maintenance of the MMRRC
as a resource for the research community under strict adherence to standard industry practices to enhance data
stability & security. The success of the Informatics Core efforts is backed by statistics: since 2015, the MMRRC
enjoys formidable increases in its user base (~50%) and holdings (~100%) following streamlined donation/order
processing with a focus on user-friendliness. In summary, the Informatics Core permits the operational
excellence the research community has come to expect from the MMRRC as a bioresearch community resource
for translational inquiries into human disease etiology and intervention."
10880147,"ABSTRACT:
Immunotherapy has led to remarkable improvements in patient survival for many tumor types. In particular,
immune checkpoint inhibitors have shown efficacy in many cancer types. These drugs act by turning off pathways
that inactivate T-cells and allow patients’ adaptive immune response to attack tumors,. However, very little is
known about how immunotherapy affects different racial and ethnic populations.
Breast cancer is a disease with substantial disparities in outcomes. Black women have particularly high risk of
mortality from breast cancer and also have higher risk of “triple negative” (estrogen receptor, progesterone
receptor and Her2 negative) breast cancer (TNBC) which is more responsive to immunotherapy. The tumor
immune microenvironment is a strong prognostic factor among women with breast cancer and a strong predictor
of benefit from immunotherapy. In preliminary data, we have found that breast tumors from women of African
ancestry have higher rates of lymphocytic infiltration which is generally associated with better response to
immunotherapy. However, there is no clear data on how well Black women, Hispanic/Latina or Asian women do
on checkpoint inhibitors.
In this application, we will focus on breast cancer disparities and immuno-oncology in the Research Project.
First, we will population based (cancer registry) data to determine how frequently women of different racial, ethnic
and ancestry groups with TNBC are treated with immunotherapy. We will also leverage an existing trial of locally
advanced breast cancer, ISPY2, which includes an immune checkpoint inhibitor. The trial will allow us to examine
genetic ancestry in addition to race and ethnicity. Second, we will examine the tumor immune microenvironment
among women with breast cancer in relation to genetic ancestry and in relation to genetic variants that we have
identified as associated with the tumor immune microenvironment. We will perform deep characterization using
single nuclear RNA-sequencing of a subset of the trial women, comparing responders to non-responders
selected by stratification on race and ethnicity.
We will integrate all of these data and leverage the organizational structure of the accompanying Administrative
Core to interpret these data within the context of what is already known about cancer immunology,
immunotherapy and health disparities. We will build on these results and other projects and datasets to plan
larger projects to address more ambitious questions of how different populations respond to immunotherapy,
how their rates of adverse events compare."
10880325,"The Department of Surgery at the University of California, San Francisco is one of the leading surgical
departments in the world and has a rich history of scientific, educational, and clinical advancements. We are
proposing an innovative new training program to encourage surgical residents to pursue clinician-scientist
careers in surgical oncology and position them for leadership roles in the field. The practice of cancer care has
changed considerably over the last 5 years with the introduction of a plethora of targeted agents and new
technologies. Now, more than ever, surgical oncologists are required to have a broad understanding of the
biological bases of cancer and its treatment, as well as training in modern clinical and translational
methodologies. To be leaders in the field and make real improvements in cancer care, however, they must also
be able to confidently navigate both the regulatory processes and the complex healthcare delivery environment
in which we work.
This program will be the first on the West Coast to explicitly support surgical residents in oncology research. It
will also be the only T32 that explicitly incorporates training in regulatory research and innovation, integrating
this with translational/clinical sciences and health services/implementation science. The core of this training
program are mentored research projects, which will focus on one of the three themes, but with the guidance of
faculty mentors, will include aspects of all three themes. Among the unique opportunities presented in this
program is the option for short-term placement at the FDA to address problems in regulatory science. Another
important aspect of the program is a series of courses and workshops designed to develop the leadership skills
necessary to evoke positive change, guide productive research projects and teams and create a diverse and
inclusive work environment. We will initially fund two positions each year for two years, which will be available to
third year surgery residents undertaking their research elective. An external advisory board of leaders in
oncology, trials, implementation science and education will advise the program.
The program is led by Dr. Laura Esserman, who has demonstrated her commitment to training throughout her
career, and who has the full and conscientious support of the department and institution for this program. The
rich research environment of UCSF Department of Surgery, the carefully selected faculty mentors and the
availability of numerous large-scale research programs provides ample opportunity for meaningful mentored
research projects that will provide strong foundations for trainees future careers as clinician-scientists."

Making advances in oral health depends on training highly skilled scientists capable of conducting rigorous
dental, oral and craniofacial research, and on preparing them to work in multi- and interdisciplinary teams to
translate research findings into applications that improve the health of the public. The proposed training
program at the University of Washington (UW) is a competing renewal of an existing T90/R90 training grant
titled Comprehensive Training in Interdisciplinary Oral Health Research. By leveraging the breadth and
strength of academic research programs available at the UW, we have successfully created and refined a
comprehensive training program that offers a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary oral health research areas,
including public health, behavioral, and clinical, as well as basic and translational sciences. Our previous
NIDCR-funded training programs have been highly effective, with 85% of our former predoctoral and/or
postdoctoral trainees from the prior 15 years going on to work in research-intensive or research-related
positions. Research areas included are public health, behavioral, and clinical, as well as basic and translational
sciences. The Department of Oral Health Sciences (OHS) in the School of Dentistry serves as the focal point for
the program, providing core content for all trainees. Other participating departments include Biostatistics,
Epidemiology, and Health Systems & Population Health in the School of Public Health. Areas of focus are in
basic and translational sciences include molecular and genetic approaches to health and disease; craniofacial
structure, function and development; and stem cell biology/tissue regeneration/engineering. Our objectives are
to: 1) provide rigorous, discipline-based training in basic/translational or public health/behavioral/clinical oral
health research (achieved through departmental graduate programs and mentored research); and, 2) provide
experiences that develop trainees' skills for participating as strong contributing members of multi- and
interdisciplinary research teams (achieved through core seminars and research presentations, as well as
individualized career development opportunities, based on the trainee's Individual Development Plan). Pre-
doctoral training (2 PhD positions) is offered through PhD programs in all four participating departments. The
DDS/PhD program (3 positions) is offered through the Oral Health Sciences Graduate Program. Postdoctoral
training (4 positions) is available to candidates with an eligible doctoral degree to work on oral health research
topics, and this includes dentists seeking additional research training and experience. Included is 1 post-
doctoral position designated for a non-citizen dentist interested in advanced research training to prepare for a
research career, particularly in a US school of dentistry. The expected duration of appointments is 5 years for
pre-doctoral and 2 or 3 years for postdoctoral trainees. We evaluate the program based not only on process
measures (e.g., progress toward degree, near-term goals), but also on long-term outcomes, including positions
taken by trainees, their authorship on scientific publications, and record of grants as PI or key personnel."
10927426,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The PI was previously funded by the F30 mechanism while completing the Duke Medical Scientist Training
Program. He has since completed medical school and internship and now returns for a full-time research career.
This career development proposal is an effective continuation of the PI’s prior mentored training and research
experience and seeks to develop him into an independent investigator. The proposed project concerns the role
of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in retinal disease screening. Preventable retinal blindness affects tens
of millions of Americans and hundreds of millions worldwide. Its top three causes are chronic, progressive
conditions that yield irreversible vision loss after an initial asymptomatic period. Annual screening is therefore
essential to detect and treat these diseases before sight deteriorates. Rates of screening are suboptimal,
however, because the proper eye examination is difficult for and inaccurate when performed by primary care
providers (PCPs). OCT is an essential imaging modality for management of retinal diseases. Currently, clinical
OCT is deployed as bulky tabletop instruments that require trained ophthalmic photographers, dedicated imaging
suites, and mechanical head stabilization with chinrests for operation, which has prevented OCT-based eye
screening by PCPs. We recently introduced robotic point-of-care OCT (RAOCT) as a fundamentally new
paradigm for OCT-based eye examination that overcomes the barriers that restrict OCT to ophthalmology offices.
RAOCT offers semi- or fully-automated non-contact OCT imaging by bringing a robot-mounted OCT scanner to
the patient, tracking them throughout a large imaging workspace, and optically correcting for motion artifact. Our
laboratory prototypes using this approach have demonstrated sufficient OCT quality in freestanding and seated
subjects for anatomic measurement and clinical correlation, respectively, with only minimal operator training.
These prototypes function reliably only under controlled laboratory conditions, however, and significant
technology development for portability, tracking robustness, and motion correction is necessary to yield a clinic-
ready instrument. This project therefore seeks to advance our bench-mounted prototypes into fully-fledged
mobile systems for imaging in non-specialist clinics and to test them against the OCT standard-of-care. First, we
will transition our prototype into a wheeled cart that can be brought into clinics, upgrade our robot arm for
extended reach, and redesign our robot-mounted scanner for improved tracking under realistic imaging
conditions. Next, we will enhance motion attenuation by transitioning image processing algorithms to dedicated
hardware, by adding digital correction for residual motion, and by incorporating a novel adaptive scanning
technique to reduce imaging time. Finally, we will perform RAOCT imaging in ophthalmology clinics to compare
against the standard of care and in primary care offices to evaluate screening workflows. Completion of this
project will develop robotic point-of-care OCT into a turnkey imaging platform that promises to enhance eye
screening in primary care settings."
10877593,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The national opioid epidemic is a significant public health crisis requiring accelerated efforts to translate
mechanistic studies into therapeutic developments. Substance use disorders (SUDs) feature dysregulation of
brain reward circuits, especially dopaminergic systems governing motivated behavior. The habenula (Hb) is a
key reward circuitry hub that sends direct projections to the ventral tegmental area (VTA), as well as other
aminergic centers, to modulate reward seeking. Hb circuit dysfunction is associated with addiction, but the
molecular mechanisms mediating this dysfunction, especially in the context of opioid use disorder (OUD) are
unknown. Here we propose to use integrated single cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches to map
molecular changes associated with chronic opioid self-administration in specific cell populations across the
rodent Hb (Aim 1). Using retrograde labeling and nuclear tagging, we will also generate transcriptomic
signatures for Hb neurons projecting to the VTA (Hb-VTA projections) and evaluate their susceptibility to
molecular changes associated with chronic opioid exposure (Aim 2). Finally, we will integrate these
complimentary rodent datasets with molecular data we are generating in the post-mortem human Hb in the
context of OUD as part of an ongoing NIDA-funded award (1R01DA55823) to identify specific Hb cell
populations and projection neurons enriched in genes associated with opioid addiction in the human brain (Aim
3). The proposed study will generate the first spatially-resolved atlas of opioid-induced gene expression
changes in the rodent Hb at cellular and circuit resolution. Integration of this molecular map with clinical gene
sets in the context of OUD will help translate insights from rodent models into cell type- and circuit-based
therapeutic approaches for the treatment of addiction."
10878789,"The University of Pittsburgh seeks continued support for multidisciplinary and innovative pre-doctoral training in
Regenerative Medicine via the Cellular Approaches to Tissue Engineering & Regeneration (CATER) training program.
The CATER program combines faculty and research expertise from an eclectic group of disciplines that combine tissue
engineering with molecular and cellular approaches of therapies for human disease and regeneration. Regenerative
medicine is truly a multidisciplinary field that brings together scientists from human biology, engineering, medical
devices, material sciences, development, pathology, systems biology and applied technologies to focus on the repair and
replacement of human tissues to restore form and function. A significant challenge in regenerative medicine is
developing the next generation of experts with intellectual grasp of these diverse disciplines. This was the impetus
behind the inception of the CATER program, which enabled cross-disciplinary training transcending the more traditional
departmentally-focused research training programs. The CATER pre-doctoral training program embraces this
multidisciplinary collaborative sentiment for research and education in regenerative medicine, abolishing silos within
disciplines and remains the hallmark of the CATER program. The students matriculate into CATER program from the
Bioengineering Graduate program in the School of Engineering or Interdisciplinary Biomedical Graduate program
from the School of Medicine usually in their 2nd year based on successful nomination and evaluation for academic
excellence and research in regenerative medicine. While CATER trainees are funded for the next 2 years as they
accomplish coursework, develop research projects and become part of a robust, interactive and collaborative community,
they remain part of CATER activities until their thesis defense and beyond. The goal of the CATER training program is to
provide a solid foundation upon which to build a productive and independent career in regenerative medicine for human
disease and injury. This goal is accomplished via a highly coordinated and mentored interdisciplinary training program,
which combines required and elective courses, research and specialized training opportunities, including internships and
professional development activities. Having been funded for 15 years, the CATER program continues to provide what
we believe is timely, innovative and outstanding training in all key areas critical for success in regenerative medicine.
CATER trainees have successfully established research programs in academia or industry, joined industry or government
in regulatory domain, and have even gone on to more diverse professions like intellectual property law and FBI. We
are confident that our program will continue to ‘cater’ to the evolving needs of our trainees and toward the advancing
definition and depth of regenerative medicine as a discipline. We request continued support of NIBIB for 6 training slots
to continue training our next generation of scientists practicing regenerative medicine, through coordinated,
interdisciplinary and rigorous didactics; research; and professional training, via the CATER program."

Endothelial cell (EC) metabolism has emerged as an essential driver and regulator of blood and lymphatic
vessel development, as well as an alternative approach in anti-angiogenic therapy. It has been shown that
metabolism is not only vital to EC function, but also to controlling different steps of the (lymph)-angiogenic
process. Lymphatic vessels show remarkable plasticity and heterogeneity, reflecting their functional
specialization to control the tissue microenvironment. Our recent findings revealed that by sensing the lymphatic
endothelial cell (LEC) differentiation status and microenvironmental metabolic conditions, mitochondrial
complex III regulates LEC fate specification and maintenance during embryonic development. Similar to what
was shown for blood endothelial cells, most likely in different pathological conditions, mitochondrial respiration
is also required for the growth and expansion (lymphangiogenesis) of lymphatics. We argue that mitochondrial
respiration sensing and regulation of the metabolic status of LECs is a critical step during developmental and
disease-promoted lymphangiogenesis, and we will evaluate this proposal in mouse models of cardiac injury and
induced acute and chronic pancreatitis."

Chronic pain is a significant public health problem that costs society billions of dollars per year and causes great
suffering in countless individuals. Opioid-based medications are among the most prescribed for various forms of
chronic pain contributing to the current opioid epidemic. Recently, cannabis and cannabinoid compounds (e.g.,
Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD)) have been described as having pain-alleviating
properties. While these cannabinoids, particularly the less psychoactive variant, CBD, may offer alternatives to
opioid treatments for pain, few well-controlled studies demonstrate analgesic efficacy, especially for CBD. While
it is still unclear if cannabinoids are good stand-alone options for treating pain, cannabinoids may act as useful
opioid-sparing drugs, given the substantial overlap between opioid and cannabinoid receptors in reward- and
pain-related pathways. Our proposed project will focus on a heuristic approach that incorporates fundamental
pharmacology, novel operant behavioral assays of pain, and functional neuroimaging. The long-term goal of
this research program is to establish novel approaches to treat chronic pain by maximizing analgesic efficacy
and minimizing abuse liability. The objective of this proposal, which embodies the first step toward this long-
term goal, is to determine how CBD modifies the effects of oxycodone (OXY), a commonly prescribed opioid
analgesic, in the contexts of chronic pain and opioid self-administration. Our overarching hypothesis is that
CBD and OXY will act synergistically to yield enhanced analgesic effects, and that CBD will attenuate the effects
of pain on OXY self-administration. Two major specific aims will be investigated: (1) to determine how CBD
interacts with OXY to reduce chronic operant pain behaviors; and (2) to determine the interacting effects
of chronic pain, OXY self-administration, and CBD on analgesia, reinforcement, and dependence. We will
assess the effects of preexisting pain on OXY self-administration, as well as the effects of preexisting OXY self-
administration on pain. The latter goal is a particularly innovative aspect of this proposal. CBD-modulatory effects
on pain and OXY self-administration will be evaluated under both conditions. Neuroimaging will be used across
experiments to map and quantify changes in neural connectivity across reward and pain centers of the brain
following the various drug treatments (CBD, OXY) and pain states (acute, chronic). Further, we will use clinically
important and innovative pain-depressed behavioral assessments that accurately model pain in human subjects.
The rationale for completing these studies is that by determining how CBD and OXY interact to affect pain and
substance use, we will establish the necessary foundation for future efforts to develop effective analgesics with
reduced abuse liability. We believe we are particularly well suited to undertake this project because we have a
unified (and already collaborating) multidisciplinary team with complementary expertise in behavioral
neuroscience, pharmacology, and neuroimaging."

The misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins into fibrillar amyloid deposits is the pathological hallmark of
a wide class of diseases and neurodegenerative disorders, which represent a major public health concern
worldwide. While it is recognized that amyloid aggregates play an active part in the molecular pathology of the
disease, the exact aggregation states that causes cytotoxicity and relationship between pathogenesis and the
distribution of secondary structures in amyloid aggregates is not well established. The aim of this project is to
investigate the heterogeneities in protein secondary structure in amyloid aggregates both in-vitro and ex-vivo
and identify their relationship with disease progression. Our approach relies on utilizing state-of-the-art
nanoscale infrared (IR) spectroscopy and confocal IR spectroscopic imaging to map protein secondary structures
in amyloid deposits. We will focus on studying amyloid aggregates and their heterogeneities in Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) to develop and optimize our methods, and subsequently aim to extend these strategies to
investigate amyloid aggregates in other diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and Breast Cancer. The
hypothesis underlying this effort is that structural heterogeneities of amyloid deposits, and not just specific fibrillar
structures, are correlated with disease progression. We will utilize photothermal AFM-IR, a technique that
augments IR spectroscopy with Atomic Force Microscopy, to obtain nanoscale aggregate-specific spectra.
Seeded growth from tissue extracts from AD patients will enable probing the differences in aggregation pathways
and structural polymorphisms associated with different disease stages. Amyloid aggregates in tissues will be
investigated through confocal IR microscopy. The tissue spectral data will be analyzed to classify amyloid
deposits based on their secondary structure distributions, and the correlation between distinct classes of deposits
and disease stages will be explored. We further aim to integrate AFM-IR and IR microscopy and develop a
spatially and spectrally adaptive IR imaging approach that will enable multiscale measurement of spectral data
in tissues. The unique aspect of this approach is that it uses cutting edge technologies in spatially resolved IR
spectroscopy and imaging to investigate a problem that is central to the molecular pathology of a wide range of
diseases and development of therapeutic strategies."
10888292,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to better define the proteostasis pathways that coordinate erythropoiesis, a specialized
process distinguished by massive hemoglobin synthesis and the elimination of most other proteins. This
application investigates how protein quality control modulates ß-thalassemia, a common hemoglobinopathy
caused by HBB gene mutations that impair the production of the ß-globin subunit of adult hemoglobin (HbA,
α2ß2). Consequently, free α-globin forms cytotoxic precipitates that cause maturation arrest and apoptosis of
erythroid precursors (ineffective erythropoiesis) and hemolysis, leading to anemia, bone deformities and iron
overload. Current therapies, including red blood cell transfusion, iron chelation and hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation for selected patients, are effective but not uniformly available, particularly in low/middle income
countries where the disease is most prevalent. Hence, new therapies are needed. Our preliminary data
demonstrate that the Unc-51–like autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK1) mediates the autophagy of free α-globin
in ß-thalassemia. In general, ULK1 is inhibited by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)
kinase and stimulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Administration of the mTORC1 inhibitor
rapamycin to HbbTh3/+ mice, a validated preclinical model for ß-thalassemia, stimulated the autophagy of free α-
globin to reduce ineffective erythropoiesis and hemolysis in an ULK1-dependent fashion. Our data support the
central hypothesis that mTORC1 inhibition or AMPK activation can alleviate the pathophysiology of ß-
thalassemia by stimulating ULK1-mediated autophagic clearance of free α-globin. We will test this by: Aim 1,
optimizing the pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 for ULK1 activation in HbbTh3/+ mice and by defining the
regulatory circuitry of α-globin autophagy in mouse and human ß-thalassemic erythroblasts; Aim 2, determining
whether elemental iron, a known activator of mTORC1, suppresses ULK1-mediated clearance of α-globin in ß-
thalassemic erythroblasts and whether this deleterious effect can be prevented by iron restriction; and Aim 3,
elucidating the genetic interactions between ß-thalassemia and miR-451, an abundantly expressed erythroid
microRNA that we showed to inhibit the LKB1 kinase and its substrate AMPK. In support of Aim 3, disruption of
the bi-cistronic miR-144/451 locus in HbbTh3/+ mice caused a reduction in α-globin precipitates and ß-thalassemia
pathologies. Overall, our studies promise to elucidate the biology of proteostasis networks that maintain balanced
hemoglobin synthesis through targeted protein degradation and validate mTORC1, AMPK and ULK1 as
“druggable” targets for novel ß-thalassemia therapies."
10887212,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Plasmodium parasite infections cause an estimated 229 million malaria cases and 409,000 deaths per year
worldwide, posing a significant global public health burden. Artemisinin (ART) is the most effective first-line drug
in combination therapies to treat Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria, the deadliest malaria-causing parasite,
but a major problem plaguing disease elimination efforts is the emergence and spread of partial ART resistance,
characterized by delayed parasite clearance following ART treatments. In Pf, this has led to reduced efficacy as
well as an increased risk of resistance to partner drugs. The threat of multi-drug resistant parasites therefore
looms large, prompting a critical need to understand the molecular mechanisms of ART resistance, a complex
phenomenon whose associated molecular markers remain poorly described. Studies on Pf ART resistance have
largely focused on mutations in the Kelch 13 protein (K13) propeller domain, which disrupt digestion of
hemoglobin required for ART activation. This disruption gives the parasite a fitness advantage when faced with
ART, and can partially account for resistance. But while ART is dependent on hemoglobin digestion, its activity
is dependent on other, yet-to-be elucidated mechanisms. In the present work, ART sensitivity in a Pf field isolate
harboring a K13 mutation was modulated using an in vitro evolution strategy. Single-cell RNA-sequencing was
then performed to elucidate the transcriptional signatures of ART-resistant and -sensitive ring forms. The most
striking distinction between ART-resistant and -sensitive rings is the greater expression of genes encoding for
RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the former group. RBPs are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression
that coordinate growth and life-stage transitions in Plasmodium parasites, and are also known to mediate stress
responses, including to drug exposure. However, despite evidence of altered Pf stress response pathways
implicated in ART resistance, the role of RBPs remains unknown. The proposed project will use state of the art
techniques and phenotypic assays to assess the extent to which post-transcriptional gene regulation via RBPs
governs ART resistance. In aim 1, I will use long-read, short-read, and Chromosome Conformation Capture
sequencing to determine the genetic signatures underlying the observed cellular and transcriptomic phenotypes
in ART-resistant and -sensitive parasites; in aim 2, I will use inducible knockdown studies to assess the extent
to which two candidate RBPs mediate ART resistance; and in aim 3, I will use high-throughput sequencing of
RNA isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP-seq) to identify the RNA interactors of the candidate
RBPs. The outcomes of these studies will expand our understanding of ART resistance mechanisms and guide
new therapeutic strategies to tackle ART resistance."
10888197,"Heart failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Cardiomyopathy, the pathology that
underlies most cases of heart failure is often triggered by myocardial injury. This promotes inflammation,
fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast transformation, and ultimately fibrosis, which directly contributes to
structural changes that underlie heart failure and its complications. Structural imaging modalities such as
magnetic resonance imaging can provide a snapshot of cardiac structure at a given point. However, they do
not provide any information on the fibrotic process, which is the target of therapeutic interventions to prevent
the progression and promote the regression of fibrosis. Similarly, while several new tracers have been
introduced to detect fibrosis by molecular imaging, these agents target mature collagen and cannot distinguish
between established disease and ongoing matrix remodeling which accompanies active fibrogenesis and
resolution of fibrosis. Therefore, novel non-invasive quantitative tools are needed to characterize fibrosis,
detect matrix turnover, select the patients for emerging therapies, track the effect of therapeutic interventions,
and improve prognostication. Cardiac fibrosis consists mainly of collagen types I and III. The hallmark of
collagen structure is triple helix, a right-handed helix of 3 α-chains formed by repetitive motifs, which self-
assemble to form (pro)collagen fibers. During ventricular remodeling, the highly organized mature collagen
fibers are degraded by proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) into single stranded α-chains that
are not normally present in the extracellular space. Based on the role of collagen turnover in cardiac
remodeling and in conjunction with our preliminary data, we hypothesize that the development and regression
of fibrosis in ventricular remodeling can be tracked by imaging single stranded collagen. To address this
hypothesis, and as a novel approach to imaging cardiac fibrosis, we propose to develop novel radiotracers to
target collagen turnover by taking advantage of collagen triple helix self-assembly. This novel class of peptide-
based radiotracers is designed with a modular structure and includes a prototype tracer which has yielded
promising results in preliminary studies. Here, we seek to further characterize and optimize the lead tracer as
needed, and evaluate it for micro single photon computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT)
imaging in murine models of replacement and interstitial cardiac fibrosis to track fibrosis and its resolution, and
to predict ventricular remodeling in comparison with MMP-targeted imaging. Combined these studies will
introduce and validate a novel molecular imaging approach with a straightforward path to clinical translation to
track fibrosis and its resolution, for not only cardiomyopathy, but also a wide range of other fibrotic disorders."
10889071,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The discrepancy between health spending and outcomes in the United States compared to other developed
countries suggests persistent inefficiency in the nation's health systems. Current provider payment systems often
inadvertently penalize, rather than reward, providers who produce better health outcomes at lower cost. One
approach to improving efficiency is to give consumers information about higher-quality, lower-cost providers and
financial incentives to choose them. Tiered cost-sharing is one such health insurance benefit design that provides
information and incentives to patients, thereby rewarding efficient providers with greater patient volume.
 This study will examine one of the longest-running tiered cost sharing systems in the United States – the
State Employee Group Insurance Program Minnesota Advantage health plan (SEGIP). The SEGIP plan covers
130,000 State employees and their dependents across the state, which includes dense urban centers and
remote rural areas. Each year SEGIP employees select a primary care “gatekeeper” clinic that is responsible for
coordinating the entirety of their care, including referrals to specialists and hospitals, and pharmaceuticals.
Clinics are assessed on their risk-adjusted total cost of care and placed into one of four cost-sharing tiers. The
cost-sharing differentials are substantial, giving consumers a strong incentive to choose lower-cost clinics.
 We have addressed some of the initial questions regarding consumer responses to tiering in research funded
by the Robert Wood Johnson and Donaghue Foundations. In this proposal, we move to the next step to
investigate responses of clinic leaders to inclusion in a tiered cost-sharing system. We will use both quantitative
and qualitative methods as part of a triangulation mixed methods design. Our research will assess what actions
clinic leaders have taken in response to inclusion in a tiered cost-sharing system, how they think strategically

Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) not only burdens affected patients with a second, attention-demanding
disease but threatens nutritional status, pulmonary function, and survival. Developing strategies to preserve β-
cell function are crucial for interrupting CFRD development and its hazard to CF-relevant outcomes. The overall
aims of this application are to better understand the emergence and progression of abnormal glucose tolerance
in pancreatic insufficient CF (PI-CF) and to test a potential strategy for restoring β-cell function. This application
extends our recent studies demonstrating that 1) insulin secretion defects are present at glucose thresholds
traditionally considered normal (one-hour oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] glucose >155 but <200 mg/dL;
referred to as early glucose intolerance [EGI]), 2) such subtle glucose abnormalities associate with increased
CFRD risk and may portend greater declines in pulmonary function, and 3) infusion of the incretin hormone,
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), but not glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), augments glucose-
dependent insulin secretion in PI-CF. Our cross-sectional studies in CF demonstrate marked reductions in meal-
related early-phase insulin secretion and β-cell secretory capacity in EGI. With worsening glucose tolerance, PI-
CF subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, two-hour OGTT glucose >140 but <200 mg/dL) and CFRD
exhibit further compromised meal-related early-phase insulin secretion and β-cell secretory capacity. The extent
to which emergence and progression of glucose intolerance is a manifestation of worsening β-cell secretory
capacity is not known and will be investigated in longitudinal studies of youth and adults with PI-CF in whom
mixed-meal tolerance tests (MMTT) will be performed to characterize early-phase insulin secretion and glucose-
potentiated arginine (GPA) tests will be completed to quantify β-cell secretory capacity. In Aim 1, we will leverage
the genotyping and clinical phenotyping of our pediatric and adult CF cohort (n=350) to test the impact of T2D
genetic variants, diet, CFTR modulator therapy, and pulmonary exacerbations on the emergence and
progression of glucose intolerance and the relationship of glucose intolerance with nutritional status, pulmonary
function, and body composition longitudinally over 4-5 years. In Aim 2 we will test whether our findings of β-cell
responsiveness to acute GLP-1 infusion has the potential to be translated into the use of chronic GLP-1 therapy
as a mechanism to preserve β-cell function. Specifically, we will pursue a proof-of-concept 6-week randomized,
placebo-controlled cross-over study of the GLP-1 agonist, dulaglutide; the primary outcome will be the impact of
dulaglutide upon meal-related early-phase insulin secretion, one of the earliest defects detected clinically. If
successful, this work will provide the foundation for a multi-center study aimed at identifying and treating early
insulin secretion defects in PI-CF and interrupting progression to CFRD."

Eating behaviors are robustly associated with dietary quality and weight gain. Given the relevance of eating
behaviors to health in children and adults, remarkably little is known regarding the development of these
behaviors from infancy, and their continuity (or discontinuity) into childhood. Eating behaviors can be
phenotyped in infancy through rigorous measurement of behavior following exposure to different stimuli under
careful experimental control, though no studies prior to R01HD084163 have phenotyped multiple eating
behaviors objectively in a single longitudinal infant cohort. Eating behavior may be modifiable between infancy
and early childhood, potentially altering any associations with future dietary quality or weight gain. Interventions
that promote adaptive maternal feeding practices have been effective in reducing obesity risk. Intervention
effects might be further strengthened by tailoring to characteristics of the individual child. Identifying
interactions of carefully phenotyped child eating behavior and maternal feeding practices in an observational
cohort study is an important initial step towards future tailored intervention development. The proposed work
will examine for the first time the continuity (or discontinuity) of extensively phenotyped eating behaviors in
infancy, based on novel objective measures and maternal report, to age 5 years. The work will, for the first
time, test whether maternal feeding practices and infant eating behaviors interact to predict child eating
behaviors at age 5 years, as well as dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years. The ABC Baby study
(R01HD084163, 7/1/15-06/30/20) and its ancillary funded studies used novel behavioral protocols to
phenotype eating behavior and maternal feeding practices longitudinally at ages 2 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, 9, and
12 months in a cohort of 286 infants. The current application proposes to follow up with 200 of these children at
ages 5 and 6 years to address the following aims: Aim 1: To test the cross-lagged associations between child
eating behaviors and maternal feeding practices across infancy and age 5 years. We hypothesize that child
eating behaviors in infancy predict child eating behaviors at age 5 years, maternal feeding practices in infancy
predict maternal feeding practices at age 5 years, child eating behaviors in infancy predict maternal feeding
practices at 5 years, and maternal feeding practices in infancy predict child eating behaviors at 5 years. Aim 2:
To test the hypothesis that eating behaviors measured in infancy have direct and indirect (through eating
behaviors at age 5 years) associations with dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years. Aim 3: To test the
hypotheses that maternal feeding practices in infancy moderate associations of infant eating behaviors with
eating behaviors at 5 years, and that maternal feeding practices at 5 years moderate associations of eating
behaviors in infancy with dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years, and moderate associations of eating
behaviors at age 5 years with dietary quality and BMI at age 6 years."

 Reducing the prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a public health priority in the US as highlighted in
Healthy People 2030. Although pharmacological and behavioral treatments can reduce alcohol-related harms,
a large unmet need for AUD treatment exists. The unmet need can be attributed to several factors, including
the ongoing shortage of mental health workforce. In 2022, over 148 million (45%) of Americans resided in
mental health professional shortage areas (MHPSAs), facing barriers to access to AUD treatment.
 To attract more clinicians to MHPSAs, policymakers have launched many programs, including the National
Health Service Corps (NHSC). Since 2009, federal investment in the NHSC has experienced a significant
surge, resulting in the NHSC clinician workforce more tripling by 2022. Compared with other types of NHSC
clinicians (e.g., primary and dental care clinicians), the NHSC mental health workforce experienced the largest
growth since 2009. However, no study to date has evaluated the potential effect of the NHSC expansion on
disparities in AUD treatment across geographic areas. We hypothesized that the substantial growth of mental
health workforce brought about by the NHSC expansion reduced disparities in AUD treatment and outcomes
between MHPSAs and other areas. Further, we posited that the effects of the NHSC expansion on AUD
treatment disparities differ by population groups and clinician types given the facts that people with lower
socio-economic status dominated MHPSAs and that the growth of the NHSC’s workforce varied by clinician
type (e.g., psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, and clinical counselors).
 This proposed project will examine these hypotheses and fill the gap in the literature. Specifically, the
project aims to assess the effect of the NHSC expansion on disparities in AUD mortality, unmet need for AUD
treatment, and utilization and costs of alcohol-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations. In
addition to geographic disparities between MHPSAs and non-shortage areas, the project will examine effect
heterogeneity of the NHSC expansion across population groups and clinician types. We will use multiple large,
national data files. To analyze the data, we will take two complementary approaches, including a difference-in-
differences method and an instrumental variable approach, to generate rigorous quasi-experimental evidence
about the impact of the NHSC expansion on AUD treatment disparities.
 By focusing on health workforce issues in underserved areas, the proposed study is highly relevant to
NIAAA’s PAR-23-185, which lists workforce-related barriers to access to AUD treatment as a specific area of
interest. The study findings will have important implications for policy decisions related to future directions for
the NHSC and further reducing disparities in AUD treatment and outcomes."

The purpose of this K01 proposal is to facilitate the applicant's transition to an independent research career
focused on stress and sex hormone biology to understand mechanisms of sex differences in cardiovascular
disease and potential disparities among women. Training components for the proposed research will include
direct clinical training in stress testing and vascular physiology, new training in sex hormones and measures of
ovarian function, faculty career development, active mentoring, and completion of the proposed research. The
premise of this research project is based on preliminary data from the applicant's own research which suggest
that compared to men, women (and particularly, younger women) with coronary heart disease have distinct
vascular mechanisms in relation to stress and myocardial ischemia, and have higher basal and stress-related
inflammation. We have also reported that women ≤ 60 years of age are more likely to develop myocardial
ischemia during mental stress than men of similar age. The underlying explanation for these sex differences is
unknown; however, one potential mechanism involves sex hormone biology among premenopausal women
and across the menopausal transition. Stress may impair female reproduction through diminished ovarian
reserve and induce earlier age at menopause, which have been associated with cardiovascular risk, possibly
through sex hormone-related pathways influencing immune response, vascular, and cardiac function. The
overall goal of this project is to understand mechanisms for sex differences in inflammatory and vascular
responses to mental stress, and the role of ovarian function and menopausal status among women. The
applicant will leverage the infrastructure of the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2:
R01HL109413), which was recently renewed for a new enrollment wave (MIMS3: 2R01HL109413). The two
waves will total 300 men and 300 women with a recent myocardial infarction (MI), ≤ 60 years of age. The
applicant will add the collection of data on anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), a biomarker of ovarian reserve and
menopausal status in women and examine AMH levels in relation to stress responses. The applicant will also
recruit a sample of healthy women (n = 100) matched for age to the post-MI women, for comparison of AMH
levels and age at menopause. The scientific aims of this project are to: 1) Examine sex differences in
inflammation and vascular function at baseline and in response to mental stress and the role of gonadal aging
by comparing young and middle-aged women and men; 2) Examine and compare inflammatory and vascular
profiles and gonadal aging and age at menopause with age-matched control women; and 3) Examine whether
psychosocial stressors such as depression, early life adversity, discrimination, and neighborhood disadvantage
are associated with gonadal aging (lower AMH levels) in women with a recent MI and age matched controls.
The new enrollment of patients and controls will provide key opportunities for training and data collection on
gonadal aging and vascular function to inform the development of a future NIH-R01 proposal."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and a major cause of morbidity in the United
States, yet there remains no disease-modifying therapy as the mechanism of disease is incompletely
understood. AD is defined by the accumulation of two protein lesions in the brain, amyloid-β plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary tangles, which are composed of aggregated tau protein, are a better marker
of disease progression than amyloid-β, correlating with neuron loss and cognitive decline. Notably, tau tangles
spread through the brain in a stereotypical fashion defined by Braak staging, starting in the locus coeruleus and
spreading along networked synapses. This suggests that misfolded tau is propagated across the synapse,
templating normal tau to become misfolded as well and generate new lesions. However, some regions never
develop tau lesions despite parallel synaptic exposure to the locus coeruleus, suggesting selective vulnerability
of different regions to tau lesions. Although some cases of AD are due to dominant single gene mutations, the
vast majority of AD cases are sporadic with no clear genetic cause. One approach to such complexity is to study
the gene expression response to disease in order to capture functional interactions between genes. Most
transcriptomic studies have limited their analysis to the disease response in affected areas of the brain,
comparing diseased individuals to normal controls. In contrast, our analysis incorporates the selective
vulnerability of specific brain regions to developing tau lesions, comparing a lesion-affected area of the brain
(prefrontal cortex) to a lesion-protected area (cerebellum) in both diseased and control individuals. According to
the premise that both regions receive the same anterograde tau insult, but differential expression uniquely
protects the cerebellum, this comparison will highlight the drivers of neuroprotection in areas that never develop
lesions. This approach has yielded a list of candidate drivers of disease neuroprotection, notably enriching for
chaperone proteins that regulate protein folding. Our analysis also identified several transcription factors (TF)
candidates, such as the core clock regulator BHLHE40. This aligns with observations of several circadian
phenotypes observed in AD, such as the increased risk of AD among patients with sleep disorders and vice
versa. This proposal aims to test our candidate driver genes through several approaches. Aim 1 will test the
identified chaperone proteins for functional inhibition of tau misfolding in both a biochemical model of induced
recombinant tau fibrillization and in vitro with a cellular biosensor of tau aggregation. Aim 2 will test TF candidates
for modulation of tau aggregate accumulation in vitro with a cellular biosensor of tau aggregation. Finally, Aim 3
will test how a circadian TF, BHLHE40, modulates tau spreading in a mouse model of misfolded tau seed
injection. Together these aims will create new insight into mechanisms of protection from AD tauopathy and
provide multiple new avenues for development of disease-modifying therapies."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the US and globally. The epidemic
of obesity, diabetes, and cardiometabolic disease is changing the nature of CAD, with diffuse and microvascular
disease emerging as key drivers of adverse outcomes. Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging is the most
widely used modality for CAD assessment and is still primarily performed with SPECT. But SPECT evaluates
only relative perfusion and is inherently insensitive in the setting of diffuse or microvascular disease. PET, with
its unique ability to accurately quantify absolute myocardial blood flow, allows robust detection of obstructive
CAD, diffuse atherosclerosis, balanced ischemia, and coronary microvascular dysfunction. Cardiac PET is also
always obtained with additional chest CT for attenuation correction purposes. However, this modality requires a
high level of on-site technical expertise to maximize its broad capabilities.
We have applied highly efficient, image-based artificial intelligence (AI) approaches extensively to SPECT and
CT, demonstrating improved diagnostic accuracy and risk stratification. These tools can be harnessed to
enhance the utility of cardiac PET/CT. We propose to efficiently translate the latest AI advances and our recent
SPECT developments to fully automate cardiac PET/CT analysis, including novel tools for quality control, high-
performance image segmentation, new quantitative variables, and direct outcome prediction from images, using
PET/CT data from multiple centers.
The overall aim is to develop is to develop practical AI algorithms for comprehensive cardiac PET/CT analysis
and to validate them in a multi-center setting. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To
develop and test automated end-to-end PET quantification, (2) To develop and test automated end-to-end chest
CT quantification, (3) To develop and validate explainable AI models for enhanced patient assessment from
images and clinical data, employing latest advances in survival analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning,
and knowledge transfer.
This research will result in personalized tools, which will improve the accuracy of patient assessment by PET/CT
beyond what is possible by the current practice of subjective interpretation and mental integration of diverse
data. Explainable methods combining image and clinical data to make AI conclusions more tangible will allow
clinical adoption of this technology. The new tools can dramatically simplify PET/CT protocols, reduce
subjectivity, reduce burden on the physicians, and maximize the information derived from the multimodal scans.
They will fit directly into existing workflows, facilitating deployment in diverse clinical settings. The new AI
methods for image analysis and explainable integration of multimodality data will generalize to other diseases
and problems in biomedical imaging."

providing training and educational opportunities to a graduate student of a low socioeconomic status background.
Specifically, the candidate will develop a microphysiological model of the salivary gland with integrated epithelial

epithelial and endothelial cells in a customized hydrogel matrix of macroscopic dimension will likely lead to the
establishment of a pre-vascularized neotissue that can be directly implanted to the host to re-establish the
secretory function (Aim 2 of the parent award), the chip-based tissue model with a defined epithelial-endothelial
interface will enable mechanistic investigations on how the endothelial components affect the organization and
the phenotype of the epithelial cells. The candidate will evaluate whether the vascular components will enhance
the expansion of progenitor cells, suppress ductal differentiation, promote the establishment of polarized acini,
and at the same time, facilitate epithelial patterning. He will further evaluate whether a primitive vasculature and
a fully functional and perfusable blood vessel exert the same effects on the epithelium. Parallel to the
establishment of the scientific program is a mentoring plan that includes the development of annual Individual
Development Plan (IDP), frequent mentor-mentee meetings, and interactions with the broader scientific

Amelogenin phosphorylation is critical to the development of enamel. Individuals with amelogenesis imperfecta
(AI) exhibit enamel hypoplasia and overall structure and integrity of enamel is weakened. AMELX-KI mice lack
amelogenin phosphorylation and exhibit features of AI. Studies are still needed to understand the mechanisms
of amelogenin phosphorylation. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and RT-qPCR we found acid
phosphatase 4 (ACP4) to be significantly upregulated in the enamel organ of AMELX-KI mice. Published
articles have shown that ACP4 is a transmembrane protein found in secretory ameloblasts, particularly in the
Tomes’s processes. ACP4 was found in the Tomes’s processes of wildtype (WT) mice with higher expression
in KI secretory ameloblasts using immunohistochemistry staining. Using western blot analysis, we found ACP4
expression in the enamel organ layer in both WT and AMELX-KI mice. Publications suggest that ACP4 is
upregulated in a local acidic environment with higher expression in the secretory stages than in maturation
stages. This supports our findings that higher ACP4 expression found in AMELX-KI mice may correlate to their
lower pH levels in secretory stages. These findings have led to the hypotheses that interactions of
phosphorylated amelogenin with ACP4 are essential for proper enamel formation and that changes in pH can
affect these interactions. We will investigate protein-protein interactions between phosphorylated amelogenin
and ACP4 using in situ proximity ligation (isPLA) and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays. We will assess
distribution and quantities of ACP4 and its relationships with amelogenin in WT and KI secretory ameloblasts
using high resolution confocal microscopy. Finally, we will determine the effects of pH on phosphorylated
AMELX and ACP4 interactions using isPLA on ameloblast lineage cells transfected with ACP4 and use acid
phosphatase assay to determine activity. These studies will support the role of ACP4 expression in enamel
development and will provide in-depth knowledge towards mechanisms of amelogenin phosphorylation."

 Posttranscriptional modifications of bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes are linked to many human
diseases, but the precise role of most modifications remains undefined. Dimethylation of a universally
conserved adenine, A2058, in bacterial rRNA causes cross-resistance against all three critically
important families of antibiotics (macrolides, lincosamides, and streptogramins (MLS)). A2058
dimethylation occludes MLS from the ribosome, thereby allowing normal protein biosynthesis and
bacterial growth. The thirty-five classes of Erm methyltransferases responsible for A2058 dimethylation
are invariantly encoded by a two-gene operon preceded by a short ribosome stalling leader sequence.
These short stalling peptides considerably vary in size and sequence composition. The functional and
evolutionary connections between the stalling sequence and its cognate erm gene are poorly understood.
A previous `ribosome stalling' model suggests that macrolide-mediated translational stalling of the leader
sequence is required for the upregulation of downstream co-transcribed erm, but clinical surveillance and
our data indicate the existence of an alternative pathway. Our unpublished data further show that
collateral sensitivity to unrelated antibiotics, reduction in virulence gene expression, accumulation of
inactive ribosomes, and loss of in vivo fitness are all part of the trade-offs associated with the A2058
dimethylated ribosome. The exact mechanistic links between these traits are unknown. There is also an
unmet need to understand the mechanism by which Erm recognizes and acts on 23S rRNA. This
proposal will use a multi-pronged approach consisting of high-precision next-generation sequencing,
bacterial genetics, proteomics, comparative genomics, biochemistry and structural biology to address
three central questions: What are the underlying mechanisms of the trade-offs conferred by the A2058
dimethylated ribosome? How does the erm operon evolve, and how is the expression of erm regulated?
How does Erm find its target substrate RNA? The erm operons are widespread among nosocomial
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, addressing these questions will offer significant mechanistic
insight into new antimicrobial strategies tailored to disrupt these biochemical interactions and regulatory
pathways."

Individuals with intractable focal epilepsy and normal structural imaging (non-lesional focal epilepsy, NLFE) pose
treatment challenges. When no lesion is detected, localization of the seizure focus is difficult and surgical
success elusive. It is unknown how focal seizures arise in cortex with radiographically normal structure, and
whether pathology below the resolution of standard 3T MRI is a common culprit. We recently demonstrated that
somatic mutations in SLC35A2, which encodes a UDP galactose transporter, account for some NLFE. Some
radiographically normal cases exhibited FCD1a, demonstrating that somatic SLC35A2 mutations can account
for seizure onset in structurally normal and abnormal cortex, and identifying SLC35A2 as the first gene underlying
FCD1a and NLFE. We recently found somatic brain variants in PLXNB1 and BRAF in cases with normal imaging
but FCD2a on pathology. PLXNB1 may represent the first non-mTOR gene in FCD2. We thereby demonstrated
brain somatic variants can result in radiographic NLFE, some with abnormal pathology. As gene identification
illuminates the biology of focal epilepsy and informs therapy, discoveries can have major clinical implications.
We will further explore the somatic genetics of radiographic NLFE, including 1) replication of gene discoveries
in new cases, additional gene identification, and deeper sequencing for lower-frequency pathogenic alleles; 2)
clarifying phenotypes associated with specific somatic mutations, 3) development of imaging to detect subtle
abnormalities; 4) correlation of variant allele frequency (VAF) with pathology and EEG from specific biopsy sites
within resected brain and 5) association of regional pathology with EEG when mutations are absent.
In Aim 1 We will define the somatic genetic landscape of NLFE. In surgical epilepsy samples, we will conduct
ultra-high-depth whole exome sequencing of brain resected from the seizure focus from individuals with NLFE
to identify additional somatic mutations in SLC35A2, PLXNB1, BRAF, and other genes. In Aim 2 we will define
genotype-phenotype correlations in NLFE. We will determine phenotypes associated with somatic mutations
in specific genes in a cohort of individuals with NLFE, focusing on age at onset of epilepsy, abnormalities on
presurgical advanced 3T and 7T MRI with computational post-processing, and histopathologic analysis of
resected tissue. In Aim 3 we will define the regional EEG, pathological, and allelic burden of pathogenic
somatic variants within NLFE. During epilepsy surgery, we will perform 4-6 biopsies from tissue destined for
resection using an MRI-localized, electrophysiology-guided procedure. We will characterize pathology and EEG
firing pattern in each biopsy, distinguishing the EEG-designated seizure focus (core) vs. surround (penumbra).
We will quantitatively genotype each biopsy for variants deemed pathogenic to establish per-biopsy VAF and
when mutations are absent, correlate EEG pattern with histopathologic abnormalities. This will define
associations among VAF, EEG firing pattern, and pathology."
10892903,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
One of the least-investigated areas of research in brain pathologies is glycosylation, which is a critical regulator of
cell surface protein structure and function. ST6Gal1 is the primary enzyme that a2,6 sialylates N-glycosylated
proteins destined for the plasma membrane or secretion. Sialylation adds a negatively-charged, sialic acid to the
end of an oligosaccharide chain of a glycoprotein. Sialylation of distinct protein subsets has important effects on
conformation, clustering and cell surface retention as has been found for some integrins, growth factor receptors
and death receptors. Through this mechanism, ST6Gal1 regulates phenotypes including survival, invasion, and
stem cell maintenance. However, there are critical gaps in our understanding of how ST6Gal1-mediated sialylation
impacts brain tumor cell growth or differentiation state, and there are no studies identifying a2,6 sialylated proteins
or ST6Gal1 regulated pathways in brain tumors. Our preliminary data demonstrate a novel, pro-tumorigenic role for
a2,6 sialylation and ST6Gal1 in the deadly brain tumor glioblastoma. We seek to determine whether ST6Gal1-
mediated a2,6 sialylation promotes brain tumor initiating cell maintenance and metabolic plasticity. In the short-
term, our results will lead to an improved understanding of how ST6Gal1-mediated a2,6 sialylation regulates protein
expression and function to impact brain tumor propagation. In the long-term, these studies may offer the potential
for new mechanisms of therapeutic intervention for the treatment of brain tumors as ST6Gal1 inhibitors are under
development."

This collaborative project seeks to gain a deep mechanistic understanding of the Mediator kinases (CDK8 and
CDK19) and their roles in driving hyper-active interferon (IFN) signaling in Down syndrome (DS). A chronic
inflammatory state underlies the DS condition and contributes to its co-morbidities; consequently, a means to
dampen IFN activation could have broad therapeutic benefits. CDK8 and CDK19 each represent druggable
targets and, as potent activators of IFN responses, inhibition of their function could effectively antagonize
runaway IFN signaling in DS. CDK8 and its paralog, CDK19, are considered “Mediator kinases” because of their
stable, but reversible, association with the 26-subunit Mediator complex. Mediator is a global regulator of RNA
polymerase II (pol II) activity, which transcribes all protein-coding and many non-coding RNAs in the human
genome. CDK8 and CDK19 have each been shown to help drive transcriptional responses to IFN cytokines,
which are universal regulators of inflammation and immune function. Here, we seek to define their essential—
yet poorly understood—cellular and mechanistic roles in the context of DS (Biobank-matched D21 and T21 cells)
and IFN signaling. We will combine sophisticated cell-based methods (e.g. transcriptomics and metabolomics)
with detailed, cutting-edge biochemical approaches to allow rigorous and reliable assessment of the mechanisms
by which CDK8 vs. CDK19 control IFN responses in DS individuals. In Aim 1, we will probe the role of Mediator
kinase activity, whereas in Aim 2 we will focus on the CDK19 protein, which serves key structural/scaffolding
roles to enable robust transcriptional responses upon IFN stimulation. Transcriptomic (RNA-seq and PRO-seq)
and metabolomics approaches will be applied in Aims 1 and 2, to assess T21-specific signatures (including
potential splicing defects) and to identify how CDK8 and/or CDK19 impact cellular responses to IFN. These
experiments will also uncover how sequence-specific, DNA-binding transcription factors (TFs) are differentially
mobilized in T21 vs. D21 cells, including during IFN stimulation. As part of this, we will establish how CDK8 and
CDK19 independently control TF activation or repression, through kinase-dependent or -independent
mechanisms. In Aim 3, we will perform detailed in vitro studies to define the molecular mechanisms by which
Mediator kinases regulate pol II transcription initiation, promoter-proximal pausing, or elongation. Mechanistic
findings will then be probed further in cells, to better characterize their significance in DS and related IFN
signaling cascades. Collectively, these experiments (Aims 1-3) may help establish Mediator kinases (CDK8 &
CDK19) as viable therapeutic targets to antagonize hyper-active IFN signaling in DS. Moreover, the balance of
targeted/mechanistic studies with discovery-based approaches may yield new and unanticipated therapeutic
strategies with relevance for DS and its associated co-morbidities, which also affect the general population."

for Cancer Research (PCCR), primarily through support of faculty recruitment and through support of the
Computational & Medicinal Chemistry Shared Resource (CMC-SR). Through the direction of PCCR leadership,
developmental and additional funds and space were used to directly support recruitment of 10 new faculty (6

 Aim 1: Recruit faculty members into the PCCR, with a major emphasis on faculty in computational
 genomics and bioinformatics, and cancer biology. An emphasis will be placed on recruiting senior
 investigators in the area of computational biology or cancer therapeutics, as well as in the area of
 analytical chemistry and biophysics, with a cancer focus."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcoholism is a tremendous health and financial burden on our society. A growing literature indicates that the extended amygdala plays a key role in stress-reward interactions that may mediate key behavioral responses to chronic alcohol exposure. We demonstrated that chronic intermittent alcohol exposure up regulates CRF receptor dependent augmentation of glutamate release, as well as postsynaptic NMDA receptor function at extended amygdala glutamate synapses. We propose here to test a ""two-hit"" model, whereby affective disruptions produced by chronic alcohol exposure and withdrawal depend upon the coordinated pre- and postsynaptic regulation of extended amygdala glutamate synapses. We propose a series of experiments to map out mechanisms by which CRF receptor signaling regulates glutamate synapses, and to explore the alterations in NMDA receptor function that occur with alcohol exposure and withdrawal. We further propose to explore the impact of disruption of these processes on alcohol-abstinence induced depressive behaviors."

Gene delivery via the oral route offers a promising strategy for improving gene-based therapy outcomes. The
non-invasive nature of oral delivery allows for ease of dosing, which can promote convenience and a high rate
of patient compliance. Moreover, oral administration facilitates both local and systemic production of therapeutic
genes. For local gene therapy for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases (e.g., metabolic and nutritional defects,
inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancers), the oral route allows direct access to the affected tissue.
However, the highly vascularized nature of the GI tract also makes oral gene delivery a viable option for
administering systemic therapies, where transfection within intestinal cells results in production of protein that is
delivered into the bloodstream and circulated systemically. In addition, oral DNA delivery can be used as a
vaccination strategy, providing for both systemic and mucosal immunity. Although there is potential for oral gene
delivery to treat and vaccinate against a wide variety of diseases, the efficacy of nonviral delivery methods is
limited by carrier materials that cannot prevent DNA payload degradation in the harsh conditions of the GI tract
nor promote uptake by intestinal cells, which results in low transgene expression. To overcome challenges
associated with oral gene delivery, we propose to develop a novel, biological-based delivery platform by loading
outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) derived from commensal gut bacteria with plasmid DNA to create DNA-loaded
OMV nanocarriers (DNA-OMV NCs). OMVs are produced via budding of bacterial outer membranes and function
as a natural communication system for bacteria. OMVs protect and deliver secreted material, allowing bacteria
to influence their environment. Numerous commensal (non-pathogenic) bacteria residing in the human GI tract
secrete OMVs, and preliminary results from our team show that OMVs from commensal Escherichia coli (E. coli)
isolated from the human GI tract can be internalized by both intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages, elicit a
range of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine responses from macrophages, and survive gastric transit when orally
administered to mice. Moreover, we have shown in preliminary work that we can load OMVs (from a lab strain
of E. coli) with pDNA to create DNA-OMV NCs. We hypothesize that a DNA-OMV NC delivery platform will
protect loaded DNA through GI transit, facilitate uptake by epithelial cells and macrophages, elicit tunable
cytokine responses, and enable effective in vivo transfection. We will pursue two aims: 1) Screen OMVs isolated
from gut commensal E. coli strains for internalization, cytotoxicity, and immune modulation to develop a library
of OMVs for use as NCs for oral gene delivery; 2) Develop methods to produce DNA-OMV NCs and evaluate
their abilities to protect DNA cargo, modulate immune profiles, and mediate transfection. Specific to the Awards
Supporting Cutting-Edge Technologies for Translational Science (ASCETTS) funding opportunity, we expect to
develop a tunable, bio-inspired platform for oral gene delivery that leverages natural host-bacterial interactions
and is suitable for broad utilization in therapeutic applications, ranging from gene therapy to vaccination."

For the nearly 37 million people living with HIV (PLWH), functional cure, or antiretroviral (ART)-free remission,
is rapidly becoming an attainable target. While extensive research on the mechanisms underlying immune
dysfunction and viral persistence present promising opportunities for novel therapeutic modalities, a modest
understanding of how pharmacology (pharmacokinetics, PK, and pharmacodynamics, PD) contributes to clinical
variability in reservoir reduction and immune modulation has frequently resulted in marginal clinical trial
outcomes. This career development award will provide Dr. Amelia Deitchman, a pharmacist-researcher with a
PhD in PK/PD, with the essential mentorship and training to develop her independent research program to bridge
this gap in translational HIV cure research by harnessing heterogeneity in drug response and mismatched clinical
translation to further the HIV cure agenda and develop robust and targeted treatments for all patients.
 Numerous novel therapeutic approaches are being investigated as components of durable HIV cure,
including immunosuppressants targeting chronic immune dysfunction and inflammation associated with HIV
persistence, as well as broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that clear virus and HIV-infected cells. This
research investigates the use of sirolimus alone and with Shingrix (recombinant varicella zoster virus, rVZV
vaccine) in two clinical trials, and two bNAbs in a combination clinical trial. Using data and samples from these
trials in PLWH on virally suppressive ART, and state-of-the-art viral, immune, and pharmacological approaches,
the candidate will 1) establish exposure-response of sirolimus and rVZV vaccine on HIV reservoirs, immune
function and safety, 2) define predictors of sirolimus and rVZV vaccine response variability attributable to PK and
PD heterogeneity, and 3) determine if systemic bNAb levels can predict time to viral rebound after ART
interruption in the context of other curative strategies. We hypothesize that changes in outcomes (reservoir size,
immune phenotype, inflammatory markers, and for bNAbs, reservoir size and time to viral rebound post ART
interruption) are directly related to drug exposure. For sirolimus, these PK/PD relationships may be entirely
distinct from those used for other therapeutic indications. Furthermore, we hypothesize that drug-drug
interactions, and differences in immune genetics, and patient demographic, clinical, and disease-related traits
account for observed variability in clinical drug exposure and response.
 Ultimately, this award will be the cornerstone for a career in HIV cure clinical pharmacology research
through hands-on and didactic training in HIV pharmacology, immunology and virology, clinical trials, and grant
writing by an expert team of mentors. These mentors will foster the candidate's development of an independent
academic research career answering clinical pharmacology questions in the setting of HIV cure. The research
performed as part of this award will support a future R01 submission investigating PK/PD relationships to
accelerate drug development, identify novel therapeutic approaches, and deliver precision care to patients."

Inherited retinal diseases (IRD) are a major cause of early-onset blindness, profoundly affecting millions of
patients. Given the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of IRD, targeted gene therapy is emerging as the main
effective approach for treating the disease with many clinical trials currently underway. To maximize the benefit
of these emerging therapies to patients, molecular diagnosis is the first critical step.
In coordinating with the ClinGen Ocular Clinical Domain Working Group committee, we propose to establish a
new variant curation expert panel (VCEP) that will focus on developing disease and gene specifications and
curating expert assessment of variants in the seven X-linked IRD genes, including RPGR, CHM, RS1, RP2,
OFD1, NDP, and CACNA1F. Collectively, mutations in these genes account for 15% of IRD patients. We have
identified a distinguished panel of scientists across the world who will commit to this effort with diverse expertise:
practicing ophthalmologic physicians, clinical diagnostic laboratory directors, and world-leading researchers
studying the function of the X-linked IRD genes in the clinical and research domains. These experts bring
complementary knowledge and resources to this effort including functional laboratory assays to assess the
impact of patient variants, clinical trials for gene-based treatments, and collections of patient samples with
sequenced variants and a detailed clinical history.
Together with dedicated bioinformatics, curatorial, and administrative support, the X-linked IRD Variant Curation
Panel proposed will deploy the FDA approved ClinGen infrastructure tools and processes in combination with
the supportive resources we propose to collect, organize and provide to the panel to develop rule specifications
for X-linked IRD gene curation. With our panel and team of coordinated curation volunteers, we will curate and
expertly assess the variants in these genes. The products of this effort will be two-fold. First, specifications that
can be applied to assess new variants in the seven genes and can be adapted for other X-linked IRD genes.
And second, curated variants in the seven X-linked IRD genes with three-star (expert panel assessed) ratings in
the ClinVar databasethat will improve the assessment of de novo patient variants and enable treatments with
gene-based therapies."

Host-microbe interactions profoundly impact cancer. This is exemplified by well-documented infections that
promote cancer, and the ability to prevent these cancers through vaccination or pathogen avoidance. However,
humans are densely colonized with trillions of normally beneficial microbes, termed the microbiota, which also
have the ability to promote cancers through the induction of inflammation or genomic instability. Further, recent
seminal studies demonstrated that intestinal microbiota are also required for anti-tumor immunity in the context
of therapeutic interventions, such as checkpoint blockade. Despite these advances, the specific pathways by
which microbiota shape pro- versus anti-tumor immunity remain poorly defined, and the potential relevance of
these findings to specific types of cancer are unknown. The fundamental focus of this proposal is to
mechanistically define a novel pathway that controls host-microbiota interactions to protect from
tumor progression and promote the efficacy of immunotherapies in colorectal cancer (CRC). In recently
published data (Goc et al., Cell, 2021), we have determined that group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) are
fundamentally altered in CRC and contribute to tumor progression and immunotherapy responsiveness by
coordinating host-microbiota interactions. These data provoke a fundamental hypothesis that intestinal ILC3s
are protective in cancer, but become inherently disrupted in CRC, subsequently driving dysfunctional adaptive
immunity and alterations to the microbiota that support tumor progression and immunotherapy resistance. We
will mechanistically test this hypothesis by asking the following specific questions: (1) What drives dysfunction
of ILC3s in CRC?; (2) What are the microbial and host pathways by which ILC3s protect from tumor
progression?; And (3) What are the microbial and host pathways by which ILC3s protect from immunotherapy
resistance? Finally, we will directly test a number of interventional strategies that target the microbiota to limit
tumor progression and break resistance to cancer checkpoint inhibitors. Results from these experiments will
pave the way for a greater understanding of host-microbiota interactions in cancer, and could provoke novel
preventative, therapeutic or curative strategies in cancer by modulating host-microbiota interactions."

Preeclampsia (PE) remains a significant clinical and public health burden affecting 3-5% of all pregnancies
worldwide, and is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no
effective therapy for PE other than delivery. While its etiology is not fully clear, compelling evidence demonstrates
that placental hypoxia/ischemia is a key initiating event that triggers the release of anti-angiogenic factors into
maternal circulation, such as soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFLT-1) and endoglin (sEng). These placental
factors cause systemic vascular dysfunction and ultimately the clinical symptoms of PE. Furthermore, PE is a
well-established hypercoagulable state, associated with placental thrombosis as well as increased risk for
thrombotic events during and after pregnancy. Hypercoagulability could contribute to exaggerated placental
disease and systemic vascular dysfunction in PE. Although increased expression of procoagulant factors and
platelet activity along with decreased anticoagulant activity have been implicated in this prothrombotic tendency,
the precise mechanism underlying hypercoagulability in PE remain to be fully elucidated. Extracellular
mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a damage-associated molecular pattern released from hypoxic and/or injured
tissue, is known to directly activate platelets, triggering reactive oxygen species overproduction by their
mitochondria, which in turn leads to apoptosis and release of additional mtDNA from platelets. This this feed-
forward cycle results in escalating platelet activation and hypercoagulability that culminate in thrombosis remote
from the initial site of mtDNA release. While placental and maternal mtDNA levels are elevated in PE patients,
its role as a mediator of hypercoagulability in the placental and systemic circulation during PE has never been
investigated. Moreover, circulating mtDNA can be directly depleted by DNase I treatment, which has been shown
to inhibit in vitro and in vivo platelet activation and aggregation. However, DNase I has never been explored as
a therapy for PE. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to examine whether mtDNA acts as a driver of
hypercoagulability in the placental and systemic circulation during PE, and whether this effect can be mitigated
by DNase I treatment using the rat sFLT-1/sEng model of severe PE. Similar to severe preeclamptic patients,
the chronic sFLT-1 and sEng infusion into pregnant rats promotes placental pathology, hypertension, reduced
platelet counts, and end-organ damage. Parallel ex vivo studies will determine whether sFLT-1, sEng, and
placental mtDNA cause platelet activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and aggregation. Thus, by applying
integrative novel approaches, clinically relevant models of PE, and advanced methodologies, we will test the
central hypothesis that mtDNA mediates platelet activation, mitochondrial dysfunction, hypercoagulability, and
vascular dysfunction in severe PE, and that this pathway is ameliorated by DNase I treatment. Findings
generated by these groundbreaking studies could revolutionize the standard of care for PE by identifying a novel
class of mtDNA-targeted antithrombotic agents with potential wide applicability to other hypercoagulable states."

Most adults in the United States consume alcohol at some point in their lifetimes. Excessive drinking may elicit
detrimental consequences, such as liver cirrhosis, increased cancer risk, motor vehicle accidents, and legal
problems, and increase the risk for the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Progression to problematic
drinking varies depending upon individual differences in responses to alcohol, for which dietary differences may
be a contributing factor. Preliminary data from our laboratory suggest a pharmacokinetic interaction of ketones
with alcohol, such that ketones paired with alcohol decreased the intoxicating and pleasurable effects of alcohol
in human participants. Ketones (-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), acetoacetate, and acetone) are produced
endogenously during periods of glucose restriction or administered exogenously with nutritional ketone
supplements (KS). In comparison to glucose, ketone metabolism for energy production spares nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) utilization. NAD+ serves as a cofactor for key alcohol metabolism enzymes, namely
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), and increased NAD+ availability following ketosis may have implications for
accelerating alcohol breakdown. Here, we propose to examine the effects of KS on alcohol sensitivity and
tolerance in human participants. We propose the following specific aims: Aim 1: to characterize the
pharmacokinetic effects of exogenous ketones on alcohol sensitivity, alcohol tolerance, and cognitive functioning
(R21 Phase), and Aim 2: to characterize the effect of exogenous ketones and alcohol on brain NAD+
concentrations (R33 phase). We propose to utilize a cross-over designs for the R21 and R33 studies, in which
socially drinking participants will undergo alcohol challenge tests on separate study visits following ingestion of
KS or a taste-matched placebo. In the R21 phase, we hypothesize that KS vs. placebo will lead to a faster
breakdown of alcohol and reduced sensitivity to alcohol. We will compare effects of a low (10g) and high (25g)
of KS on a moderate dose of alcohol targeting breath alcohol levels of 0.08% and high dose. We will pilot proton
magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRS) methodology at high-field strength for the quantification
of brain NAD+ concentrations. The milestones for the transition to R33 are the detection of significant effects of
KS vs placebo on breath and blood alcohol levels, the reliable quantification of the 1H-MRS NAD+ peak at 9.3
ppm, and the tolerability of KS and alcohol in the high-field strength 7T scanner environment. In the R33 phase,
we will perform 1H-MRS and functional imaging, and we hypothesize that NAD+ levels will increase with KS vs
placebo, and brain NAD+ levels will significantly decrease with alcohol intake. The present study will test the
degree to which exogenous ketones affect alcohol sensitivity and tolerance and prevent neurocognitive
impairments after drinking alcohol. The study outcomes may identify new approaches for accelerating alcohol
clearance and preventing neurocognitive impairments after alcohol intoxication, or novel therapeutics for AUD."

pigmentosa. The overall goal of the proposed research to gain insight into the pathophysiological
mechanisms of CACNA2D4-associated IRDs by illuminating the structure/function relationships
of a2d-4. Our central hypothesis is that a2d-4 utilizes distinct molecular determinants to promote
the modulation and presynaptic clustering of Cav1.4 in photoreceptors. We will test this
hypothesis using state-of-the-art techniques in electrophysiology, optical imaging, and in vivo
testing of the structure/function relationships of a2d-4 in mouse photoreceptors. The expected

Dysfunction of multiple metabolic cells contribute to the pathophysiology of the two major pathological states,
obesity and type 2 diabetes, which have a huge economic burden worldwide. Identifying the etiology of the two
linked pathological states continues to be an area of intense research with a focus on identifying new
regulatory pathways within tissues that impact metabolic function and cause dysfunction. There is a continuing
need to develop a systems biology framework that integrates real patient data to inform signaling within cells
and crosstalk between tissues to enable identification of potential new targets for effective therapy.
An emerging area of significance in human obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is epigenetics that has primarily
focused on DNA methylation and protein modifications. A missing link in this epigenetic framework is the
modification(s) in mRNA and chromatin-associated regulatory RNAs (carRNAs) that have been shown to
contribute to gene expression regulation at both posttranscriptional and transcriptional levels. Current data
indicate altered expression of various regulators in metabolic tissues (e.g. human islets, adipose, liver, skeletal
muscle) in obesity and type 2 diabetes; however, the significance of these alterations and the impact on mRNA
and protein expression in real human tissues is virtually unknown. Consistent with the requirement of a RC2
mechanism, we will develop a comprehensive database of functionally important RNA modifications in selected
human tissues. We seek to interrogate alterations in the modifications of RNA, specifically, the two most
important modifications, N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) and pseudouridylation in key metabolic cell types that
are relevant for type 2 diabetes and obesity. In this proposal, we will: 1) Interrogate the mRNA and chromatin-
associated RNA modifications, m6A-sequencing and BID-ψ-sequencing at base resolution with stoichiometry
information in key metabolic tissues from patients with T2D and obesity; 2) Perform m6A and ψ QTL studies in
tissues from patients with T2D and obesity and validate the functional relevance of key mRNA and chromatin-
associated RNA modifications in in vitro studies; 3) Interrogate comprehensive transcription and enhancer
activity using ATAC-seq in the metabolic tissues from patients with T2D and obesity; 4) Perform eQTL studies
using transcriptional activity data obtained from KAS-seq and RNA modification results on carRNAs in T2D and
obese tissues, and perform validation in in vitro studies; and 5) Develop a large-scale resource database on
mRNA and chromatin-associated RNA modifications and transcription activity with correlation of common
genomic features for the larger scientific community. The success of this project will lay ground for the broader
community to take advantage of these data and our analyses for future basic and translational investigations
and therapeutic developments."

One aspect of the mission of the NICHD is to support basic research in human development.
The Language Development and Multilingualism program supports research into the
mechanisms underlying typical language development and language related processes. The
research proposed here will ask how children learn that a word has more than one meaning.
Homophones are common in speech to and by children and yet most theories of word learning
do not include an account of how they are learned. The proposed studies will use a cross-
situational word learning task, where children learn new words for new objects without being
specifically taught them, to directly test whether a range of previously posited information
sources support children’s learning of homophones. These studies in particular ask how
children learn about multiple meanings for words when they are not directly taught that a word
has more than one meaning. Because this is how children learn most words, these studies will
better represent real-world learning than other studies have. These studies support the mission
of the NICHD by providing insight into processes of typical child development, specifically the
learning of words. Understanding how children learn about homophones in speech may also
have important implications for early literacy, as the need to map multiple meanings on to a
single form also arises in the domain of reading."

The opioid crisis has enormous consequences on the health and well-being of Veterans and their communities.
Opioid addiction is propelled by opioid-induced changes in brain circuits that control behavioral responses to
rewarding and aversive stimuli, and neuromodulatory therapies that reverse opioid-induced changes in these
circuits are sorely needed. The mesolimbic dopamine (DA) projection from ventral tegmental area (VTA) to
nucleus accumbens (NAc) is often described as the brain's reward circuit, and indeed much evidence points to
a central role for this projection in processes underlying behavioral reinforcement. But what controls activity of
VTA DA neurons? And where does NAc send signals that have been modulated by released DA? An answer
to both those questions is: the ventral pallidum (VP). Yet much less is known about VP. For example, it has
only recently become appreciated that VP contains heterogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory
projection neurons that regulate approach and avoidance behaviors in opposite directions. Further, Mu-opioid
receptors (MOR) mediate both the analgesic and addictive effects of abused opioid drugs, the VP is a MOR
hotspot, and MOR activation in VP can profoundly change behavior. Thus, we know that VP can potently
modulate approach and avoidance behaviors and that opioids can potently modulate VP. Yet we know
remarkably little about how VP cell types are connected to NAc and VTA cell types, how VP cell types and
synapses are modulated by MORs, or how opioid-induced plasticity in VP cell types and synapses modify
approach and avoidance behaviors that are perturbed in opioid dependence and withdrawal. This proposal will
systematically attack this knowledge gap using mouse genetics and both ex vivo and in vivo anatomical,
physiological and behavioral approaches to: i) characterize the cell types and synapses in VP that express
MOR, ii) define how VP cell types are connected to afferent NAc and efferent VTA cell types, iii) identify how
MOR activation modulates the function of these cell types and synapses, and iv) describe how their function is
perturbed in opioid dependence and withdrawal."
10872602,"Project Summary
The cardiac cycle starts with the production of an action potential (AP) by pacemaking cells in the sino-atrial
node (SAN), initiating the propagation of electrical signals that trigger atrial and ventricular contraction. We have
discovered that the organization of the SAN microvasculature varies regionally, a variability that serves to match
blood supply to local myocyte excitability. These observations have led us to propose a new model for the
metabolic control of excitability and cardiac pacemaking activity. In our model, the highly vascularized superior
SAN is populated by myocytes capable of undergoing periodic voltage oscillations, some of which do not reach
AP threshold. Despite these failures, the many oscillations that do reach threshold can still enable superior SAN
myocytes to exhibit a high intrinsic AP firing rate, even if their periodicity is not optimal. By contrast, inferior SAN
myocytes are sparsely vascularized and have a low AP firing rate. Importantly, inferior SAN cells produce
stochastic subthreshold electrical signals. We propose that, when these subthreshold events coincide with an
electrical signal from the more periodic voltage oscillator in the superior SAN, the subthreshold signal events
integrate and, at their peaks, increase the probability of the superior SAN crossing the threshold and generating
an AP. Accordingly, inferior SAN cells that produce these random electrical signals act through a stochastic
resonance mechanism to increase the strength and periodicity of superior SAN activation. A key feature of our
proposed conceptual model is that inferior SAN myocytes do not fire APs at high frequencies for prolonged
periods of time because they do not generate ATP at the rate necessary to sustain a high level of electrical
activity. Consistent with this, we discovered that, contrary to the prevailing view, APs induce rapid fluctuations in
ATP levels in SAN myocytes, indicating that electrical activity has an impact on the energetic reserve of
myocytes. Thus, a combination of regional variations in vascular supply and ATP dynamics help deterimine
superior and inferior SAN excitability. We will test the hypothesis that changes in vascular supply to the node
impact myocyte ATP dynamics, excitability and, hence, pacemaking activity during the development of heart
failure. A central premise of this project is that vascular supply, pacemaking activity, and ATP dynamics in SAN
myocytes are inextricably intertwined. The project will test the physiological and pathological implications of our
conceptual model with three specific aims. Specific aim 1 tests the hypothesis that stochastic resonance
increases the periodicity of SAN myocytes. Specific aim 2 tests the hypothesis that ATP consumption fluctuates
in SAN myocytes in a beat-to-beat fashion and varies regionally. Specific aim 3 tests the hypothesis that
changes in vascular supply to the SAN, as well as myocyte ATP dynamics and stochastic resonance, contribute
to alterations in pacemaking activity during the development of heart failure. The proposed studies offer an
alternative to the predominant entrainment pacemaking paradigm and have the potential to radically transform
our understanding of how the excitability of SAN myocytes is regulated in health and disease."
10872674,"The leading cause of death in women in the United States is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Progress in reducing
CVD in women has lagged behind progress in men. Obesity is a prevalent risk factor for CVD, and becomes
more prevalent in women following menopause. We have shown that XX chromosome complement promotes
increased adiposity in female compared to male mice, and this effect is amplified when gonadal hormone levels
are diminished, as occurs after menopause in humans. We have identified the Kdm5c gene on the X
chromosome as a key contributor to XX effects on adiposity. Kdm5c is expressed at higher levels in female
compared to male humans and mice due to escape from X chromosome inactivation. Kdm5c encodes a histone
demethylase that modulates chromatin structure and gene expression. Reducing Kdm5c gene dosage in XX
females to that normally present in XY males reduces adipose tissue mass and alters histone marks in
preadipocytes to favor induction of beige adipocytes and enhanced whole body energy expenditure. We
hypothesize that sex differences in histone modifications throughout the genome, which likely change in
hypogonadal states such as menopause, influence sex differences in adipose tissue function. We will investigate
key questions regarding the role of Kdm5c gene dosage, and more generally, histone modifications and gene
regulation, as determinants of sex differences in adipose tissue. Aim 1: Is Kdm5c gene dosage a determinant
of weight/fat gain in hypogonadal states? We hypothesize that Kdm5c gene dosage is partially responsible
for the impact of X chromosome dosage on weight gain when gonadal hormone levels are diminished. We will
test the impact of Kdm5c gene dosage on weight gain, adiposity, and energy balance in female and male mice
with preadipocyte Kdm5c deficiency under normal and reduced hormone levels. Aim 2: What is the effect of
sex, gonadal hormones, and Kdm5c gene dosage on adipocyte histone and gene expression profiles at
the tissue and single-cell levels? We will map the histone landscape and corresponding gene expression
profile in adipose tissue to identify effects of sex, gonadal hormones, and Kdm5c gene dosage (A) at the tissue
level using CUT&RUN and RNA-seq, and (B) and the single-nucleus level using Paired-Tag to simultaneously
profile histone marks and gene expression in individual nuclei. Aim 3: How do sex and gonadal hormone
status impact the histone landscape in human adipocytes? There is a dearth of information regarding the
effect of sex on histone modifications in human adipose tissue, and whether changes in histone profile underlie
alterations in adipose tissue following menopause/andropause. We will map histone profiles in adipose tissue of
women vs. men, and in pre- vs. post-menopausal women. Our studies will shed light on how sex influences the
epigenetic regulation of adipose tissue gene expression, composition, and function through histone
modifications. This knowledge may inform therapeutic strategies to prevent excess adiposity and CVD risk in
both women and men, including adipose tissue accrual in response to diminished hormone levels in mid-life."

inhibitors, like many other novel therapies for metavivors, are highly fatiguing. Cognitive behavioral therapy for
fatigue (CBTF) is an evidence-based intervention that has produced large and durable improvements in fatigue
among patients with curable cancers but has not been tested specifically for metavivors. In this clinical trial
planning project, we will adapt CBTF for women with MBC treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and evaluate the
feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention (“Energize-MBC”). The central
hypothesis is that Energize-MBC will be feasible, acceptable, and will provide preliminary indications of reduced
fatigue (primary outcome) and improved functioning (secondary outcome). Our specific aims are to: 1) adapt
CBTF to the needs of women with MBC treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (i.e., Energize-MBC); 2) refine and
finalize a web-based platform to deliver Energize-MBC via telemedicine; and 3) test the feasibility, acceptability,
and preliminary efficacy of Energize-MBC via a pilot RCT. To achieve these aims, we will solicit patient (n=20)
and provider (n=10) feedback via semi-structured interviews to adapt the CBTF intervention for women with
MBC, conduct usability testing with MBC patients (n=10) to refine the Energize-MBC web-based platform, and
then pilot test the 16-week telemedicine Energize-MBC intervention with MBC patients (n=60). Participants in
the pilot RCT will complete baseline questionnaires at enrollment and will be randomized 2:1 to the Energize-
MBC intervention or usual care (waitlist) control. Participants will wear ActiGraph GT9X activity trackers at
baseline and follow-up to assess objective sleep and physical activity. The Energize-MBC intervention content
will be tailored for individual participants based on responses to their baseline questionnaires, with selected
intervention modules completed by patients online via the Energize-MBC web-based platform. Interventionists
will maintain accountability by checking in weekly via text or email, as well as a maximum of two telephone or
video consultations. All participants will be asked to complete self-report questionnaires immediately post-
intervention or at a corresponding time for controls (i.e., 16 weeks post-baseline). A priori benchmarks will be
used to define intervention feasibility and acceptability. These data will be used as the basis for a future, full-
scale, multisite Phase II trial of Energize-MBC. This rigorous and impactful line of research aligns with NCI’s
priority focus on well-planned clinical trials aimed at improving management of treatment-related symptoms,
supportive care, and the long-term outcomes of cancer survivors."
10874372,"The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic and risk is especially high in veterans. Current
therapies consist mainly of alternative opioids, but their efficacy is limited. Thus, new treatments for pain and
addiction are in high demand. Improved knowledge of the mechanisms underlying opioid addiction and relapse
could help predict who might be a risk for addiction, and help to develop better therapies for those already
battling addiction and relapse. The reinforcing effects of opioids depend in large part on the nucleus
accumbens (NAc) and mu opioid receptors, which are expressed at glutamatergic synapses on medium spiny
neurons in the NAc. Opioids and other drugs of abuse can hijack these synapses and alter their number,
morphology, and glutamate receptor subunit composition. These changes are thought to produce abnormal
synaptic states that underlie addiction, withdrawal, craving, and relapse. We recently identified a novel
signaling mechanism that can influence the synaptic and behavioral effects of opiate drugs. This mechanism
involves protons released from presynaptic neurotransmitter-containing vesicles, activation of the post-synaptic
acid sensing ion channel, ASIC1A, and pH buffering at the synapse by carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4). Our
previous studies and pilot data suggest that ASIC1A plays a critical role in stabilizing glutamatergic synapses
in the NAc, and that loss of ASIC1A increases vulnerability to synaptic abnormalities induced by opioids, as
well as by cocaine. Interestingly, reducing pH buffering by disrupting CA4, increases the inward synaptic Na+
currents mediated by ASIC1A and appears to protect against the synaptic rearrangements thought to
contribute to addiction, craving, and relapse. Here we propose to extensively test the degree to which CA4 and
ASIC1A regulate opioid-induced synaptic abnormalities in the NAc, and influence opioid-reinforced behaviors.
Specific Aim 1 proposes to test the effects of opioids on synaptic physiology in mice lacking ASIC1A, CA4, or
both. Specific Aim 2 proposes to test effects of opioids in these mice in multiple behavioral paradigms
including opioid self-administration, withdrawal, and relapse-related behaviors. We hypothesize that
disrupting ASIC1A will alter synaptic and behavioral effects of opioids, disrupting CA4 will protect against these
effects, and that effects of CA4 disruption will depend on ASIC1A. Together the experiments in this proposal
will pave the way to a better understanding of the neurobiology underlying opioid addiction. Moreover, the
knowledge gained from these studies could suggest new ways to treat opioid addiction through non-opioidergic
pathways, for example by manipulating brain pH, ASICs, or carbonic anhydrase, for which several inhibitors
are already approved for human use."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an extremely aggressive malignancy with a five-year survival of
less than 5%. Genomic analyses of human samples suggest that PDAC can fundamentally be classified into
at least two major subtypes based on cancer cell autonomous properties: Classical and Basal-like. These two
subtypes have discrete cellular identities, as reflected by the differential expression of several lineage
specifiers, i.e. transcription factors that regulate differentiation state. The Classical subtype expresses high
levels of lineage specifiers pivotal for foregut endodermal determination (including HNF4A). The Basal-like
subtype expresses high levels of transcription factors promoting alternative identities, such as the
mesodermal lineage specifiers SIX4 and SIX1. Moreover, the Basal-like subtype confers poor prognosis and
responds less well to first-line chemotherapy compared to the Classical subtype. These correlations raise the
possibility that these lineage specifiers are not merely markers of PDAC subtype, but might regulate the
malignant potential of this disease. Our long-term goal is to identify the molecular regulators of PDAC

Chronic inflammation is a rising health issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Emerging evidence shows
that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota can lead to changes in the production of microbial-derived metabolites
(MDMs), which contribute to inflammation and the onset of inflammatory diseases, such as cancer, non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease, and inflammatory bowel syndrome. MDMs are absorbed into host circulation through the gut
and regulate immune responses. A key immune cell type at the interface of host-microbe interactions is
macrophages, which maintain tissue homeostasis, and are key contributors to chronic inflammation. To date,
few MDMs with well-studied cellular and molecular mechanisms describing the interplay between microbes and
our immune system are known. Using metabolomics data from a dietary intervention study that found distinct
immunological trajectories based on microbiota diversity, as well as data from a 176 gut microbiota strain library
we identified 18 human-immune associated MDMs. Here we aim to determine the regulatory role of MDMS on
the host immune system through a direct effect on macrophages. The impact of these MDMs on host molecular
pathways will be characterized using murine and human macrophage cells, NFκB reporter lines, CRISPR/Cas9
systems, GPCR reporter lines and in vivo using IBD murine models (Aim1). On the microbe end, I will determine
the metabolic pathways responsible to produce these immune-associated MDMs and generate knock-out or
knock-in bacterial strains. I will perform a series of highly-controlled mouse experiments to determine the specific
microbial components responsible for MDMs immune modulating effects (Aim2). My previous experience in
immune regulation and animal models make me well-equipped to analyze and perform these technical
experiments, and the expertise in microbial genetics and metabolomics facilities honed by my mentoring team
make Stanford University an ideal location to learn the skills I will need to perform these experiments. Completion
of these aims will increase the understanding of the microbiota-host interaction during times of homeostasis and
acute or chronic inflammation, which will pave the way for the development of precision therapeutic strategies to
reduce chronic inflammation and prevent acute disease."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the leading cause of stroke and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. AF is
due to both inherited and acquired factors. Genome-wide association studies have identified ERBB4 as a
candidate susceptibility gene for AF. Acquired conditions, such as aging, hypertension, and heart failure, are
known to cause electrical and structural changes in the left atrium (LA) in a process known as remodeling that
predisposes to AF. Our data show that left atrial ERBB4 levels are reduced in patients with AF. We have also
shown that ErbB4 is downregulated in heart disease mouse models. To study the role of ErbB4 in both atrial
electrical development and in acquired AF mechanisms, we have generated mouse models that have reduced
ErbB4 expression during development or acquired during adulthood. Both model systems show an important
dependency of correct ErbB4 gene dosage in the maintenance of normal atrial electrophysiology."

Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is a clinical manifestation of alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) that has a
very poor prognosis. Current treatments are ineffective and liver transplantation is the only long-term solution.
The liver has the unique ability to regenerate post-injury but in ALD/AH this process becomes compromised.
Mitochondria dysfunction is a hallmark of ALD and AH that can contribute to compromised liver regeneration.
Mitochondria enriched with cardiolipin maintain the energy requirements (e.g., ATP) necessary for hepatocyte
proliferation and liver regeneration. Preliminary data demonstrate that hepatic cardiolipin synthesis is
compromised in clinical AH and experimental AH. Cardiolipin is required to maintain mitochondrial bioenergetics
and undergoes oxidation and depletion in ALD compromising liver regeneration. However, treatment with
cardiolipin or elamipretide (drug that prevents cardiolipin oxidation) can restore hepatocyte mitochondrial function
and proliferation. The aim of this study is to determine if cardiolipin supplementation and preservation will
promote liver regeneration via maintenance of ATP synthesis and prevention of hepatocyte apoptosis alleviating
hepatic insufficiency in AH. This study uses pre-clinical animal models and human in vitro models of AH to
assess the treatment efficacy of cardiolipin supplementation and preservation. Aim 1 will determine if mice with
cardiolipin deficient hepatocytes have compromised liver regeneration due to loss of mitochondrial ATP
synthesis in a model of AH. Aim 2 will test whether treatment with cardiolipin and elamipretide will enhance
hepatic mitochondrial function, liver regeneration, and proliferating hepatocyte populations in an experimental
animal model of AH. Aim 3 will identify cardiolipin species in human AH liver and plasma and assess their effect
on hepatocyte proliferation and inflammatory responses in immune cells. The K99-phase (Aim 1) will provide
training in assaying liver regeneration and mitochondrial function, sc-RNASeq analysis, and use of a mouse
deficient in hepatocyte cardiolipin. This MOSAIC K99/R00 proposal will provide the training necessary (K99) to
build a solid research foundation providing a pathway to independence as an independent researcher in the field
of ALD and liver regeneration (R00). Findings from this study will identify a therapeutic strategy to treat AH via
enhanced liver regeneration which could replace the only long-term treatment alternative, liver transplantation."

Speed of processing training (SOPT), practicing to enhance the information processing efficiency while
performing various perceptual and cognitive tasks, is the widest examined type computerized cognitive training
among aging populations, including those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the efficacy of existing
SOPTs in maintaining or improving older adults' cognitive health greatly varies across individuals. Our
preliminary studies identified that the flexibility of autonomic nervous system (ANS) is associated with learning
and cognitive and neural gains in existing SOPT in older adults with MCI. Our premise is that adaptation capacity,
which is primarily reflected by ANS flexibility, is a key contributor to the neuroplasticity underlying broad and
sustained effects of cognitive interventions. In this proposed study, we will combine this ANS response profile
with the traditional learning index to develop a “personalization engine”, called pSOPT, for better
reflecting individual adaptation capacity, and to test pSOPT's feasibility (R21 phase) and preliminary
effect (R33 phase) in MCI. In R21 phase (intervention refinement, Stage Ia), we will establish a
“personalization engine” for the SOPT by taking advantage of unique information derived from ANS
assessment that links to learning and test the feasibility in MCI. Advanced time-series data analysis
methods (e.g., shapelet analysis) will be used to develop a prototype of pSOPT based on the previously identified
ANS shapelet. Compliance and usability of the pSOPT will be examined using interviews, questionnaires, and
recorded performance data using a single group design in older adults with MCI (n = 10). Specific aims include
(1) Use the identified ANS shapelet to develop a “personalization engine” that can modulate SOPT according to
real-time measures of ANS; (2) Examine the feasibility of administering the pSOPT. In R33 phase (pilot test,
Stage Ib), we will test the preliminary effects of the pSOPT in MCI. A pilot double-blinded randomized
controlled trial (RCT). An MCI group (N = 50) will be randomized into a 6-week pSOPT (n = 25), or attention
control (n = 25). Cardiac monitor-based ANS signals will be recorded throughout training sessions across groups.
Learning is indexed by performing accurately across a consecutive set of trials in training tasks. Cognitive battery
(measuring cognitive gains) and BOLD fMRI-based brain function (measuring neural gains) will be assessed at
baseline, post training (7-week), and short-term follow-up (3-month); neurodegeneration (T1MRI and blood-
based Alzheimer's pathology) assessed at baseline. Specific aims include (1) Compare changes of cognitive
and neural gains between groups; (2) Explore whether pSOPT will enhance ANS flexibility in supporting cognitive
gains against baseline neurodegeneration. This study is a prerequisite to efficiently launch an efficacy trial of
pSOPT in slowing dementia progress."

Vector Borne Diseases (VBD) are emerging threats to health globally. One of the biggest challenges of VBDs
is the complexity of interconnectedness among humans, animals, vectors, and their shared environments.
There is increasing evidence of the impact of climate change on prevalence of VBDs globally. Sustainable
VBD control and prevention requires collaborative research and intervention implementation using a One
Health framework. Lack of a holistic academic platform for integrated interdisciplinary research is one
of the major impediments in the advancement of innovative methods in VBD control.
In this D43 Training Application to the Fogarty International Center, the Aga Khan University (AKU)-
Department of Pathology & Lab Medicine, in partnership with University of Washington (UW) Departments
of Medicine and Global Health, and in collaboration with the national universities in Pakistan, will develop an
Integrated Interdisciplinary VBD Research Training Program in which researchers will work under
close supervision of a Transdisciplinary Research Advisory Committee that will ensure learning by
integration of multidisciplinary methods and concepts, and help researchers develop integrated research
strategies. The Training Program Faculty that forms this Committee are experienced mentors with local and
international trainees, have a strong history of 312 peer-reviewed publications with international mentees and
a mean of ~$3.5M USD in available research support.
This program will foster the use of metagenomic, bioinformatics, mathematical modelling,
implementation science skills and advanced immunologic techniques to examine relationships
between pathogens, vectors, hosts, and their environments. It will develop a platform for frontline
researchers in VBD for transdisciplinary learning through discussions forums, sharing best practices and
case studies. Specific aims of this program are: 1) Establish high-impact interdisciplinary research on VBD
(PhD Program), guided by the transdisciplinary research advisory committee on VBD at AKU, 2) introduce
new skills: a) Metagenomics., b) Mathematical Modelling, and, c) Implementation Science, through Master’s
level degree training for VBD surveillance and policy implementation in Pakistan, 3) develop a
transdisciplinary VBD Professionals’ Learning Network in Pakistan: that will provide short term training
(certification Program) to frontline researchers encountering VBD across disciplines. This will enhance their
diagnostic, management, and research skills and engage these researchers from different disciplines to meet
on a regular basis through an integrated seminar series. Pakistan is a crossroad for West and Central Asia,
the Middle East, notably a region of high risk for VBD emergence, yet no VBD research training is available
in these regions, Thus, the capacity building gained by establishing this Training Program will benefit the
worldwide effort to understand, detect, and respond to emerging VBD."

Harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs), dense proliferations of toxic cyanobacterial metabolites due to
eutrophication of freshwater, are a leading threat towards drinking water. CyanoHABs impact human health in a
multifaceted way through acute and chronic exposure, aerosolization, economic loss, and reduction in access to
natural resources. Some metabolites produced in cyanoHABs are well known such as microcystins and
saxitoxins, yet countless others remain unidentified. Advances in DNA sequencing and biosynthetic gene cluster
(BGC) mining have revealed the genomic basis and origin of a novel suite of metabolites amongst cyanoHABs,
yet current research remains focused on canonical cyanotoxins. Additionally, recent work indicates that many
commonly produced cyanopeptides have unknown toxic synergistic effects when produced in combination.
These insights suggest that studies of individual cyanotoxins and cyanopeptides on human health do not reflect
the composite health risk associated with natural bloom samples. Thus, unanswered questions remain about the
effects of toxic cyanobacterial metabolites when produced as mixtures in cyanoHABs. Moreover, the
environmental factors driving the production of these toxic metabolites remains poorly understood. Our goal is
to identify the effects of cyanopeptide mixtures on an array of human cell lines and identify the mechanistic basis
for toxin production in cyanoHABs using a nine-year, multi-omic time series from Western Lake Erie (WLE),
where cyanoHABs have threatened the drinking water supply for decades. Determining conserved
cyanobacterial biosynthetic patterns in the field through metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic
analysis will enable improved monitoring strategies to protect public health in and around WLE and globally.
Furthermore, we plan to model these data to identify environmental and physiochemical parameters that
stimulate the production of toxic cyanobacterial metabolites in WLE cyanoHABs. We anticipate these efforts will
catalyze the production of enhanced risk assessment models that consider the combined risks of other toxic
metabolites beyond common cyanotoxins like microcystins. Throughout this study, we will bridge field and
laboratory studies using multi-omic and bioassay techniques to redefine “toxicity” in cyanoHABs by identifying
additional metabolites and metabolite combinations that pose unrecognized threats to human health. Overall,
we hypothesize that changes in toxic metabolite composition across spatiotemporal gradients correspond with
fluctuating cyanobacterial communities within cyanoHABs, representing biosynthetic adaptations and novel
threats towards human health. Ultimately, the development of such models and frameworks for cyanoHABs have
the potential to produce highly resolved risk assessment models for cyanoHABs around the world, thereby
protecting people and natural resources from the effects of these catastrophic events and informing prevention
and management strategies."

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic and severely
impacted public health. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects respiratory epithelium cells expressing host factors
required for viral entry. Infection is initiated when the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein binds to the host cell
receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The viral glycoprotein must be processed by cellular
proteases to enable fusion and two distinct proteases have been shown to process Spike in different contexts.
In cells that do not express the plasma-membrane associated serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), the virus is
endocytosed and undergoes membrane fusion in acidified compartments by cathepsin proteases. In contrast, in
respiratory cells, TMPRSS2 is a plasma-membrane associated protease thought to process the glycoprotein at
the plasma membrane for fusion at the surface. Although viral entry is a critical step of infection and can be
targeted by therapeutics, the full spectrum of proteins involved and how they are regulated is incompletely
understood. Our lab utilizes the Calu-3 cell line which resembles primary cells in morphology, signaling pathways,
and expression of both ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We previously identified ~130 drugs with antiviral activity against
SARS-CoV-2 including the canonical TMPRSS2 inhibitor Camostat. Thus, we postulated that additional drugs in
this set may block TMPRSS2-dependent entry. To identify drugs that block entry we took advantage of
recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing endogenous glycoprotein (VSV-G), or the SARS-CoV-
2 glycoprotein Spike (VSV-S). I found that two entry inhibitors, Retro2.1 and Staurosporine, block SARS-CoV-2
infection in diverse cell types utilizing TMPRSS2-dependent and cathepsin-dependent entry, suggesting that
they impact ACE2, or another common step in the entry pathway. Retro2.1 is known to impact host protein
trafficking through inhibition of the ER exit site protein SEC16A, block entry of several viruses, and block uptake
of bacterial toxins. Staurosporine is a broad protein kinase c (PKC) inhibitor, and my preliminary data suggests
it blocks viral entry. Given that PKCs are known to impact receptor expression and have been implicated during
entry of several viruses including SARS-CoV-2, I tested multiple PKC isozymes and implicated a role for PKCη
in viral entry. I hypothesize that Retro2.1 and Staurosporine block ACE2 surface expression through
inhibition of SEC16A-dependent trafficking and PKCη-regulated recycling. In Aim 1, I will determine the
functional impact of Retro2.1 and SEC16A on SARS-CoV-2 binding and infection as well as the surface
expression of ACE2. In Aim 2, I will test the role of PKCη in entry and determine the impact of Staurosporine
and PKCη depletion on ACE2 surface expression and recycling. The proposed experiments will provide insight
into the molecular mechanisms of ACE2 regulation and SARS-CoV-2 entry and may inform the development of
therapeutics against emerging variants and zoonotic coronaviruses."

 Sepsis is a common and deadly disease and treatment options are limited to antibiotics and supportive care.
Endotoxemia is a key feature of sepsis pathogenesis and can also contribute to numerous other inflammatory
disorders. Growing antibiotic resistance and an aging population have contributed to an urgent unmet need for
new therapeutics for these conditions.
 This K08 proposal will complete the training that will launch the independent career of Vinitha Jacob, MD,
PhD, a physician scientist in emergency medicine. She seeks to complement her expertise in zebrafish
development with additional training in mammalian systems to reach her long-term goal of developing both novel
and repurposed therapeutics for sepsis and other acute diseases.
 In Dr. Jacob’s recently published work, she used the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to recapitulate key
features of sepsis pathogenesis. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) identified cholesterol metabolism as one of the
most significantly altered pathways in LPS treated zebrafish and sepsis patients with poor outcomes.
Specifically, the mRNA for 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), which catalyzes the conversion of 7-
dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol, was significantly upregulated in LPS treated zebrafish and was one
of only two lipid-related gene associated with mortality in sepsis patients. Dr. Jacob made the novel finding that
fish treated with a DHCR7-specific inhibitor were completely protected from endotoxemic death. In her specific
aims, she will build on these findings and interrogate the mechanisms by which DHCR7 inhibition protects from
endotoxemia (Aim 1), test whether DHCR7 inhibition can also relieve LPS toxicity a mammalian model (Aim 2)
and identify clinically used DHCR7 inhibitors (Aim 3) that can be considered for repurposing for acute human
inflammatory diseases including sepsis.
 These aims will elucidate the role of DHCR7 in endotoxemia and will identify clinically utilized DHCR7
inhibitors that mediate LPS toxicity. In completing the proposed aims under the guidance of established mentors
and leaders Dr. Shavit (genome editing), Dr. Dickson (mammalian endotoxemia/sepsis) and Dr. Schwendeman
(cholesterol metabolism), Dr. Jacob will complement her experience in zebrafish development with knowledge
in cholesterol metabolism and hands-on-training in genome editing techniques and mammalian models of
endotoxemia. The fertile training ground at the University of Michigan, with its strong history of developing
successful physician scientists, combined with an experienced mentorship team with relevant expertise will allow
Dr. Jacob to emerge from this career development award period as a uniquely trained emergency medicine
physician-scientist with expertise in both zebrafish and mammalian systems. She will thus have the ability take
her findings from initial discovery across the translational spectrum."

The transcriptional regulatory sequences communicate with each other dynamically in the
3D nuclear space to direct cell type specific gene expression. Currently, a major barrier to
understanding the transcriptional regulatory programs is the lack of tools, models and maps
to explore the chromatin architecture in diverse cell types and physiological contexts. We
will address this pressing need by deploying transformative technologies to study the
chromatin architecture in mammalian cells at an unprecedented resolution and scale.
Specifically, we will generate navigable, cell-type-specific reference maps of chromatin
architecture in the mouse, macaque and human brains by integrating high resolution and
high throughput imaging and orthogonal single-cell-based genomic methods. We will also
dissect the role of chromatin architecture in gene regulation through a set of controlled
perturbation experiments in the mouse ES cells (ESC) and ESC-derived neural progenitor
cells (NPC). We will develop structural models of chromatin organization with advanced
polymer physics and statistical learning methods, and validate their predictive power in
embryonic stem cells and in ex vivo brain slices. Finally, we will make the reference maps,
analytical tools, visualization methods and structural models available to the broader
community. The proposed research project will dramatically transform our ability to analyze
the 4D Nucleome of complex tissues, and produce the much-needed maps, tools and

Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS) is a serious but poorly understood visual disorder characterized by the persistent
perception of specks flickering across the entire visual field, akin to television snow. VSS has an estimated
prevalence of 1.4-3.3% and is often accompanied by additional symptoms such as prominent afterimages
(palinopsia), poor night vision, entoptic phenomena, and photophobia (light sensitivity). These symptoms make
tasks like reading and driving particularly difficult. While previous research has focused on identifying the
common symptoms and comorbidities, effective treatments have not been identified, the mechanisms underlying
the disorder are still unknown, and quantitative assessments of visual perception remain sparse. The proposed
research seeks to address these knowledge gaps by measuring differences in visual performance and
associated neural processing with a series of well-established psychophysical and imaging paradigms. To
provide quantitative measures of perception and visual processing in VSS, we will assess (1) contrast sensitivity,
(2) spatial context, and (3) temporal context perception in people with VSS compared to normally sighted controls
through a series of fundamental psychophysical and high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) experiments. These experiments will help us understand how people with VSS perceive and process
contrast, which is an important measure of visual function that is related to performance on every-day visual
tasks. Additionally, the proposed research will address how both spatial and temporal context are altered in
VSS—previous but sparse research suggests that both spatial and temporal context may be altered in VSS, but
further evidence with both larger numbers of participants and robust measures of neural activity are required to
investigate potential differences in visual context processing. Critically, we will also provide high resolution 7T
fMRI measures of cortical responses during visual tasks to investigate potential differences in gain control
throughout the visual system. The proposed assessment of visual perception and accompanying measurements
of neural processing in VSS are necessary to better characterize this disorder, and will help formulate hypotheses
about mechanisms underlying VSS."

Under Unit Director Dr. Eliezer Van Allen's leadership, the Van Allen laboratory's NCI funded research programs
study genitourinary (GU) cancers (prostate, bladder, kidney, testes), with a focus on understanding treatment
resistance in these diseases through integrative computational and molecular approaches grounded in the
patient experience. With her multidisciplinary training and collaborative leadership, Research Specialist Dr. Jihye
Park has been an integral part of these research programs contributing to various discovery and novel
computational methods. Our research programs led to the discovery of the molecular basis of selective
chemosensitivity in bladder and testes cancers, and biological understanding of androgen inhibitor resistance in
prostate cancer, creating new drug discovery paradigms and means of patient stratification. We also developed
integrative computational and experimental approaches to discover the interaction relevant to treatment
resistance across the tumor, germline, and immune axes with our patient-centered paradigm in GU cancers.
Furthermore, we discovered tumor-intrinsic factors determining cancer immunotherapy in solid tumors, directly
invoking chromatin dysregulation as a cause of selective immunotherapy response and forming the basis for
new files of drug development and therapeutic combinations. Despite these advances, the majority of patients
with advanced GU cancers still experience resistance to therapies and the biological relevance and interplay of
specific germline, somatic, or immune systems in these cancers are still largely unknown. Furthermore, we face
computational challenges to handle vast amounts of new types of data to analyze efficiently. Dr. Park is now
leading the effort to utilize integrated patient-centered approaches, specifically longitudinal single cell
transcriptional and whole genome and epigenetic characterization of tumors, to understand the biological basis
of molecular sensitization with tumor evolution perspectives and determine the paradigms that drive lethal
immunotherapy resistant disease in GU cancers. Dr. Park will also contribute to the development of
comprehensive and scalable analytic tools that can integrate multi-omics data and study systems level
interactions between germline, somatic, and immune systems. These methods will be implemented within an
open cloud-based platform (Terra) and amplify collaborations within the cancer community. Overall, Dr. Park's
recent and ongoing contributions aim to reveal the integrated molecular factors that drive lethal disease in GU
cancers and elucidate the biology of these processes, toward translation of effective therapeutic and patient
stratification modalities, and broader accessibility of comprehensive computational methods utilizing cutting edge
molecular profiling approaches. With Unit Director Dr. Eliezer Van Allen, Dr. Park's leadership and scientific and
computational efforts will continue to establish an interdisciplinary and highly collaborative group with scientists
from diverse scientific domains driving these comprehensive clinical computational research programs.

The overarching goal of the Administrative Core is to ensure smooth functioning of the primary projects, pilot 
grants, research cores, and CNAP programs. We have recruited individuals with strong expertise in research 
project development, grant writing and grant management, research mentoring, and research administration to 
ensure that the overarching goals are met. The four aims of the Administrative Core are: (1) To promote R01- 
level award success for CNAP project and pilot grant leaders. The Administrative Core will implement the 
mentoring program to help achieve this aim. We have recruited two expert mentors for each of the three 
projects and will recruit one or more mentors for each pilot grant and future replacement projects with specific 
expertise in research areas relevant to each project. The mentors are nationally known researchers with 
considerable mentoring experience. The mentors bring their outstanding expertise to ensure that the projects

Alzheimer's special care units (SCUs) are a promising care model for nursing home residents with Alzheimer's
Disease & Related Dementias (ADRD). SCUs provide higher quality care and improve outcomes for residents
with ADRD. Our preliminary analysis further found that, in facilities with an SCU, the disparities in 3-month
hospitalization rates and pressure ulcers between Hispanic and White residents were eliminated or greatly
reduced. Despite the benefits of SCUs, racial and ethnic minority residents are less likely to access SCUs than
White residents, suggesting that lack of SCU access may be a mechanistic pathway responsible for disparities
in outcomes. Currently, SCUs are available in only 14% of nursing homes and access varies substantially across
states. State Medicaid policies and SCU regulations can incentivize or disincentivize nursing homes to develop
SCUs. By analyzing national Medicare claims and resident assessment data, as well as unique Ohio
surveys of SCUs and resident and family satisfaction with care, we propose to understand the extent to
which racial and ethnic differences in SCU access contribute to disparities in outcomes, and the
associations of current state policies and regulations with SCU availability.
The specific aims are: Aim 1) To examine disparities in access to Alzheimer's SCUs among Black and Hispanic
residents with ADRD; Aim 2) To understand SCU access as a pathway to disparities in health outcomes among
Black and Hispanic residents with ADRD; and Aim 3) To investigate which state policies are associated with
increased availability of SCUs.
The primary analyses will study the 819,415 newly-admitted long-stay residents with ADRD in 15,305 nursing
homes from 2011 to 2019. The decomposition method will uncover factors that explain disparities in SCU access
among Black and Hispanic residents, and mediation analyses will assess how differences in SCU access
contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes. Dominance analyses will evaluate the contribution
of specific SCU characteristics (physical environment, staffing, and physician involvement) to health outcomes
and resident and family satisfaction, as well as reduced racial and ethnic disparities. We will also analyze 2020-
2024 data to examine whether our findings hold during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Hierarchical
Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Difference-in-Differences method will explore which state policies (e.g.,
supplementary payments for SCU care, Medicaid payment-to-cost ratios, regulations about staffing or training)
are associated with SCU availability. Understanding the role of SCU access in racial and ethnic disparities in
ADRD-related outcomes can inform policymakers as they seek to mitigate disparities in nursing home care."
10875556,"PROJECT DESCRIPTION: Sepsis affects at least 1.7 million Americans annually, causing the death of
270,000 patients and including 30% of all hospital deaths. Unfortunately, there are no effective therapies for
patients with sepsis and septic shock. Excessive neutrophil activation is a critical determinant of inflammation
and tissue injury in sepsis. Therefore, targeting neutrophil activation, migration, and infiltration may be a
rational strategy to reduce sepsis morbidity and mortality. During the last funding period of this MIRA project,
we have made significant advances in the molecular mechanism of neutrophil and endothelial cell activation,
their interaction, and neutrophil infiltration in the lungs in sepsis. We previously reported extracellular cold-
inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) as a new damage-associated molecular pattern molecule released in
sepsis to increase inflammation and cause acute lung injury. To continue our MIRA program, we aim to
explore the deep insights into neutrophils’ phenotypic and functional characteristics induced by eCIRP that
may aggravate organ injury in sepsis. We have discovered a previously unknown neutrophil population with
antigen-presenting, T-cell activating, and aged phenotypes, which we named antigen-presenting aged
neutrophils (APANs). APANs produce IL-12, which polarizes Th1 cells to generate interferon-, thereby
priming and inducing neutrophils to produce excessive neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), causing further
tissue injury. Adoptive transfer of APANs aggravated sepsis and increased the mortality of septic animals,
suggesting that APANs play a critical role in sepsis pathobiology. However, APANs’ localization, induction,
and effector functions in sepsis remain unknown, as does their contribution to the immune and cognitive
dysfunction of sepsis survivors. We have recently predicted in silico and confirmed in vitro that our newly
discovered stable RNA mimic A12 binds to eCIRP with high affinity, decreasing eCIRPs affinity for its receptor,
inhibiting eCIRP’s ability to induce TNF release and to induce NETosis. Thus, A12 is a novel and potent
eCIRP inhibitor with the potential to attenuate the detrimental effects of eCIRP-induced APANs in sepsis. As
such, this renewal MIRA research program will address the following three key questions: 1) How does eCIRP
induce APANs, and what are their effector functions? 2) How do APANs aggravate sepsis? 3) Does targeting
eCIRP regulate APANs to mitigate sepsis? The proposed research will lead to a new direction for developing
innovative therapeutics to treat patients suffering from sepsis and septic shock by preventing or modulating the
novel hyperinflammatory neutrophil population of APANs."
10875557,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to develop safe and effective drugs to treat obesity. We propose to validate ALDH1A1 as
a new drug target for obesity treatment by testing the anti-obesity efficacy of a novel inhibitor of this enzyme,
N42, that was recently developed by our group. Retinoic acid (RA), a metabolite of vitamin A, is synthesized by
three aldehyde dehydrogenases, ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3, that are expressed in temporally and
spatially distinct yet sometimes overlapping patterns in a tissue- and developmental stage-dependent manner.
ALDH1A1 is the major RA synthesis enzyme in two metabolically important tissues, liver and adipose, where RA
is known to regulate expression of genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism and adipose tissue
differentiation. Aldh1a1-/- mice develop normally, are healthy and fertile, and are also protected from
developing diet-induced obesity. In agreement with observations in Aldh1a1-/- mice, we demonstrated that
mice treated with WIN 18,446, a pan-inhibitor of ALDH1A enzymes, had lower weight gain due to a decrease in
adipose tissue mass, demonstrating the feasibility of using pharmacological inhibitors of ALDH1A to treat obesity.
Although WIN 18,446 treatment is promising for weight suppression, it inhibits other RA synthesis enzymes as
well as ALDH2, causing unwanted side effects such as reversible spermatogenesis inhibition and alcohol
intolerance. Therefore, we developed compounds that specifically inhibit ALDH1A1 and now propose to
evaluate the efficacy and potential toxicity of a novel ALDH1A1-specific inhibitor, N42, for treatment of
obesity and to determine mechanisms by which ALDH1A1 regulates weight gain by using
comprehensive studies of gene expression and metabolite changes in response to ALDH1A1 loss. In
Aim 1, we will determine if N42 treatment can (1) suppress weight gain in obese mice when they are continuously
fed a high fat diet and (2) accelerate weight loss in obese mice when they are provided reduced calorie diet. We
will also investigate potential organ toxicity of N42 treatment using standard, well-established protocols of clinical
and toxicologic pathology. Metabolic changes associated with ALDH1A1 loss (N42 treatment or Aldh1a1-/- mice)
will be comprehensively investigated using global metabolomics and gene expression studies. Phenotypic
parameters including metabolites, gene expression, retinoid levels etc. will be associated with N42-mediated
efficacy to identify potential biomarkers for future clinical use of this compound. In Aim 2, the role of ALDH1A1
in liver and adipose tissues will be further explored using tissue-specific Aldh1a1-/- mice. We will also determine
how ALDH1A1 loss in adults alters adipogenesis and adipocyte hypertrophy using an adipocyte linage mouse
model. Finally, we will identify tissue-autonomous functions of ALDH1A1 by combining a novel perifusion
method, metabolomics, and systems-biology approaches. Successful completion of the proposed studies will
validate ALDH1A1 as a novel target to treat obesity and provide a potential prototype drug."
10875664,"Abstract
Age-related cataract, defined as ocular lens opacity, is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Cataract is also
associated with injurious falls and increased mortality and is a significant public health problem in the U.S.,
accounting for approximately 60% of Medicare costs related to vision. Given the aging U.S. population, cataract
surgery demand is expected to double over the next 25 years. Thus, it is important to understand the etiology of
cataract to identify at-risk patients and develop effective prevention strategies. Recently, we conducted a large-
scale multiethnic genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of cataract that has identified 55
genetic loci, including 38 novel loci, that underlie the risk of cataract. Majority of the genes in these loci were
independently supported as promising candidates for cataract by the database iSyTE (integrated Systems Tool
for Eye gene discovery), based on their significant expression in the lens. While these data uncovered potential
new causal genes in the identified loci, their function in the lens is not defined and their role underlying cataract
risk remains largely unknown. Further, whether cataract-loci regulate genes and how regulation differs across
tissues has not yet been explored. Our study also identified strong genetic correlations between cataract and
several disorders/traits, including, glaucoma, myopia, cigarettes smoking, and BMI, supporting previous
observational studies. However, it is not clear that these associations are causal. Finally, no predictive tool exists
for evaluating individuals at-risk for cataract. The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the role
of genetic and non-genetic factors and causal mechanisms underlying the etiology of cataract and develop a
prediction tool to facilitate risk-stratified screening for cataract. By leveraging a rich multiethnic cohort, with both
genome-wide genotype data and extensive clinical data collected through electronic health records, and using
whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of UK Biobank participants, we will accomplish the following specific
aims: 1.a) Identify novel genetic predictors of cataract risk using high quality WES data and transcriptome-wide
association study (TWAS) approach; 1.b) Evaluate whether glaucoma, myopic refractive error, diabetes, high
blood pressure, high BMI, cigarette smoking, or alcohol consumption and other clinical and behavioral factors
are causal risk factors of cataract using a Mendelian randomization approach; 2) Develop risk prediction models
of cataract risk by integrating polygenic risk scores along with other risk factors; and 3) Determine the function –
in the lens using animal models – of novel candidate genes prioritized in cataract-associated loci. This proposed
research is significant because it will fill an important gap in cataract genetics and will provide important
mechanistic insights into the pathogenesis of cataract. The project is innovative in the development of
prediction models of cataract risk based on genetic and non-genetic risk factors as well as the development of
novel animal models of cataract. The long-term goal of this research is to advance cataract etiology knowledge
for effective interventions and non-surgical therapeutics for its prevention, delay or treatment."
10876967,"Project Summary/Abstract
Cellular phenotypic heterogeneity is a key mechanism underlying neoplastic disease progression and
therapeutic resistance, yet its regulation is poorly understood at the molecular level. We have found that elevated
therapeutic resistance is associated with higher levels of cell-to-cell transcriptomic heterogeneity and that
decreasing such heterogeneity by modulating the activity of epigenetic histone-modifying enzymes such as
KDM5B improves responses to treatment. We also determined that acquired resistance to epigenetic drug
agents, including KDM5 and BET bromodomain inhibitors, is due to epigenetic mechanisms, whereas acquired
endocrine resistance reflects a selection for a pre-existing, genetically distinct sub-populations of cells. The goal
of this Project is to investigate the population dynamics of cellular phenotypic heterogeneity in response to and
resistance to cancer therapies in luminal estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and triple-negative breast cancer
(TNBC). Our hypothesis is that cellular states governed by epigenetic regulators are highly variable and dynamic
and that this underlies acquired therapeutic resistance. We also hypothesize that by modulating the activity of
epigenetic regulators and by identifying mechanisms of synthetic lethality and the acquired resistance to
epigenetic agents, we can decrease transcriptomic heterogeneity and improve therapeutic response. To test our
hypotheses, we will characterize the impact of genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity on acquired resistance to
endocrine, chemo-, and epigenetic therapies (Aim 1). We will use barcoded cells to follow population dynamics
during the development of acquired resistance, characterize the epigenetic landscape and transcriptomic
heterogeneity of drug-tolerant and -resistant populations, and build mathematical models based on experimental
data to predict the evolution of therapeutic resistance to different agents. Additionally, to define synthetic-lethal
interactions and mechanism of acquired resistance to epigenetic therapies we will perform CRISPR/Cas9
screens (Aim 2) in ER+ and TNBC cell lines that are sensitive versus resistant to epigenetic agents. Overall, the
project will significantly advance our knowledge of the regulation of phenotypic heterogeneity and the role this
plays in therapeutic responses and resistance."
10914692,"The amount and quality of infants’ interaction with caregivers impact their opportunities for optimal development,
providing the foundation for lifelong health outcomes. Nevertheless, around the world, some 250 million young
children are at risk of not achieving their developmental potential. To improve development for these at-risk
children, evidence-based approaches include supporting caregivers to provide nurturing care. However, scaling
these services and support for caregivers is challenging in many low-resource delivery environments, where
over-taxing of frontline healthcare workers is a limiting constraint. For infant development, mHealth technologies
have the potential to solve this problem by providing tailored content directly to caregivers, involving and
empowering them to promote infant development, promoting and facilitating interactions with health workers
when areas of concern are identified and, therefore, and expanding the reach of healthcare systems. The
objectives of this project are to develop mHealth smartphone technology which can be used to engage primary
caregivers directly in the active monitoring of their infants’ development, and to provide tailored feedback and
support for the provision of nurturing care. In addition, we will also prospectively assess the implementation
characteristics of the technology—usability, acceptability, and sustainability—for caregivers and health workers.
Aim 1 is to use an agile design approach to develop and audience test a smartphone application to engage
caregivers in monitoring their infants’ development and to provide tailored anticipatory guidance for nurturing
care. Aim 2 is to assess the implementation characteristics of the smartphone application through a longitudinal,
six-month usability trial, to determine caregiver engagement over time and to assess the perceived usefulness
of the application. Aim 3 is to determine the effectiveness of a smartphone-based, real-time caregiver feedback
intervention to promote positive infant developmental outcomes and improved caregiving behaviors.
This exploratory/developmental research application responds to PAR 19-376’s call to “study the development,
validation, feasibility, and effectiveness of innovative mobile health (mHealth) interventions or tools specifically
suited for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)”, in this case a culturally-based, family-focused approached
to engaging caregivers in nurturing care for infants at-risk. This is a multidisciplinary proposal, involving
pediatrics, developmental and community psychology, physical therapy, and biomedical engineering. Our results
will contribute to the evidence base for the use of mobile technology (client-focused applications providing real-
time interactive feedback) to directly engage target populations around important public health priorities while
building research capacity for mHealth in an LMIC, Guatemala. This application is a partnership between the
Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (a U.S. institution), Emory University (a U.S. institution), and Maya Health
Alliance (an LMIC institution). The proposed plan will strengthen the mHealth research capabilities at the LMIC
institution and in Guatemala through the development of research and programming personnel and resources."
10875223,"Title: Fall Prevention in ASL-Using Deaf Older Adults
 The overarching goal of this project is to improve the safety, independence, and ability of the older adults
who are Deaf, Deaf Blind, Deaf Disabled, and Hard of Hearing (DDBHH) and use American Sign Language
(ASL), to participate in daily life, through fall prevention programs that are effective in reducing fall incidences
among older DDBHH adults. The incidence of falls among older adults who report being deaf is significantly
higher than among those who deny being deaf (CDC 2020). DDBHH adults who use ASL are diverse, yet unique
in that most of them have been deaf congenitally or since childhood, and that they do not share the value of
hearing sensitivity and spoken communication abilities in the same way the rest of the society, particularly the
healthcare providers, does. We lack understanding of how cultural, linguistic, and physiological differences
impact access to and relevance of resources, information, and support network; nor of the impact of life-long or
near life-long vestibular deficit on balance control and fall risk. The potential inequity for ASL using adults cannot
be addressed without gaining further understanding of these factors.
 An effective fall prevention program design must consider both the physiological factors as well as the cultural
and behavioral factors impacting Deaf adults’ fall incidences; and be able to reach them at different stages of fall
prevention, including engaging older DDBHH adults in regular physical activities. Therefore, the specific aims of
this project are (1) To identify barriers and opportunities for a successful implementation of a fall prevention
wellness program targeting community-dwelling older DDBHH adults; and (2) To determine feasibility and
potential benefits of a balance exercise program delivered in ASL. For the first aim, qualitative data from eligible
older DDBHH adults will be collected, through (a) individual interviews which will be analyzed for themes re:
individual experiences with fall incidences, fall-related resources, and access to services; and (b) focus groups
to generate ideas and strategies to mitigate fall risks in this population. For the second aim, we will deliver four
8-week exercise programs over a course, each enrolling 10 community-dwelling DDBHH adults 60 years and
older. We will describe the vestibular and physical balance characteristics of the participants, adherence rate,
perceived benefits, and improvements in physical fitness among the participants.
 The results of this culturally informed investigation will inform future design of fall preventative care for older
DDBHH persons, success of which will have a significant impact on older DDBHH adults’ fall incidences, health,
and quality of life. The PI, Chizuko Tamaki, AuD, PhD, is a clinician-researcher-educator who has mentored
multiple student researchers in vestibular science and serving the DDBHH community as audiologist. Dr. Tamaki
will work with Janis Cole, PhD, a Deaf researcher with background in social work and studies in cultural and
gender impact on language use; and Carol Riddick, PhD, Professor of Physical Education & Recreation Program
with extensive experience working with older adults and conducting gerontological research."
10876890,"ABSTRACT
Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a highly prevalent malignancy in sub-Saharan Africa. This cancer, with
Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) as the etiologic agent, is at increased incidence in HIV-1
infected patients despite antiretroviral (ART) suppression of HIV-1 viral load. It also occurs as an
aggressive tumor in the HIV-negative population. Our team has been studying KS and KSHV
transmission in KS endemic countries and we have shown that KSHV infection is acquired
predominantly in early childhood, HIV-1 infection is a major risk factor, and that mucosal exposure to
infectious saliva is the likely mechanism of transmission. More recently, our results from Zambia and
Tanzania demonstrated that high titer neutralizing Ab responses (nAb) develop primarily in individuals
with symptomatic KS as opposed to infected asymptomatic individuals, suggesting that nAb is not a
correlate of KS protection. Thus, much like in the HIV-1 virus-host interaction, it appears that KSHV
nAb cannot prevent disease after long-term chronic infection. However, the prophylactic capacity of
passively administered broadly nAb has been demonstrated in HIV-1/SIV infectious challenge models;
whereas, the ability of pre-existing nAb to prevent KSHV transmission is untested. In addition, while the
in vitro KSHV entry process has been studied in some depth, the precise viral and cellular interactions
involved in KSHV at the tissue level, have not been clearly elucidated. In part, this knowledge gap
results from the lack of an in vivo model of human KSHV transmission. The proposed project applies
our team's long-term experience with KS, KSHV, human KSHV Ab responses, and KSHV infection in a
humanized mouse model that we have developed, to address the knowledge gap posed by KSHV
transmission and dissemination. Our overall objective is to identify immune response(s) that can
protect against KSHV infection and transmission, and thereby, prevent KS. Our hypothesis is that
KSHV nAb can be protective against KSHV transmission in ex vivo human organotypic tissue models
and in a humanized mouse model of KSHV infection. The hypothesis will be tested with 3 specific aims:
1) Develop organotypic oral and vaginal epithelial culture models to understand KSHV transmission
dynamics and to test whether sera with high nAb titer prevents trans-epithelial KSHV infection; 2) test
whether KSHV nAb is protective in a humanized BLT-mouse model of mucosal and blood exposure,
infection and dissemination of KHSV, and 3) isolation of human monoclonal KSHV nAb and
characterization of their impact on KSHV transmission. This project will clarify the mechanisms of
KSHV transmission and dissemination, and lay the foundations for strategies to develop a vaccine to
prevent KSHV infection. Ultimately, such studies will expand our capacity to prevent KSHV infection
and associated neoplasms."

10877723,"SUMMARY
In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the material properties of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules,
which are formed via liquid-liquid phase separation, play crucial roles in both cellular physiology and pathology.
Nevertheless, mechanistic understandings of the molecular determinants and modulators of RNP granule
viscoelastic phases remain incomplete due to the limitations of currently available techniques to probe for protein
condensate dynamics across single-molecule to mesoscale. The goal of this proposal is to address this critical
gap by the development of a multi-parametric experimental toolbox that simultaneously reports on RNP
condensate structure and dynamics across different length-scales, with high sensitivity. Our approach will feature
correlative multicolor single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, dual-trap optical tweezers, and microfluidics.
Utilizing our novel toolbox, we will decipher the mechanisms of liquid-to-liquid and liquid-to-solid phase
transitions of intracellular RNP condensates, processes that critically contribute to the onset or development of
many neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia
(FTD). Commonly used fluorescence microscopy techniques, such as fluorescence recovery after
photobleaching (FRAP), offer only probe-specific protein/RNA diffusivity within the RNP granules. In contrast,
our proposed correlative force-fluorescence microscopy platform will provide a multiscale view of RNP
condensate dynamics by taking advantage of optical tweezer-based rheological and fluid dynamics
measurements in conjunction with quantification of protein dynamics using single-molecule fluorescence. We
hypothesize that (a) a hierarchy of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions determines both
nanoscale RNP dynamics and micron-scale material properties of the condensate, and (b) post-translational
modifications, RNA/DNA and ligand binding, and pathologic mutations modulate the material properties of RNP
condensates by manipulating the long-range and short-range inter-molecular forces. Overall, our research
program will address three Key Challenges (KCs): (a) we will develop a novel experimental toolbox based
on correlative multi-color confocal fluorescence microscopy and dual-trap optical tweezer that simultaneously
reports on molecular and mesoscale protein condensate structure and dynamics (KC 1), (b) we will apply our
toolbox to map the transition pathways of physiologic RNP granules to pathologic states in c9orf72 repeat
expansion disorder (KC 2), and (c) we will identify mechanisms of ligand-dependent transcriptional condensate
regulation at DNA enhancer sites (KC 3). Our studies will provide new insights into the determinants of functional
RNP condensate material states, dynamics, and composition, as well as identify novel pathways of these
granules’ pathologic alterations."

 I am an academic hematologist passionate about clinical research. My primary goal is to become a
successful, independent physician-scientist with expertise in the biology, epidemiology, and evidence-based
practice of rare bleeding disorders. More specifically, my long-term research goal is to better define the role of
age and age-related conditions in hereditary bleeding disorders, such as von Willebrand disease (VWD). This
K23 award will allow me to develop the skills necessary to act as a principal investigator for multicenter clinical
research studies, become trained in epidemiological research, and become proficient in the use of
bioinformatics to analyze genetic data. I have assembled an outstanding mentorship team, including experts in
hematology and epidemiology, to help me achieve these goals. My clinical research activities will be conducted
at HCWP and benefit from the excellent research infrastructure.
 The goal of this proposal is to determine the effect of age on von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels and
bleeding risk in patients with type 1 VWD. We will perform a multicenter, cross-sectional study enrolling
patients with type 1 VWD, age 18 and older, at participating Hemophilia Treatment Centers (N=7) during clinic
visits. Following enrollment, the condensed MCMDM-1 VWD bleeding assessment tool will be administered
and blood samples will be obtained. Laboratory tests include VWF antigen (VWF:Ag) level, VWF ristocetin
cofactor activity, factor VIII activity, and blood type. An additional blood sample will be obtained for DNA
isolation for VWF gene sequencing and analysis. We hypothesize that age is associated with increased
VWF:Ag levels and lower condensed MCMDM-1 VWD bleeding scores in patients with type 1 VWD. In
addition, we hypothesize that multimorbidity partially explains the association between age and VWF:Ag levels.
We also propose that VWF:Ag levels partially explain the association between age and condensed MCMDM-1
VWD bleeding scores. Finally, we expect the effect of age on VWF:Ag levels and condensed MCMDM-1 VWD
bleeding scores is weaker among those with a pathogenic VWF mutation.
 The identification of bleeding risk in elderly type 1 VWD patients is essential for providing appropriate
medical care to affected patients. Administering VWD-specific therapy to older type 1 VWD patients with
normalized VWF levels may be harmful, placing patients at risk for thrombosis. Thus, investigation into the
effect of age on VWF levels and bleeding risk in VWD patients is sorely needed. The results from this study will
provide preliminary data for several future R-level independent studies: 1) a longitudinal observational study
assessing bleeding risk with age in VWD patients; 2) a clinical trial comparing bleeding and safety outcomes
among type 1 VWD patients with normalized VWF levels undergoing invasive procedures randomized to VWD
therapy or no VWD therapy; and 3) gene sequencing of biorepository samples to identify candidate non-VWF
loci and explore how they interact with the effect of age on VWF levels and bleeding risk.

10877843,"Adolescence is characterized by changes in decision-making, accompanied by the progressive development of the prefrontal cortex and reconfiguration of brain networks that support goal-directed decision-making. Adolescence is also the typical age of clinical onset and peak prevalence for many forms of mental illness. Recent advances in computational modeling of cognitive processes have enabled the quantification of parameters that govern learning and decision and characterization of how they differ in mental illnesses. There are several differentiating properties of learning and decision making processes in the brain: learning can be model-free (based on past trial and error) vs. model-based (learning the structure of a task and computing a best course of action given that structure), Pavlovian (with innate sensitivities to different motivationally relevant outcomes) vs. instrumental (arbitrarily adaptive), and learning occurs from positive and negative consequences. Furthermore, responses can be biased toward action or inaction, and can be more or less exploratory (variable). We will use three reinforcement-learning tasks that, together with computational models, index these multiple differentiable features of learning and decision making, in order to jointly define an individual “computational phenotype” of learning and decision processes. In Aim 1 this computational phenotype will be defined in a large online sample age 10-25 in order to map changes in symptom dimensions across adolescent development. 
In Aim 2 we will use neuroimaging to characterize the relationship between decision-making phenotypes and neural connectivity in children, adolescents, and young adults. In Aim 3 we will characterize the relation between decision-making phenotypes and clinical symptomatology in a diagnostically heterogeneous sample of adolescents with generalized anxiety, depression, ADHD or OCD. Throughout, computational modeling of task behavior and self-reported symptom dimensions will build on state-of-the-art hierarchical modeling of multimodal and multi-task data. The research activities described in this proposal hold the potential to improve our understanding of the cognitive and neural mechanisms that underpin adolescent psychopathology, a question of broad societal impact given the prevalence and cost of mental illness, and the super-additive benefits of early detection and treatment."
10877847,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The developing mouse brain is a foundational experimental model for investigation of the origins of cell types in
the mammalian brain. Comprehensive knowledge of mouse brain development is critical for comparative studies
of neurodevelopmental processes, which are key to understanding the remarkable evolutionary innovations that
distinguish humans from other species. In addition, developmental information enables refining cell taxonomy in
the adult brain by incorporating knowledge of cell type and lineage origins into adult cell classification. Despite
the transformative insights enabled by the recently created molecular atlas of the adult mouse brain, we currently
lack a comprehensive census of cell types of the developing mouse brain, and the lineage relationships that link
them to their adult counterparts.
Here we seek to generate a comprehensive, spatially- and temporally-resolved, cellular-resolution atlas of the
whole developing mouse brain, sampled at high resolution through the entire period of embryonic and postnatal
brain development (from E8.0 to P28). We will employ three complementary approaches to generate
comprehensive multi-omic single-cell profiles: 10x Genomics single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), 10x Genomics
Multiome (simultaneous single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, for combined transcriptomic and epigenomic
profiling), and Smart-seq3 (for full-length deep RNA-sequencing). In parallel, we will use the spatially resolved
transcriptomic method MERFISH across the same densely-sampled timeline, to identify the spatial distribution
of all cell types and dynamic changes in cell states across the entire mouse brain. We will apply computational
methods to predict developmental lineage relationships from these spatially and temporally resolved datasets,
and experimentally validate lineage relationships through both barcode-based in vivo lineage tracing and by
functionally testing candidate molecular effectors using multiplexed in utero CRISPR screening (Perturb-seq).
Finally, we will pilot integration of developmental datasets across species, mapping single-cell omics datasets
from the developing human and non-human primate brains onto the comprehensive mouse brain developing cell
type atlas established here, to create a computational alignment of developmental time that will enable
understanding of differential regulation of specific developmental events across species. Overall, this project
brings together a team of investigators with extensive, demonstrated expertise in brain development, circuitry,
single-cell genomics, and assembly of brain atlases to produce a comprehensive developmental brain cell atlas,
intended to serve as a first-of-its-kind foundational resource to the neuroscience community for the study of
mechanisms of mammalian brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders. Our proposed project will
contribute substantially to the overarching goal of BICAN to generate fundamental knowledge on diverse cell
types and their three-dimensional organizational principles in the brain across lifespan and evolution."

Vascular inflammation is a key component of atherosclerosis that contributes to plaque instability and clinical
cardiovascular events, including ischemic stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). Despite decades of research,
the immune mechanisms contributing to these processes remain largely unresolved. Among myeloid cells,
monocytes/macrophages are believed to be major players in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases
(CVD). Emerging single-cell technologies have unveiled that the macrophage pool in CVD is vastly
heterogeneous, containing a plethora of transcriptionally distinct subpopulations. In chronic inflammatory
diseases, GATA3 is regarded as a master regulator of the phenotype of T-cells and other immune cells.
However, the role of GATA3 in the regulation of the phenotype of macrophages is completely unknown. For
the first time, we demonstrated that GATA3 was expressed in macrophages and GATA3+ macrophages
accumulated into the myocardium after acute MI and adversely affected the cardiac function. In fact, the
deficiency of GATA3+ macrophages led to a significant improvement of cardiac function after acute MI. Cell
culture studies revealed that IL-33 stimulated the expression of GATA3 in macrophages. Our long term goal is
to dissect the mechanism/s that regulates the phenotype and function of GATA3+ macrophages in CVD. Our
rationale is that by identifying the mechanism/s that control the phenotype of GATA3+ macrophages in the
setting of CVD will offer new therapeutic opportunities. In Specific Aim 1, we will utilize novel mouse models in
combination with transplant immunology to test the hypothesis that macrophage-specific IL-33R signaling
controls the recruitment and function of GATA3+ macrophages in CVD. Most studies aimed at characterizing
the phenotypes of human macrophages are performed in vitro; however, the relevance to the function of
macrophages in vivo is uncertain. The role of GATA3 signaling in the activity of human macrophages in vitro
and in vivo is completely unknown. We have generated macrophage-specific humanized GATA3 sufficient
mice as a novel preclinical platform to test the hypothesis that human GATA3 signaling controls the
phenotype/function of macrophages after acute MI in Specific Aim 2. In depth knowledge of atherosclerotic
plaques is a prerequisite to preventing and treating MI. We found that GATA3+ macrophages accumulated into
atherosclerotic plaques, and GATA3 expression in macrophages is stimulated by cholesterol crystals.
However, the function of GATA3+ macrophages in atherosclerosis is completely unknown. In Specific Aim 3,
we will use atheroma-prone mouse models in combination with bone marrow transplantation to test the
hypothesis that GATA3+ macrophage subset/s are atherogenic. The proposed research is innovative because
we will investigate the effect of GATA3+ macrophages in CVD, a heretofore-unexamined process."

 Globally there is a growing need to implement community-based services that support improvements in quality
of life of autistic people. Early autism intervention is critical because it can significantly improve both child and
family outcomes, but implementation gaps exist worldwide. These gaps are starkest in Africa, where by 2050,
iven the lack of specialists in Africa, task shifting early autism
intervention to non-specialists will be a key implementation strategy. Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral
Interventions (NDBI), are a class of early autism intervention approaches, that can be effectively delivered by
caregivers. Through a partnership between Duke University and the University of Cape Town, our team laid the
groundwork for an innovative and scalable coaching intervention for young autistic children . We systematically
adapted a caregiver coaching NDBI for the South African context in which coaching is effectively delivered by
non-specialist Early Childhood Development practitioners employed by the Education Department. In the
proposed study we will build on our foundational work by conducting a type 1 hybrid effectiveness implementation
trial of the coaching intervention, delivered by non-specialists, within an existing system of care in South Africa.
Our goal is to implement a feasible, scalable early autism intervention model in Africa by conducting research
with culturally and linguistically diverse participants in community-based settings, that is inclusive of diverse
stakeholder perspectives and incorporates task-shifting. In the proposed study, we will build on our current
relationships with families, practitioners, and policy makers by formalizing these relationships and including other
key stakeholder groups such as South African autistic self-advocates through a community-academic
partnership, a key bridging factor in the EPIS implementation framework. The proposed project has three main
objectives. First, to evaluate the real-world effectiveness of non-specialist delivered NDBI caregiver coaching for
improving patterns of caregiver-child interaction and child developmental outcomes, and assess the cost-
effectiveness of this approach. Second, to identify implementation determinants to inform scale-up. Third, to
expand African autism research capacity to enhance scalability. This project also offers a unique opportunity to
study variability in autism-related behaviors and phenomenology. We will therefore assess the degree to which
response to intervention is moderated by caregiver and dimensional child characteristics. In addition, using an
innovative digital assessment method, changes in dimensional quantitative measures of autism-related
behaviors will be examined. Finally, cross-cultural differences in dimensional autism-related behaviors will be
evaluated via comparison with existing quantitative phenotypic data gathered in U.S. studies. This study is timely
and innovative and will inform scale-up of autism early intervention in Africa. Assessing the impact of a scalable
intervention in an environment like South Africa which faces significant contextual challenges, increases the
ecological validity and relevance of findings for many regions of the world that face with similar challenges."
10877742,"Rates of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are among the highest in persons requiring maintenance
hemodialysis (MHD). Antimicrobial exposure is the main risk factor for the emergence and spread of MDRO. Up
to 30% of antimicrobials administered in out-patient dialysis facilities are not indicated. Decreasing inappropriate,
unnecessary or suboptimal antimicrobial use in dialysis facilities is therefore crucial. We recently published a
decision analytic model on the clinical and economic consequences of implementing antimicrobial stewardship
programs (ASP) in out-patient dialysis facilities nation-wide. The model predicted a 4.8% reduction in infections
caused by MDRO and Clostridium difficile; a 4.6% reduction in infection-related deaths and a 5.0% reduction in
costs. In 2017, the PI completed an AHRQ-funded study of an ASP in out-patient dialysis facilities. The program,
which focused on educational and behavioral strategies, resulted in a reduction in antimicrobial use (P=0.02).
Although successful, three barriers to even greater effective prescribing were identified. First, our initial ASP
method could not fully identify inappropriate doses, administered after the empiric doses, in a timely manner.
Thus, opportunities for improving prescribing were missed. Second, approximately 55% of doses prescribed
were from orders received from the transferring hospital upon hospital discharge. Data pertaining to the
indications for and choice of antimicrobial therapy were minimal and thereby limited the number of opportunities
to improve antimicrobial prescribing. Third, engagement from unit medical directors was minimal. Lack of
leadership support likely prevented the ASP to be more effective. With this foundation and leveraging a research
infrastructure established during our previous AHRQ grant, this proposal, entitled OPTIMUS (Optimizing
Antimicrobial Use In Maintenance Dialysis UnitS), will develop and implement an improved ASP. In addition to
the previous educational and behavioral components, specific tools and strategies to overcome the three barriers
mentioned above will be developed and implemented in this improved ASP. These tools include an antimicrobial
hospital transfer report and an evidence-based checklist for antimicrobial prescribing in the dialysis facilities. We
will enroll DaVita dialysis units and have already obtained leadership support. Our interdisciplinary team includes
investigators with expertise in ASP and implementation science, senior nephrologists with experience in quality
improvement initiatives and our CDC consultant, with expertise in MHD healthcare quality. An interrupted time
series design will be used in 8 intervention and 8 control units. Specific aims are:1] To develop and implement
an improved ASP in out-patient hemodialysis units, 2] To demonstrate the effectiveness of this ASP in reducing
antimicrobial use, and 3] To develop a dialysis setting specific-antimicrobial prescribing audit tool and
demonstrate improvement in the quality of antimicrobial prescribing patterns as a result of the ASP.
Demonstrating the efficacy of this ASP and generating tools to assist in optimizing antimicrobial prescribing will
provide an unmet and overdue need in the MHD population and will ultimately improve their health outcomes."
10877863,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aberrantly high expression of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) Malat1 is strongly associated with lung
adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression and poor patient prognosis and has been pursued as a potential
therapeutic target. However, these correlative observations do not reveal whether the aberrant expression of
Malat1 is a driver of tumorigenesis and what are the mechanisms by which Malat1 overexpression promotes
disease progression. In preliminary studies, we developed an innovative CRISPR activation (CRISPRa)
system that successfully models Malat1 overexpression in patient-derived cell lines and autochthonous murine
models of LUAD. Strikingly, we uncovered that tumor-specific overexpression of Malat1 at the time of tumor
initiation is sufficient to accelerate the progression of murine LUAD to aggressive and metastatic disease,
demonstrating that Malat1 overexpression is a driver of cancer development. We further determined that
Malat1 overexpression leads to pleiotropic effects on the tumor microenvironment through the altered
expression of cytokines and stromal factors. Based on these promising findings, our central hypothesis is that
progressive accumulation of Malat1 in LUAD drives the development of aggressive disease through the
activation of a metastasis-promoting gene expression program and the establishment of a pro-metastatic tumor
microenvironment. In Aim 1, we describe our use of advanced, temporally controlled mouse models to clarify
the stage of tumorigenesis when overexpression of Malat1 promotes tumor progression, the requirement for
sustained Malat1 overexpression, and the window of opportunity when downregulation of Malat1 may have a
therapeutic impact. Aim 2 seeks to investigate the non-cell autonomous effects of Malat1 overexpression in the
establishment of a pro-metastatic niche. We propose to perform detailed characterization of Malat1-dependent
changes in the tumor stroma at different stages of tumorigenesis as well as use genetic models to explore the
contributions of candidate secreted factors, such as inflammatory cytokines. Finally, Aim 3 outlines our plans to
elucidate the molecular mechanism by which overexpressed Malat1 alters the expression of tumor
microenvironment effectors. We propose to utilize state-of-the-art molecular biology approaches and work with
long-term collaborators, who are experts in bioinformatics and chemical biology, to determine whether Malat1
overexpression affects target genes at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, through dominant
negative or gain-of-function mechanisms, and through direct or indirect activities. In summary, this proposal
outlines a highly innovative experimental and conceptual framework for dissecting the poorly understood role
of overexpressed Malat1 as a driver in LUAD. Beyond Malat1, the broad significance of this work lies in its
potential to elucidate how aberrantly expressed lncRNAs modulate cancer development and to uncover
whether targeting aberrantly expressed lncRNAs might hold a therapeutic promise."

The World Trade Center (WTC) Health Registry, the largest post-disaster registry in U.S. history, is among the
world’s longest running as it continues to track long-term health impacts of the 9/11 disaster among a diverse
cohort of over 71,000 persons who performed 9/11-related rescue/recovery work (responders), or who lived,
worked or attended school in lower Manhattan on 9/11/2001 (survivors). The Registry’s 142 peer-review
publications to-date contribute substantially to the literature on 9/11 physical and mental health outcomes and
gaps in care and inform 9/11 healthcare policy and clinical practice. The Registry also conducts extensive
outreach to refer enrollees to the WTC Health Program (WTCHP) and provides de-identified survey data and
recruitment services for 9/11-related research by independent or collaborative external researchers. This
renewal will enable the Registry to extend its epidemiological research and surveillance 24 years post- 9/11 via
follow-up health surveys and in-depth studies, including cancer and mortality assessments and in-depth
studies with WTCHP entities to identify potential emerging health conditions. We propose 5 specific aims:
(1) Maintain the Registry as a public health resource to allow health professionals to track and investigate
possible trends in illness and recovery (i.e., maintain updated contact information for enrollees, keep them
engaged); (2) Expand knowledge about long-term health effects of 9/11 by facilitating medical, public health,
emergency preparedness or other research relevant to the WTC Health Program with emphasis on impacts to
the WTC survivor cohort (i.e., continue matches to vital records, cancer registries and hospitalization data;
extend cancer/mortality assessments 20 years post-9/11; conduct a Wave 6 survey to ascertain cohort health
status 23-24 years after 9/11; conduct qualitative research to better understand persistence of 9/11 conditions
and their mitigation; assess the contribution of 9/11 exposure and other risk factors to the course of health
conditions, functional impairment, age-related conditions, and unmet healthcare needs); (3): Conduct
community activities to respond to the physical and mental health concerns and specific healthcare needs of
enrollees and others exposed to 9/11 (i.e., disseminate Registry findings and recommendations to enrollees,
the public, and WTCHP leadership via video, social media, e-newsletters, website; provide data and other
resources to enrollees and the public; continue health promotion activities); (4): Maintain the 9/11 Treatment
Referral Program to help enrollees and others find care for 9/11-related health problems (i.e., inform enrollees
of 9/11-related services, conduct outreach to assist them in applying to the WTCHP, including those with
specific conditions or unmet care needs); and (5): Collaborate with WTCHP entities to explore surveillance
signals and treatment outcomes including 9/11 linkage with uncommon health conditions (e.g., autoimmune,
neurological disease), treatment outcomes for selected 9/11 conditions, and conducting activities to address
emerging WTCHP priorities regarding health and wellness issues.."
10878901,"Pathogenic bacteria must acquire iron from the host to cause disease. The host, in turn, interferes with
acquisition of this essential nutrient because free iron is not readily available. The details of this interplay
between the host and the pathogen competing for limiting iron have been largely devoted to understanding
the biology of extracellular pathogens or pathogens growing freely within the host cell cytosol. In contrast,
the dynamics of iron competition is poorly understood for intravacuolar pathogens. Prior to this work, few
strategies have been forwarded for how iron is transported into the pathogen replication vacuole and the
source of the intracellular store of iron accessed by these pathogens is unknown. Similarly, how the host
cell limits iron availability to these pathogens is quite limited. This application proposes to attack this
problem by taking advantage of recent data on the biology of metal acquisition by the Legionella
pneumophila MavN protein, the development of a pure system that allows reconstruction of transition metal
transport, and technological advances that allow the analysis of random mutations in any cell type. MavN is
the only known bacterial protein that is inserted into host membranes to facilitate iron access by pathogen
growing in a vacuole, making this a unique opportunity to study iron access.
The experiments described propose to identify the molecular details of how MavN transports transition
metals across membranes, and identify host components that modulate accessibility of iron to the protein.
Experiments are proposed using Double Electron-Electron Resonance, X-Ray crystallography and
cryoelectron microscopy to identify the critical atomic components of MavN that promote metal transit into
the Legionella-containing vacuole. To identify host components that modulate iron accessibility to MavN,
two CRISPR/Cas9 mutant hunts are proposed. Each of the mutant hunts takes advantage of an iron-
responsive fluorescent protein reporter harbored in L. pneumophila that allows the identification of human
cell mutants that are defective for allowing iron access to the bacterium, or which allow promiscuous access
to this nutrient. Using defined criteria to prioritize mutant candidates, the targets identified will be used to
determine if MavN accesses the host cytosolic labile iron pool, acquires iron from organelles, or directly
interfaces with a host protein to allow iron access. In the process, the details of how iron is routed from the
host into the bacterium-containing compartment will be uncovered, and host proteins that interfere with this
process will be identified. By understanding this process, it is hoped that control of metal access can be
linked to host innate immune function, with the goal of understanding how to interfere with iron acquisition
and restrict intravacuolar pathogen replication."
10878903,"Project Summary
The objective of the proposed research is to understand physiological functions of the mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the brain circadian (~24 h) clock, the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic
nucleus (SCN). To be synchronized with the external and internal environment, gene expression in the SCN
clock is regulated by an intracellular signaling network. A major gap exists in our understanding of the key
signaling events that couple extracellular and intracellular signals to regulate protein synthesis (mRNA
translation). mTOR is a master regulator of mRNA translation. It forms two functionally distinct branches, mTORC
(mTOR complex) 1 and mTORC2. Based on our published work and unpublished preliminary data, our overall
hypothesis is that mTORC1 controls mRNA translation and SCN cell synchrony, whereas mTORC2
controls circadian cytoskeleton reorganization, both of which are critical for the SCN clock function. To
test the hypothesis, activities of specific mTOR components will be manipulated by genetic and pharmacological
approaches. The circadian clock functions will be assessed at the molecular, cellular and animal behavioral
levels using a multidisciplinary approach. Aim 1 will define the functions of the mTORC1 translation effectors
S6Ks in the SCN. We hypothesize that S6Ks regulate the photic clock resetting by regulating mRNA translation.
Aim 2 will assess a role for mTORC1 in mediating photoperiodic regulation of SCN cell synchrony. We
hypothesize that mTORC1 mediates the regulation of SCN synchrony by photoperiods. Aim 3 will identify a role
for mTORC2 in the circadian clock. We hypothesize that mTORC2 regulates SCN properties by controlling
circadian cytoskeleton reorganization. The proposed work is innovative because it utilizes our latest mouse
genetic models to address conceptually novel questions regarding the role of mTOR in the brain clock. The
contributions of the proposed work are expected to be significant, because it will elucidate fundamental
mechanisms whereby mTOR regulates the function of the circadian clock. Aberrant mTOR activities in the brain
are identified in neurological and psychiatric diseases, which are often accompanied by disrupted daily rhythms
in patients. FDA-approved mTOR inhibitors can cause sleep problems. The proposed research will generate
new knowledge that is essential for a mechanistic understanding of the clinical issues regarding mTOR and
clock/sleep disruptions."
10878907,"Bladder cancer (estimated 83,730 new cases and 17,200 death in 2021) is unique in that most (70-80%) of
patients are diagnosed with early-stage, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). NMIBC is first treated by
transurethral resection (TUR) and then adjuvant transurethral therapies, such as intravesical BCG and
chemotherapy, for patients with high risk for advanced stages. However, recurrence remains a significant
problem. There has been no breakthrough in NMIBC treatment since BCG was FDA-approved for bladder cancer
treatment in 1990. Last year, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for treating BCG-unresponsive, high-risk
NMIBCs, but it is very expensive and its complete response rate is not very satisfactory. These days, the
shortage of BCG has become a problem in clinical practice. Our long-term goal is to develop a clinically
translatable NMIBC-treatment strategy to effectively and selectively kill cancer cells without collateral damage to
normal bladder tissue. Our hypothesis is that a mitochondria-localizing and singlet oxygen (SO)-activatable
prodrug is effectively activated by HAL (hexyl-5-aminolevulinate)-PDT in the mitochondria of cancer cells, thus
greatly improving therapeutic efficacy of HAL-PDT with minimal collateral damage. Recently, we proved and
advanced this novel SO-activatable prodrug concept in both intramolecular and intermolecular activation
manners. The combination of green light and intravesical administration is expected to avoid collateral damage
to normal bladder wall unlike traditional PDT. The objectives of this proposed work are 1) to develop SO-
activatable prodrugs of clinically used anticancer drugs for NMIBC and 2) to prove enhanced efficacy of this
combination treatment in both in vitro and in vivo models. An orthotopic rat model of bladder cancer will be used
to better mimic physiology of human NMIBC. Three specific aim are proposed: Aim 1) Develop mitochondria-
targeting and SO-activatable prodrugs of clinically used drugs for NMIBC, Aim 2) Determine uptake and the
combination effect using 3D cell culture and healthy bladders (rat and rabbit), and Aim 3) Determine the
anticancer effects and local side effects of the combination treatment using the orthotopic rat bladder cancer
model. This project is highly innovative in both conceptual and technical aspects. It is a novel approach to
address an important clinical problem using a highly multidisciplinary and integrative strategy. If successful, the
proposed research will provide new effective treatment strategy and prodrugs for treating NMIBC with high
likelihood of rapid clinical translation, because HAL and anticancer drugs have historically been used for NMIBC.
Due to the advances in optical and transurethral surgical technology and the unique accessibility of bladder,
there is no major technical barrier for implementing such strategy to clinical practice. We have been consulting
with practicing urological clinicians to gear our strategy towards clinical translation. Our strategy can also be
applied to post-surgical treatment of micro-metastasis of many other cancers (brain, GI malignancies, cervical
and ovarian cancers), for which HAL has been used for fluorescence diagnosis."
10879021,"Project Summary
Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is critical to the pathophysiology of inflammation through its
interaction with the chemokine receptor CD74, while also opposing the immunosuppressive effects of
glucocorticoids and catalyzing enzymatic reactions of unknown biological significance. The mechanism by which
MIF accommodates these and other biochemical functions within its compact structure is unclear, but we recently
identified a network of amino acids that link the enzymatic active site of MIF with peripheral regions of the protein,
including the proposed CD74 binding site. These residues, and likely others, allosterically regulate several
biochemical functions of MIF, including enzyme catalysis, receptor activation, and protein-protein interaction.
Preliminary data showed that multi-timescale dynamics of the MIF structure (and resulting changes to
intersubunit hydrogen bonding) contribute to its function, leading us to hypothesize that intrinsic structural
flexibility is a major driving force of the allosteric mechanism that enhances spatial-temporal control of MIF. The
design of MIF selective inhibitors with therapeutic value for inflammatory diseases would be aided by a more
detailed understanding of the biophysical underpinnings of MIF allostery. This proposal will explore how changes
to the MIF structure via mutations and pro-inflammatory solution conditions affect its allosteric crosstalk, catalytic
activity, and activation of CD74. We will complete three specific aims, beginning with atomic level
characterization of the MIF allosteric network using state-of-the-art solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy and molecular simulations. The impact of oxidative solution conditions on the MIF structure and
allosteric network will then be assessed with solution NMR and quantitative proteomics. We will mimic
inflammatory environments to determine how the MIF structure is modified, and if those modifications result in
downstream functional differences. Lastly, we will apply our integrated NMR-MD approach to study the first MIF
mutant ever associated with human disease, a Y99C variant found in children with juvenile arthritis. This mutation
occurs directly at the allosteric site we identified in earlier publications. Each aim will assess the resulting
biological outcomes with measurements of active site chemical properties, catalytic function (in vitro) and CD74
activation (in vivo) function. The project will dissect allosteric pathways through the analysis of differential
motions probed by NMR spin relaxation, molecular simulations, and network analysis, mapping the specific
amino acids and interactions responsible for transmitting structural or dynamic changes between the allosteric,
enzymatic, and CD74 receptor sites. The outcomes of the work can broadly inform the promiscuous mechanisms
of cytokines, the role of allostery in the extended MIF superfamily, and focus NMR-guided computational screens
of molecular libraries against the MIF allosteric pathway, relevant to asthma, respiratory distress, and cancer
therapies."
10879022,"PMCA2 is a calcium pump expressed in the apical membrane of mammary epithelial cells (MECs) during
lactation. It is responsible for transporting 60-70% of milk calcium. After weaning, milk stasis rapidly decreases
PMCA2 expression, causing a sustained increase in intracellular calcium. Preliminary data suggest that this
rise in intracellular calcium may serve as the biochemical signal that couples milk stasis to activation of
lysosome biogenesis, STAT3 phosphorylation and lysosome-dependent cell death (LDCD). In the last cycle of
this grant, we documented that PMCA2 is also re-expressed in breast cancers and correlates with
ErbB2/HER2 levels and increased mortality. We have now defined interactions between PMCA2, NHERF1,
Ezrin, HSP90 and ErbB2 that are required for membrane retention of ErbB2 and its downstream biochemical
signaling. Inhibition of PMCA2 increases intracellular calcium and causes a PKCa-dependent disassembly of
this multiprotein complex as well as the ubiquitinylation, internalization and degradation of ErbB2. In normal
MECs, NHERF1, ezrin and PMCA2 interact within the apical plasma membrane while ErbB2 interacts with a
different scaffolding protein called Erbin, at the basolateral membrane. Preliminary data show that, in DCIS
lesions and in invasive breast cancer cells, PMCA2, Ezrin and NHERF1 intermix with Erbin and ErbB2
throughout the plasma membrane and that this complex is greatly upregulated in trastuzumab-resistant breast
cancer cells. The premise/hypothesis of this grant application is three-fold: 1) that milk stasis rapidly decreases
PMCA2 expression causing sustained increases in intracellular calcium, which, in turn, trigger LDCD; 2) that
loss of cell polarity enables novel interactions between the apical, PMCA2-NHERF1-Ezrin complex and the
basolateral, Erbin-ErbB2 complex that accelerate ErbB2-mediated transformation; and 3) that upregulation of
interactions between PMCA2 and ErbB2 contribute to the development of trastuzumab resistance. We
propose 3 specific aims. Aim 1 will examine the mechanisms whereby increased intracellular calcium
concentrations activate lysosome biogenesis, STAT3 and LDCD. Aim 2 will test whether alterations in PMCA2
localization accelerate malignant transformation by ErbB2/HER2. Aim 3 will test whether further upregulation
of interactions between PMCA2, NHERF1, Ezrin, Erbin, HSP90 and ErbB2 contributes to trastuzumab
resistance. These experiments will provide important new knowledge of the mechanisms by which milk stasis
triggers involution. They will contribute important insight into the early steps of transformation of MECs by
ErbB2. They will validate novel cancer cell-specific drug targets for ErbB2/HER2-positive tumors and will test
the potential therapeutic value of disrupting these interactions in trastuzumab-resistant cancers."

projects. In its new configuration as an R24 resource, it will focus on user services and collaborations utilizing
the already established extensive and unique technologies that have already been developed. We have a well-
established administration and operations scheme for this objective. Through outreach efforts we plan to
significantly expand the user base both nationally and internationally. We will be providing extensive educational
and training capabilities for the expanded user base. This will include a series of workshops, on-line resources,
in house training and visits to other labs. The outreach will include tutorial papers in key journals, virtual
meetings with the International ESR Society, video lectures on YouTube, and advertisements in leading Journals
and Newsletters. The ESR resources we provide are in many ways unique in the world. In addition to our
commercial spectrometers for cw and pulse ESR covering the frequency range of 9 to 35 GHz, we have extensive
and unique custom-home built spectrometers covering the range of frequencies 9 to 240 GHz. These
spectrometers are dedicated to a full range of ESR methods utilized by the biomedical community, especially
including techniques for conducting pulse dipolar ESR (PDS), which provides distances between labeled protein
and RNA sites from which protein tertiary structure may be inferred. It is applicable to protein complexes in
their natural states. ACERT has developed methods that both significantly increase the sensitivity to low sub-
micromolar protein concentrations and very small samples, and they greatly increase the throughput, enabling
a greater rate of processing of the many samples studied in PDS. While PDS supplies protein structures, the
additional techniques of multi-frequency ESR and pulsed 2D-ESR at ambient temperatures supply details of
protein dynamics, important in learning about structure/function; this includes the unique ability to study in
real time nanosecond to microsecond dynamics, which will address such issues as domain motions in proteins.
Our innovative software enables the fitting of the complex 1- and 2-D spectra to extract the details of the complex
protein motions, and our recent developments of signal processing software have led to unique packages for
greatly increasing the signal-to-noise of weak ESR signals while providing great fidelity, as well as accurately
transforming the results of PDS experiments into (complex) distance distributions. These software methods will
also enhance the throughput of the Resource."

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are associated with a
devastating but poorly understood thromboinflammatory state. Standard anticoagulation strategies result in
significant bleeding risk, yet are inadequate as life-threatening thromboses remain common. There are no
effective strategies to mitigate the inflammatory storm initiated within minutes of starting mechanical circulatory
support. Data from the PIs lab suggests that factor XII (FXII) promotes both thrombosis and inflammatory
mediated organ damage during ECMO. There is significant interest in FXII as a target in mechanical circulation,
but the mechanisms coupling FXII to mechanical circulation associated thromboinflammation are under-
studied. FXII is a multifunctional protease that bridges the hemostatic and inflammatory systems. FXII activates
factor XI (FXI), leading to thrombin generation. The importance of FXII-mediated FXI activation in the setting
of mechanical circulation has never been evaluated. Data from the PIs lab suggests mechanical circulation
components can promote thrombin-mediated FXI activation, significantly limiting the relevance of FXII in some
contexts. Moreover, targeting FXII appears inadequate during CPB with open heart operations where
sternotomy and cardiac manipulation increase circulating tissue factor levels. FXII also activates prekallikrein
(PKK) to the active protease kallikrein (Kal). Kal is linked to multiple inflammatory pathways, including
complement activation and bradykinin generation. Kal has also been proposed to promote thrombosis
independently of FXI. FXII-mediated PKK activation has been proposed to drive inflammatory events during
ECMO, but there are no studies directly evaluating the role of PKK in mechanical circulation associated
thromboinflammation. Data from the PIs lab suggests that targeting PKK significantly limits thrombosis and
organ damage in ECMO. The proposed studies will use novel gene-targeted rats developed specifically for this
proposal, and cutting-edge pharmacological agents to test the following hypotheses: 1) FXII promotes ECMO
and CPB related thromboinflammatory pathologies by independent mechanisms related to activation of FXI
and PKK. 2) FXI is a superior antithrombotic target in mechanical circulation contexts with relatively high
circulating TF levels, such as exist during CPB. 3) FXII-mediated PKK activation promotes key inflammatory
events that lead to organ damage during ECMO/CPB, as well as thromboembolic complications. 4) Combined
strategies targeting FXI and FXII, or FXI and PKK, provide better protection from thrombosis and inflammatory
organ damage than targeting one of these factors alone, without incurring a major bleeding risk. The proposed
studies will provide needed insights into the mechanisms coupling FXII to mechanical circulation associated
thromboinflammatory pathologies. The knowledge gained will critically inform future clinical trials of available
and emerging agents targeting FXII and FXI. The proposed studies are also likely to identify additional novel
targets (e.g., PKK) to limit thromboinflammatory driven morbidity in mechanical circulation."

Cardiac arrest (CA) has an estimated annual incidence of 250-350,000 out-of-hospital and 250-750,000 in-
hospital events in the U.S., with survival rates as low as 5% and 20% respectively. Anoxic brain injury remains
a major health burden for those who survive to hospital discharge. These outcomes reflect a two-step injury
process including a) whole body anoxia/isquemia and b) secondary reperfusion and inflammation injury
following return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). As secondary injuries are determined by the magnitude of
ischemia during CA, the ability to ameliorate ischemia by improving resuscitation quality and increasing oxygen
delivery in real-time is vital to reducing ischemic and subsequent secondary injuries. Current resuscitation
methods only provide 25-30% of cardiac output and are limit by the inability of clinicians to deliver
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) effectively up to 50% of the time. In response, the American Heart
Association (AHA) has recommended two options of feedback to improve CPR quality: i) physiological or ii)
non-physiological systems. Through a multi-site study, we have studied end tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2)
monitoring, and pioneered non-invasive brain monitoring of regional cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) using near
infra-red spectroscopy as physiological feedback during CPR and demonstrated that they reflect two
complementary aspects of CPR: i) circulation quality (ETCO2) and ii) brain/vital organ perfusion (rSO2). We
have also shown that rSO2 exhibits a dose response relationship with survival and favorable neurological
outcomes. In spite of these data and the AHA recommendations, the physiological target and the optimal
feedback system during CPR to predict CA survival without neurological impairment remains unknown. In the
present study, we propose to analyze data and blood samples collected from an ongoing 20 site observational
study (AWAreness during Resuscitation [AWARE II]) of in-hospital cardiac arrests (IHCAs) to identify a brain
resuscitation “gold standard,” and then test the hypothesis that physiological feedback guided CPR using rSO2
or ETCO2 or a combination will perform better than non-physiological feedback CPR in predicting CA survival
and neurological status through attenuation of brain injury and inflammation. The current application proposes
three aims: For Aim 1, using prospective data from 500 IHCAs, we propose to identify the optimal physiological
resuscitation target (rSO2 and/or ETCO2) in predicting CA survival and neurological status. For Aim 2, serum
collected during CPR and in the post-CA period will be analyzed to measure biomarkers of brain injury and
inflammation to determine the association between rSO2 and ETCO2 levels during CPR and markers of
secondary injury. Having determined the optimal physiological target, Aim 3 will randomize 150 subjects to
compare the impact of real-time physiological feedback CPR with non-physiological feedback CPR on ROSC,
survival and neurological outcomes in a pilot randomized control trial."

Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is one of the most intractable human cancers to cure. It is an aggressive tumor
characterized by rapid growth, metastatic progression, and initial response followed by almost invariable
resistance to therapy. Studies to date have not resolved the extent that diverse genetic and epigenetic programs
drive SCLC and contribute to its lethality. We combined one of the largest and most diverse inventories of
patient-derived xenograft models of SCLC globally with an ex vivo culture system that maintains
transcriptional fidelity with matched primary SCLC tumor to identify distinct and dynamic phenotypic states that
differ in functional attributes within individual tumors. We show that human SCLC tumors display distinctive
equilibria in the proportion of cells in various phenotypic (not merely transcriptional) states. We also show that
SCLC states are highly regulated by multivalent cellular plasticity and we measure the kinetics of this plasticity
at the single cell level. Importantly, standard of care chemotherapies in this disease preferentially kill specific
cancer cell states. In this proposal, we posit that understanding the facets of SCLC's intratumoral heterogeneity
will: 1) contribute to our understanding of a poorly characterized aspect of cancer heterogeneity; 2) reveal how
stochasticity and/or ecological cues in single-cell behaviors promote phenotypic equilibrium in cancer
populations; 3) provide insight into the biological and clinical behavior of SCLC; and 4) advance desperately
needed new therapeutic strategies of epigenetic reprogramming in this recalcitrant disease. Our team of
investigators have content expertise in several computational, experimental, and translational methods pertinent
to this proposal including human-derived in vivo and ex vivo model systems, single-cell RNA sequencing, bulk
genetic and expression analysis, single cell fluorescence tracking, and mathematical and statistical modeling.
Our integrative approach is poised to formulate and validate a unified model of cellular states and program
diversity in SCLC. If successful, the characterization of malignant cell ontogenic programs (SA1), their plasticity
(SA2), and the advancement of new therapies designed to combat plasticity by epigenetic reprogramming (SA3)
will advance a unique scientific canvas for the study of this highly lethal disease."

Tumor progression, resistance to therapy, and metastasis are closely related to the characteristics of the tumor cell ecosystem. Multiplexed antibody-based cytometry is the standard method for phenotypic characterization of tissue composition, pathogenesis, and immune infiltration with single-cell (and sometimes spatial) resolution. The identification of cell populations in these data is facilitated by algorithms that cluster cells according to their antigenic profile, as well as by predefined sets of markers that have historically evolved by trial and error. However, the annotation of these data is a manual, subjective, and laborious process that hinders the reproducibility and accuracy of the results. The design of antibody panels that include specific markers for all cell types and states present in a tissue is usually unfeasible, and the efficiency of commonly used markers is unknown. Consequently, cell clusters can differ little in their antigenic profile or contain a mixture of cell types. To overcome these limitations, this project will develop informatics technologies that leverage existing single-cell transcriptomic atlases to assist and automate the design and analyses of multiplexed antibody-based cytometry experiments. Our working hypothesis is that the vast amount of available single-cell transcriptomic data of tissues can inform the design, annotation, and analysis of cytometry experiments. We will develop and evaluate informatics technologies for establishing reference antigenic profiles and optimal antibody panels based on single-cell proteotranscriptomic data (Aim 1 ), and for automating the identification, annotation, and gating of cell populations in multiplexed antibody-based cytometry experiments (Aim 2). These new computational methods will enable any researcher to 1) automatically identify and annotate cell populations in a cytometry dataset based on reference single-cell data hosted in a repository, 2) define optimal gates for sorting cell populations, 3) transfer gates across experiments, 4) design optimal antibody panels for a given tissue or set of cell populations, and 5) infer the gene expression profile of cells. We will implement these methods in an open-source software and online portal for the transcriptome-guided annotation and analysis of cytometry data of tumors, and will closely work with end-users through several planned workshops and tutorials to maximize the utility and outreach of this platform (Aim 3). We will test our platform on leukemic and pancreatic cancer tissues profiled with spectral flow cytometry and multiplexed quantitative immunohistochemistry. The informatics technologies developed in this project will transform cancer research by boosting the phenotypic resolution, accuracy, and reproducibility of multiplexed antibody-based cytometry analyses of tumor tissues."
10887652,"Speech understanding is a key function of human audition with important roles in learning, professional, and
social functions. Ageing is associated with increased difficulties with speech recognition, particularly in noisy
backgrounds, although traditional clinical tests frequently fail to account for subjective speech perception
difficulties. A growing body of work has identified increased compensatory use of cognitive resources, collectively
known as listening effort (LE), as a key change within the ageing and hearing-impaired populations.
Consequently, accurate measures of LE may serve as critical objective diagnostic tools for quantifying subjective
speech perception deficits. While multiple methods for quantifying LE have been proposed, little is known about
whether these measures reflect usage of the same underlying cognitive processes, particularly in the context of
continuous speech in the presence of other meaningful speech maskers. Moreover, little is known about whether
changes in LE affect processing of lower- and higher-level features (e.g., acoustic envelope vs. lexical surprisal)
throughout the auditory cortical hierarchy. This proposal will address these important gaps in our knowledge. In
Aim 1, we will manipulate LE demands via changes in signal-to-noise ratio or spatial cues in a speech recognition
task utilizing isolated sentences masked by competing speech, while measuring three commonly used measures
of LE (self-report, pupil size, and neural measure of alpha band power). We will then correlate these measures
with one another to determine whether they are similarly modulated by intelligibility manipulations, indicating
common underlying cognitive processes. In Aim 2, we will address two key questions. First, we will test whether
the LE measures used in Aim 1 exhibit similar relationships with one another in the context of more naturalistic,
continuous speech, more closely mimicking scenarios in which speech perception difficulties are commonly
encountered. Second, we will use advanced model-based analyses to decompose speech-evoked
electroencephalographic activity into responses to lower- and higher-level features of both attended and ignored
speech and assess how LE manipulations modulate these representations. Doing so, we will gain novel insights
into the interaction between higher-order cognitive processes and the language processing pathways in the
cortex, potentially revealing new neural signatures of LE. Finally, to gain deeper understanding of aging effects
on LE and speech processing, we will assess how each Aim’s key measures change as a function of age. This
work will provide foundation for future studies aimed at a more detailed characterization of the effects of different
cognitive processes involved in LE on cortical processing of attended and ignored speech, with potential
applications in diagnostics of speech processing deficits, particularly in scenarios where standard clinical tests
fail to detect an impairment, and in testing speech-perception benefits from new algorithms used in hearing-
assisting devices."
10886164,"Implementation of a Comprehensive Survivorship Care Intervention Across FQHC-Based Primary Care Practices
PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer survivorship challenges adversely contribute to cancer burden, morbidity and mortality, and are
exacerbated by multiple health care and contextual barriers such as oncology provider shortages, and limited
comprehensive survivorship care services in primary care (PC). There is a critical need to integrate
comprehensive survivorship care (i.e., care coordination, prevention, surveillance and intervention) in PC
settings given a growing demand for acute cancer care by oncologists which has shifted the need to deliver
essential survivorship care in PC clinics. The rising shift towards follow-up care in PC requires that
survivorship care in those settings effectively implement and promote comprehensive survivorship care (CSC):
including adherence to best practice guidelines, care coordination and management of physical, psychosocial
and practical needs, attention to lifestyle behaviors and self-management, and optimal surveillance for new
primary cancers and/or recurrences. However, evidence-based interventions that implement these care
processes to provide risk stratified optimal care for survivors and address unmet needs of this growing population
in PC are critically lacking, and particularly in community safety net PC clinics with survivors primarily from
racial/ethnic minority and other communities with limited financial resources. Guided by the EPIS implementation
and RE-AIM evaluation frameworks, we propose a Type II effectiveness-implementation hybrid study with a
cluster randomized clinical trial to implement PC clinician training, and evaluate survivorship standard of care
(SOC; e.g., survivorship care plans), relative to a comprehensive survivorship care (CSC+SOC) intervention, on:
(a) unmet needs, health-related quality of life, lifestyle behaviors (primary outcomes), and (b) screening, health
care utilization and care quality (secondary outcomes) across 14 community clinics part of the Health Choice
Network (HCN) Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) in South Florida that provide PC to primarily
racially/ethnically diverse and low SES survivors. We will recruit 100 PC clinicians, 20 clinic and HCN leaders,
and 930 adult survivors. Our aims are: (Aim 1) Train clinicians in the SOC and CSC conditions to establish the
components of the experimental conditions and finalize the necessary infrastructure in the HCN clinics; (Aim 2)
Conduct a cluster randomized trial (3 FQHC systems with 14 clinics) that will evaluate the effectiveness of
SOC vs. CSC conditions on survivors’ unmet needs, HRQoL, lifestyle health and health care utilization and
satisfaction; and (Aim 3) Evaluate implementation and sustainability of CSC for future dissemination by
assessing determinants of successful implementation. The research team has expertise across critical areas
targeted in this U01 (e.g., psychosocial and medical oncology, primary care, health services research, e/mHealth,
EMR-integrated assessment and intervention, minority health). The 14 FQHCs clinics served over 4,300, older
(80% >50 yrs. old) survivors from diverse communities (e.g., 58% Hispanic, 23% Black; 46% Spanish speakers)
with limited financial resources (54% <$15K annual household income) in the past five years."
10886295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Predicting the outcome of a treatment given the pre-operative patient status, i.e., individualized treatment effect
(ITE) inference, is of great clinical importance for precise treatment planning. For example, the ITE w.r.t. survival
time estimation of glioblastoma (GBM) patients undergoing different treatments enables assessing these possible
multi-treatments by answering the question: ”would this patient have lived longer (and by how much), had an
alternative treatment been applied?” Improving beyond subjective experience-driven therapy, the widespread
accumulation of big medical data offers unprecedented opportunities for the data-driven deep learning (DL)
algorithms to learn the underlying causal relations between multimodal depict patient imaging and clinical data,
multi-treatments, and corresponding ITE. The practical ITE prediction requires a DL framework, which is largely
unavailable at present. The current methods have limitations, including only utilizing the partial and incomplete
status depiction, not applicable to multi-treatment on the outcome, and neglecting the ordinal ITE labels. In addition,
the lack of reliability information and interpretability in the conventional DL model also hinders its large-scale
clinical implementation. We propose to use our previous successful DL model to take both multimodal status and
multi-treatments for accurate ITE inference for both factual and counterfactual cases with either continuous or
ordinal labels. We will further establish a deep self-training scheme for reliable and interpretable ITE inference with
quantified uncertainty and visualized DL-focused pathology region. The overall goal of this project is to develop an
accurate, reliable, and interpretable pipeline for ITE inference by leveraging our advanced DL technique, which
can be widely generalizable. This concept could significantly advance individualized treatment planning. The
overall hypothesis is that the proposed solution can offer a unique opportunity to characterize causal relations
among multimodal status depictions, multi-treatments, and corresponding ITEs with the novel DL model, which
is not provided by current direct models. In addition, enabling the reliability quantification and interpretation of
the underlying patterns of DL decisions could open a new window for ITE outcome utilization and treatment-
specific pathology patterns investigation, thus leading to a multitude of new applications. The specific aims of this
exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a multimodal multi-treatment DL framework for accurate ITE inference, (2)
to establish a deep self-training scheme for reliable and interpretable ITE inference with calibrated uncertainty and
visualized 4D (3D+modal) gradient activation. We will apply the proposed DL-based ITE inference framework to
the clinical GBM survival dataset with different resections and test it based on various figure-of-merits. Successful
completion of the project will provide a clinically applicable DL technique for better assessment and prediction of
outcomes with individualized treatment. Using this overall strategy, which is only just now beginning to be explored,
DL will play a major role in advising the best interventions."

 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causes COVID-19 fatalities and is linked to uncontrolled
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).
Blockade of IL-1/IL-6 receptor signaling has shown success in treating severe COVID-19, but the molecular cues
initiating excessive production of these cytokines remains unclear. A major source of IL-1 is the inflammasome,
a supramolecular protein complex formed in response to two innate immune stimuli that executes IL-1β release.
Meta-analysis of patient single-cell RNA sequencing data reveals exacerbated expression of IL1B and
inflammasome-related genes in severe, but not mild, COVID-19. Co-culture of primary human airway epithelia
(HAE) and primary human leukocytes during SARS-CoV-2 infection promotes IL-1β release, while infection in
either cell type alone does not. These conditions also promote IL-6 release in an IL-1-dependent manner,
highlighting how inflammasome activation and cell-cell communication amplify this inflammatory response.
Furthermore, infected HAE undergo lytic cell death and secrete inflammasome-activating damage-associated
molecular patterns (DAMPs). Therefore, the scientific goal of this proposal is to understand how SARS-CoV-2
infection promotes pathologic inflammasome responses with the central hypothesis that damage from dying,
infected airway epithelial cells potentiate detrimental IL-1β release. Aim 1 will determine which inflammasome(s)
mediate harmful IL-1β responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and identify the tissue(s) from which this
response is derived. Aim 2 will define the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2-mediated cell death in airway epithelial
cells and its relationship with inflammasome-mediated cell death in myeloid cells using an established primary
human co-culture system. Aim 3 will identify DAMPs released by infected primary human airway epithelial cells
that stimulate inflammasome response via an unbiased multi-omics approach. These studies will define how
damage caused by viral infection propagates inflammation and its role in disease, opening avenues for
therapeutic targeting and identifying biomarkers related to pathologic inflammation in COVID-19.
 My goal is to become a tenured faculty member at a major research university with a research program
studying fatal and emerging viral pathogens. My group will focus its efforts on understanding the innate immune
response to viruses that regularly threaten human health and pinpoint pattern recognition receptor (PRR) ligands
that lead to detrimental patient outcomes. Using a combined approach of primary human cell culture models,
organismal murine models, and mechanistic molecular biology, I will identify readily translatable molecular
targets to treat human viral diseases. Herein, I outline both a scientific vision and a plan acquire new skills
through collaboration with local faculty, the support of my community and my advisory committee, and formal
coursework to enhance my abilities further, creating a framework for my success as an independent investigator."
10886297,"Project Summary
Caregivers in emerging and young adulthood account for nearly half of all caregivers in the United States;
however, they are significantly underrepresented in cancer caregiving scholarship. Little is known about their
unique psychosocial needs, and there is a dearth of cancer caregiving resources to support them. Emerging
and young adult caregivers (EYACs, ages 18-35) are a particularly vulnerable caregiving population. They
experience higher rates of psychological distress than their older counterparts, as well as lasting impacts to
their developmental trajectory as a result of their caregiving experience. Caregiving at this age is particularly
challenging when an EYAC must provide care to a parent with cancer, as they must undergo a distressing
relational shift = that creates psychological and communication challenges unique to this patient-caregiver
dyad. Diagnosed parents are known to withhold information about their cancer from their adult children, which
creates further difficulties for EYACs in communicating and coping with their parents. Open family
communication during cancer has been linked to better social, psychological, and physical health outcomes for
both caregivers and patients. Thus, there is a significant need for a communication skills intervention directed
at EYACs of their parents with cancer to help them navigate the interpersonal challenges associated with their
caregiving role that can lead to distress. The goal of this project is to identify the complex communication
needs unique to this age group and adapt an existing caregiver communication skills training intervention
(Healthy Communication Practice, HCP) to meet their age-specific communication needs. The K99 phase of
this project will include two aims: 1) identify EYACs’ unmet communication skill needs via online survey, and 2)
use the survey findings to adapt the intervention materials and pre-test them in EYAC focus groups. The R00
phase of the project will pilot test the new EYAC-tailored intervention for feasibility and acceptability. The
objective of this application will not only create the first communication support intervention specifically
designed for EYACs, but it will also equip Dr. Kastrinos with the necessary skills and training to complete the
proposed research and transition to research independence. She will advance her training in four key areas: 1)
psychosocial intervention development and adaption in cancer caregiving, 2) advanced mixed-method and
quantitative design and analysis, 3) designing and conducting RCTs, and 4) professional skills development.
She will complete both her training and the proposed research with the full support of her mentors (Drs. Allison
Applebaum, Smita Banerjee, Yuelin Li), her collaborators (Drs. Carma L. Bylund and Carla L. Fishers) who are
the creators of HCP, and her advisory board (Drs. Kathryn Greene and Youngmee Kim). At the end of her R00
phase, Dr. Kastrinos will submit an R01 application to test the efficacy of the new intervention in a fully
powered randomized controlled trial. This K99/R00 plan will enable Dr. Kastrinos to achieve her goal of filling a
critical research and resource gap for EYACs and launch a research program addressing their needs."

Proline is a multifunctional imino acid with myriad uses in the cell. Aside from direct incorporation into protein,
proline can be metabolized via a process known as the proline cycle. Here, proline is oxidized by proline
oxidase (PRODH) to form D1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C). PRODH is a FAD+ dependent enzyme that
donates electrons to complex II of the mitorchondrial electron transport chain thus coupling proline oxidation to
ATP synthesis. P5C is converted back into proline by the NADH dependent enzyme pyrroline-5-carboxylate
reductase (PYCR) to provide reducing power for glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathways. It is
unknown how osteoblasts obtain proline, how proline uptake is regulated, or if and when the proline cycle is
required during differentiation. Osteoblasts express a diverse array of membrane-tethered amino acid
transporters to facilitate proline uptake. We have identified the system A neutral amino acid transporter
SNAT2 (encoded by Slc38a2) as the most highly expressed putative proline transporter in osteoblasts. Our
preliminary data indicates WNT stimulates proline uptake through SNAT2 that is necessary for osteoblast
differentiation in vitro. Moreover, mice homozygous for a null allele of Slc38a2 (Slc38a2-/-) have defects in
endochondral ossification. In this proposal, we will 1) establish the necessity of proline uptake through
Slc38a2/SNAT2 to regulate osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vivo, 2) determine how SNAT2
activity is regulated by WNT signaling and 3) elucidate the necessity of proline metabolism via the proline cycle
in differentiating osteoblasts. Our findings will have broad implications in bone development, maintenance of
bone mass, skeletal repair and regeneration."
10889117,"Ovarian endometriomas are deep endometriosis lesions on the ovary. Endometriomas are a unique form of
endometriosis in that they do not respond to hormonal therapy and carry the highest risk of developing clear
cell ovarian cancer. There is an urgent need to determine the unique pathogenesis of endometriomas to
improve the lives of women. As an alternative to retrograde menstruation, the induction theory of endometriosis
posits that a substance induces an adult cell to transdifferentiate into endometriosis, although the inductive
substances or the cells which transdifferentiate into endometriosis have yet to be identified. AKA mice
(Arid1aflox/flox; Krasflox-stop-flox-G12D; Amhr2Cre) spontaneously and reproducibly develop large, cystic
endometriomas that recapitulate human endometriomas at the histologic and molecular level. As the genetic
recombination lies in the granulosa cells of the ovary, AKA endometriomas do not develop by retrograde
menstruation. The AKA mouse model allows for the cellular and molecular interrogation of the paradigm-
shifting induction theory of endometriosis using a rigorously reproducible and easily manipulatable
model. Transcriptomic analysis of AKA endometriomas revealed enrichment in cellular senescence
genes. Cellular senescence is defined as a permanent cell cycle arrest. Senescent cells exhibit a senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and secrete high levels of pro-inflammatory molecules, similar
to those found in the pelvic cavity of women with endometriosis. These results suggest that senescent cells in
the AKA ovary secrete factors and induce endometriosis. As for the cells induced, granulosa cells exhibit the
ability to transdifferentiate, a developmental process by which fully differentiated cells change into different fully
differentiated cells. The role of senescence in endometriomas is conceptually novel, and the ability of
granulosa cells to transdifferentiate into endometriosis through senescence signaling is a new
paradigm. The central hypothesis is that the senescent microenvironment, mediated by Arid1a loss and
oncogenic Kras, is critical for developing endometriomas through induction and transdifferentiation of
granulosa cells. The objective of Aim 1 is to characterize the unique transcriptomic profile of the senescent
cells and the endometriotic microenvironment using spatial transcriptomics. The objectives of Aim
2 are to identify the genetic changes (i.e., Kras G12D) required for senescence in granulosa
cells, validate the expression of the endometriosis SASP (from SA 1), and establish SASP-mediated
endometriosis transdifferentiation using primary murine granulosa cell cultures and a soluble Cre
recombinase. The objectives of Aim 3 are to determine if senescence is essential for endometriosis
and determine whether senotherapies restore ovarian function, fertility, and reduce endometrioma
development and progression. Targeting senescence through senotherapies is critical to developing non-
hormonal therapies, an urgent unmet need for endometriosis."

Helicobacter pylori is the strongest risk factor for gastric cancer and interactions between this chronic pathogen
and innate immune cells dysregulate signaling pathways that influence oncogenesis. One H. pylori oncogenic
determinant is the cag type IV secretion system (TFSS) which translocates pro-inflammatory effectors, such as
CagA, into epithelial cells. In studies supported by R01 DK 58587, we demonstrated for the first time that the
cag TFSS can also translocate microbial DNA, which activates TLR9. In addition to inducing inflammation,
however, activation of certain host pattern-recognition receptors can suppress inflammatory responses,
conferring tolerance to chronic pathogens. In the last funding period, we used a genetic deficiency model to
demonstrate that TLR9 suppresses the inflammatory response to H. pylori. These data coalesce with our
recent efforts to more broadly define consequences of microbial DNA translocation, and exciting data
from our laboratory now demonstrate that H. pylori can suppress activation of the DNA sensor/adaptor
STING. Chronic pathogens such as oncogenic DNA viruses utilize multiple mechanisms to abrogate STING
signaling and in other models of inflammation-induced disease with pre-malignant potential (e.g., chronic
pancreatitis), inhibition of STING worsens disease via promoting Th17 polarization. Pertinent to this model,
our provocative new data using mouse, gerbil, and human samples indicate that 1) STING signaling is
absent in H. pylori-infected gastric tissue within the context of increased expression of the Th17 cytokine IL-
17A, a key driver in cancer initiation and progression, 2) genetic deficiency of IL-17A significantly reduces the
severity of H. pylori-induced inflammation, and 3) H. pylori up-regulates Th17 differentiation and stabilization
factors, but not STING targets in gastroid:macrophage co-culture systems. We have also identified a focused
subset of H. pylori proteins that harbor homology to viral effectors that inhibit STING signaling. Finally, we have
gastric tissue from a unique longitudinal cohort in Colombia from persons who either progressed to irreversible
premalignant gastric lesions or remained stable, which will provide critical clinical validation of our mechanistic
studies. Our hypothesis is that active suppression of STING signaling contributes to the augmentation
in carcinogenic risk conferred by H. pylori by promoting persistence and deploying immune responses
(Th17) with carcinogenic potential. We will test this hypothesis via the following Aims:
1. Identify, define, and validate microbial effectors that regulate STING suppression by H. pylori
2. Define mechanisms through which STING suppression promotes H. pylori-induced injury
3. Perform targeted interventions to activate STING within the context of H. pylori infection"

Clinical time-of-flight positron emission tomography (TOF-PET) systems capable of excellent coincidence time
resolution (CTR) promise to drastically enhance effective 511 keV photon sensitivity. The ability to more precisely
localize annihilation origins along system response lines constrains event data, providing improved signal-to-
noise ratio (SNR) and reconstructed image quality by associating 511 keV photons more closely to their true
origin. This SNR enhancement increases as CTR is improved, and a major goal of ongoing PET instrumentation
research and development is to push system CTR ≤100 ps full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM). At this level of
performance, events are constrained ≤1.5 cm, providing more than a five-fold increase in SNR relative to a
system with no TOF capability. Advanced systems capable of ≤100 ps FWHM CTR would more than double or
quadruple the effective 511 keV system sensitivity, in comparison to state-of-the-art, clinical TOF-PET systems
(250-400 ps FWHM CTR). Thus, advancing CTR is also a pathway for greatly improved system sensitivity without
increasing detection volume and associated costs. This level of timing performance can be achieved with state-
of-the-art (SoA) electronic readout for silicon photomultiplier (SiPM)-based scintillation detectors in single pixel,
bench top coincidence measurements. Readout capable of demonstrating experimental limits in achievable CTR
leverage low noise, high frequency signal processing to facilitate a single photon time response that is near the
limit of the SiPMs architecture. This readout strategy can optimally exploit fast luminescence and prompt optical
photon populations, and promising measurements show detector concepts employing this readout can greatly
advance TOF-PET detector CTR, relative to SoA in clinical systems. However, the technique employs power
hungry components which make the electronics chain impractical for channel-dense TOF-PET detectors and
systems. If compact, tractable readout topologies that achieve this performance can be created, they offer a
platform for the development and translation of novel detector concepts to push system CTR ≤100 ps. We
propose to design and experimentally evaluate an analog, multichannel application specific integrated circuit
(ASIC) that implements SoA front end signal processing and time pickoff methods into a compact form factor,
capable of bringing SoA CTR demonstrated for new PET detector concepts into systems. Thus, when coupled
with existing high resolution, multichannel time-to-digital converters (TDCs), this new development thereby offers
a direct pathway to realize greatly advanced CTR in large scale, clinical PET imagers."
10889689,"Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of severe vision loss. Early
detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent
irreversible vision loss from advanced AMD stages such as geographic atrophy (GA). Patients at higher risk of
progression to GA would benefit from more frequent follow up visits, low vision referrals, and administration of
therapeutic interventions. Deep learning (DL) techniques have recently been applied to diagnose, classify, and
understand the progression trends of GA. However, a major limitation of DL is the need for large amounts of well
curated datasets from a diverse sub-population for robust diagnostic or prognostic performance. Due to the
overfitting on training data, the model tends to perform badly on external data (less generalizability of the model).
Moreover, efforts towards large public centralized datasets for DL research are hindered by significant barriers
to data sharing, privacy concerns, costs of image de-identification, and controls over how data would be used.
In this project, we aim to demonstrate the utility of novel federated DL approaches, which enable gaining insights
collaboratively, e.g., in the form of a consensus model, without moving patient data beyond the firewalls of the
institutions in which they reside. This novel paradigm of DL model training focuses on distributing the training of
DL models across institutions instead of sharing patient data and only the model parameters are shared with a
central server. We specifically seek to build robust risk models for predicting the occurrence and growth of GA.
Four data cohorts from the Stanford University, University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), Wake Forest University
(Wake Forest), and National Taiwan University (NTU) will be used to test the hypothesis that the prognostic
accuracy of the GA risk models using federated approach is more robust than models built on single institutional
datasets. Our first aim is to establish a federated learning (FL) framework for GA prediction utilizing longitudinal
multi-modal imaging and patient meta-data from four independent institutions (training and independent testing
dataset from Stanford, UIC, Wake Forest, and NTU). Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate
a robust and secure FL framework for GA risk model training within the multi-institutional environment. The
second aim is to integrate a novel adversarial domain alignment (ADA) technique into the FL framework to tackle
domain shift caused by heterogeneous data distribution at different institutions. To improve data representation
learning, and model transferability and generalizability across sub-population data, a novel self-supervised
contrastive learning (CL) based methods will be employed within the FL framework. Key success criterion of the
aim 2 study is to establish protocols for integrating domain alignment into FL framework and evaluate the FL-
trained GA prediction models deployed on new and previously unseen clinical data. Clinical deployment of such
AI prediction tools will facilitate identification of high-risk AMD patients as candidates for more frequent screening
and earlier treatment, leading to better clinical outcomes."
10889693,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Stroke commonly disrupts the corticospinal tract (CST) and impairs hand function. Transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS) interventions that target and strengthen residual CST connections are promising candidates
for improving poststroke hand function. To maximize their therapeutic effects, such interventions must repeatedly
activate the residual CST and enhance its neural transmission. We and others recently showed in neurotypical
adults that resting brain activity spontaneously alternates between EEG activity patterns (brain states) that
predict strong and weak CST activation. TMS interventions also preferentially enhance CST transmission when
delivered during strong CST states but instead diminish CST transmission when delivered during weak CST
states. However, virtually all poststroke TMS interventions are uncoupled from the current brain state, such that
only a fraction of TMS stimuli coincide with brain states during which the beneficial effects of TMS are likely to
be strongest. To resolve this issue, poststroke TMS interventions should be delivered solely during brain states
reflecting strong CST responses. Given that each stroke survivor has a unique pattern of brain damage and
recovery-related brain reorganization, these brain states must be fully personalized. We recently developed a
personalized machine learning framework that successfully identifies electroencephalography (EEG) activity
patterns that predict strong and weak CST states in neurotypical adults. Our framework is fully personalized and
is therefore unaffected by lesion-related changes in brain structure and/or function, making it ideal for application
in the poststroke brain. In this project, we will use this framework to establish the mechanistic rationale and
methodological foundation for future personalized brain state-dependent TMS interventions that target and
strengthen the residual CST after stroke. In Aim 1, we will use our machine learning framework to identify
personalized brain states that predict strong and weak residual CST activation in chronic stroke survivors; we
will also evaluate relationships between our framework’s performance and functional and structural metrics of
poststroke CST pathway integrity. Results of Aim 1 will establish poststroke brain state-dependency of residual
CST output and the relationship of this state-dependency to CST integrity. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate
a real-time EEG algorithm that accurately delivers TMS during personalized brain states reflecting strong and
weak CST activation in neurotypical adults. Results from Aim 2 will demonstrate the technical feasibility of
personalized, real-time brain state-dependent TMS. Overall, this project fits the scope of the NIMH/NINDS R21
mechanism because it will develop a novel neuroengineering approach that can in the future enhance residual
CST transmission and promote paretic hand function in stroke survivors."

 The meninges, located between the calvaria bones and brain, are composed of three layers; the pia, arach-
noid, dura. Each meningeal layer contains specialized fibroblasts with unique expression profiles that facilitate
specific functions. The meninges contain resident macrophages called BAMs (border associated macrophages),
directly interact with bones of the skull, and contain extensive blood and lymphatic networks. The adult meninges
provide physical protection, act as a selective barrier, function in neuro-immune surveillance, regulate cerebro-
spinal fluid make-up, and are a site of CNS waste removal. During fetal development, meningeal fibroblasts are
a key paracrine signaling source that regulates neurogenesis and cerebrovascular development via production
of paracrine factors. Primary defects in meningeal fibroblasts cause congenital brain abnormalities in mice and
humans. We have incomplete knowledge of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control development of
the meninges and its functions in fetal life. Our goal is to fill knowledge gaps on meninges formation and function
and advance knowledge on how primary meninges defects may contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders.
 The transcription factor Foxc1 is required for meninges development and global Foxc1 mutants have been
used for key discoveries of prenatal meningeal fibroblast function. To identify the cell-autonomous role of Foxc1
in fibroblast development and study meningeal fibroblast regulation of calvarial bone and local immune cell de-
velopment, we generated conditional Foxc1 mouse mutants using Tbx18-CreERT that deletes Foxc1 expression
in meningeal fibroblasts and mural cells but not other Foxc1-expressing cells like osteogenic cells. Dorsal fore-
brain meningeal fibroblasts fail to specify into layer-specific subtypes in fetal Foxc1 conditional mutants, instead
differentiating into an abnormal, myofibroblast-like cells. As a result of these primary defects in fibroblast devel-
opment, we show resident meningeal macrophages (BAMs) do not develop properly and prenatal mutant mice
have a severe calvarial bone growth defect. Aim 1 will identify how meningeal fibroblasts regulate BAM devel-
opment, testing the function of meningeal-derived colony stimulating factor-1, and use a maternal infection model
to identify prenatal functions of BAMs and fibroblasts in fetal neuroinflammatory response. Aim 2 will identify
how signals from the meninges control calvarial bone growth over the brain, testing the prediction that meningeal
derived ECM and secreted factors stimulate osteoblast cell migration. Aim 3 will employ single cell Multiome
profiling and transcription factor-DNA binding analysis of Foxc1 and Foxc2 to identify the transcriptional mecha-
nisms that drive meningeal fibroblasts to gain layer specific identities and the ability to produce paracrine factors
that regulate brain, immune, vascular and bone development. Completion of experiments here will be impactful,
uncovering new mechanisms into how the fetal meninges functions as a paracrine signaling center and generate
potentially clinically relevant insights into how meninges defects contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders."
10893043,"The purpose of this research is to support the development of Dr. Abdulla Damluji into an
independent investigator focused on studying geriatric syndromes during cardiovascular intervention.
The K23 award will allow the development of a fundamental skillset including: the design and methods for
analysis of interventions, understanding and proper application of frailty and resiliency assessments, designing
pilot prospective studies, and enhancing knowledge of geriatrics and gerontology. Skills will be obtained through
coursework, workshops, seminars, scientific meetings and mentored research. The overall goals are: 1) identify
a simple universal bedside frailty test for clinical decision-making and 2) become an NIH-investigator prepared
to conduct a clinical trial aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of different treatments of acute
myocardial infarction (AMI) in a heterogenous population of older adults living with frailty and lack of resiliency.
 Two thirds of all patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are older than 60 years of age, and >85% of
patients over age 85 years live with some form of CVD. Of those older patients admitted with acute AMI, a
majority experience frailty, a syndrome of decreased physiologic reserve and vulnerability to stressors.
Moreover, some of these frail patients lack physical resiliency, the ability to rebound back and recover from a
major health crisis. Critical “gaps in knowledge” in cardiovascular care for older adults, particularly those with
frailty and lack of resiliency, have been identified. These “gaps” need to be addressed in order to provide the
best possible care to a growing older patient population. This proposal examines the hypothesis that frailty
and resiliency influence the treatment choice and health outcome after AMI. Aim1 evaluates the
prevalence of frailty in U.S. among older AMI patients by treatment [percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI),
coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, or guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT)] using the validated
claims-based frailty index. Aim 2 examines the role of frailty in treatment response to PCI and CABG. Aim 3
validates the diagnostic accuracy of a bedside 4-item frailty scale and assesses whether this diagnostic tool,
used in combination with resiliency measurements, can predict health outcomes at 1-year follow-up.
 The institutional environments at both the Inova Heart and Vascular Institute (IHVI) and Johns Hopkins
University (JHU) are ideal for conducting cardiovascular outcomes research. The mentorship consists of leaders
with expertise directly relevant to the career goals of the applicant: Christopher M O’Connor, MD (IHVI; expert
in experimental design); Dr Wayne Batchelor (IHVI: interventional cardiologist); Jodi B Segal, MD, MPH (JHU:

 The overall research in the Lazarus Lab revolves around studying energy and protein homeostasis as it
relates to human disease using chemical biology and structural biology. We have several multidisciplinary
projects around this topic, including studying the ULK family of autophagy kinases and pseudokinases, lysine
metabolism disorders, and other kinases related to diabetes and cancer. Over the last 4 years, we have used
crystallography and chemical biology to help develop highly potent inhibitors of the metabolic sensor O-GlcNAc
transferase, solved the first structures and identify the first chemical probes of the ULK pseudokinase linked to
schizophrenia ULK4, and helped elucidate the first structure of an enzyme in the lysine metabolic pathway
DHTKD1.
 Our goals over the next five-year period include further understanding of the ULK family of kinases.
ULK1 and ULK2 are the main initiating enzymes for the autophagy pathway, a conserved metabolic pathway
whereby cellular components get degraded for quality control and energy generation during starvation. The
pathway is thought to be critical in diseases ranging from cancer to Alzheimer’s disease, yet there are still
major gaps in our understanding of the pathway. What happens to cells when you inhibit autophagy at different
stages of the pathway in different disease models using selective probes? What is the role of the mysterious
family member ULK4, which has no catalytic activity but binds ATP with nanomolar potency and likely has a
function for the ATP binding. Another major goal involves the lysine metabolic pathway, in which several inborn
errors of metabolism are found. How do the enzymes in this pathway function, and can inhibiting other
enzymes in this pathway block the toxic buildup of intermediates that arise in glutaric aciduria patients?
 The overall vision of the research program is to develop chemical probes and obtain high-resolution
crystal structures to better understand key enzymes in these metabolic pathways and determine if they are
therapeutic targets for human diseases. Within the context of the Mount Sinai research community, we are
well-positioned to collaborate with our colleagues to leverage our strength in chemical and structural biology to
provide molecular understanding that synergizes with our colleagues’ expertise in human biology or medicinal
chemistry, like our overarching collaboration with the Drug Discovery Institute here and our collaborations that
involve cancer, genetic diseases, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. As new opportunities arise, we can
provide our expertise in the molecular underpinnings of glycosyltransferases, kinases and pseudokinases, and
protein degradation pathways to develop new projects supported by the MIRA funding, while still focusing on
the core projects described above."
10892916,"Abstract
Heroin addiction is characterized by compulsive craving, drug seeking and re-occurrence of relapse, and is
considered to be one of the most problematic public health concerns. Heroin relapse is significantly affected by
stress. Human studies suggest that exposure to life stressors is correlated with compulsive drug abuse and
relapse to drugs during periods of abstinence. More importantly, environmental stress during early life is
related to bigger risk for developing addiction and increased relapse vulnerability. Early social isolation (during
adolescence, ESI), as one of the widely used models for early life stress, causes many behavioral
abnormalities that related to mental health issues including increased vulnerability for relapse. My preliminary
data confirmed that ESI potentiates cue-induced heroin seeking after forced abstinence from heroin self-
administration (SA). However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms are largely understudied.
 Prefrontal cortex (PFC) is involved in the regulation of drug relapse. PFC hypofunction has been identified
in opioid abusers. Preclinical studies indicate that PFC, which projects to subcortical regions such as NAc and
VTA, is critical for heroin relapse. As ESI induces irreversible synaptic dysfunction in the PFC, it is likely that
ESI potentiates heroin seeking by exacerbating PFC malfunction. Moreover, due to the heterogeneous of PFC
projecting neurons (PFC-VTA and PFC-NAc projection have distinct distribution and molecular signatures), it
remains unclear what are the neuronal circuit-specific molecular mechanisms for heroin relapse vulnerability.
Therefore, my central hypothesis is that hypofunction of PFC (PFC-VTA/PFC-NAc) projecting neurons is
involved in ESI-potentiates heroin seeking, and this effect is accompanied by gene transcriptional changes
within the PFC-VTA and/or PFC-NAc projecting neurons.
 To test my hypothesis, I will incorporate state-of-the-art electrophysiology, chemogenetic strategies
(DREADDs), and projection-specific molecular profiling (TRAP [translating ribosome affinity purification])
technologies into my study. I propose to measure excitatory synaptic transmission in PFC-NAc and PFC-VTA
projecting neurons after forced abstinence from heroin SA. Chemogenetic tools will be used to test the
functional role of PFC-VTA and PFC-NAc projecting neurons in ESI-intensified heroin seeking. TRAP methods
(using GFPL10 transgenic mice) will be applied to isolate projection-specific neurons for RNA-seq to identify
potential molecular mechanisms for ESI-potentiated heroin seeking. Fulfillment of my Research Plan and
Training Plan will allow me to independently pursue my long-term career goals: study neuronal circuit-specific
molecular mechanisms for heroin seeking to ultimately contribute to the development of pharmacotherapies for
heroin relapse."
10892923,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Invasive aspergillosis (IA) is a life-threatening pulmonary infection of immunocompromised patients caused by
Aspergillus fumigatus. While previous work has identified recruited phagocytes as critical cellular players in
controlling A. fumigatus infection, a major knowledge gap exists regarding the role of lung structural cells in
establishing the anti-fungal environment of the lung. My preliminary data indicates that IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1)
signaling promotes neutrophil and monocyte killing of A. fumigatus spores (called conidia) and that IL-1R1
expression on lung structural cells is required for production of key anti-fungal cytokines such as GM-CSF. These
data strongly suggest an accessory immune role for structural cells during A. fumigatus infection, although the
identity of IL-1/-producing cells and IL-1R1-expressing cells is unknown. I hypothesize that production of IL-
1 and  by recruited and lung-resident phagocytes, respectively, is required for optimal immune cell killing of
Af conidia and murine survival and that IL-1R1 expression by structural cells is required for broad production of
anti-fungal cytokines by diverse structural cell subsets. I will test this hypothesis with the following specific aims:
Aim 1: To investigate the cellular sources of IL-1/ and their contributions to prevention of mortality and
efficiency of conidial killing in the A. fumigatus-infected lung. I will identify IL-1/ producing cells in infected
mouse lungs using ELISAs, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy, in both wild-type mice and
mice depleted of candidate producer cell types. I will infect mice deficient in IL-1 or  with a fluorescent A.
fumigatus reporter to test the contributions of each cytokine to fungal killing and murine survival.
Aim 2: To define a map of IL-1 responsive structural cell types that produce key cytokines modulating the quality
and quantity of the anti-A. fumigatus immune response. I will identify IL-1R1-expressing structural cell subsets
in the lung using flow cytometry and microscopy. I will test the requirement for IL-1R1 on specific cellular subsets
for murine survival and fungal killing by using mice with conditional Il1r1 deletion on three different structural cell
subsets. I will test whether IL-1R1 on structural cells is required for anti-fungal cytokine production and determine
which structural cells may produce these cytokines.
Upon conducting these aims, I will determine the structural and immune cells involved in IL-1R1-dependent
crosstalk during A. fumigatus infection. These results will advance our understanding of immunity to a medically-
important fungal pathogen. I have designed this training plan for broad training in fungal pathogenesis and
cellular immunology. The sponsor's laboratory and the host institution are the ideal environment for conducting
this training and contribute to a high likelihood of success in both research and other aspects of training."
10892925,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The United States is experiencing an opioid use and overdose crisis. To address this crisis, programs that
provide medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are being expanded and enhanced. MOUD is the most
effective intervention for an OUD, and methadone treatment (MT) is the most commonly prescribed MOUD;
however, approximately half of people who begin MT discontinue within a year, and half of people retained in
MT use opioids within six months. Physical pain, emotion dysregulation, and reward processing deficits,
affecting most people on MT, could be contributing to their ongoing opioid use.
 Novel behavioral interventions that address physical pain, emotion dysregulation, reward processing
deficits and opioid use among people on MOUD are needed. Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement
(MORE) integrates training in mindfulness, reappraisal, and savoring skills into an 8-week group therapy
designed to remediate hedonic dysregulation in brain reward systems underpinning OUD. Across multiple
trials, MORE has demonstrated efficacy for reducing opioid use, craving, emotional distress, and pain in other
healthcare settings. Our R21 pilot randomized controlled trial of MORE was the first to demonstrate MORE’s
feasibility and acceptability as delivered in MT clinics, with indications of preliminary efficacy for decreasing
drug use, craving, depression, anxiety, and pain for people with OUD. Further, expedited implementation and
dissemination of effective interventions is needed. However, uptake of novel interventions may be slow in MT
because time and resources are often limited. Therefore, to best address potential implementation issues and
to optimize future MORE implementation and dissemination, in this study, we will utilize a Type 2, Hybrid
Implementation-Effectiveness study design. We will not only evaluate MORE’s effectiveness but also assess
barriers and facilitators to integrating MORE into MT and evaluate the impact of a sustainable train-the-trainer
model on provider burden, intervention fidelity and engagement, and patient outcomes. We will randomize MT
clinicians to receive training in 1) a higher intensity MORE implementation strategy consisting of a train-the-
trainer model with training in the full MORE treatment manual plus supervision and feedback or 2) a minimal
intensity implementation strategy consisting of a simple, scripted mindfulness practice (SMP) extracted from
the MORE treatment manual with minimal training, no supervision, and minimal feedback.
 Specifically, we aim to: 1) using a RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and
maintenance) framework, examine barriers and facilitators to implementation of MORE and SMP in MT and
evaluate strategies for optimizing training, fidelity, and engagement, 2) optimize existing MORE and SMP
training and implementation toolkits, including adaptable resources that can accelerate the translation of
evidence into practice, and 3) evaluate effectiveness and treatment fidelity of a higher intensity MORE
implementation strategy versus a lower intensity SMP implementation strategy as an adjunct to MT (N=420)."

10892094,"ABSTRACT
Apoptosis happens continuously along with the active clearance of apoptotic cells (ACs) by phagocytes or
efferocytes, termed “efferocytosis”, to maintain tissue homeostasis. When efferocytosis becomes defective,
uncleared ACs undergo post-apoptotic necrosis and release immunogenic epitopes and pro-inflammatory
mediators, which leads to chronic inflammatory diseases. Our recent studies revealed a novel role of
efferocytosis in accelerating tissue repair as it promotes inflammation resolution by inducing the biosynthesis of
specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) that stop inflammatory responses. Therefore, understanding how
efferocytosis is successfully carried out is of paramount importance. Much has been learned about the
mechanisms of AC recognition and uptake, but how efferocytes degrade ACs and process the metabolic cargo,
e.g., cholesterol released from AC digestion, is incompletely understood. Moreover, although efferocytosis and
endocytosis share common features, such as involving cytoskeleton rearrangement and intracellular transport
of vesicular membrane-bound cargoes, whether efferocytes hijack the endocytic machinery to process AC-
derived cargo remains uncertain. In our unpublished results, we found that resolvin D1 (RvD1), a
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)–derived SPM, enhanced the acidification of the AC-containing compartments
(efferosomes) and LC3-II lipidation, key features in LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP)-mediated corpse
degradation. As our recent study showed that the activation of MerTK, the efferocytosis receptor, was required
for RvD1 biosynthesis, these results indicate a novel role of MerTK-RvD1 signaling in LAP-mediated AC
degradation. To study whether the key endocytic regulators—the C-terminal Eps15 Homology Domain (EHD)
proteins comprising EHD1, EHD2, EHD3, and EHD4—are involved in efferocytosis-related events, we analyzed
a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset from atherosclerotic lesions where a lot of cells undergo
apoptosis and found that EHD proteins had heterogeneous expression with high expression of EHD1 and EHD4
in macrophages, the professional efferocytes. We further found that EHD1 enhanced the cell surface levels of
the cholesterol efflux transport protein ABCA1 in macrophages during efferocytosis, which indicates that EHD1-
mediated endocytic trafficking of ABCA1 may play a role in removing the excess free cholesterol released from
digested ACs. Here, we propose to combine approaches in cell biology, biochemistry, mouse genetics, and
functional genomics to determine the function and mechanisms of MerTK-RvD1 signaling in LAP and EHD
proteins in efferocytosis-related events including maintaining cellular cholesterol homeostasis and controlling
endocytic trafficking of MerTK. We will also perform unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screening to identify novel
regulators of MerTK levels on the cell surface where macrophages receive ACs. Taken together, understanding
these aspects of efferocytosis will shed light on key physiological and pathophysiological processes and suggest
novel therapeutic strategies for diseases driven by defective efferocytosis."

Influenza infection causes high morbidity and mortality each year in the United States. Influenza vaccination of
children is one of the most effective strategies for reducing the burden of disease among individuals and
communities, yet coverage levels remain suboptimal. Hospitals are a promising setting for reaching a large
number of high-risk children. Recent studies, however, indicate that many influenza vaccine-eligible children
fail to receive this needed vaccine during hospitalization. Local data suggest that multimodal approaches
leveraging health information technology may increase influenza vaccine uptake among hospitalized children.
This project will build upon this existing evidence to establish a standardized pediatric inpatient influenza
vaccination program that can be readily disseminated and successfully implemented across diverse health
systems. In Aim 1 of this proposal, the study team will engage parents, nurses, providers and other key
stakeholders from Seattle Children’s Hospital, Children’s Hospital Colorado, and Lurie Children’s Hospital of
Chicago to create a best practice implementation guide for the inpatient influenza vaccination program. Core
components will include creating a multidisciplinary leadership team, maintaining end-user engagement,
utilizing novel electronic health record and data analytic tools, and enhancing evidence-based education and
communication of parents, nurses, and providers. The program will be piloted at the 3 lead sites and refined as
needed based upon evaluation metrics. In Aim 2, the study team will conduct a cluster randomized trial using a
Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial adaptive design at 12 health systems nationally to test the
effectiveness of the influenza vaccination program in improving influenza vaccination rates of hospitalized
children. In the first intervention season, sites will be randomized to implement the standardized influenza
vaccination program using the aforementioned implementation guide or usual care. In the second intervention
season, the usual care sites and lower-performing intervention sites will be re-randomized to the standardized
or intensified version of the program. The latter will include a learning collaborative, with monthly meetings of
site leaders as well as one-on-one meetings with the study team to facilitate successful implementation. In the
third intervention season, all sites will continue their influenza vaccination program to assess sustainability. In
Aim 3, the study team will use mixed methods and the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and
Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the program, including identification of key barriers, facilitators,
and considerations for future dissemination. This information will be used to optimize and expand the program.
This evidence-based program, which leverages novel clinical decision support tools in one of the most utilized
electronic health record systems and optimizes hospital infrastructure, has the potential to markedly increase
influenza vaccination of high-risk children. It also has broad public health implications, as the program could be
readily adapted and expanded to include other needed vaccines, patient populations, and healthcare settings."

The Bioengineering Cardiovascular Training Grant (BCTG) program provides Bioengineering training for six NIH
supported and one Bioengineering department supported PhD students committed to careers in cardiovascular
research. Cardiovascular (CV) diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the US and progress in this area
will require training outstanding scientists with a variety of backgrounds in bioengineering to develop new and
innovative approaches for study, diagnosis and treatment of CV disease. The UW and Department of
Bioengineering have been leaders in CV research and technology development for over 50 years. BCTG faculty
in multiple departments in the College of Engineering and School of Medicine have strong collaborative programs
in this area. Our program benefits the public by training professionals in basic science and translational research
that integrates engineering, mathematics, chemistry, physiology, physics and computational skills to promote
fundamental discoveries and develop new technologies. Students gain interdisciplinary skills and the value of
collaboration. The program emphasizes new technology development in diagnostics and therapeutics to study
and treat CV pathologies, improving early detection and disease management, to improve quality of life for heart
failure patients. We believe that the success of translational research requires highly trained scientists to be
placed in both academia and industry, with skills to successfully transition research from universities to
commercialization and the clinic. For this renewal proposal we have added several novel components to provide
training in research and professional skills that spans the biomedical pipeline from discovery & mechanistic
studies to translational research to commercialization or clinical development. The 2-year program involves 1)
research in the laboratory of a chosen mentor, 2) a unique curriculum with opportunities for training in clinical
translation and commercialization, and 3) clinical preceptorships that are unique to our program. Trainees attend
a weekly seminar series focused on CV research, with an associated journal club and special sessions with
speakers that are limited to trainees. Trainees also attend lectures and discussion groups in the Biomedical
Research Integrity summer program, sponsored by the School of Medicine. Additional new components include
outreach and research mentoring to under-represented groups to increase the diversity of the workforce in STEM
fields, and a course that provides resources and seminars for professional skills development and training in
research reproducibility, rigor and transparency. Trainees are selected based on strong quantitative and
engineering backgrounds, training environment of faculty mentors, appropriateness of the research to our
programmatic focus and the potential for innovative, collaborative and translational research. Trainees present
at yearly symposiums and national meetings, and write a yearly progress report that includes feedback questions
to continually improve our program. Trainees are required to apply for fellowships at the end of the two-year

10892190,"The rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) among women who have recently experienced perinatal loss
(including early and late fetal death and early neonatal death) are 3 times the rates of MDD among matched
samples of community women. Mood difficulties can persist up to 4 years after the loss and can worsen with
subsequent pregnancies. Suicide rates after perinatal loss are higher relative to mothers of living infants. PTSD
is a common co-occurrence; PTSD rates after perinatal loss are 7 times that of mothers of living infants. Despite
recognition that MDD following perinatal loss is an important public health concern, that it causes significant
impairment, and that treatment as usual has been inadequate, the only treatment developed and tested for this
population was part of a randomized trial conducted by our team in pilot work for this proposal. That study created
the first manual for treating any psychiatric disorder after perinatal loss. The manual is structured, easy-to-follow,
and uses interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) principles to address the circumstances perinatal loss, such as
resolving conflicts over how to respond to the loss, grieving and requesting support in the absence of social
norms about how to do so, reviewing the loss event, and resolving questions of fault and role competence. It
can be used by providers who do not know IPT. Our pilot trial randomized 50 women with MDD following
perinatal loss to group IPT or to group Coping with Depression (CWD), an evidence-based cognitive behavioral
treatment which did not focus on perinatal loss nor social support. IPT was feasible and acceptable, with
significantly higher (p = .001) treatment satisfaction scores and PTSD recovery rates (among the 54% of the
sample with PTSD; p = .009) in IPT than in CWD. Confidence intervals around between-groups effect sizes
favored IPT for reductions in depressive symptoms during treatment as well as for improvement in mode-specific
targets (social support, grief symptoms), over follow-up. Given these promising findings, the proposed R01 will
conduct a fully-powered randomized efficacy study comparing IPT for MDD following perinatal loss to CWD in a
sample of 274 women. The trial will be the first fully-powered randomized trial of treatment for any psychiatric
disorder following perinatal loss. It addresses NICHD priority to improve the health of women before, during,
and after pregnancy. Given that poverty increases risk of perinatal loss and that rates of perinatal loss for African-
American women are double those for White women, the location of the trial in Flint and Detroit, Michigan
(minority-majority cities with high rates of poverty) increases the significance of the trial. Outcomes will include
time to recovery from MDD, depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms, time to recovery from PTSD, social support,
well-being, grief, and fear of subsequent pregnancies. Results have high potential for dissemination and uptake:
we have received and fulfilled more than 160 requests for the free, unpublished IPT treatment manual. This
study will provide an evidence base for treating a vulnerable and understudied population whose distress has
historically been minimized, improving outcomes for these women and their families."

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) using orally or topically delivered antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can prevent HIV
infection in susceptible, uninfected individuals. Adherence to the daily or monthly dosing regimens, however,
has emerged as a critical factor driving the clinical success of HIV PrEP. The poor adherence of some
participant groups in the ASPIRE trial of an intravaginal ring (IVR) delivering the non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) dapivirine (DPV) indicates that multiple barriers to adherence exist, and
strategies beyond decreased dosing frequency will be required for successful implementation of an effective
non-vaccine, method to prevent HIV infection. “Long-acting” subdermal implant ARV formulations that maintain
protection for periods of 6 months, and preferably 1 year, or more may increase adherence by minimizing a
product's use demands once the initial product uptake decision is made.
We propose a resorbable subdermal implant Sustained/Extended Release Drug Delivery System (SER-DDS)
delivering a novel ARV agent from the maturation inhibitor mechanistic class. The implant will be developed
through a three-tiered formulation development process employing design, fabrication, and in vitro studies
iteratively coupled with in vivo PK, degradation, safety, and efficacy studies in three animal models. The drug is
DFH-1160005, a novel betulin-derived, 2nd generation maturation inhibitor (MI) with single-digit nanomolar
potency against HIV and a robust resistance profile. The program objectives are to develop a safe and
effective SER-DDS for HIV prevention; understand the fundamental pharmacology of sustained, systemic
DFH-1160005 delivery in the context of vaginal and rectal HIV infection, and apply rigorous methodologies to
characterize implant degradation and evaluate safety and efficacy in preclinical in vivo models. In Aim 1, we
will formulate implants, measure drug release in vitro, and conduct PK studies in rats, sheep, and rhesus
macaques. In Aim 2, we will investigate SER-DDS degradation and resorption kinetics and mechanisms in vitro
and in vivo. In Aim 3, we will evaluate lead candidate SER-DDS safety in sheep and explore efficacy and PK-
pharmacodynamic relationships in a non-human primate rectal and vaginal challenge SHIV infection model."

The kidney has developed a complex, three-dimensional architecture to serve its key functions, including
excretion of waste substances, maintenance of the internal balance for fluid and salt, blood pressure control,
and hormonal function. Understanding the roles of the individual renal cell types and cell states in these
processes in health and disease is critical to develop novel targeted therapies. Extensive studies lead by this
investigative group and others have started to identify molecular disease mechanism in renal biopsy tissues
and helped to develop novel disease markers and therapies. The PREcision Medicine through IntErrogation of
Rna in the kidnEy (PREMIERE) Network has brought investigators from three leading biomedical research
institutions with diverse, complementary expertise together. Our team has an established track record in
working jointly to develop state of the art approaches in molecular analysis of renal disease. We will continue
to perform high-quality, high-throughput single cell RNA sequencing on research biopsies from the Kidney
Precision Medicine Project and advance the technology for deeper sequence coverage, reduce cost, use
smaller biopsy portions without data loss so that additional technologies can be employed across KPMP, in a
robust and reproducible manner. These single cell profiles will be linked to the disease states of the patients.
Key signatures associated with specific cells and diseases will be extracted and localized in the spatial context
of the kidney using specific, highly multiplexed RNA staining techniques. Additionally, we will employ cutting
edge spatial transcriptomic technology to map cell clusters to their local environment for an added dimension
of disease understanding. To this end the PREMIERE investigators will work closely with the tissue
procurement sites and the Central Hub of the KPMP, using their 20 years of experience in team science, so
that at the end of the KPMP funding cycle, novel cell type specific treatment targets are identified fueling the
therapeutic pipelines of the future."

The overall goal of this project is to expand the knowledge on the genetic basis and molecular
mechanisms of Prune Belly Syndrome (PBS), a severe human multi-system congenital urologic
anomaly with muscle and connective tissue deficiencies. Hallmark clinical features of PBS
include the triad of 1) wrinkled `prune' belly due to hypoplastic or absent abdominal wall skeletal
musculature, 2) megacystis secondary to bladder smooth muscle pathology, and 3) bilateral
undescended testes. We discovered three gain-of-function missense mutations in the X-linked
gene filamin A (FLNA) causing syndromic and isolated PBS. FLNA is an abundant intracellular
actin-crosslinking protein that functions as a crucial mechanosensor, transmitting force
bidirectionally between actin and integrins as well as binding and regulating other modulatory
transmembrane receptors or signaling molecules. FLNA regulates cell shape, adhesion, gene
transcription, hypoxic responses, embryonic morphogenesis, and cell contraction. To assess
the role of Flna mutations on mouse development and function, we will study our Flna gain-of-
function mutant mice that have a highly penetrant PBS-like phenotype when exposed to
gestational hypoxia (Aim 1). Using state-of-the-art structural and biochemical techniques, we
will characterize mutant FLNA protein structure and the impact on binding partners (Aim 2). As
the mouse-derived Flna gain-of-function bladder smooth muscle cells have a dysmorphic,
dysfunctional cell phenotype, we will subcellularly and molecularly define their cell form and
function when exposed to environmental stress and stimulants (Aim 3). This multidisciplinary
expert team with unique scientific expertise and advanced molecular tool sets will unite to
identify FLNA-based critical regulatory mechanisms modulating detrusor smooth muscle
function and dysfunction leading to PBS. This work may fill an important gap in our
understanding of FLNA signaling and yield greater mechanistic understanding of detrusor
myogenesis and detrusor underactivity, integrating signaling pathways, creating animal models
of PBS, and potentially impacting future management of detrusor underactivity by guiding future
rational therapeutic designs."
10898043,"New genes (NGs) are generated by multiple mechanisms and their end-piece sequences are identified as the
chimeric transcript sequence from multiple human sources including healthy and disease tissues. Therefore,
NGs have been recognized as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets for precision medicine. Many
efforts have been made to study individual NG function and to identify relevant drug targets. However, the
current in-depth research and achievements are mainly concentrated on several driver NGs, and classical
cancer drugs have been directly used to target the NG domains, such as the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1
fusion protein in leukemia. Some of the fusion proteins with retaining DNA-binding domains such as
transcription factors can directly bind their target genes, such as the EWSR1-FLI fusion actively recruiting BAF
complex. Recently, the downstream effectors of driver FGs have emerged as therapeutic targets. For example,
targeting the downstream CCND2 inhibited RUNX1/ETO-driven leukemic expansion in vitro and in vivo and
inhibition of STAT5, the downstream factor of NUP214-ABL1 led to the induction of leukemia cell death.
However, the functions of most identified FGs have not been systematically investigated. This is mainly due to
the limitations of traditional tools and the high cost of experimental procedures. Therefore, there is an urgent
need to develop new tools for analyzing NG breakpoint-specific features systemically in the human genome
and predict their originating and regulatory mechanisms, such as upstream and downstream effectors. In-depth
annotation based on NG structure is important for understanding the cellular mechanisms of NGs. Effective
use of systematic bioinformatics tools for functional annotation can provide a deeper insight into the role of
NGs in the development and progression of diseases such as cancers to find direct and indirect therapeutic
targets. In this study, we will develop five bioinformatics tools for the functional annotation and feature analysis
of NGs, a predictive pipeline for automatic analysis of downstream effects of NGs, and a predictive method for
tracing the origin of NGs."
10898044,"SUMMARY
CD8 T cells play a key role in the elimination of intracellular infections and malignant cells and can provide long-
lived protective immunity. In the response to infection, CD8 T cell metabolism is coupled to transcriptional,
translational, and epigenetic changes that are driven by extracellular metabolites and immunological signals.
These programs facilitate the adaptation of CD8 T cells to diverse and dynamic metabolic environments
encountered in circulation and tissues. Defining the metabolic adaptations of CD8 T cells to specific tissue
environments informs our understanding of how these cells protect against pathogens and tumors and maintain
function at tissue barrier sites.
Following the resolution of infection, a portion of effector CD8 T cells differentiate into long-lived memory CD8 T
cells that either recirculate or establish long-lived tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM). Lodged in tissues
throughout the body, CD8 TRM make up a significant portion of the T cell arsenal against reinfection and
tumorigenesis. TRM adaptation is of special relevance at tissue-barrier sites, such as the small intestine (SI),
where exposure to the microbiome, opportunistic pathogens, and diverse as well as fluctuant amounts of
nutrients possible. However, the functional metabolic adaptations of T cells to tissue residency, including any
variations between tissue types, are only beginning to be understood. We have found that TRM undergo tissue-
specific metabolic adaptations and highlight the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, and Srebp2, a key
transcriptional regulator of cholesterogenesis to be of special relevance for SI-TRM formation. Based on these
preliminary data, we hypothesize that the sustained induction of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is a key
adaptation by SI TRM and that understanding the basis for this dependence will shed light on memory T cell
homeostasis. We propose to: Aim 1) Investigate the role of Srebp2 in differentiation and homeostasis of effector
and memory T cell populations and to uncover the relevant intermediates and products of this pathway for TRM,
and Aim 2) Place Srebp2 in the transcriptional network that drives SI TRM and establish the impact of known SI
TRM-inducing tissue cues on Srebp2 expression. Results from these studies will be crucial to the understanding
of how CD8 T cell fate and function are mechanistically connected to their metabolism and will help design
therapeutic approaches that harness the beneficial actions of CD8 T cells."

The aims of this 36 month qualitative research project are as follows: a) Identify gendered differences in
the meanings and roles of intoxication within sexual encounters; b) Explore the extent to which different
drinking contexts, and normative cultures that operate within them, influence sexual encounters; c) Examine
the ways in which social structural inequities, such as gendered power relations, influence the meanings and
outcomes of intoxicated sexual encounters; d) Produce practice-based evidence, informed by a systematic
constitutive analysis of qualitative narrative data, that can inform promising innovations for the development of
sexual victimization prevention and education initiatives. This evidence can also provide important information
for the formulation of new guidelines and practices for the operation of nightlife establishments.
 Although concern about sexual violence, victimization and harassment has increased, much of the
recent attention has been to address these issues within the workplace. Hence, much less focus has been
directed towards addressing these issues in drinking settings. This is in spite of the extensive research that has
identified the role of alcohol as a major contributory factor in sexually violent and aggressive behaviors.
However, while epidemiological and survey research on intoxication and sexual encounters has been
important, limitations with this research need to be addressed. Furthermore, while social science research on
contemporary sexual encounters and sexual consent has increased, especially among young adults, much
less research has examined the social dimensions of intoxication in the context of sexual encounters.
Consequently, we will adopt an alternative theoretical framework combining insights from existing social
science research to emphasize both the socio-contextual and structural aspects of intoxicated sexual
encounters. Additionally, this proposed project considers these issues among diverse groups of young adults,
not only those enrolled in college, who have been the primary focus of existing research on sexual encounters.
By combining theories from several fields and research traditions, we can expand the current state of
understanding of the meanings, processes, and implications of intoxicated sexual encounters for young adults.
 Our proposed project will examine the following three research questions:
 1. How do young adults understand and conceptualize the role of intoxication in shaping sexual
 encounters, consent and victimization?
 2. To what extent do different intoxication settings, such as bars, clubs and parties, influence the
 processes of sexual encounters, consent, and victimization?
 3. How do socio-structural factors (cultural scripts of sexuality and gendered intoxication, gendered
 power relations, gender inequities) influence the processes involved in intoxicated sexual encounters?
 In order to examine these issues, we will conduct in-depth interviews with 200 young adults using a
qualitative interview schedule, which includes a closed-ended survey, detailed open-ended questions, and
innovative qualitative elicitation techniques. We will disseminate findings through a project website
(criticalpublichealth.org) that includes an accessible presentation of study findings and a social media forum to
solicit feedback from study participants and people concerned about alcohol-related problems associated with
intoxicated sexual encounters."
10898858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A growing body of research has highlighted the importance of frontal regions, at both the
functional and structural levels, in age-related declines in attentional and cognitive processing.
However, the underlying neurobiological pathophysiological changes in the brain that contribute
to these declines are still largely unclear. The objective of this proposal is to investigate neural
mechanisms of age-related attentional distractibility, focusing on the neural circuit initiated from
the locus coeruleus (LC). In the current proposal, we will test the hypothesis that the neural
dysconnectivity of LC with the salience network (SN) drives failures of ignoring distractors in older
adults. To this end, we will examine humans’ and animals’ brains simultaneously through 1) an
integrative approach combining human brain imaging and animal-based neural circuit
manipulation and 2) equivalent research designs, including compatible attention task paradigms,
analogous neural network analyses, and rescue strategies between human and animal. Using
our novel unidirectional circuit-specific gene manipulation approach in vitro and in vivo, we will
directly impair and rescue the LC-SN circuit in animals and examine how the circuit manipulation
changes attention performance in the presence of distractors in the animal model. For human
older adults, we will examine how LC-SN connectivity is associated with selective attention
performance, and how improved LC-SN connectivity through a cognitive training program may
lead to improved attentional performance. To increase fidelity in LC signal estimation, we will
utilize two advanced imaging approaches at both the structural and functional level, namely
neuromelanin-weighted structural MRI and physio-noise correction. Finally, we will include a
measure of family history of Alzheimer’s disease (first degree relative) as variable of potential
interest for exploratory analyses. The proposed project will provide an essential springboard to
future work to identify and protect against age-related declines in attention, including among
individuals at-risk for Alzheimer’s disease."
10896752,"Project Summary
Hox genes are crucial for patterning the early embryo along the anterior-posterior axis in all bilateral animal
species. Hox dysregulation leads to severe developmental defects, including homeotic transformations. During
early developmental time points and in pluripotent stem cells, Hox genes are repressed by the Polycomb group
complexes (PcG). They are then activated by extracellular patterning signals like retinoid acid (RA) acting on
RAREs (retinoic acid response elements), which activate the anterior Hox genes within the cluster. A CCCTC-
binding factor (CTCF)-dependent boundary between Hox5 and Hox6 acts as an insulator, allowing for the RA
signaling to activate only anterior genes maintaining PcG repression on posterior Hox genes. Recent
developments in the field have characterized a sufficient boundary element to include CTCF and MAZ, a myc-
associated zinc finger protein. Thus, this project aims to study activators and repressors further, which will be
crucial for explaining the minimal elements sufficient to recapitulate epigenetic memory. By taking advantage of
synthetic DNA technology developed in collaboration with the Boeke lab I can insert a highly editable synthetic
Hox cluster (SynHoxA) into a pre-determined ectopic locus. This system allows for highly sensitive
transcriptional and chromatin analyses of different SynHoxA variants. Using this system, we recently showed
that the ectopic SynHox cluster itself contains all the information necessary to decode patterning signals. Thus,
I propose to use the SynHoxA system to dissect the remaining two regulatory components required for a Hox
cluster to respond to patterning signals. Aim 1 will tackle the relative contributions of RARE by testing whether
the anterior Hox activation domain is a product of the additive RARE activity or whether each RARE activates
specific Hox genes. I will measure the transcriptional output and chromatin modifications of SynHox variants
carrying mutations of RARE to compare RARE activation of the anterior cluster. Aim 2 will identify PcG
recruitment elements (PREs) and nucleation sites, which have not been identified in mammalian cells nor in
the HoxA cluster. Although the ectopic SynHoxA cluster recruits PRC II, we find no evidence of it interacting
with PRC II nucleation sites in trans. Therefore, I will generate overlapping constructs that can undergo a
typical promoter bashing strategy to isolate “PRE-like” minimal elements. Finally, I will create a minimal
construct containing all three elements required for epigenetic memory: activators (RARE), repressors (PcG),
and boundary elements (CTCF+MAZ).
This study will elucidate how Hox clusters receive patterning signal information and store it into stable
epigenetic memory. This model will add to previous studies that have looked at the binding behavior of the
activators without the context of chromatin boundaries and the establishment of transient signals and vice
versa."

The discovery of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in AML, and the accompanying functional implications of the resulting
neomorphic activity of these mutated enzymes, has resulted in FDA approved targeted therapies. Similarly, the
changes brought about in methylation due to IDH mutations in the AML genome have ushered in treatment
regimens combining venetoclax with hypomethylating agents. In this setting, where traditional chemotherapy
regimens also are applied for treatment of primary diagnoses, the available outcomes data for all three
therapeutic approaches should now provide clear metrics of predicted response, given the correct analytical
methods. However, given a lack of direct comparison studies, no guidance exists as to which treatment choice
will provide best response in IDH-mutated patients. Furthermore, emerging data about the importance of the
biologic context on the response to different agents, including co-existing gene mutations and patient age, pose
additional questions that need to be systematically addressed in order to provide patients with the best treatment.
In order to address this imminent question, and provide data-driven treatment decision support for the ~20% of
AML patients harboring IDH mutations, we are proposing a carefully designed, translational study:
To directly compare the response of IDH-directed and non-IDH directed targeted therapy, we designed the first
head-to-head comparison trial for older and unfit IDH-mutated patients. This long overdue study will provide
information about treatment response, as well as first insights into the optimal sequence of treatments, with
respect to co-existing molecular features. The trial will be complemented by correlative studies that aim to assess
the utility of clonal outgrowth tracking and residual disease assessment for possible dynamic treatment
adjustments (iDATA trial, Aim 1). Utilizing the AML patient collection from the Alliance for Clinical Trials in
Oncology, as well as our newly established multicenter collaboration between six major US Cancer Centers, we
have assembled the thus far largest cohort of 930 IDH-mutated adult AML patients, treated with standard
cytotoxic chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents or IDH-directed or non-directed targeted inhibitors. Following
our experience in genomic risk stratification models, we are equipped to identify markers predictive of treatment
response based on treatment type and genomic context (Aim 2). Lastly, to better understand resistance and
escape mechanisms to targeted and non-targeted therapies, we will leverage our large longitudinal specimen
collections provide a comprehensive molecular characterization of the leukemic clones during different disease
and treatment stages; including clonal and subclonal evolution, identification of clone-specific altered cellular
pathways and epigenetic changes at each stage (Aim 3).
We are confident that this comprehensive approach, executed by a skilled investigator team will shift current
clinical practice paradigms towards data-driven and personalized treatment approaches."

This Gordon Research Conference (GRC), “Endothelial Cell Phenotypes in Health and Disease”, and the
accompanying Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) have the underlying hypothesis that an improved
understanding of endothelial cell phenotypes provides basic knowledge crucial to promote vascular repair and
enable tissue regeneration for the large collection of diseases with vascular dysfunction. The goals of this
conference are to therefore to address existing knowledge and communication gaps by bringing together
researchers at all levels who study endothelial cell biology and heterogeneity with those who study vascular
disease, bioimaging, and tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Each of these fields has recently
developed novel paradigms, tools and models to bring forward this goal, and integration between the fields is
predicted to move all of them forward towards the translation of basic discoveries into clinical benefit. The GRC
Chair and Vice-Chair are leaders in the field and well-suited to organize the meeting. The Chairs will ensure
that the meeting goals are accomplished by bringing together a selected group of 150 researchers to a small,
semi-isolated site for a week, with a meeting structure designed to foster extensive discussion of largely
unpublished data, and in a venue that promotes informal interactions and networking through shared meals
and afternoon social activities that especially benefit trainees. Invited speakers were chosen based on
excellence in research, topic, and willingness to engage trainees, as well as geographic diversity and gender
balance. Participants will be chosen based on topic and demographics. Female and minority speakers have
been invited, and those groups will be encouraged to apply as participants. The GRS pre-meeting will be
organized by trainees for trainees to facilitate knowledge exchange and networking and provide them with a
peer group as they transition into the larger meeting. Together, the GRC and GRS will thereby foster lasting
interdisciplinary interactions and collaborations amongst NIH-funded and international vascular biologists to
impart a strong and lasting impact on the field whose progression is now more timely and urgent than ever,
with the growing knowledge of that vascular health is key not only for lifespan but also health span."
10874404,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel theranostic agents targeting CD46 for imaging and treatment
of multiple myeloma (MM). CD46 is a novel therapeutic target, with a cognate antibody-drug conjugate, FOR46,
now in phase 1 clinical trials. Our preliminary data demonstrate high expression of CD46 in MM. In this proposal,
we develop and implement [89Zr]DFO-YS5 and [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 as imaging and therapeutic agents targeting
MM. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that CD46 is an effective target for molecular imaging and therapy
of MM. In this proposal we test this hypothesis in preclinical models, and in a pilot study of patients with MM.
In order to test this hypothesis, we have assembled an experienced team of chemists, biologists, imaging
scientists, physicists, and physicians to evaluate this method in preclinical models and in patients. In specific aim
1, we will develop [89Zr]DFO-YS5 and [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 as PET imaging and therapeutic agents for MM. In
specific aim 2, we will develop new co-treatment approaches to maximize CD46 expression, and use these to
augment [89Zr]DFO-YS5 PET and [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 treatment. In aim 3, we perform a pilot [89Zr]DFO-YS5 PET
imaging study in patients with MM, and analyze the data to determine its sensitivity for detecting sites of disease.
The methods developed in this proposal will ultimately be used to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic
approaches in MM, to help reduce morbidity and mortality for this disease."
10874538,"ABSTRACT
There are >6 million individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in the US; this is
predicted to triple in the next 30 years. Research indicates that those with dementia have substantially greater
healthcare utilization. Yet, dementia represents only the extreme end of a chronic progressive disorder. Fully
characterizing patterns of healthcare utilization across the continuum of cognitive impairment is
critical to (i) planning resource use in our aging population, and (ii) identifying areas where care might
be modified/improved. In particular, better understanding care patterns in early stages of cognitive
impairment could be crucial since modifications may be easier for those with less disease burden.
Indeed, growing research suggests changes in healthcare utilization may begin even with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI). However, the limited studies generally lack either rigorous data on cognitive status, integrate
health services data from 10-15+ years in the past, or include very small samples. Thus, we propose to
evaluate the spectrum of cognitive health in relation to healthcare utilization, including ADRD drugs and end of
life (EOL) care, in 4 ongoing cohorts at the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center (RADC). All participants receive
annual, harmonized cognitive assessments and neurologic exams, with ~90% followup; this includes 2,317
older individuals with linked Medicare fee-for-service claims from 2010-19 (11,000PY of followup: 2000PY for
MCI, 1200PY for dementia). Further, 20% of participants are African American (AA), enabling initial work on
cognition and health services focused in AAs, who have high risk of MCI and dementia; this will also establish
a platform for future research as the RADC AA cohort continues to expand. Briefly, we will compare
participants diagnosed as no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, and dementia at each annual cohort evaluation,
considering differences in the subsequent year in their utilization of outpatient and inpatient services (Aim 1),
and ADRD drug prescription fills (Aim 2). Aim 2 will focus on examining participant and disease characteristics
that may be related to prescription fills. In Aim 3, we will compare EOL care across decedents diagnosed with
NCI, MCI or dementia. Finally, while cohort data are essential to validly studying the continuum of cognition,
cohorts often target specific participants; in Aim 4, we will enhance larger translation of cohort findings by
assessing any differences in health services, ADRD drugs, and EOL care between RADC participants versus
the general Medicare population. We will then apply statistical methods, as needed, to “mimic” our results in
larger groups of the general Medicare population. Impact: By comprehensively evaluating differences in
healthcare utilization across the continuum of cognition, we can begin to detect stages where care is accessed
differentially, including types of care which may be affected. This will both inform targeted interventions to
optimize health services, and improve future resource planning."
10874409,"Every year more than 15,000 – 30,000 Veterans and service members suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI)
according to the Department of Defense (DOD). Mortality from TBI is high and many survivors suffer from
reduced life expectancy and persistent disability, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which might
be due to autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction. ANS dysfunction can be quantified by reduced heart
rate variability (HRV) and baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (BRS), which are associated with poor neurological
outcomes, arrhythmias, and death. The proposed studies will assess TBI-impaired central neuronal circuitry to
address the overall hypothesis that TBI-induced dysautonomia is not only a prognostic biomarker, but also a
pathogenic element compromising Veteran's health. This proposal investigates the amygdala, a brain region that
is related to fear, anxiety and PTSD, as well as in behavioral pathology following TBI, but is under-studied in the
ANS dysfunction following TBI. The amygdala is of interest because it: 1) controls ANS responses in humans
and rodents; 2); is damaged in human TBI and animal models; and 3) contributes to fear and anxiety in humans
and rodents. This constellation of factors is critical for Veterans health.
 A novel, rotational TBI model, that is bioengineered to mimic human injury will be employed in male and
female rats. This TBI model induces behavioral and ANS deficits, and damages the amygdala. The proposed
studies will implement a multi-faceted approach to examine cardiovascular (CV) disturbances following TBI by
monitoring blood pressure (BP) via surgically implanted radiotelemetry units from which heart rate (HR) , HRV,
and BRS will be derived in awake freely moving male and female rats during: 1) inactive, resting states; 2)
pharmacological stressors that disturb CV homeostasis; 3) pharmacological and chemogenetic manipulation of
the amygdala; and 4) fear conditioning with correlation between amygdala-dependent behaviors and CV
parameters.
 Aim 1 will examine the role of the amygdala in dysautonomia after TBI using HRV and BRS in response to
pharmacological stressors (systemic phenylephrine and nitroprusside) and amygdala microinjections. The
basolateral (BLA) and central amygdala (CeA) will be targeted with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists
or antagonists because GABAergic neurons control amygdala outflow to behavioral circuits and CV centers.
 Aim 2 will assess chemogenetic manipulation of amygdala circuits on CV control. Excitatory or inhibitory
DREADDs (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) will be expressed in the amygdala. HRV
and BRS will be evaluated at rest and following BP changes due to pharmacological stressors with DREADD
ligand or vehicle to confirm amygdala neurons as a potential therapeutic target for ANS dysfunction after TBI.
 Aim 3 will quantify the relationship between amygdala mediated fear behaviors and ANS parameters
following TBI. Behaviors during amygdala-dependent cued fear conditioning, extinction and reinstatement will
be recorded simultaneously with HRV and BRS following TBI. The impact of fear conditioning on recovery after
TBI will be tested by measuring CV parameters, body weight, and global neurological function.
 This proposal will identify neurophysiological and neuroanatomical processes underlying ANS dysfunction
consequent to TBI as novel targets for development of innovative treatment strategies. This award will provide
a solid foundation for career development with the expectation of encompassing a range of related fields of study
in the future. The basic methodological approach employed here has powerful translational potential to Veterans
because these parameters can be monitored non-invasively in humans over long periods of time during normal
activities at rest and during stress. The short-term goal will assess TBI related ANS dysfunction contributing to
CV and mood disorders, such as anxiety or PTSD. The long-term goal will define the central circuitry as a
therapeutic target for Veterans that are suffering from TBI to improve their quality of life and long-term survival."

 Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) and neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) impose major health threats on
neonates. Although CMV and HSV are lifelong infections with periods of latency and reactivation, most maternal
infections remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific or absent clinical symptoms. In the United States, a child is
permanently disabled by cCMV infection every hour, even though 9 of 10 infants are asymptomatic after birth and
remain undiagnosed. Invasive nHSV, on the other hand, is a rare neonatal infection that presents with a broad
range of clinical symptoms, including those that may be life-threatening. Viral culture and DNA detection by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have become the “Gold Standard” for the diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection,
despite poor sensitivity of PCR assays in neonates and time consuming culture techniques (up to 5-7 days).
 Universal genotyping of pathogen genomic sequences using High Resolution Melt (U-HRM) provides a simple,
low cost, rapid, and modern alternative to viral cultures and PCR techniques. By measuring the fluorescence of
an intercalating dye as PCR-amplified pathogen DNA or RNA fragments are heated and disassociate, sequence
defined melt curves, or “fingerprints”, are generated with single-nucleotide resolution in a closed-tube reaction.
These unique microbial “fingerprints” are then automatically identified and quantified using machine learning
technology, with an accuracy of 99-100% on minimal blood volume (1 mL), in a platform called NeoChip. Presently,
we have established unique signature melt curves for 40 bacterial species and antimicrobial resistance genes that
commonly infect neonates. Additionally, NeoChip has been expanded to distinguish individually amplified melt
curve signatures for multiple pathogen identification and quantification, as required for polymicrobial infection.
 In this proposal, we will build out NeoChip’s comprehensive database by incorporating clinical strains of CMV
and HSV with actionable antiviral resistance genes. Because NeoChip identifies variances in nucleic acid
sequences, individual differentiation and quantification of CMV and HSV strains are possible. We will also translate
the NeoChip for specific and rapid diagnosis of cCMV and nHSV infection in a large prospective clinical study of
pregnant women and their offspring(s), as well as directly compare the platform to standard quantitative nucleic
acid test (QNAT) assays, IgG/IgM antibody testing, and clinical outcome measures for statistical concordance
(predictive value). Finally, we will validate and translate NeoChip for cCMV detection and clinical correlation using
dried blood spot (DBS) samples for incorporation into standard universal newborn screening programs. NeoChip’s
goal is to provide an accurate and valid test for the timely diagnosis of pathogen etiology (viral, bacterial, and
fungal) in a single test with efficacy on broad tissue matrices and capacity to inform microbial resistance, thereby
facilitating early administration of targeted antimicrobials and therapeutics. This proposal directly addresses the
funding call by applying a multidisciplinary approach to address the biomedical challenges of rapidly and accurately
diagnosing cCMV and nHSV to facilitate disease prognostication and early therapeutic or intervention programs."

all RI-INBRE operations, which can be broadly divided into two categories. The first category includes managing
key research and training activities. This consists of the Developmental Research Projects Program, the
Centralized Research Core Facility, the Data Science – Molecular Informatics Core, the Summer Undergraduate
Research Fellowship program, the Student Research Program, the Teaching Postdoctoral Fellowship program,
and the Workforce Development and Training program. The second category of AC activities is administrative
and includes overseeing fiscal management and program assessment and coordinating the three governance
committees: External Advisory, Steering, and Executive. In the renewal period, the AC will ensure the smooth
operation of all program components, including program evaluation and reporting. The Student Research
Program in the AC will intentionally train a diverse pool of students via mentored research opportunities. Key
initiatives in this renewal include expanding paid academic-year research opportunities for underrepresented
students and coordinating student skillset training in the Workforce Development and Training program. The AC
will modify the existing Teaching Postdoctoral Fellowship program to be a DEI-focused cohort-based training
program. Reorganizing the Faculty Sabbatical Program at Community College of Rhode Island will boost
community college participation in RI-INBRE training programs. These efforts will enhance the research
environment, promote faculty development, and bolster student training, all of which will encourage the creation
of a dynamic and well-trained biomedical workforce and act as a catalyst for investment and entrepreneurship in
the biomedical sciences in Rhode Island."

The overarching goal of the Rhode Island IDeA-Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (RI-INBRE) program
is to improve institutional capacity for biomedical research excellence and student experiential training in the State
of Rhode Island. The primary function of the RI-INBRE Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP) is to
design and oversee a diversity of competitive funding mechanisms designed to meet the varying research needs
and career stages of participating investigators at all nine RI-INBRE network institutions. This includes two
research-intensive institutions, six Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) and one community college. The
RI-INBRE Research Project mechanisms include Early Career Development awards for early-career investigators
at URI/Brown and the PUIs and Collaborative Research awards for early-career faculty at the PUIs who
collaborate with an established URI/Brown investigator. The DRPP also solicits and evaluates applications for the
training-intensive Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship awards for PUI investigators. In the renewal
period, the DRPP will continue to adjust its funding structures and activities to better support the developmental
research pathways for students, postdoctoral fellows, and early-stage investigators. We will create pilot awards
to provide seed funding for very early-stage investigators. In addition, we will create proposal development pilot
awards to support investigators collecting preliminary data for extramural proposals. These mechanisms will
complement the existing DRPP awards by providing additional defined steps on the developmental scaffold. This
will help early career investigators to move toward independence and competitiveness for research grants. We
will expand our pool of external mentoring consultants to provide early-career investigators with independent
expert advice. Expanding research training opportunities for underrepresented students and postdoctoral fellows
will produce a diverse pool of trainees ready to fill biomedical positions in Rhode Island. Taken together, these
new DRPP initiatives will improve the training environment for multiple levels of the biomedical research

Our proposal aims to co-design and pilot trial the implementation of a package of brief
interventions for suicide prevention among youth (12-24 years of age) delivered by Peers (YPF-
SuPP). YPF-SuPP will contain two evidenced-based interventions tested in South Asia (safety
planning and contact follow up) with two core innovations: safety plans delivered through a
personalized youth-designed jewelry and protocolized strategies to culturally and safely engage
trusted family members to support youth. We will leverage a nationally renowned non-
governmental organization (Social Changemakers and Innovators – SOCHAI) in Nepal and their
well-supported Peer Volunteer workforce to deliver YPF-SuPP alongside the existing health
system. We establish an implementation system that provides supportive supervision to Peers.
Using equity-informed and participatory mixed methods we will establish two advisory boards, a
Youth Advisory Board and a Community Advisory Board of local adolescent mental health
clinicians, suicide experts, teachers, family members of youth with lived experience of suicide,
and youth advocates. We focus our work on a marginalized municipality of Makwanpur District,
focusing on providing care to care for minority ethnicities (Tamang and Chepang) in Nepal. We
will identify successes and improvement based on operationalized benchmarks to move on to a
fully powered hybrid type 2 clinical trial. Youth clinical outcomes include suicide-related coping,
suicide ideation severity, and mental health service use, among other secondary and mechanistic
domains. Implementation outcomes include reach, adoption, acceptability, appropriateness,
fidelity, and potential for sustainment.
This

10926888,"Project Summary
Peri-implantitis is a prevalent, destructive, inflammatory disease that leads to loss of jawbone around dental
implants and impairments in oral health-related quality of life. It poses a public health concern because bone
loss progresses at a rapid rate and does not respond therapeutically to conventional periodontal antibacterial
therapies. Multiple human studies have firmly established that implant hygiene and tribocorrosion generate
implant degradation products, such as titanium microparticles, which are associated with inflammation in a
large fraction of peri-implantitis cases, i.e., Titanium (Ti)-mediated peri-implantitis. While it is well documented
that titanium microparticles alter peri-implant immune surveillance primarily by inducing oxidative stress, the
effects that these changes have on the peri-implant microbiome have not been adequately investigated.
The proposed research aims to investigate the genetic mechanisms employed by Veillonella parvula, a
bridging microorganism in oral biofilms, to survive and cross-protect oral pathogens in response to
environmental oxidative stress. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that increased free titanium levels in
peri-implant plaque are associated with a significant reduction in the biodiversity of the peri-implant biofilms
that is coupled with the overgrowth of V. parvula. Strong preliminary data point to an antioxidant catalase
enzyme encoded by the katA gene as being a key survival system that enables V. parvula’s survival while
most peri-implant commensal bacteria are depleted by Titanium-mediated oxidative burst. Importantly,
Veillonella demonstrates widespread mutualism with oral pathogens, such as P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum
and its catalase protects the latter from oxidative damage suggesting a community-level regulatory role. In this
project, we will determine (i) the exact mechanisms used by V. parvula to survive oxidative stress, (ii) the role
of katA and other key antioxidant enzymes in modulating biofilm oxidative tolerance, and (iii) the ability of oral
pathogens to leverage Veillonella’s katA to colonize and survive in the oral mucosa soft tissue barrier during Ti-
mediated inflammation. The long-term goal of this work is to identify the drivers of microbiome dysbiosis in
peri-implantitis and to develop efficacious antimicrobial strategies for the management of peri-implant
diseases. The objective of the proposed work is to assess the hypothesis that survival mechanisms of
commensal Veillonella spp., which enable their overgrowth in this niche are leveraged by oral pathogens to
colonize peri-implant microbial communities and lead to clinical disease. The proposed objective will be
completed in two main Aims: 1) to identify how titanium-mediated inflammation promotes V. parvula
overgrowth, and 2) to determine the extent to which V. parvula alters polymicrobial infection course in vivo.
These findings will provide important insights in the role of oral commensal bacteria in modulating microbiome
dysbiosis and will introduce novel therapeutic targets of peri-implantitis treatments."
10899345,"RESEARCH SUMMARY
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) accounts for the largest percentage of active substance use disorders. One
prominent trait of AUD is compulsive use despite adverse consequences. Previous work has found that animals
who drink alcohol in excess display diminished lateral habenula (LHb) activity, a brain region widely
acknowledged to participate in aversive behaviors, suggesting that LHb hypoactivity may be an integral factor in
compulsive alcohol use. However, mechanisms that contribute to these reductions in LHb activity have not been
fully explored. Comprehensive assessment of LHb plasticity in preclinical models of AUD through the
measurement of afferent neurotransmission dynamics could offer potential insight into a neurobiological basis
for the reduced LHb activity observed in aversion resistance. One afferent region of particular interest is the
ventral pallidum (VP). Recent findings have shown that VP glutamate (VPGlu) neurons, which project extensively
into the LHb, contribute to adaptive constraint of natural reward consumption and reduction of drug-seeking
actions. Yet, there remains a significant knowledge gap concerning potential alterations of LHb-projecting VP
neurons that arise in response to the development of aversion-resistant alcohol use. Clarifying the changes that
occur in both multiregional and VP-specific afferent input is necessary to improve our understanding of
physiological alterations preventing normative aversive behavior in aversion-resistant drinking. Thus, the broad
goal of the proposed work is to elucidate neurobiological adaptations of LHb afferent projections during
compulsive alcohol consumption.
The primary objective of this proposal is twofold: first, to investigate the impact of alcohol use on afferent
neurotransmission into the LHb during aversion resistant alcohol consumption, and second, to explore the
significance of VP-to-LHb projections in this behavior. Given that afferent input from several distinct brain regions
has been shown to influence aversive behavior and alcohol misuse, I hypothesize that LHb afferent
neurotransmission is adaptably dysregulated in animals that exhibit aversion resistant alcohol use,
which may be due in part to changes in activity of VP inputs. To test this hypothesis, I will use in vivo fiber
photometry to record neurotransmitter activity in the LHb and optogenetics to manipulate VP-to-LHb projections
during aversion-resistant alcohol consumption alongside histological techniques to quantify neurochemical
content of LHb projections. Experiments proposed here will advance our understanding of the neural
mechanisms underlying aversion-resistant alcohol use, establishing a foundation for future research examining
LHb-associated neural circuitry in compulsive alcohol use. Throughout this proposal, I will gain valuable training
in the execution of behavioral neuroscience experiments, in vivo neurotransmitter recording methods, neuronal
manipulation techniques, histological processing, and advanced computational strategies. This project will allow
me to build a firm foundation for a successful career as an independent investigator."
10899350,"Project Summary
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as myocardial infarction and stroke are the leading causes of death in the
United States (US), and widespread disparities in CVD burden exist across socioeconomic, racial, and ethnic
groups. High blood pressure (BP), or hypertension (HTN), is the most prevalent risk factor for CVD.
Importantly, higher BP in young adulthood, even within the clinically normal range, tracks with cumulative
lifetime exposure to elevated BP levels, leading to earlier development of clinical HTN and significantly greater
CVD risk, despite use of optimal antihypertensive therapy later in life. Primordial prevention of BP elevation is
therefore needed to reduce HTN-related morbidity. Social determinants of health (SDOH) could contribute to
observed disparities in uncontrolled BP and increasing proportions of HTN among US adults. Notably, early life
SDOH have been associated with epigenetic changes in DNA methylation (DNAm), potentially accelerating
HTN and CVD development, but limited work has considered long-term relationships between early life SDOH,
epigenetic mechanisms, and CVD risk factors. Our overarching hypothesis is that early life SDOH are
associated with young adult BP levels, and that DNAm statistically mediates these associations. To examine
this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) investigate early life SDOH and young adult BP
associations, 2) investigate temporal associations between DNAm and young adult BP, evaluating DNAm as a
mediator of SDOH-BP associations, and 3) replication to examine the durability of these associations. We will
primarily utilize the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), a diverse prospective cohort study
collecting phenotype, genotype, epigenetic, and parental data in children from birth to young adulthood. In Aim
1, multi-trajectory modeling and latent class analysis will assess SDOH trajectories and cumulative exposures.
Aim 2 will involve epigenome-wide association and mixed-effect models to examine repeated longitudinal
measures of SDOH and DNAm. Standard and high-dimensional mediation analyses can quantify DNAm
effects within SDOH-BP associations. Aim 3 replication of FFCWS association and mediation analyses will be
performed in the diverse community-based CARDIA cohort, which has collected extensive SDOH, phenotype,
genotype, and epigenetic data in participants from young adulthood through middle age. This work will provide
longitudinal insight into the complex interplay between SDOH, epigenetics, and BP, deepening our
understanding of primordial risk factor prevention and tailored interventions to prevent HTN. If awarded, this
fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and CVD fields, gain competency in the
development and application of biomedical informatics and analytical methods, and improve my writing and
presentation skills, while learning from a sponsor team with extensive subject matter and mentorship expertise.
Completion of this project and training will prepare me for my career goal of becoming an independent
academic investigator, using data science and informatics tools to research SDOH and improve public health."
10893635,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem in the United States that affects 37 million
Americans and disproportionately burdens racial and ethnic minority populations. Advances in personalized
medicine approaches for patients with CKD lag behind advances in other fields. Current approaches to
classifying CKD do not provide granular insight into the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the
heterogeneity of the disease. To address this gap, NIDDK established the Kidney Precision Medicine Project
(KPMP) in 2016 with the overarching goal of using deep molecular phenotypes of kidney biopsies, along with
longitudinal clinical phenotypic data to develop new disease ontologies and treatments for kidney disease. This
proposal for a University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) KPMP CKD Recruitment Site brings together a diverse
multidisciplinary team of experienced investigators with expertise in nephrology, renal pathology, interventional
radiology, bioethics, social determinants of health, and biostatistics. Our team has a successful track record in
recruiting and retaining large and diverse populations of patients with CKD in long-term studies. This proposal
has three overarching goals: 1) Utilize our well-established and successful recruitment strategies to enroll 100
participants (50% non-Hispanic Black, 30% Hispanic) from the University of Illinois Health Science System and
a large affiliated federally qualified health center to undergo high-quality research kidney biopsies, conforming
to the highest ethical, research and clinical standards; 2) Leverage the infrastructure of the UIC Chronic Renal
Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study Clinical Center to enroll 50 eligible CRIC participants into KPMP, providing
an unprecedented opportunity to link data from this deeply phenotyped cohort with KPMP kidney biopsy
measures; and 3) Implement a systematic assessment of neighborhood-level measures of social determinants
of health which will advance the overall mission of KPMP to better characterize disease subgroups. We will
use an established real-time electronic health record-based reporting system to identify eligible individuals in
the two health care systems and then engage potential participants in an open discussion of the risks and
benefits of a research kidney biopsy. Additionally, we will utilize patient-centered strategies to maintain long-
term patient engagement and achieve high rates of retention with the guidance of a local Community Advisory
Board composed of key stakeholders (i.e., patients, a caretaker, and a primary care provider). Leveraging our
expertise and experience working with NIDDK U01 cooperative projects, we will rapidly and effectively
implement the KPMP protocol, work collaboratively with the consortium, and will make substantial contributions
to the long-term scientific mission of KPMP to develop precision medicine-based approaches for treating
kidney disease."

The overall goal of this project is to investigate the role of Zika virus (ZIKV) in glaucoma pathobiology. ZIKV is
an emerging viral pathogen that causes microcephaly and leads to severe ocular complications in newborns
born to ZIKV infected mothers. Although the ocular manifestations of ZIKV are primarily reported to affect the
posterior segment of the eye resulting in chorioretinal atrophy, withering of the retina and choroid, and optic
nerve abnormalities, several clinical case reports showed the involvement of the anterior segment resulting in
glaucoma. Studies from our laboratory, as well as those of others, have shown that ZIKV can cause
glaucomatous pathology including an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP), retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss,
and optic nerve damage. The offspring of ZIKV infected dams have shown increased IOP and RGC loss and the
presence of anti-flavivirus-antibody in these mice correlates with significantly enhanced glaucoma pathology due
to antibody-dependent enhancement. Until the recent ZIKV epidemics, glaucoma has been primarily considered
as a genetic and age-related disease and has not been reported among infants exposed to infection during
gestation. Several studies have now reported that ZIKV can cause congenital glaucoma in infants born from
mothers who were infected during pregnancy. Considering the fact that there is an endemic transmission of ZIKV
in >84 countries, it is imperative to investigate the link between ZIKV and glaucoma to develop new prognostic
and therapeutic tools to combat this global health threat. Our laboratory has developed several in vitro and in
vivo models to study the pathobiology of ocular ZIKV infections. In our recent study, we reported that ZIKV can
infect and replicate in human primary Trabecular Meshwork cells (HTMC). More recently, we performed RNAseq
analysis and discovered that ZIKV infection of HTMC leads to transcriptomic alteration and dysregulation of
several pathways including those that modulate ER stress response, autophagy, hypoxia, and ECM organization.
Furthermore, ZIKV-infected mice exhibited increased IOP, ER stress, and autophagy in the anterior segment of
the eye. ZIKV infection also caused RGC death and loss of RGC and optic nerve damage leading to disruption
of anterograde axonal transport. Based on these novel findings, we hypothesize that ZIKV induces ER stress
and autophagy resulting in TM death and dysfunction, increased IOP, and the development of glaucoma. Two
specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine the role of ZIKV induced ER stress in
TM dysfunction and the pathobiology of glaucoma using C57BL/6 (WT) and IFNAR1-/- mice/pups and whether
the reduction of ER stress alleviates ZIKV induced glaucomatous pathology. Aim 2 will investigate the role of
autophagy using HTMC, and mouse models and evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of an FDA approved drug,
hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in ZIKV induced glaucoma. The anticipated results will establish the role of ZIKV
infection in the pathogenesis of glaucoma and elucidate the molecular mechanisms and pathway-mediated
therapeutic targets for future treatments."

Sanfilippo disease (mucopolysaccharidosis type III; MPS III) is a devastating neurodegenerative lysosomal
storage disorder of childhood whose pathologic features are neurologic: slowing of development, severe
behavioral problems, progressive cognitive decline, dementia, and decline in motor skills leading to immobility,
unresponsiveness, and death. We have focused on MPS IIID caused by a deficiency of alpha-N-
acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase (GNS). Because MPS IIID is rare (1 in a million) and affects the brain (which is
difficult to treat) no cure or treatment is available and there are at least five patients in the USA to our knowledge.
Sanfilippo patient organizations have 19 additional cases registered around the world (see letter of support). Dr.
Patricia Dickson and Dr. Tsui-Fen Chou (LABioMed) have developed an enzyme replacement treatment (ERT)
for MPS IIID. Our strategy proposes to deliver recombinant human alpha-N-acetylglucosamine-6-sulfatase
(rhGNS) via intracerebroventricular infusion to effectively treat the underlying causes of the neurologic symptoms
that dominate MPS III pathology. ERTs can have a dramatic effect on the quality of life and patient development
especially when administered early in developments. There are several examples of successfully
commercialized ERT’s (e.g. laronidase (MPS I), idursulfase (MPS II), etc.) and BioMarin recently received
approval for an ERT for a form of Batten disease, CLN2. Other ERTs for MPS I, II, and IIIB are in Phase I trials.
Both the FDA and investors are familiar with ERT and its commercialization path, which will greatly increase the
chances of reaching a clinical trial. LABioMed has filed a US patent on rhGNS and Phoenix Nest, Inc. has
licensed it. Our pivotal nonclinical and manufacturing plans are on track.
We had a positive interaction with the FDA and got guidance for moving our program into the clinics. In
preparation for the interventional study the recommendation was for a thorough natural history study (NHS) in
the available patient population with a broad net to capture endpoints that are most likely to predict the clinical
benefits in each individual. Since the number of diagnosed patients is small the collected data form each
individual would be their own control at the time of intervention, where the patient will receive the recombinant
enzyme. Most of the work will be executed by contracted service providers. The clinical trial itself will be
conducted at Columbia University under the guidance of Dr. Chung. She has experience with over 10 clinical
trials interventional and observational. The clinical protocol was designed by the team at Phoenix Nest with help
of KOLs and clinical experts in the MPS III field. We have engaged expert third party clinical service providers to
help with the execution, monitoring and data collection. Crucial data collected from the patients on this study will
help us develop clinical outcomes that will be tools for measuring the efficacy of our rhGNS therapy and will be
primary endpoints on the pivotal study. The success on this trial will put a step closer to executing the pivotal
trial to assess the efficacy of our experimental therapy and its commercialization."

 Viral infections are known to produce double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a molecule that is not present at
high levels in uninfected host cells. This property of dsRNA is exploited by cells to sense viral infection and
deploy anti-viral countermeasures. While DNA viruses produce viral mRNA molecules that look identical to
cellular RNA, many DNA viruses are thought to produce dsRNA due to the process of symmetrical gene
transcription of both strands of DNA. When we looked for the presence of dsRNA during adenovirus (AdV)
infection using modern antibody-based techniques we found no evidence of dsRNA production, directly
countering the existing dogma. Considering many DNA viruses encode antagonists of cellular dsRNA-sensing
pathways, this directly calls into question the relevance of dsRNA sensing during DNA virus infection. While
wildtype AdV did not produce detectable dsRNA, viral mutants which can no longer splice their own transcripts
efficiently saw robust accumulation of dsRNA within the nucleus. Furthermore, these dsRNA-producing mutants
activated cytoplasmic sensors of dsRNA such as PKR and RNaseL. The use of mutant viruses provides a unique
opportunity to assess host responses to dsRNAs derived from DNA virus infection. Still, the question of how
these nuclear dsRNAs are detected by cytoplasmic sensors remains unanswered.
 By completion of this mentored career development award I will gain training in RNA sequencing,
quantitative mass spectrometry, and the bioinformatics approaches to analyze both. In the mentored phase I will
continue my training with AdV, a relatively simple virus that provides powerful tools to understand regulation and
sensing of DNA virus derived nuclear dsRNA. In the independent phase I will utilize herpes simplex virus (HSV-
1), a complex virus able to exert control over dsRNA-sensing pathways, as a model virus to study exploitation of
dsRNA for viral gene regulation. This proposal will reveal the binding partners and localizations of DNA virus
derived dsRNA as well as new strategies in which viruses exploit host cell gene regulatory machinery. In Aim 1
I will determine the localization and binding partners of viral dsRNA using immunoprecipitation coupled to next
generation sequencing and mass spectrometry. These experiments will determine how nuclear dsRNA leads to
activation of cytoplasmic sensors, as well as how AdV interacts with and blocks these novel pathways. In Aim 2
I will determine how HSV-1 regulates its own viral gene expression using the nuclear retention of overlapping
viral transcript pairs that form dsRNA. The outcome of these experiments will reveal a new mechanism for viral
gene regulation with broad implications for all herpesviruses. The outstanding training environment at CHOP
and the University of Pennsylvania, coupled with the excellent advisory committee I have assembled, will greatly
facilitate my research during the mentored phase as well as launch my career with the skills necessary to
transition to an independent faculty position studying how host cells sense the RNAs generated by DNA viruses."

Uganda, a low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), faces a high burden of disease, particularly communicable
diseases, which accounts for over 50% of the morbidity and mortality in the country. Over the past ten years,
Makerere University, the leading research-intensive institution of higher learning in the country, has become a
leader on the African continent in research that is working to address some of the highest impact health problems.
In just a decade, Makerere University has become the third highest recipient of biomedical research in Africa
with over $100 million in funding from the NIH alone. Makerere Universities College of Health Sciences is host
to the highest number of researchers and awardees of 25 active grants from NIH to Uganda. The growth in
research funding brings with it administrative requirements, such as financial management, grants management,
reporting processes and procurement systems. Alongside this growth in grants, there needs to be strong
research administration support staff who are experienced in the regulatory requirements and systems that
funders like the NIH use, as well as be able to be informed about regulatory changes and educate staff and
faculty in turn. At Makerere University, the research administration capacity, until recently, had not been able to
keep up with this rapid growth in funding. To address this discrepancy, the University is committed to supporting
the strengthening of research administration infrastructure for staff through continuing education, as well as the
establishment of standard operating procedures (SOPs) in order to ensure knowledge transfer and sustainability.
To do this, Makerere University College of Health Sciences is partnering with Northwestern University Havey
Institute for Global Health. This project is a continuation of work that the two institutions, longtime partners, have
engaged in since 2021 to share knowledge and practices to support the growth of research administration
infrastructure. Strengthening staff and institutional capacity in research administration at Makerere University will
cement a positive research culture and environment and benefit all who are working to improve the health of
disadvantaged populations within Uganda and sub-Saharan Africa. Specific aims of this project are: To
strengthen NIH grants administration at Makerere University College of Health Sciences by providing senior
researcher administrators with advanced training and mentored exposure to pre and post award best emergency
response grants management practices and standard operating procedures; and to develop training standard
operating practices (SOPs) for enhancing the implementation of institutional best grants management practices
at Makerere University and other Ugandan research partner institutions for best practices and continuous

Patients with gastroparesis often suffer with chronic symptoms that are not adequately treated due to both a
lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of gastroparesis and lack of effective treatments.
Participation of Temple University as a clinical center in the NIDDK Gastroparesis Clinical Research
Consortium (GpCRC) and Temple's proposed studies will help achieve the broad, long term objectives of
improving the understanding and treatment of patients with gastroparesis. The PI and Temple University are
well qualified to continue to be one of the clinical centers in the GpCRC. Temple University has extensive
clinical expertise in gastroparesis and has been active in study development, enrolling patients into studies,
manuscript publication, and obtaining funding for ancillary studies. The aims for Temple's renewal for the
GpCRC are threefold. First, to continue enrollment and follow-up of patients in current GpCRC studies: GpR3,
BESST, PBG, PSAG. We will maintain the Gastroparesis Registry 3 (GpR3) to enroll 400 patients with follow-
up on patients for 1 to 4 years. GpR3 was recently enhanced to study the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in patients
with gastroparesis. We continue to enroll in the clinical trial Buspirone for Early Satiety and Symptoms of
Gastroparesis (BESST). Our Pathological Basis of Gastroparesis (PBG) is studying immune cell profiles in
gastroparesis. We will start our study on pyloric pathophysiology: Pyloric Sphincter Abnormalities in Patients
with Gastroparesis Symptoms (PSAGS). Second, to better understand the clinical manifestations and
pathophysiology of patients with symptoms of gastroparesis, we will start a new registry, Gastroparesis
Registry 4 for enrollment of 400 new patients. This application includes suggestions for five areas of study: 1)
evaluating for autoimmune gastroparesis; 2) understanding meal eating characteristics and ARFID-like
symptoms in patients with gastroparesis; 3) assess for hypocortisolism which can occur in gastroparesis
patients and add to the symptom severity; 4) assessing for vagal and peripheral neuropathy as
pathophysiologic comorbidities in gastroparesis; and 5) further enhancement of gastric emptying scintigraphy
(GES) assessing antral synchronicity and antropyloroduodenal coordination. Third, to conduct a new
multicenter study investigating the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of gastroparesis. Our application
proposes a new study, Relating Gastric Pathophysiology using GES with DACS to Treatment Outcome, aimed
at understanding the pathophysiologic basis of gastroparesis and its relationship to symptoms. The goal is to
better target specific treatment based on pathophysiology and symptoms. Temple's participation and proposed
studies will help achieve the goal of the NIDDK GpCRC to advance our understanding and treatment of
gastroparesis."
10875627,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of our lab is to investigate immune regulation by innate cells for the treatment and resolution/repair of
central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases. During neuroinflammation the concerted actions of the
CNS and the immune system affect the pathological responses mediated by infiltrating and resident immune
cells. In particular, during multiple sclerosis (MS), myeloid cells are found in abundance within lesions. These
myeloid antigen-presenting cells (APCs) have the ability to phagocytose myelin debris, release neurotoxic factors
and promote the expansion and polarization of T cells in the CNS. However, they can also antagonize
inflammation and promote repair. The exact mechanism(s) by which the CNS environment regulates myeloid
APCs function during neuroinflammation remains ill defined.
Analysis of the transcripts associated with MS-like lesions in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE),
an animal model of MS, revealed a significant enrichment of genes associated with the Wnt/b-catenin pathway
as compared to non-lesioned areas. Binding of Wnt proteins to the cell surface receptor Frizzled (Fzd) inhibits
glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b) and b-catenin phosphorylation, allowing b-catenin translocation to the
nucleus and activates transcription of Wnt target genes. It has been demonstrated that Wnt signaling in dendritic
cells (DCs) plays a central role in regulating the balance between inflammatory vs. regulatory responses in the
gut. Blockade of GSK3b kinase was shown to increase IL-10 production by monocytes while suppressing the
release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, our preliminary results demonstrate that following activation
of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway, PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression were increased on human and mouse myeloid cells,
while IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-23 were reduced. Significantly, in EAE, Wnt agonist treatment decreased the
clinical severity of chronic and relapsing-remitting EAE.
Wnt proteins are naturally expressed in the CNS by brain endothelial cells (BBB-ECs) and astrocytes, and are
upregulated during neuroinflammation. These cells make the neurovascular unit (NVU), a structure serving as
an interface between the periphery and the CNS and hence directly exposed to the effects of peripheral and
CNS driven inflammation. We hypothesize that inflammatory signals at the neurovascular level induce Wnt
production by ECs and astroglial cells, which will regulate myeloid APCs function and promote anti-
inflammatory responses that support repair and limit neuropathology. Using in vitro and in vivo
approaches, our goal is to understand how Wnt ligands affect the immune response in the CNS and to determine
the possibility to manipulate it in order to regulate myeloid cell function to reduce CNS-inflammatory responses
and stimulate the repair mechanism."
10875628,"Excessive and ectopic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and smooth muscle-derived cells accumulate in 
diverse vascular diseases but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Seminal work from our 
lab as well as other labs indicate that SMC progenitors play a vital role in this process. In 
paradigm-shifting studies, we recently identified pools of SMC progenitors in the lung that we 
reasoned were primed to muscularize distal arterioles based on their location at the muscular- 
unmuscular border of each pulmonary arteriole and their molecular signature of expressing SMC 
markers and the undifferentiated mesenchyme marker platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR)-β. Upon exposing mice to hypoxia, expression of the ligand PDGF-B by lung endothelial cells 
and macrophages induces these ""primed"" cells to express the pluripotency factor Kruppel-like factor 
4 (KLF4) and in each arteriole, one of them migrates distally and clonally expands. This 
pathological muscularization results in pulmonary hypertension. Similarly, in atherosclerosis of 
systemic arteries, our recent results indicate that a single or rare SMC marker+ cells gives rise 
to most of the cells in an advanced plaque, and the vast majority of these cells have been shown to 
express markers of macrophages, stem cells or undifferentiated mesenchyme but not SMCs. Remarkably, 
our findings demonstrate that bone marrow-derived cells (most likely macrophages) non-cell 
autonomously regulate the number of SMCs recruited into a plaque and suggest that the number of SMC 
progenitors recruited into a plaque dictates the progression of atherosclerosis. Thus, these novel 
SMC progenitors are critical to the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension and atherosclerosis, but 
little is known regarding their origin, development, gene expression, maintenance and the 
mechanisms underlying their role in disease pathogenesis. In this proposal, we will use mouse 
models, isolated murine cells, human tissue and myeloid cells isolated from humans. We will 
identify SMC progenitors in the aorta and meticulously characterize both these progenitors and 
those in the pulmonary arterioles. In addition, we will delineate progenitor cell origins and 
development as well as their role in morphogenesis of the tunica media.
Mechanisms underlying their clonal expansion in disease and the non-cell autonomous regulation of 
progenitor cells will be investigated. Taken together, our research program promises to yield 
seminal insights into this novel progenitor cell type that is vitally important for vascular 
pathologies and thereby, provide therapeutic strategies for combatting lethal diseases of the 
vasculature, such as pulmonary hypertension and atherosclerosis."
10875665,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Childhood asthma is a common, burdensome disease for which there are currently no effective prevention
strategies. This is due in part to our limited understanding of the molecular determinants of asthma pathogene-
sis. As the development of asthma is highly influenced by genetic and environmental factors, assessment of
both genetic and metabolomic profiles can improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and identify
potential targets for treatment and prevention. The overall research objective of this proposal is to elucidate
metabolic and upstream genetic pathways underlying childhood asthma pathogenesis. Our central hypotheses
are that metabolic profiles at birth are associated with subsequent development of childhood asthma and that
this association is due in part to the effect of genetic variants on intermediate metabolic profiles and childhood
asthma. To test these central hypotheses, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) identify metabolic pro-
files at birth associated with the development of childhood asthma, and 2) determine the genetic contribution to
variation in metabolite concentrations at birth and identify genetic pathways linking metabolic profiles at birth
with childhood asthma. To achieve Aim 1, we will capitalize upon a unique resource of longitudinal birth co-
horts with newborn metabolic data and rich phenotypic data (n=6209 children). To achieve Aim 2, we will utilize
genotypes for children within the largest of these cohorts to perform a metabolite genome-wide association
study. We will then leverage these findings, along with summary statistics from the largest GWAS of childhood
asthma performed to date, to perform a genetic co-localization analysis.
The purpose of this K01 proposal is for Dr. Snyder to build on her prior training in maternal-child health epide-
miology and experience with utilizing metabolomics data in large epidemiologic studies by taking on leadership
roles in the conduct of epidemiologic studies, applying modern statistical methods for high-dimensional data,
and receiving advanced training in genetic epidemiology so that she can more effectively address fundamental
questions about upstream pathways of disease development. Through the comprehensive career development
plan applied directly to the research, the complementary expertise of the mentorship team, and an outstanding
institutional environment, Dr. Snyder will acquire the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to advance
her toward her long-term career goal of becoming a recognized leader in maternal-child health epidemiology,
with a focus on integrating genetics and metabolomics in large epidemiologic studies to understand and pre-
vent childhood respiratory diseases. The experience, training, and findings generated through this proposal will
result in Dr. Snyder developing critical research skills to move toward independence and the submission of a
highly competitive R01 application."
10875666,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Double faulting on match point is intensely disappointing. Yet it is also a performance error that could help
improve your future serve. ‘Limbic’ structures such as the lateral habenula (LHb), ventral pallidum (VP) and
ventral tegmental area (VTA) have classically been associated with hedonic functions. But this emphasis might
result from behaviorist traditions that train lab animals with rewards and punishments. A more general function
of the limbic system may be to impose valence on any prediction error, including mistakes that occur during
motor performance. If this is the case, then decades of progress on how the brain processes reward can
generalize to motor sequence tasks such as speech, sport, and musical performance. In past work, we
discovered that when a male songbird unexpectedly sings the right note, its VTA dopamine (DA) neurons are
activated in the same way as when a thirsty primate unexpectedly receives juice. And following song errors, its
DA neurons are suppressed as when a primate experiences disappointing reward omission. We also found that
when males sing to females, these performance evaluation signals are turned off and DA neurons are instead
activated by female calls. These discoveries have important implications for motor learning circuits that motivate
the proposed work. Frist, to determine how performance quality is evaluated in circuits upstream of VTA, we will
anatomically identify inputs to VTA, perform lesions to test which are necessary for song learning, record VTA
responses to microstimulation of distinct inputs, and conduct neural recordings to identify auditory error and/or
timing signals important for error computation (Aim 1). Second, in past work we identified the VP as a hub for
auditory, motor, and error processing during singing. In pilot experiments we are identifying LHb and subthalamic
nucleus (STN) as novel targets of VP that also project to VTA. To dissect VP’s role in performance evaluation,
we will anatomically define VP inputs and outputs, and will record STN-, LHb-, and motor cortex-projecting VP
neurons during singing (Aim 2). Finally, our past discovery that DA error signals are turned off when males sing
to females is unprecedented. To determine if DA signal gating is behaviorally relevant, we first test if males can
learn from experimentally controlled errors with females present (Aim 3.1). To test if error signals are gated off
globally, we will record neurons in VTA-projecting areas (auditory cortex, VP, STN, LHb) as we control both
perceived error and female presence (Aim 3.2). Altogether, these studies will identify the neural correlates of the
internal evaluation systems that construct motor sequences. A major impediment to understanding pathological
activity patterns observed in BG-related diseases is a limited understanding of signal propagation through the
healthy circuit. The proposed work aims to understand the functions of DA-BG signals and how they are
processed at successive stages of the circuit. At stake in this issue is the potential to tailor therapies, such as
neural circuit re-programming and deep brain stimulation for movement disorders, based on detailed knowledge
of normal brain physiology."
10875667,"Somatic mutations, present in some but not all cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in
neurological and psychiatric diseases. Somatic mutations that arise during the cell divisions of prenatal brain
development are inherited in clonal fashion and can cause neurodevelopmental diseases such as epilepsy and
intellectual disability, even when present at low levels of mosaicism. The previous funding period of this grant
developed new methods and algorithms to analyze somatic mutations in postmortem human brain, and
technologies to sequence the genomes of single neurons, and has shown that each neuron has a unique
genome, with hundreds of developmental mutations present at birth, and dozens more mutations being added
each year of life. During prenatal life, 2-3 mutations mark each cell division, so that mutations make in
principal a permanent record of each cell division. Integrating the analysis of DNA marks of cell lineage with
patterns of gene expression that identify the different neural types in human brain potentially now enables the
discovery of the first systematic picture of the pattern of cell divisions that generates the cells of the human
brain. In this project, we will apply our existing methods to provide several scientific discoveries not otherwise
attainable, providing tools of widespread utility to the genetics and neuroscience communities.
 Our three Specific Aims will be to 1) use simultaneous analysis of DNA mutations and RNA gene
expression to map the lineage of neural cell types in cerebral cortex; 2) map clonal patterns across the surface
of the human cerebral cortex to see how they relate to functional subdivisions of the cortex; and 3) focus on the
analysis of development of human temporal lobe, which is subject to many unique conditions like temporal lobe
epilepsy.
 These data provide three major discoveries which have all been major goals of neuroscience and which
are not presently obtainable by other means: 1) the first direct cell lineage data from the adult human brain, 2)
a preliminary lineage map connecting neuronal cell classes, and 3) unique insight into temporal lobe
development."
10874313,"Project Summary: The nexus between diet, microbiome, and host involves molecular signals and xenometabolites (“non-
self” molecules derived from microbial metabolism) that remain largely unmapped. DNA and RNA sequencing
technologies have led to major advancements in understanding how abundances of specific gut microbes correlate to
health, diet, and disease; however, the most important information about microbe-host and microbe-microbe
communication will emerge from greater understanding of functional outcomes including microbial xenometabolism. To
address this knowledge gap, the current proposal will leverage the diversity of innovative human gut bacterial cultures to
expand the catalog of microbial metabolites, which can be screened to characterize binding and bioactivity characteristics
relevant to physiology and health. This approach is a direct response to guidance from PAR-21-253, Identification and
Characterization of Bioactive Microbial Metabolites for Advancing Research on Microbe-Diet-Host Interactions.
Considering the paucity of information related to microbial fat metabolites in particular, our primary focus will be on
xenolipid discovery, including (but not limited to) characterization of cyclopropane fatty acids (CpFAs) as an illustrative
example of discovery-to-bioactivity proof-of-principle. For instance, the extant literature and our preliminary results
indicate that novel odd-chain CpFAs are generated by bacteria harboring CpFA synthase (cfa), with CpFA catabolized by
hepato-splanchnic tissues, stored, and released by white adipose tissue. Our data support anti-inflammatory effects of
some CpFAs, as well as binding of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs). The team will leverage human gut
microbes cultured with combinations of fiber/complex carbohydrate substrates with or without diet-relevant fats, to drive
substrate-specific bacterial communities and associated xenometabolomes. We will—for the first time—comprehensively
identify xenolipids and non-lipid metabolite patterns that track the fiber and fatty acid milieu, and that correlate with
specific bacterial communities varying in phylogeny. This will expand the library of microbe metabolites and shed light on
how dietary components such as fibers and lipids interact to alter the xenometabolome. A complementary aim to
interrogate the effects of xenolipids on nuclear receptors, inflammation and GPCR read-outs, and broader effects in gut
organoids will link our findings to potential bioactivities, one of the remits of PAR-21-253."
10876971,"Project Summary/Abstract
This translational proposal focuses on the use of inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 for
breast cancer treatment. CDK4 and CDK6 are components of the core cell cycle machinery that are activated
upon interaction with their regulatory subunits, the D-type cyclins (cyclins D1, D2 and D3). Inhibitors of
CDK4/6 palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib received ‘Breakthrough Therapy’ designation status from the
FDA and have been approved for treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. In addition, these
compounds are now in clinical trials for several other cancer types. A large number of studies demonstrated
that treatment of human cancer cells with CDK4/6 inhibitors blocks tumor cell proliferation, and in some cases
causes tumor cell senescence. Working together with Dr. Polyak, we observed that tumor cells expressing
high levels of cyclin D3-CDK6 complexes undergo cell death upon CDK4/6 inhibition. We found that cyclin D3-
CDK6, but not several other types of cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes analyzed by us (such as cyclin D1-CDK4),
plays a rate-limiting role in regulating tumor cell metabolism, and protects tumor cells against elevated levels of
reactive oxygen species. In an independent study, we found that in mouse and human tumor cells, cyclin D-
CDK4 kinase regulates the levels of an immune checkpoint protein, programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1).
Using mouse cancer models and in vitro cultured cells, we found that treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors results
in upregulation of PD-L1 protein levels in tumor cells. We also found that combined administration of CDK4/6
inhibitors with antibodies that target the interaction between programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its
ligand PD-L1 increased the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy. In the studies proposed here, we will
extend these observations to breast cancers. In Aim 1, we will work with Drs. Polyak and Brown to test our
hypothesis that measuring cyclin D3 and CDK6 levels in human breast cancers may allow one to identify
breast cancer cases that are particularly sensitive to CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment, as cyclin D3/CDK6-high
tumors might undergo tumor cell death and tumor regression upon CDK4/6 inhibition. We will also explore
ways to trigger apoptosis of breast cancers expressing predominantly cyclin D1 and CDK4. We will address
these issues using xenografts of human breast cancer cell lines and patient-derived breast cancer xenografts.
We will also work with Drs. Polyak and Brown to address the intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity of breast
cancers, which may influence the outcomes. In Aim 2, we test our hypothesis that CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment
would increase the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapy for breast cancers and result in tumor regression
and improved survival rates in mouse breast cancer models. We will study this using mice bearing breast
cancer allografts as well as autochthonous triple-negative breast tumors. The expected overall impact of this
proposal is that it will provide means to identify breast cancer cases that are particularly sensitive to anti-
CDK4/6 therapy, and establish novel, highly effective combinatorial treatments involving CDK4/6 inhibitors."

10877086,"PROJECT SUMMARY – DATA ANALYSIS CORE
Reproducible and robust computational methods, coupled with rigorous statistical analyses, are critical for the
success of the Center. We will ensure a unified approach to data analysis, integration, and management that
leverages the existing infrastructure and the computational strengths of our investigators. Our data analysis
effort will be divided into four tiers, with increasing level of data integration as we move up the tiers. Members
of the Data Analysis Core (DAC) will be involved in all phases of project planning, from design to execution, to
ensure that the data flow between the DAC and the OSPs and between our Center and other HuBMAP tissue
mapping centers is well coordinated. Members of the DAC have extensive experience in algorithm
development, genomics and imaging data analyses, large-scale data management, and coordination of data
analytic efforts within multi-project centers. We propose the following five specific aims.1) To design and
implement a pipeline for tier-one analyses using both public and in-house software tools. The pipeline will
handle raw data generated using all assay types by the Center. 2) To develop and deploy computational
methods for tier-two analyses. These methods will be used for the discovery and taxonomy of different cell
types in the heart and inference of spatial distribution of cells and gene expression patterns in the heart. 3) To
develop and deploy computational methods for tier-three analyses. These methods will be used for the
discovery of transcriptional regulatory pathways contributing to spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the heart,
and signaling pathways mediating interactions between different cell types in heart tissue microenvironment. 4)
To construct integrated multidimensional heart atlases. Using cell-centric signatures and pathway models
generated in Aims 2 and 3 as anchors, we will aggregate genomic and imaging data and metadata collected
throughout the project. 5) To collaborate with the HuBMAP Integration, Visualization, and Integration
collaboratory (HIVE) and other research centers of the Human Biomolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP). We will
contribute to benchmarking of software generated by HuBMAP investigators, development of common data
formats, and improvement of interoperability of software tools."
10877087,"PROJECT SUMMARY – HEART OSP
The human heart is vital for our survival and health, and it presents remarkable anatomical, cellular and functional
heterogeneity. The four chambers of the heart, together with specialized arteries, veins, valves and conduction
cells, perform distinct yet essential physiological functions. A significant gap of knowledge is that different cell’s
molecular signature, spatial distribution and interactions, and functional state remain little understood at the
single-cell level. The goal of the heart Organ-Specific Project (OSP) is to address this knowledge gap and
generate high quality, single-cell resolution, longitudinal imaging and multiomics data of normal human hearts
across the entire human lifespan. To achieve this goal, we will generate: 1) Human heart atlases. Spatially
resolved atlases will provide a highly user friendly, publicly available, searchable database of the most
comprehensive multi-omic, single cell analysis of the normal human hearts. Molecular data will be richly
annotated with additional clinical and demographic data. 2) Computational methods. In addition to the atlas data,
the critical computational tools and pipelines developed in this project will be available to the research
community. These include methods and pipelines for processing multi-omics and imaging data, inference of cell-
specific regulatory and signaling pathways, correlation of mesoscale imaging and molecular imaging features,
as well as database algorithms for the query, exploration and visualization of highly complex data. 3) Access to
biospecimens for follow-up studies. Biospecimens collected in this project will be banked and made available to
the biomedical research community. These include freshly frozen and fixed specimens and tissue sections. In
summary, the heart OSP will broadly impact the entire research community and jumpstart basic-science and
medical discoveries based on a sophisticated understanding of the key molecular circuits underlying the
development and aging of human heart."

10894175,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Nearly half of the US adult population has hypertension, which puts them at increased risk for stroke, vascular
damage, heart attack, heart failure, and kidney disease. Recent genome-wide association studies have linked
a number of mutations in the gene, CLCN6, to reduced hypertension and stroke risk. CLCN6 encodes the
voltage-sensitive chloride channel 6 (ClC-6). To date, very little is known of about the function ClC-6, or its role
in blood pressure homeostasis. The overall goal of this proposal is to establish the physiological and molecular
roles of ClC-6 on vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) function and blood pressure.
 Mentored Phase: Preliminary data have demonstrated that ClC-6 is expressed in the Golgi apparatus
of VSMCs. I hypothesize that ClC-6 activity in VSMCs regulates luminal Golgi Ca2+ stores by providing a
charge balance for Ca2+ uptake, thereby maintaining membrane electroneutrality. This occurs through
an association with the Golgi-specific Ca2+-ATPase, SPCA1, and loss of ClC-6 reduces Golgi Ca2+ stores
and signaling, which alters VSMC contractility. Specific Aim 1. Establish the role of ClC-6 on Golgi Ca2+
handling in VSMCs. I will utilize planar lipid bilayer electrophysiology and sophisticated Ca2+ imaging to
determine ClC-6 chloride channel properties and their impact on the Ca2+ storage capacity of the Golgi.
Furthermore, these experiments will provide the first evidence of the role of Golgi-specific Ca2+ release in VSMC
Ca2+ handling in response to vasocontraction and dilation stimuli, which has never before been examined.
 Independent Phase: This phase of the project will develop an independent line of investigation into the
molecular effects of ClC-6 on VSMC function. Insight gained from these experiments will further explain the
physiological mechanism underlying ClC-6 regulation of blood pressure control. My preliminary data have
established that ClC-6 prevents or slows large artery vessel stiffening during development of hypertension. I will
further examine the effect of ClC-6 on cellular proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix protein
deposition in normotensive and hypertensive vessels. I hypothesize that loss of ClC-6 will reduce
extracellular matrix protein secretion and slow cell proliferation, thereby reducing hypertension induced
fibrosis and media thickening. These changes will result in abrogated arterial stiffening and vessel
remodeling, and reduce peripheral vascular resistance, providing a rationale for how ClC-6 moderates
blood pressure. Specific Aim 2. Elucidate the influence of ClC-6 on vascular stiffness and vessel remodeling
during hypertension. Experiments to address this hypothesis will include a diverse range of experiments,
including pulse-wave velocity measurements, histological analyses, migration assays, myography, TUNNEL and
BrdU assays, and transcriptomic analysis. These studies will inform our understanding of the protein's function
by defining the role of this channel in vasculature at the molecular, cellular, and systemic levels."

This application, “Translational Postdoctoral Training in Neurodevelopment (TPND)” is a competing renewal to
request five additional years of funding in support of our Institutional Training Grant (T32). The TPND Program
at Boston Children's Hospital is designed to provide promising postdoctoral investigators (MD, PhD or
MD/PhD) with advanced training in essential translational topics ranging from preclinical considerations
through implementation of clinical trials for individuals with a range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Large
numbers of children, adolescents, and adults are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders that begin early in
life, and are rooted in aberrant brain circuitry. Most currently available treatments have had limited impact on
the course of neurodevelopmental disorders. Recent advances in genetics, neuroscience, and neuroimaging
have led to dramatic gains in our understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. We now
have the possibility of developing mechanism-based treatments for many disorders in this field, and thus there
is an urgent need for training young investigators who will become the leaders in initiating and executing
research at the interface of these advances and ultimately improving the lives of individuals affected with these
disorders. TPND leverages the significant strengths of the Translational Neuroscience Center (TNC), the Fuss
Center for Neuropsychiatric Disease Research, and the Laboratories of Cognitive Neuroscience at Boston
Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School to provide trainees with research experiences ranging from
pre-clinical and cognitive neuroscience labs through clinical trial involvement in neurodevelopmental disorders.
A key premise of this program is that effective research training in the field of translational neuroscience
requires both mentors with expertise in areas across the continuum of translational research with
neurodevelopmental disorders and ongoing programs to support the trainees to conduct innovative, high
impact translational research. The 17 faculty mentors will involve trainees over a 2-year period (3 new entrants
per year) with a range of state of the art methods in translational neurodevelopmental science that reflect core
areas of the TNC program including basic science and translational methods as well as application to clinical
populations in therapeutic trials for neurodevelopmental disorders. This research experience will be
supplemented with both didactic and clinical immersion experiences designed to provide trainees with the skills
needed to be successful independent investigators in this critical and emerging field. Ultimately this research
experience will have the potential to yield new treatments and insight that in turn will impact the field by
reducing the burdens and costs of care and costs to society that is now associated with neurodevelopmental
disorders. In addition, the TPND will develop models of interdisciplinary research training for promising young
scientists that will have a transformative impact on the field."
10875689,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Obesity risk shows individual variation such that some children are more likely than others to gain excess
weight. One potential reason is that, due to genetic and environmental factors, individuals vary in appetitive
behaviors that drive food intake and weight. However, the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underpinning
variation in appetite and weight, and effects of risk and protective factors on those outcomes, are not understood.
Preliminary data from RESONANCE, our large MRI cohort, suggests obesity risk factors (maternal pre-
pregnancy obesity, obesity-associated genetic variants) are associated with not just heightened parent-reported
child appetite and BMIz, but with slower global myelination, decreased gray matter volume within fronto-cingulate
control circuits, and increased volume in striatal reward regions, from infancy through early childhood. However
the relevance of these findings to appetitive behaviors and development of obesity in middle childhood is
unknown. This is important because obesity rates and metabolic complications increase through development,
adiposity and eating habits measured in later childhood track into adulthood, and obesity is harder to treat later
in development, making middle childhood a key stage for capturing outcomes with relevance for lifetime
metabolic health. Further, although task fMRI studies have identified altered patterns of activation in brain
appetite circuits in association with pediatric obesity and early risk factors for obesity, the predictors of altered
functioning of brain appetite circuits in middle childhood are unknown. Identifying the patterns of brain
development that predict obesity-promoting behaviors and brain functioning in middle childhood is essential to
understand the neural mechanisms by which early obesity risk factors drive excess intake and obesity, and may
help pinpoint neurobehavioral targets for early obesity prevention. Finally, although preclinical research and MRI
studies of children >9y support that hypothalamic gliosis, a cellular inflammatory response, plays a role in obesity
pathogenesis, it is unclear whether it occurs or impacts appetite in earlier life. For the proposed study,
RESONATE, we will address the above research gaps by extending the RESONANCE study to administer meal
tests, behavioral and fMRI tasks assessing food and non-food reward and cognitive control, and weight/adiposity
measures in middle childhood, and examining hypothalamic gliosis, in a sub-sample of RESONANCE children.
By combining this data with extant MRI data and extant or newly-collected data on obesity risk and protective
factors, we will test a multi-faceted hypothesis that prenatal, genetic and postnatal factors lead to differential
early development of brain appetite circuits, which in turn gives rise to variation in appetitive behaviors and
behaviors involving reward processing and cognitive control as well as altered function of brain appetite circuits,
that act to influence the development of obesity into middle childhood. Our long-term goal is to lay foundations
for developmentally-appropriate, neurobehaviorally-informed interventions to address child obesity."
10875690,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cannabis and tobacco are two of the most widely used drugs and are frequently used together. People who use
both cannabis and tobacco tend to have higher rates of problematic cannabis use and dependence, sustained
long-term tobacco use, and poorer outcomes during treatment for tobacco use disorders. With rates of cannabis
use on the rise, understanding the mechanisms driving cannabis and tobacco co-use is imperative for developing
effective policy and public health efforts aimed at decreasing co-use rates. Although cannabis and tobacco co-
use is common, mechanism(s) underlying co-use remain unclear. Preliminary work by our group shows that
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can alter the subjective experience of commonly used tobacco products
including combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes. Preclinical evidence supports this interaction by documenting
increases in motivation to use nicotine, including less price sensitive nicotine demand in THC-exposed rodents.
Human laboratory data are needed to extend this work by comprehensively determining effects across the range
of commercially-relevant THC and nicotine doses and routes of administration. We will concurrently conduct two
full-factorial laboratory studies to determine the impact of acute THC administration on the dose-related
motivational, subjective, and physiological effects of two widely used tobacco products – combustible cigarettes
(Study 1) and electronic cigarettes (Study 2; “e-cigarettes”). Participants in both studies will receive pretreatment
with placebo or active THC. Following THC pre-treatment, participants will self-administer a combustible
cigarette containing a randomized nicotine dose (Study 1) or an e-cigarette containing a randomized nicotine
dose (Study 2) using a standardized puff procedure. We will use NIDA standardized products (SPECTRUM
cigarettes and SREC e-cigarettes) to ensure consistency across study years and applicability to other ongoing
research. A battery of craving, mood, withdrawal, and subjective drug effect measures will be collected before
and after nicotine product administration. Participants will then complete an incentivized demand task previously
validated by the study team to evaluate cigarette and e-cigarette use motivation and increase experimental rigor
through experienced consequences of task performance. Participants will be randomized to either smoked or
vaporized THC administration to evaluate the effect of congruent versus incongruent routes of THC and tobacco
administration on study outcomes. We hypothesize that THC will in a dose-orderly manner increase motivations
to use tobacco as well as decrease tobacco craving and increase positive affect with tobacco use. Understanding
the influence of cannabis on tobacco use across varied routes of administration and a broad nicotine dose range
will inform key regulatory policies within the cannabis and tobacco regulatory fields to include cannabis standard

X-ray crystallography and cryoEM single particle reconstruction (cryoEM SPR) generate uniquely detailed
structural information that is used to: (1) understand cellular processes at the molecular level, (2) explain and
validate results obtain by other biochemical, biophysical and cell biology methods, and also (3) guide drug design
studies. All these applications are highly relevant to the NIH mission. The proposal aims to advance data analysis
methods for X-ray and cryoEM diffraction and cryoEM SPR so that reliable and informative structural models
can be obtained from micro- and nanocrystals with both techniques as well as from single molecules (particles)
with electron microscopy.
The PI aims to expand X-ray crystallography and cryoEM SPR methods to new areas by highly hierarchical
application of data mining and dimensionality reduction methods. The data richness generated by recent
changes in hardware enables deep exploration of much more elaborate, non-random start algorithms that have
better convergence than the random start methods that are frequently used in computational approaches.
In diffraction methods, one frequently needs to combine data from multiple crystals for successful structure
solution. However, optimal averaging should only consider data that represent the same structural source of
diffraction patterns, so there is a fundamental need to segregate individual samples into distinct groups that are
internally isomorphous. In traditional approaches, complex non-isomorphism patterns result in combinatorial
complexity of data analysis in the presence of incompleteness and low signal-to-noise for individually contributing
datasets. The PI will develop methods addressing this long-standing unsolved problem, with the methods having
potential to also advance the analysis of biologically relevant structural variability that manifests as non-
isomorphism in experimental date. In cryoEM diffraction, data analysis does not yet produce reliable structural
results consistently, de novo structure solution is limited to a small number of projects where direct methods can
be used, and for small molecules, determination of absolute configuration remains a challenge. The PI will
develop and implement experimental and computational solutions to advance modeling of systematic effects
encountered in electron diffraction and to expand phasing approaches in electron crystallography to address
these outstanding problems. The PI will also work on developing estimators of bias magnitude and debiasing
procedures to expand cryoEM SPR so that much smaller particles can be modelled reliably. Finally, the PI will
develop approaches relying on comparative genomics so that structural models can be built and validated at
very low resolution that are currently outside of the reach for molecular interpretation. All research will rely on
the strong expertise of the PI in selected areas."
10877857,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer-cachexia (CC), loss in muscle mass that cannot be fully reversed through nutritional intervention, is
understudied relative to other muscle pathologies, affects up to 80% of patients and is responsible for 20-40%
of cancer-related deaths. Unfortunately, therapeutic approaches to prevent CC lack efficacy. We recently
demonstrated muscle metabolic health, specifically degeneration and dysfunction of the mitochondrial network,
is compromised well before muscle loss in Lewis Lung Carcinoma-induced (LLC) CC. Specifically, we observed
enhanced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission and depressed Opa1 protein 1 wk following
tumor implant with subsequent degeneration of the mitochondrial network at 2 wks, and impaired respiratory
function and induction of mitophagy protein BNIP3 at 3 wks with muscle loss at 4 wks. Our preliminary evidence
suggests attenuation of CC is possible by targeting mitochondrial quality (e.g., Opa1 activation, BNIP-3,
mitochondrial antioxidants). These data provide novel insight to potential mechanisms that may be targeted to
prevent onset of CC and highlight the need for preventive measures. The overarching goal of our laboratory
and this proposal is to utilize characterization of key steps in development of CC to identify mechanisms and
efficacious therapeutic approaches. However, many questions remain: 1) Does this course of events persist
across models of cachexia? 2) How does the tumor-bearing state interact with chemotherapy on CC? 3) Can we
specifically target pre-wasting effects to prevent CC? 4) Can we specifically deliver drugs to muscle to prevent
CC? To answer these questions, we will pursue the following aims (Fig 1):
Aim 1. Define development of cancer-induced muscle wasting across additional pre-clinical models and in
conjunction with chemotherapy.
Aim 2. Determine if nodal points identified in development of CC may be targeted to prevent or attenuate muscle
wasting.
Aim 3. Determine if mitochondria-targeted or muscle-specific delivery of therapeutics prevents CC."
10877976,"Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in adolescents. Unfortunately, our ability to accurately predict suicidal
ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) among adolescents remains remarkably limited. Thus, there is an urgent
need for biomarkers that can identify risk for SI and SA. There is also a need to identify novel molecular pathways
that may underlie suicide risk. There is growing interest in microRNAs (miRNAs), a subclass of non-coding RNAs
that regulate mRNA expression via post-transcriptional mechanisms, as potential mediators of disease
pathologies and in the development of targeted novel therapeutics. Earlier, we reported that specific miRNAs
were markedly altered in the brain of adults who died by suicide independent of psychiatric illnesses, suggesting
that miRNAs can distinguish suicidality separately from psychopathology. Using a specific neural marker, we
isolated neural-derived exosomes (NDEs) from blood plasma and found that these exosomes are highly enriched
with miRNAs that are expressed in the brain. In preliminary studies, we also found remarkable resemblance in
brain and NDE miRNA changes among adult and adolescent suicide populations. Differences in many miRNAs
were common in adults and adolescents with SI or SA; however, a distinct set of miRNAs was associated
exclusively with adolescent suicide. In addition, differentially expressed NDE miRNAs changed significantly in
adults treated with ketamine. Our novel approach thus provides a unique opportunity to detect NDE miRNAs in
plasma, which can be used as biomarkers for suicidality and treatment response. Based on our pilot data, we
propose an overarching hypothesis that a subset of NDE miRNAs will be differentially expressed in adolescents
with MDD and SI or SA compared with non-suicidal adolescents with MDD and healthy controls. There will be
unique subsets of miRNAs specifically associated with MDD, SI, and SA. These miRNAs will have specific mRNA
targets and biological pathways that may be associated with SI, SA, and MDD risk. To test these, we will examine
genome-wide expression of NDE miRNAs and mRNAs in the following groups of adolescent subjects (11-19 y;
n=240): 1) MDD with serious SI and a recent SA (MDD+SA), 2) MDD+SI without recent SA, 3) MDD without
recent SI or SA (MDD-SI/SA), and 4) healthy controls without a history of mental disorder. We will also test if
expression of NDE miRNAs will change across six weeks of antidepressant treatment (AD). With this, we will
examine if: 1) specific subset(s) of NDE miRNAs are associated with SI and SA among adolescents, 2) specific
miRNA/mRNA-regulatory pathway is associated with SI, SA, and MDD, and 3) response to AD treatment impacts
differences in NDE miRNAs associated with MDD and SI/SA. Using our existing NDE miRNA datasets in 240
adults ages 20-65 y across the same groups proposed for this study, we will also examine if miRNA biosignatures
are common in MDD and SI/SA groups for adolescents and adults, or if they differ by age. Altogether, our study
will provide novel avenues to identify miRNAs as ‘‘molecular tools’’ for the development of a biomarker for
suicidality across age group and eventually new molecular-based therapies to treat or prevent this disorder."

This is a competitive renewal application for training grant support in pediatric oncology. The goal of this T32
program is to train physicians who will be the future academic leaders in basic and/or clinical pediatric
oncology research and who will work to reduce the burden of cancer in the pediatric population. To accomplish
this goal we have engaged a diverse and outstanding training faculty that embraces multiple areas of basic
(“wet bench”), translational and clinical research. This experienced and highly accomplished group includes
members of the Department of Pediatric Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI), the Division of
Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Boston Children's Hospital (BCH), and additional components of the
Harvard Medical School (HMS). Particular emphasis is placed on close mentorship of trainees in the selection
of mentors and in on-going oversight during their research. The T32 program provides training in oncology
research at the postdoctoral level for 8 trainees, selected from the combined DFCI-BCH pediatric
hematology/oncology fellowship program, who are in their second, third and fourth years of training. These
fellows spend on average five to six years in a protected training environment with limited clinical
responsibilities, and the proposed T32 renewal would continue to support three years of that training. The
program is committed to identifying and supporting the most promising fellows, including minority candidates.
Over the past 45 years the DFCI-BCH fellowship program has trained over 200 individuals, many of whom are
leaders of academic pediatric hematology/oncology programs. Continued T32 support will ensure the training
of investigational pediatric oncologists, whose research will contribute immeasurably to the understanding and
management of childhood cancers."

 Advanced studies in neuroscience increasingly require sophisticated mathematical and
computational skills in addition to a strong knowledge base in neurophysiology. Likewise, novel
treatments of neurological diseases often require problem solvers (i.e. engineers) with both
advanced computational skills as well as a solid foundation in systems neuroscience. The
fundamental premise of this training program is that early engagement of computationally strong
students, principally engineers, in understanding fundamental mechanisms of neuroscience will
accelerate development of technology and solutions for the diagnosis and treatment of stroke,
Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, pain, epilepsy,
paralysis, and other neurodegenerative disorders. With long-established research experience in
these disorders existing at Washington University in St. Louis, we propose a training program that
will develop common skill sets in engineering doctoral students towards solving difficult problems
in neural engineering. Graduates of this novel training program will have the knowledge and
expertise to pursue either an academic research career and/or a private sector research career
in neurotechnology. We request support for four predoctoral students in the proposed five-year
program. Cohorts will include five total predoctoral positions, each of two years in duration."

 The aim of this T32 application “Training in Cancer Biology and Transplantation” is to recruit and prepare
highly qualified and diverse physicians for a research-intensive career in medical oncology (MO) or gynecological
oncology (GO). Multiple reports have emphasized the dire shortage of board certified medical and gynecological
oncologists anticipated in the US in the next decades and the potential impact of these clinical needs on the pool
of physician-scientists to drive the advances in biologically-driven, evidence-based care. It is increasingly
important to retain the best and brightest trainees in research careers.
 This training program is available only to MD or MD-PhD-prepared applicants who have strong interest
in a research-intensive career. It offers two tracks: 1) support for 2 years of research training for 4
physician/scientists enrolled each year who have completed their first 12 or 18 months of clinical training in our
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education-approved University of Washington/Fred Hutch
Hematology-Oncology Fellowship Program and 2) support for 1 Gynecological Oncology fellow in our University
of Washington accredited program for 2 years of research training, giving a total of 9 physician-scientist fellows
funded each year. The majority of the trainee’s time is spent conducting research under the direct supervision of
a faculty mentor(s) selected by the trainee with additional guidance from a specially selected Research Oversight
Committee and the Executive Committee of the T32.
 Our program provides didactic teaching and a strong foundation in research design, develops the
trainees’ ability to conceptualize and solve research problems, encourages increasing independence, provides
training in state-of-the-art analytical techniques, requires trainees to present their research findings at scientific
meetings and publish their results, and conveys an understanding of the relationship of the trainee’s research to
health and disease. Our program consists of 90 talented, well-funded and well-published mentors who are
deployed across nine specific research pathways to expose trainees to diverse scientific questions,
methodologies, and disease models. Longitudinal evaluation to ensure optimal training for the trainee is intrinsic
to the program. Multiple institutional resources to enhance career development are available to allow all trainees
to develop a customized training plan.
 Cancer researchers trained in this program will be exceptional physician-scientists who are prepared for
a career in a research-intensive setting in medical or gynecological oncology, with highly-developed research
skills in cancer biology, diagnosis, prevention, therapy and outcomes."
10879063,"Project Summary
Our research project is designed to test our central hypothesis that the interaction between the
contact activation system of blood coagulation and the surfaces of medical devices contributes to
pathologic mechanisms including inflammatory responses and device associated thrombosis.
Despite the use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents, many widely used vascular devices induce
thrombus formation. Anticoagulation can mitigate thrombus formation, though not completely, and thus
thrombosis is a persistent risk with significant clinical consequences including thromboembolism, device
failure, stroke and even death. While current forms of anticoagulation can lessen these risks, they
universally increase the risk of bleeding, paradoxically contributing to patient morbidity and mortality.
Our group has extensively evaluated the contact pathway factors XI (FXI) and XII (FXII) which appear to
be complicit in the development of device-associated thrombosis, yet dispensable for hemostasis. Our
central hypothesis is that mechanical devices induce and propagate local blood coagulation and thrombus
propagation in a FXIIa-dependent manner. Building on our prior successes, in AIM 1 we will utilize in vitro
and non-human primate models, along with samples from patients with peripherally inserted central
catheters (PICCs) as a model medical device to define the interaction of the contact pathway and device
surfaces in the blood microenvironment. Using a novel inhibitor of FXII-mediated activation of FXI, in AIM
2 we will determine the role of contact activation in the development of device-associated thrombosis in
patients with peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). PICCs are frequently used in ambulatory
medical patients who require regular administration of intravenous medications, but are plagued by high
rates of thrombosis leading to local symptoms, thromboembolism and delays in medical care.
Paradoxically, the treatment of catheter associated thrombosis with modern forms of anticoagulation leads
to significant morbidity from major bleeding, and to date trials of traditional anticoagulants to prevent CAT
have not shown a favorable risk/benefit profile. There is an unmet medical need to develop safer more
effective therapies in this space.
Taken together, these analyses will be the first to define the mechanisms of by which activation of FXI and
FXII by device surfaces contributes to device-associated thrombosis in humans. The data generated from
this analysis will provide new mechanistic insights applicable to numerous medical devices used in
modern health care practices and has large translational relevance in identifying safe and druggable
targets within the contact activation system."

The overall goals of this P20 application are (1) to identify ancestry-specific genetic regulators of macrophage
function and response to anti-HER2 antibody therapy that potentially underlie racial differences in response to
this targeted immunotherapy and (2) to establish a robust infrastructure to support and develop innovative,
productive immuno-oncology and health disparities research collaborations. The Administrative Core facilitates
this goal by providing an overall organizational infrastructure, integration with existing CCSG-supported Cancer
Center resources, a system for financial management, and overall governance. Specifically, the Administrative
Core provides the overall leadership, management, and coordination of all Research Project activities and
facilitates the meetings of the Executive Committee, Planning Committee, and Internal Advisory Committee. All
official communications among P20 participants originate from the Administrative Core. Specifically, the aims of
the Administrative Core are to provide leadership and oversight of all P20 activities by (1) convening an Executive
Committee for monthly progress review, including monitoring of specific timeline/milestones for Project and
Planning Committee deliverables, (2) providing fiscal and resource management for each component of the P20,
(3) ensuring compliance with all NIH and institutional grant regulations, and (4) facilitating communications
between P20 investigators and the National Cancer Institute. We will also facilitate the development of
multidisciplinary collaborations and grant proposals in immuno-oncology and health disparities by establishing a
Planning Committee with cross-cutting expertise in cancer immunology, molecular epidemiology, social
determinants of health, and translational science and implement a structured process for developing multiple
extramural grant proposals. Finally, we will support integration of health disparities and immuno-oncology
research into the Cancer Center overall by convening an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) to ensure program
integration and optimization of resources from the comprehensive cancer center."

For multiple subtypes of breast cancer, Black patients endure poorer outcomes than White patients. There are
many contributing factors, including socioeconomic inequality, stage at diagnosis, and access to quality care. In
addition, there may be biologic, genetic drivers that disproportionally affect Black patients. Black patients with
HER2+ breast cancer have lower response rates and experience higher off-target toxicities than their white
counterparts, even when stage and age at diagnosis are considered. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody
(mAb) designed to bind the HER2 receptor and block growth factor signaling, and the mAb Fc region is also able
to engage innate effector immune cells through Fc receptors. Due to this immune involvement, trastuzumab and
similar TAA-binding mAbs are classified as targeted immunotherapies (ITx). Importantly, patients who develop
endogenous anti-tumor immunity after targeted ITx have a predilection for improved long-term benefit, but it
remains unclear what mechanisms regulate durable response. Our preliminary data in a novel genetically diverse
mouse model support the hypothesis that host genetic background influences endogenous immune priming after
anti-HER2/neu targeted ITx. Importantly, in our model all mice receive genetically identical tumors, which
controls for tumor heterogeneity. Genetic linkage analysis in these mice pinpoints specific genomic loci that are
associated with treatment outcomes. The leading candidate locus was validated, and mechanistic studies
identified differences in the efficiency of macrophages to conduct antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADCP).
These results suggest that host genetics, and potentially genetic ancestry, may regulate the method by which
macrophages engulf, process, and/or present tumor antigens to T cells. ADCP and other genetically-regulated
immune mechanisms may contribute to the biologic underpinnings of healthcare disparities in immuno-oncology.
We have assembled a team of population scientists and tumor immunologists to investigate this hypothesis using
patient samples collected in Detroit. We will utilize cutting-edge spatial transcriptomics and imaging mass
cytometry technologies to characterize the immune landscape in 184 HER2+ breast cancer tumor sections from
patients (~50:50 Black:White) exhibiting response to or recurrence after trastuzumab neoadjuvant therapy. Aim
1 will evaluate immune infiltration patterns, which will be compared by race and association with therapeutic
outcomes. In Aim 2, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with known immune genes and novel
candidate genes identified in our preclinical model will also be probed for correlation with trastuzumab response,
by race. Collectively, we strive to unveil biologic contributors to healthcare disparities in immuno-oncology, and
identify novel actionable genes/pathways to improve targeted ITx outcomes, in addition to key biomarkers to
guide clinical decision-making and improve cancer equity for all patients."

India accounts for 15% of the Global Burden of Disease for psychiatric, neurological, and substance use
disorders, greater than in all Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC) combined, due in part to an insufficient
number of psychiatrists, a dearth of locally-relevant interventions to meet mental health needs, and a paucity of
research training for professionals to develop, implement, evaluate, and replicate meaningful approaches. There
is an urgent need to strengthen research capacity related to interdisciplinary intervention and implementation
research. We propose to expand sustainable research infrastructure by training (i) early-career researchers
at the graduate and junior faculty levels and (ii) the next generation of senior research mentors. We will
continue our tradition of hands-on, trainee-initiated research as the keystone for our training while fostering
team-based, interdisciplinary approaches focusing on serious mental illnesses and comorbid medical
disorders. Training will incorporate research into disorders common across the lifespan, including
neurodevelopmental disorders epitomized by psychoses and autism as well as neurodegenerative disorders
(dementias). Diabetes mellitus (DM) will be the primary co-morbid medical disorder of interest, not only in view
of the epidemic of hyperglycemia in India, but also because it influences the course of psychiatric disorders of
interest. We will emphasize collaboration with (1) the Government of India through the Indian Council of Medical
Research (ICMR), wherein we will advocate for regulatory revisions to ease the current administrative burden
on intervention researchers; (2) Indian institutions, to further expand the emphasis on implementation science
wherein St John’s Medical College and Hospital will be the central training institution; (3) Indian and US-based
mentors, to enable a team-based framework for addressing cross-disciplinary research; and (4) trainees, to
support investigator-driven mental health research projects, especially those incorporating stigma reduction
strategies and Research Domain criteria (RDoC). Our current proposal updates our decades of research
capacity-building success by (a) emphasizing in-country leadership with our primary Indian collaborator as
Contact PI; (b) expanding capacity-building work to focus on interdisciplinary, team-based approaches; and (c)
broadening training to include senior-level mentors. We have, since 2004, built sustainable research capacity
via continuous D43 grants, training 130 mental health researchers who published 264 peer-reviewed
publications; facilitated a partnership with the ICMR; implemented a novel “Grantathon” model to attract and
scale up research-based training; and supported our trainees in leveraging research grants exceeding
$5,418,000 over the past 6 years. Our proposal is consistent with and complies with the Fogarty International
Center’s Strategic plan."

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects over 44 million individuals worldwide, and the number is projected to triple

methods, especially deep learning, to advance neuroimaging genetics for AD. It involves novel methodological
developments in Aims 1-4, cost-effective applications to the large-scale UK Biobank neuroimaging genetic data for
AD (Aim 5), and software development (Aim 6). All four Aims for the methods development tackle emerging impor-
tant topics in deep learning with their applications to neuroimaging genetics for AD; although the other three Aims
deal with independent topics with their own other broad applications, they in turn serve for Aim 1: 1) Aim 1 applies
manually searched deep learning models for automatic feature extraction/phenotyping from neuroimages, by which
both the statistical power and biological interpretation of subsequent genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
are expected to be enhanced; 2) Aim 2 employs (automatic) neural architecture search (NAS) to more efﬁciently
identify better deep learning models, which are then applied to Aim 1 for enhancing feature extraction/phenotyping
and thus boosting the power of GWAS; 3) Aim 3 focuses on explainable deep learning, offering biological insights
by localizing and highlighting the most important features extracted by deep learning models that can be used for
Aim 1; 4) Aim 4 develops a novel inferential theory for deep learning, which is then applied to rigorously test for
the statistical signiﬁcance of any selected/highlighted features used in Aim 1. In Aim 5, these new methods will be
applied to the UK Biobank neuroimaging and GWAS data to identify novel genetic loci and neuroimaging features
for AD. As a byproduct, we will develop and distribute software implementing the proposed methods in Aim 6."
10885625,"Dementia is a disease characterized by a loss of memory and other cognitive functions that is severe enough
to interfere with daily living. In 2023, an estimated 6.7 million Americans who are 65 years and older are living
with dementia (Alzheimer's disease or related dementias, ADRD). Approximately one-third of people living with
dementia (PLWD) have highly “fragmented ambulatory care,” or care diffusely spread across many ambulatory
providers. In one national study, PLWD who had highly fragmented ambulatory care had an average of 16
ambulatory visits to 7 different providers in a given year, compared with 11 visits to 3 providers for those with
the least fragmented care. Having multiple providers may be clinically appropriate, but it creates challenges,
because providers do not consistently communicate with each other, even in the era of electronic health
records. When providers do not communicate with each other, harm for patients can follow. Fragmented
ambulatory care may be an overlooked but modifiable contributor to some key problems in healthcare delivery,
such as delayed or missed diagnoses of dementia (including racial disparities in dementia diagnoses).
Similarly, fragmented care may be leading to more prescribers of medication and more polypharmacy (i.e., the
use of ≥5 medications), which may be contributing to excess emergency department visits and hospitalizations
among PLWD. Filling these gaps in knowledge is necessary for informing the design of future interventions.
The proposed project, “Understanding Ambulatory Care Utilization in Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementias (ACUA),” will illuminate the role of fragmented care in the diagnosis of dementia and in the care of
PLWD, while identifying novel opportunities for intervention. Aim 1 will involve secondary analyses of two NIA-
funded cohort studies linked to claims (the Health and Retirement Study [N ≈ 3,425] and the REasons for
Geographic and Racial Disparities in Stroke study [N ≈ 3,235]), to determine whether fragmentation is
associated with delayed or missed diagnoses of dementia, including racial disparities in diagnoses. Aim 2 will
involve secondary analyses of national Medicare claims (100% sample) to determine whether fragmentation is
associated with more unique prescribers of medication and whether that, in turn, leads to more polypharmacy
and excess emergency department visits and hospitalizations (N ≈ 4.5 million). Aim 3 will consist of one-on-
one semi-structured interviews with a variety of stakeholders who are involved in dementia care, to determine
their preferences regarding who should address fragmented care for PLWD, when, and how (for example,
whether the goal of future interventions should be to decrease unnecessary fragmentation or to ameliorate its
adverse effects) (N ≈ 50). This project will generate robust, data-driven insights, which will enable future
development of novel interventions to improve ambulatory care and outcomes for PLWD."

understudied diseases. There he has developed and applied key new techniques and deep learning algorithms
for analyzing cell-free DNA using epigenetics, which serve as the basis for the aims in the proposal.
Key guidance for this project will be provided by Dr. Semenkovich’s mentor, Dr. Chaudhuri. Dr. Chaudhuri is a
physician-scientist and an internationally recognized expert in cell-free DNA. He has a passion for and dedication
to training physician-scientists as they prepare for independent careers. In addition. Dr. Semenkovich has
assembled an advisory committee of faculty with expertise in sepsis, critical care, and immunology, who will
provide crucial scientific and career guidance. Washington University in St. Louis is an ideal place to receive this
training, with outstanding resources and expertise readily available.
The primary research goal of this proposal is to develop and advance cell-free DNA as a novel biomarker with
predictive and prognostic roles in sepsis. Dr. Chaudhuri’s lab has previously characterized how cell-free DNA
can be leveraged in a range of malignancies. Dr. Semenkovich’s proof-of-concept work has provided the first
clear evidence that cell-free DNA can be used to predict complications and early end-organ damage in sepsis.
He is developing machine learning methods to identify septic patients at risk of complications and will test those
hypotheses in silico, in vitro, and in vivo. These efforts promise to fundamentally change our understanding and
management of sepsis and enable potential clinical trials and immunomodulatory interventions to treat sepsis.
This K08 award will provide the necessary resources and skills that Dr. Semenkovich will require to become a
successful independent investigator."

Antigen-specific therapies have long been pursued to improve outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). So
far most exploited are monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting CD33, a glycoprotein displayed on the cell surface
of leukemic blasts in almost all cases and possibly leukemia stem cells in some. Longer survival of some patients
treated with the CD33 antibody-drug conjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) validates this approach, but GO
is often ineffective, prompting efforts to develop improved, more potent CD33-directed therapeutics. Because
AML cells are exquisitely sensitive to radiation in a dose-dependent fashion, radionuclides are ideal to arm anti-
CD33 mAbs. Indeed, early phase clinical trials demonstrated substantial anti-AML efficacy of the anti-CD33 mAb
lintuzumab (HuM195, SGN-33) when coupled with the a-emitter actinium-225 (225Ac). a-emitters deliver a very
high amount of radiation over just a few cell diameters, thereby enabling precise and efficient target cell kill,
rendering them particularly interesting for specific targeting of AML with radioimmunoconjugates (“RIT”).
However, even with 225Ac-lintuzumab, an important shortcoming is CD33 expression on normal myeloid cells,
which leads to “on-target, off-tumor cell” toxicities that manifest as severe and prolonged myelosuppression with
life-threatening sequelae (e.g. infection). Thus, clinical use of CD33-directed RIT without immediate stem cell
rescue is currently limited to suboptimal drug doses. We have recently demonstrated in mice and nonhuman
primates that CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease-based editing of CD33 results in functionally normal hematopoiesis that
expresses reduced levels of CD33 and is protected from GO and CD33-directed T cell-engaging therapeutics.
We hypothesize CD33-edited normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) will resist CD33-directed
RIT with a-particle-emitting radionuclides and enable their safe use at maximally effective drug doses. However,
the CRISPR/Cas9-based CD33 gene editing strategy suffers from significant off-target activity, and DNA double
strand breaks (DSBs) can generate larger deletions and complex chromosomal rearrangements and cause
TP53-dependent DNA damage response and cell cycle arrest. To address this limitation, we will optimize and
characterize a novel gene-editing strategy to protect normal hematopoiesis from highly potent CD33-directed
RIT by utilizing the recently described base editor (BE) technology. BEs induce precise nucleotide modifications
without intentional introduction of DSBs, making them an attractive strategy to generate CD33null “normal”
hematopoietic cells. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with complementary expertise
in CD33-directed therapies, preclinical optimization of RIT, and radiopharmaceutics to conduct well-controlled
preclinical IND-enabling studies to develop BE-based CD33 engineering of normal human HSPCs for clinical
use with a-emitter CD33-directed RIT for patients with AML and other CD33-expressing disorders."

The overall goal for the annual “Workshop on Techniques in Modeling Human Cancer in Mice” proposed in this
application is to deliver an intensive cutting-edge training workshop on modeling human cancer in the laboratory
mouse to a small group of select early career scientists/trainees. Participants completing the course will acquire
a working knowledge of how to characterize and analyze mouse models of human cancer.
The course will consist of didactic lectures in the morning to introduce particular organ sites and the
characteristics of cancers associated with those organ sites, followed by intensive hands-on laboratory sessions
whereby students will gain experience in the manipulation and analysis of mouse models of human cancer. As
a global resource for genetically engineered and mutant mouse models, JAX is uniquely positioned to provide a
hands-on training experience that is not available anywhere else in the world. Sessions will also include imaging
techniques, surgical approaches to the implantation of tumors and pathology. Additionally, participants have the
opportunity to present their work and receive constructive feedback from course faculty and participants.
JAX is deeply committed to training a diverse group of biomedical scientists. With support from NCI and the
Howard Hughes Medical Institute, we will actively recruit and train under-represented minority (URM) participants
through extensive partnerships, thoughtful planning and use of scholarship resources. Additionally, we will
actively seek and invite URMs to serve as workshop faculty.
This intensive 7-day immersive course will be offered to 20 participants selected for their outstanding research
potential. They will interact with a group of prominent mouse geneticists and cancer biologists both from JAX
and other prominent institutions. The size of the class will be kept deliberately small in order to achieve a
desirable level of student-faculty interaction and to permit extensive laboratory training and practice. The course
will be held annually at Highseas, our residential conference facility and our generously equipped applied
genomic training laboratory. The Jackson Laboratory is an NCI-designated Basic Research Cancer Center and
has a long history of hosting advanced courses and scientific meetings."

Amblyopia is induced in model systems by monocular deprivation (MD), which changes the stimulus selectivity
of neurons in the primary visual cortex. Prior research utilizing this model established that the changes in
neural selectivity induced by MD result from the reorganization of excitatory glutamatergic cortical synapses
onto excitatory cortical neurons, which is regulated by an inhibitory GABAergic network composed of
parvalbumin positive inhibitory interneurons (PV INs). An emerging consensus is that a permissive level of
inhibition from PV IN circuits in cortical layer 2/3 is required for plasticity at downstream excitatory synapses,
and that inhibition above or below the permissive range constrains the response to MD. Accordingly,
developmental strengthening of inhibition triggers the onset of the critical period; at later stages, the
“permissive” range of inhibition is achieved by reductions the recruitment of PV INs.
Here we identify the plasticity of excitation onto layer 2/3 PV INs as a critical locus for the regulation of circuit
reorganization in V1. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the initial response to MD is a rapid and transient
elimination of excitatory connections made by local pyramidal neurons (Pyr) onto PV INs. Following 1 day of
MD, we find that ~50% of local L2/3 PyràPV-IN connections are eliminated. Importantly, synapses from distal
L2/3 Pyrs and excitation from layer 4 Pyrs remains unchanged. This all-or-none elimination of specific
connections coincides with the loss of synaptic structure, is transient, and returns to control values following 3
days of MD. Our preliminary results also demonstrate that the MD-induced elimination of proximal L2/3
PyràPV INs inputs depends on mGluR5 activation and is inhibited by expression of activity-independent
neuronal pentraxin 2 (NPTX2). We propose that the rapid mGluR5 and NPTX2-dependent elimination of local
L2/3 PyràPV INs connection is an obligatory initial step for subsequent changes in ocular dominance and
spatial acuity induced by MD. Accordingly, we show that accumulation of NPTX2 prevents L2/3 PyràPV IN
elimination and ocular dominance plasticity. Conversely, expression of dominant negative NPTX2 in adults
reactivates the elimination of L2/3 PyràPV INs and ocular dominance plasticity in response to MD
We propose a series of multidisciplinary experiments to test the validity of this model that combine the
expertise of the Quinlan lab in the assessment of physiological changes in vivo physiology and the Kirkwood
lab in the assessment of changes in single synapses between identified neurons. We will test the hypothesis
that the elimination of L2/3 PyràPV INs excitatory synapses is 1) local, transient and confined to a postnatal
critical period 2) dependent on mGluR and NPTX2 signaling and 3) an obligatory initial step for subsequent
changes in ocular dominance and spatial acuity induced by MD. Our model predicts that the end of the critical
period reflects directly the loss of L2/3 PyràPV-IN plasticity, which departs from many widely-held
assumptions regarding developmental changes in synaptic plasticity in the mammalian cortex."

 The calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that signals in response
to changes in extracellular calcium. It functions as an obligate dimer and couples to different G-proteins,
including Gai or Gas, in a context- or cell type-specific manner. The CaSR is widely expressed and alters
proliferation, differentiation, death and ion transport in a variety of cell types, including mammary epithelial cells
(MECs), where it regulates the production of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and milk calcium
transport. During lactation, activation of the CaSR on MECs inhibits PTHrP secretion by stimulating Gai and
reducing cAMP levels. However, in breast cancer cells, activation of the CaSR increases, rather than
decreases, PTHrP secretion because, in these cells, the CaSR activates Gas and increases cAMP levels. The
CaSR has important functions in both lactation physiology and breast cancer pathophysiology, so it is critical to
better understand the regulation of its downstream signaling events in breast epithelial cells. Emerging data
demonstrate that the CaSR can heterodimerize with the 2 metabotropic, GabaB receptors, GABBR1 and
GABBR2 and the central premise of this application is that heterodimerization of the CaSR with
GABBR1 and/or GABBR2 alters CaSR signaling, PTHrP production and transepithelial calcium
transport by mammary epithelial cells. Specifically, we hypothesize that, during lactation, reductions in
GABBR1 expression and increases in GABBR2 expression promote the formation of CaSR/GABBR2
heterodimers in MECs, which, in turn, increases membrane CaSR expression and reinforces coupling of the
CaSR to Gai. In order to explore this hypothesis, we propose 3 Specific Aims. Aim 1 will examine how
heterodimerization with GABBR1 or GABBR2 alters CaSR expression, signaling and PTHrP production in
breast epithelial cells in vitro. Aim 2 will use genetically modified mice to examine whether heterodimerization
with GABBR2 regulates CaSR expression and function in the lactating breast in vivo. Aim 3 will use
genetically modified mice to examine whether heterodimerization with GABBR1 regulates CaSR expression
and function in the lactating breast in vivo. The studies outlined in this proposal will explore novel biology of
great importance for lactation physiology that also has implications for breast cancer pathophysiology. These
studies have the potential to discover novel ways to target the CaSR therapeutically."
10889838,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 People with vision impairments or blindness routinely face substantial challenges in everyday living
that can significantly limit their participation in physical activity and exercise important for managing weight
and overall health. While there is a growing amount of scientific literature documenting physical inactivity
and increased time spent in sedentary behaviors among people with vision impairments, there remains a
dearth of health promotion research specifically studying this vulnerable population in comparison people
with adequate sight. Further lacking is the availability of evidence-based physical activity-based health
promotion programs tailored to the unique challenges experienced by individuals with a vision impairment.
Our preliminary findings clearly support the significance of this health disparity within this vulnerable
population.
 As such, this timely project will address this health disparity by: (1) adapting an evidence-based
physical activity behavior change intervention tailored to the unique challenges of adults living with a vision
impairment and (2) establishing feasibility, patient satisfaction, and preliminary efficacy of the adapted
intervention for increasing physical activity intensity and duration along with other health outcomes among
adults with vision impairments. Our research will also be informed by an Advisory Board consisting of key
stakeholders (e.g., adults living with a vision impairment; vision-related organizations involved in advocacy,
policy, and service; along with our investigative scientific team)."
10893044,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a newly emerging tick-borne
infectious disease caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV). SFTSV is listed in the most dangerous viral
pathogens by the WHO that most likely cause wide epidemics in the near future. The incidence of
SFTSV infection has continuously increased up to more than 5,000 humans with a mortality rate
ranging from 12% to as high as 30%. SFTSV induces a characteristic thrombocytopenia that is
remarkably similar to viral hemorrhagic fevers. Infected ticks are the major source of human SFTSV
infection. Particularly, the recent spread of this tick to over 12 states of USA increases the potential
for outbreaks of the disease beyond the Far East Asia. The sero-prevalence of SFTSV in healthy
people is not significantly different among age groups, but clinically diagnosed SFTS patients are
older than ~50 years, suggesting that age is the critical risk factor for SFTS morbidity and mortality.
No effective vaccines are currently available for SFTSV. The goal of this proposal is to
comprehensively test and compare the immunogenicity and protection efficacy of four SFTSV-
specific vaccine candidates against lethal SFTSV infection in age-dependent ferret model."

CEDA includes a Core that supports the development of research networks for the purpose of exploring the
cross-cutting topics of interest in the economics and demography of aging. Certain networks are proven
successes: National Transfer Accounts (NTA: Donehower, Lee and Mason), the Human Mortality Database
(HMD: Barbieri) project, the UC Berkeley Social Networks Study, UCNets (Fischer; Child, Lawton, Feehan, and
colleagues at Vanderbilt, U Mass Amherst, Stanford, and elsewhere). In addition to these, the historical census
database CenSoc (Goldstein) has developed into a full project with collaborations across the campus and the
country. All projects therefore benefit from contributions from a national, if not international, community of
researchers. NTA involves researchers in more than 94 countries; HMD comprises data from 40 countries.
UCNets is reaching out European and Israeli colleagues. Accordingly, the Conference and Communication
core will support conferences or workshops organized by CEDA affiliates, perhaps jointly with nonmembers or
other institutions, on themes related to aging, bringing together researchers or policy makers from elsewhere in
the US and other countries. With logistics provided by the Administrative Core, this Core will further support
network meetings to strengthen connections, plan research programs, achieve specific research related tasks,
harmonize international data, or present results. In addition to the CEDA website, this Core works with the
Dissemination Core D and the Computing and Data Core A.2 to support specialized websites (e.g., NTA,
UCNets or HMD) for sharing data and methods and providing training, building intellectual links, disseminating
research papers and findings, posting questions, and providing information about meetings, progress etc."

The RUSTBELT CFAR Administrative Core (Core A) integrates support for the combined $56 M/yr HIV/AIDS
research portfolios at the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt). The
Core provides the leadership and organizational structures to coordinate, support, and enhance the efforts of
the 305 members of the RUSTBELT CFAR. The Administrative Core will maintain a rigorous set of milestones for
Core activities, thus responding to the evolving research needs of CFAR investigators. The Core is committed
to equitably serve the HIV research communities in Cleveland and Pittsburgh by ensuring that core services and
research programs are transparently and expertly jointly managed. Core A has developed mechanisms to ensure
a smooth assimilation of the combined strengths with a focus on balance in the usage and innovation of the
laboratory Cores across the two institutions to raise the quality and impact of its research. Core A will (1) provide
joint leadership for the RUSTBELT CFAR; (2) coordinate a rigorous annual review and scientific planning process
and implement the plan through enhancement of Core services, recruitment, and stimulating new research
activities; (3) improve communications and visibility of the RUSTBELT CFAR through the use of an integrated
website across the two institutions, a trans CWRU-Pitt community working group, who are represented on the
CFAR Steering Committee, and the use of a shared tool for Core usage and charges; and (4) stimulate training
activities throughout the CFAR through cross-institutional “catalytic awards” provided through institutional
support and developmental awards supported through Core B. Core A will execute integration and planning of
these activities by hosting an annual CFAR internal retreat, having quarterly meetings of the Steering Committee
comprised of senior scientific leadership from both institutions, weekly calls and/or meetings of the Directors and
Co-Directors, hosting a Core retreat to update CFAR members about Core service offerings and to establish
best practices for Core management, budgeting meetings, mentoring workshops and mock study sections, and
ensuring regular meetings of the strategic working groups and engagement of the External Advisory Board.
Thus, the Core will ensure that the CFAR is responsive to emerging needs of the investigator community and
maintains a transparent, fair, and cost-efficient process for utilization of resources and will contribute to the
overall mission of the RUSTBELT CFAR by increasing the quality and value of the CFAR’s HIV research,
expanding programs to end the HIV epidemic in the US, and training the next generation of researchers in the

conducting clinical or translational research involving human participants, clinical data, or samples. The primary
services provided by the core are (i) rapid access to existing clinical data and repository samples from persons
with HIV (PWH), (ii) on-demand acquisition of fresh biologic samples from PWH, persons at risk for infection,
and uninfected low risk individuals, and (iii) centralized clinical support provided by the CFAR to investigators for the

outstanding Pittsburgh clinical cohorts. The merged Core will include expertise in HIV prevention, substance
use, and cure research. Furthermore, the range of specimens that can be obtained will also be dramatically
enhanced through the procurement of leukopheresis samples, gastrointestinal tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
cervical tissue, placenta, cord blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL), stool, and genital secretions for
translational research. Core D maintains strong relationships with patient communities and affiliated AIDS
service organizations and agencies through regular meetings of the Community Advisory Boards (CABs) and
ongoing initiatives including AIDS-free Pittsburgh and End the Epidemic in Cleveland (EtHE in CLE). RUSTBELT
CFAR Core D leaders will guide and link CFAR investigators to ongoing cohorts and study groups such as the
Pittsburgh HIV Lung Research Cohort and the CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems to enhance

10875682,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT –VIRAL PATHOGENESIS & PERSISTENCE CORE E
Viral Pathogenesis & Persistence Core E supports the needs of CFAR investigators and their innovative
projects, while maintaining strong capacities to assist researchers with more traditional basic and translational
virology research. The Core leverages the combined strength of virologists from both Case and Pitt to facilitate
research on HIV-1 pathogenesis and persistence by RUSTBELT CFAR investigators. Core E provides
investigators with innovative services to measure HIV-1 persistence with assays that identify and quantify latent,
expressed, and inducible HIV-1, paired with pioneering ex vivo methods to examine the efficacy of novel Latency
Reversal Agents (LRA) and other curative strategies in fully autologous systems, making deeper characterization
of HIV-1 reservoir dynamics and clonality widely available. Case and Pitt also have complementary systems to
quantify HIV-1 persistence, having originally pioneered ultrasensitive single copy quantitative PCR (qPCR)
assays targeting HIV-1 gag/pol and established novel techniques to measure HIV-1 env RNA transcripts by
induced transcription–based sequencing. These methods have been continually refined and expanded to now
quantify intact vs. defective proviral DNA and automated for sensitive detection of HIV-1 RNA in plasma or culture
supernatants. Core E also provides advanced viral outgrowth assays to assess inducible, infectious HIV-1 in
new ways, such as using a fully autologous system whose performance characteristics meet or exceed the gold
standard in the field. Advances in automation have also increased the throughput, consistency, and quality of
near full-length HIV-1 sequencing, while new technologies have enabled integration site analysis from the same
sample at a single cell level. Core E also provides advanced imaging platforms to study HIV-1 infection at single
virion resolution, including real-time live cell imaging. The focus of Core E on cutting edge virology is designed
to complement our second laboratory core, Core F (Systems Biology & Biostatistics), which focuses on the
host through offerings in single host cell genomics and immunology. The combination of the transcriptomic and
proteomic capabilities of Core F with the validated HIV latency and reversal models made available by Core E
opens the door to applying these detailed analytical techniques to cutting edge studies of basic virology,
prevention, treatment, and cure research. Core E will also support HIV prevention initiatives in coordination with
the Clinical Sciences Core D, and the EHE SWG2. The Core will continue to work closely with Uganda Core
C, which is now one of two national sites for HIV drug resistance testing in Uganda, to transfer advanced
technology to our partner organizations in Kampala, Uganda, and enhance the ability of Ugandan investigators
to conduct informative virological studies including Cure research. Finally, and most importantly, Core E will
dedicate its effort toward assisting CFAR investigators to obtain critical data for their projects."

While there have been developments in treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD), current pharmacotherapies
face several limitations, including the presence of adverse events. Intranasal (IN) insulin has shown promise for
use in targeting addictive disorders. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is based on the premise that IN
insulin by providing improvement of brain cell energy and glucose metabolism and stress hormone reduction,
may be an ideal approach for treating multiple domains of AUD including memory and impulsivity. Furthermore,
studies of IN insulin demonstrate that it is a safe and effective method for delivering insulin to the central nervous
system, circumventing the blood brain barrier and reducing adverse events (hypoglycemia). The main goal of
this proposed work is to tune up and test an integrated pharmacological, biobehavioral and clinical protocol to
test the safety/tolerability of IN insulin as a potential therapeutic for AUD. This is a Phase I/IIa, within-subject,
crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled human laboratory study with an acute IN insulin (80IU) administration
compared to placebo in 40 non-treatment-seeking individuals with AUD. In Aim 1, we assess the safety,
tolerability and acceptability of IN insulin as pharmacological intervention for AUD. In Aim 2, we evaluate whether
there is a difference in adverse events between IN insulin and the placebo condition when co-administered with
alcohol. In Aim 3, we will evaluate whether IN insulin, compared to placebo, improves memory and reduce
impulsivity after the alcohol challenge. Finally, in Exploratory Aim, we will assess preliminary data on the effect
of IN insulin, compare to placebo on alcohol craving. The proposed research will generate: 1) the necessary
safety data and 2) the characterization of AUD patient endophenotype who may respond to IN insulin treatment."
10891148,"SUMMARY
Bone fragility cannot be explained by bone mineral density (BMD) alone and also results from defects in the
material properties of the bone matrix, termed bone quality (BQ). Since diagnostics or therapies to identify or
treat poor BQ do not exist, understanding the control of BQ is a clinical imperative for treating skeletal fragility.
This proposal aims to uncover these fundamental biological and material mechanisms controlling BQ by focusing
on the beneficial effects of exercise on BQ. Using a mouse exercise model that can reliably induce and rigorously
monitor dynamic changes in local BQ, Dr. Kohn found that exercise-dependent control of BQ strengthens bone
independently of BMD. Though the mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of exercise on BQ remain
unclear, compelling data suggest that exercise triggers osteocytic perilacunar/canalicular remodeling (PLR) to
exert spatiotemporal control of bone matrix structure and composition. The now well-defined model provides an
unparalleled opportunity to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which BQ is controlled. Work
from the laboratory of Dr. Alliston implicates osteocytes in the control of bone matrix material properties through
the process of PLR. Several models of osteocyte dysfunction, including osteocyte-specific ablation of TGF-beta
signaling or SOD2, suppress PLR and result in compromised BQ. Preliminary data also show that osteocytic
PLR and cellular metabolism are coupled, suggesting that osteocytic mitochondrial function is tightly regulated
and plays a critical role in calibration of BQ to accommodate changing mechanical or metabolic demands.
However, the extent to which exercise exerts its effects on BQ through osteocyte or mitochondrial-dependent
mechanisms also remains unknown. It is therefore critical to define the sequence of cell and matrix changes
along the PLR continuum in an integrated mechanistic material-cellular approach. Using the well-established
models of regulating PLR and BQ via exercise or osteocyte-intrinsic genetic perturbations in TGF-beta and SOD2
signaling, and novel approaches to analyze BQ and PLR at the proteomic, compositional and structural levels,
we are in unique position to identify biological and material mechanisms by which exercise controls BQ. To this
end, we will test the hypothesis that exercise exerts spatiotemporal effects on BQ by modulating osteocyte
cellular metabolism and PLR by: Aim 1) identifying biological and material mechanisms by which exercise
controls BQ; Aim 2) identifying osteocyte-dependent mechanisms by which exercise regulates BQ; and Aim 3)
determining the extent to which BQ is regulated through mitochondria-dependent mechanisms. Results will
inform mechanisms by which BQ is controlled, in anticipation that these mechanisms may be diagnostic or
therapeutic candidates to intervene in people vulnerable to bone fragility because of low BQ."
10891149,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Bleeding in Hemophilia A (HA) is currently prevented by regular infusions of therapeutic factor VIII (FVIII) proteins
(tFVIIIs). Unfortunately, ~30% of all severe HA patients (HAPs) develop antibodies called FVIII inhibitors (FEIs)
that neutralize tFVIIIs and greatly increase morbidity & mortality. FEIs develop significantly more often in HAPs
with Mexican ancestry (MA) vs. non-Hispanic white (NHW) ancestry. This research seeks to identify genetic and
environmental variables underlying the high incidence of FEIs in HAPs of MA by applying novel omic approaches
in a powerful systematic immunoepidemiologic study of the immunogenicity of tFVIIIs. We will leverage a unique
resource, the My Life, Our Future (MLOF) repository, which has ~400 such subjects already enrolled in our study.
We have four main aims. Aim 1: To enroll and extensively characterize a cohort of 200 severe HAPs with
MA. We will recruit 200 severe HAPs (including 30 sib pairs) in the US and Mexico. Relevant clinical data and
blood samples will be collected to assess FEI risk. We will use the (i) WGS and mRNA-Seq data from these 200
new individuals plus the ~400 subjects of MA in the MLOF project (N=600) and (ii) functional CD4 T-cell data
from all 200 new subjects. We will assess intracellular (i) CRM status (i.e., presence or absence of FVIII antigen)
in all 200 new subjects, as this variable underlies the contribution of F8 mutation type to FEI risk. Aim 2: To
elucidate the genetic basis of FEI risk in MA severe HAPs using trans-omic endophenotypes. Using a
novel statistical genetics approach employing both close and distant relatedness in the overall sample of ~600
MA severe HAPs, we will identify endophenotypes genetically correlated with FEI risk from novel phenotypic
measures immunologically related to FEI development. The best endophenotypes for FEI risk will be genetically
characterized using both quantitative genetic methods and variant-specific association analyses. Aim 3: To
detect and characterize environmental effects on FEI risk. Using a novel statistical genetic approach to
maximize systematic environmental signals influencing FEI risk, we will search for environmental traits reflected
in high-dimensional transcriptomic biomarkers that are correlated with FEI development. Aim 4: To perform a
case/control peptidomic analysis of FEI risk. We will select a subset of 40 HAPs as 20 FEI discordant sib
pairs (one brother has a FEI and the other does not) and recruit their carrier mothers. We will characterize each
subject’s tFVIII peptidome, i.e., the HLA-class-II (HLAII)-bound collection of tFVIII-derived-peptides (tFVIII:dPs)
that are presented to their CD4 T-cells. We will then identify the “culprit tFVIII:dP” and “offending HLAII allele”
(OHA), which are most correlated with FEI development in the proband of each sib pair. Finally, we will evaluate
the relevance of our findings using: 1) CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout (ko) specific OHAs in their B-lymphoblastoid
cells (BLCs) in vitro; and 2) their ko BLCs for functional T-cell studies. As tFVIIIs are more immunogenic in HAPs
with MA, this study is likely to identify new determinants of FEI risk (both genetic & non-genetic) which will assist
the development of new (i) diagnostics that are more accurate, (ii) therapeutics with improved safety and efficacy,
and (iii) management strategies that reduce race- and ethnicity-based disparities in health outcomes."

to continue to train residents, fellows, graduate students and junior faculty, focusing in particular on junior
investigators, in particular women and minorities, who are currently underrepresented in COPD POR. Dr. Han
will continue to tailor mentoring plans to each trainee, consisting of one-on-one mentoring sessions,
collaboration with statisticians and formal educational opportunities in analytic methods and the responsible
conduct of research. The resources available at the University of Michigan (UM) including the UM Pulmonary
Division Multidisciplinary Training Grant and the Michigan Institute for Clinical & Health Research/Clinical &
Translational Science Award provide an ideal infrastructure for POR training. Dr. Han’s scientific aims for this
proposal will leverage several newly funded projects to provide training opportunities for junior investigators.
Emerging data suggest that COPD begins much earlier in life than previously appreciated. CT analytic
techniques (Parametric Response Mapping, PRM) developed at UM can identify small airway disease,
believed to be the precursor lesion to emphysema. Dr. Han is Co-PI of an extension to the SPIROMICS cohort
(HL144718) that is recruiting 30-55 year-old current and former smokers either at risk for COPD or with mild to
moderate established COPD. In Aim 1, we will use these data in early COPD to determine whether PRM
defined small airways disease can be identified in such individuals to predict disease progression. The second
specific aim of this proposal will use data generated by R01 (HL150023) for which Dr. Han is contact PI. In Aim
2, longitudinal PRM analyses in the COPDGene cohort will be performed to determine 10-year longitudinal
trajectories for evolution of small airways disease and emphysema among at risk current and former smokers
aged 40-80, with and without COPD. Together these analyses provide data on a novel imaging biomarker
across the lifespan and disease severity spectrum and provide a wealth of research opportunities for junior
investigators. Dr. Han is at an ideal stage of her career to take advantage of a K24 award. She is deeply
committed to her investigative career in COPD POR. This application also aligns with two NHLBI missions: (1)
to promote research, training, and education for the prevention and treatment of lung disease; and (2)
increasing the diversity of our national lung disease research workforce."
10892156,"Project Summary/Abstract
Engineered therapeutic T cells have shown transformative success in treating B cell cancers but applying this
approach to solid tumors has proven far more difficult. There do not appear to be absolutely tumor-specific single
antigen targets for solid cancers, and thus, CAR T cells that attack most tumor-associated antigens have led to
toxic cross-reaction with normal organs that also express the antigen. If we are to successfully and safely treat
solid tumors with CAR T cells, it will be essential to mitigate toxic cross-reaction with normal tissues.
To prevent off-tumor toxicity of therapeutic T cells, we propose to engineer multi-receptor T cell circuits that can
recognize a tumor based on a multi-antigen profile. In this proposal, we focus specifically on engineering NOT
gate circuits -- circuits that can override and inhibit CAR T cell activation and killing upon detecting an antigen
that is uniquely indicative of a cross-reactive normal tissue (i.e., antigen is absent in the tumor). Our recently
published bioinformatic analysis shows that there are numerous tissue-specific antigens that could be used as
signals to induce T cell inactivation in common cross-reactive tissues like the brain and lung. Nonetheless, there
is currently a lack of robust NOT-gate circuits demonstrated to work well in tumor models. Thus, we will develop
and test new NOT circuits that can inactivate a CAR T cell in an antigen-induced manner. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1. Engineer, prototype and optimize new NOT gate circuits that use diverse mechanisms to block
therapeutic T cell activation in antigen-induced manner
 Aim 1.1. T cell NOT gates using transcriptional repressors of CAR expression.
Aim 1.2. T cell NOT gates that inhibit T cell proliferation by antigen-induction of cell death effectors.
Aim 1.3. T cell NOT gates that locally induce production of secreted immunosuppressive factors (paracrine)
Aim 2. Applying NOT gate circuits to prevent anti-GD2 CAR T cross-reaction with brain/CNS tissue.
 Aim 2.1. in vitro prototyping of NOT gate circuit targeting the brain antigen MOG to turn off anti-GD2 CAR
Aim 2.2. Test if brain NOT gates block CNS toxicity of anti-GD2 CAR T cells in vivo, while maintaining
efficacy against murine neuroblastoma xenograft models (GD2+).
Aim 2.3. Test in vivo safety & efficacy of NOT gate CAR T cells in an immunocompetent model of
neuroblastoma.
This work should provide important general capabilities for engineering CAR T cells that selectively turn
themselves OFF when they are in the wrong, cross-reactive tissue. These are much needed tools that are
currently missing in the toolbox for T cell engineering, but which will be critical for engineering T cells that safely
treat solid cancers."
10892216,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Candidate: David Flood, MD, MSc, is a general internist and fellowship-trained health services researcher at
the University of Michigan and the Institute of Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) in Guatemala.
Dr. Flood’s long-term career goal is to become an independent physician-scientist who uses expertise in
implementation research to improve the adoption of evidence-based interventions for the prevention,
treatment, and control of cardiometabolic diseases (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia) in
resource-limited health systems in the U.S. and globally. Background: Pharmacologic and behavioral
interventions are effective in improving cardiometabolic disease outcomes. However, limited implementation of
these interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) leads to substantial excess morbidity and
mortality. The Hearts Technical Package for Cardiovascular Disease Management in Primary Health Care is
the model recommended by the World Health Organization to address this implementation gap (“HEARTS”:
Healthy lifestyle counseling, Evidence-based protocols, Access to medicines, Risk-based care, Task sharing,
and Systems monitoring). Despite compelling supporting evidence, HEARTS has not been implemented in
most LMICs. Training Plan: To achieve research independence, Dr. Flood requires additional training in (1)
applying implementation research methods, (2) human-centered design of interventions, and (3) mixed
methods design and evaluation of clinical trials. Dr. Flood will be mentored by an outstanding, multinational
team including Co-Primary Mentors Dr. Michele Heisler (University of Michigan) and Dr. Manuel Ramírez-Zea
(INCAP) who have extensive mentoring experience and expertise implementing chronic disease interventions.
His Co-Mentor will be Dr. Gretchen Piatt (implementation research). Dr. Flood’s advisors will include Drs.
Sanjay Saint (consensus design methods), Mark Huffman (translating research between global and U.S.
settings), Vilma Irazola (implementation research in Latin America), and Timothy Guetterman (mixed methods).
Research Plan: With guidance from his mentors and advisors, Dr. Flood will carry out a detailed study of
HEARTS implementation in a single country, Guatemala, which can serve as a generalizable implementation
template for use in other LMICs. The research plan will build and expand on an ongoing NHLBI-funded
hypertension implementation study in Guatemala (of which Co-Primary Mentor Dr. Ramírez-Zea is Co-PI).
Using a stepwise approach, Dr. Flood will (1) identify barriers and facilitators to expanding an ongoing
hypertension intervention in Guatemala to also include diabetes and dyslipidemia treatment, as recommended
in WHO Hearts; (2) co-design a delivery model of integrated treatment of cardiometabolic diseases using
human-centered design, and (3) evaluating the feasibility and acceptability of the delivery model using a
mixed-methods evaluation of a cluster randomized pilot study. Findings from this award will position Dr. Flood
to submit an R01 application to evaluate effectiveness and implementation outcomes in a type 2 hybrid trial."

The challenges addressed by this R35 application are multiple. First, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a
leading cancer worldwide that is resistant to many treatments. Two important risk factors for CRC are a history
of chronic colitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obesity, both of which are increasing at an alarming
rate. However, the mechanisms linking these predisposing factors to CRC are not well understood and thus
there is a pressing need to elucidate these basic mechanisms. Second, obesity is also a contributing factor to
other gastrointestinal cancers, where the role of innate immunity receptors is less well-defined than CRC.
Understanding the roles of innate immunity in these other cancers is a high priority. Third, the interaction of
host genetics, microbiome, inflammation and cellular transformation is complex, but fundamental to the onset
of gastrointestinal cancers. Elucidating this network of interaction is important for devising new approaches for
cancer therapy. Fourth, while the roles of adaptive immune molecules and cells have been the main stake of
cancer immunotherapy, much less emphasis has been placed on innate immune receptors which may alter
adaptive immunity to advance cancer immunotherapy, which should be an attractive strategy to combat
cancer. Finally, while studies in animals are important in establishing a foundation, a well-defined plan to
translate basic findings to humans remains the ultimate goal and challenge that we will address.
The NLR (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich repeat containing proteins, or nucleotide-oligomerization
domain receptor) is a multi-member gene family that encodes a group of cytosolic proteins that are involved in
the intracellular sensing of microbial products as well as damage-associated molecular patterns. NOD2, an
NLR family member, has a strong genetic association with Crohns' disease and has been implicated in colitis-
associated CRC. Additionally, NLRs including NOD2 and NLRP12 can affect the microbiome to impact colitis
in mice, suggesting that NLR family members are important in maintaining or disrupting the homeostasis of gut
microbiome. We and others have shown a role for the inflammasome NLRs in models of colitis and CRC. In
addition to our analyses of well-studied inflammasome components in models of colitis and CRC, we have
been at the forefront of defining a strong role for other NLRs which have anti-inflammatory functions (referred
to as inhibitory NLRs), and can alter the course of inflammation and cancer. This proposal plans to examine
the roles of NLRs in humans and in murine models of cancers, to elucidate the complex interaction of NLRs
with the microbiome and cellular transformation and to harness these proteins to enhance cancer
immunotherapy."
10898881,"Project Summary/Abstract
Mutations in
myosin VIIa (MYO7A)
are the most common cause of Usher syndrome type 1.
MYO7A is believed
to be essential for the formation and function of the hair cell mechanotransduction (MET) tip link complex and
the stereocilia ankle link, but its precise function in these complexes is not known.
In preliminary studies, we discovered that the cochlea expresses multiple isoforms of MYO7A. In a genetically
engineered mouse model in which the canonical isoform (Myo7a-C) is specifically deleted (Myo7a-ΔC mouse),
MYO7A expression is severely diminished in inner hair cells (IHCs), and to a lesser degree in apical outer hair
cells (OHCs). In contrast, deletion of the alternative isoform Myo7a-N (Myo7a-ΔN mouse) led to a significant
reduction of MYO7A levels in OHCs, varying in intensity along the tonotopic axis.
Analyses of these models led
to the hypothesis that two major isoforms are expressed in a complementary manner in the cochlea: IHCs
predominantly express the canonical isoform MYO7A-C, and much lower levels of the alternative isoform
MYO7A-N. In OHCs, the two isoforms are expressed in opposing gradients along the tonotopic axis.
This
surprising feature of MYO7A expression gave rise to a novel conceptual framework and experimental tools to
interrogate the functional role of MYO7A in the hair cell in the following three aims:
In Specific Aim (SA) 1, we propose to further investigate the variety of MYO7A isoforms, and their expression
and localization in cochlear hair cells. To this end, we have already generated a mouse model in which one of
the isoforms is genetically tagged, allowing us to determine its cellular and subcellular localization and
characterize the isoform-specific interactome.
In SA2, we will test the functional significance of each MYO7A isoform for hair cell MET and hearing
performance. Preliminary electrophysiological studies show that genetic deletion of the canonical isoform
affects resting open probability and current activation in response to fluid jet stimulation in IHCs, consistent
with a putative role of MYO7A in tensioning the tip link complex.
Finally, we ask why different types of hair cells express distinct isoforms of MYO7A. To address this, in SA3,
we test the hypothesis that the differential expression of MYO7A isoforms serves to tune tip link tension in hair
cells, thereby modulating MET current properties along the tonotopic axis.
This project, through a multi-disciplinary collaboration that enabled the combination of molecular manipulations
in the mouse, electrophysiology, imaging and biochemistry techniques, has the potential to provide critical
insights into the function of an important deafness gene."
10898884,"Air pollution exposure is a critical health risk factor for many chronic illnesses and has been linked to dementia.
However, there are a number of gaps in our knowledge of how air pollution contributes to dementia, and these
are the focus of our proposal. First, most air pollution exposure studies do not differentiate between causes of
dementia. Second, they tend to rely on cross-sectional analyses. Third, they do not consider dementia
biomarkers. To address those issues, we chose to focus on longitudinal studies of aging and brain health
where we can distinguish among two of the most common causes of dementia, i.e., Alzheimer's disease (AD)
and vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), which may also co-exist. Specifically, we will leverage data from four
diverse longitudinal studies of brain aging including more than 23,000 participants from metro-Atlanta and
Georgia spanning a wide range of age, socioeconomic status, and cognitive status. These longitudinal studies
focus on unaffected or minimally affected individuals since studying those individuals affords us the best
chance of determining the relative contribution of AD and VCI to overall cognition. Each study performs
detailed neurocognitive testing, standard cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of AD and brain volumetric
biomarkers of AD and VCI and we will assign high-resolution fine particle ambient air pollution concentrations
(PM2.5 and its components) to all study participants based on their current and past residential addresses.
Leveraging these rich data allows to test for association between air pollution and different facets of AD- or
VCI. To understand how air pollution contributes to AD, VCI, or both, we will 1) investigate associations
between air pollution and indicators of AD characterized by subjective memory complaints, short-term memory
or language impairment based on neurocognitive testing, positive AD CSF biomarkers (i.e., Aβ42, total-Tau,
and phospho-Tau) and smaller hippocampal volumes; 2) investigate associations between air pollution and
indicators of VCI characterized by impairment in the executive function (measured by neurocognitive testing)
and cerebral microvascular ischemia changes measured by brain MRI; and 3) investigate associations
between air pollution and accelerated epigenetic aging and dementia-related DNAm patterns. Critically, we will
also evaluate how sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic factors, genetic risk, depression, cardiovascular disease
and diabetes modify the associations between air pollution and indicators of AD and VCI. This study will
provide biological insights of how air pollution affects early manifestations of the two most common causes of
dementia (AD and VCI) and how modifiers (e.g., sex and race/ethnicity) affect vulnerability. Therefore, we
expect this work to have an important and sustained impact on the field."
10898886,"PROJECT ABSTRACT/SUMMARY
There are clear sex differences between women and men in the presentation, etiology, and outcomes of
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among the most prominent sex-specific risk factors for women are those related
to pregnancy, including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy such as gestational hypertension and
preeclampsia. In fact, preeclampsia increases risk of coronary artery disease by 2-fold, heart failure (HF) by 4-
fold, and CV mortality by up to 8-fold in affected compared to unaffected women. Despite this substantial risk
burden, surprisingly little is known regarding the mechanisms that drive the development of pregnancy-related
hypertensive disorders or the subsequent CVD outcomes in these vulnerable women. Emerging but limited data
suggest that some, but not all, women with the presence of pre-conception clinical metabolic traits are
predisposed to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. There is also heterogeneity in the extent to which some,
but not all, women with a history of preeclampsia have abnormalities in cardiovascular structure or function. We
hypothesize that: (i) the stress of pregnancy augments pre-existing metabolic and inflammatory derangements
in certain women, making them more susceptible to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; (ii) in this setting, the
hypertensive disorder of pregnancy triggers a cascade of inflammation and oxidative stress that persists and
results in additional endothelial damage and coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), a previously
unrecognized driver of CVD risk; and, (iii) women affected by a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy, especially
in the setting of pre-existing metabolic and inflammatory risk and CMD, are more likely to experience accelerated
subclinical cardiac disease and progression to clinical CVD. To test our hypotheses and clarify the mechanisms
by which certain women are made vulnerable to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and subsequent CVD, we
will comprehensively interrogate clinical, biochemical, and physiological determinants across the spectrum of
pregnancy-related CVD risk in both a community cohort enriched with metabolic traits and a clinical cohort that
is deeply phenotyped using advanced non-invasive CV diagnostics.
This K-23 award will support my goal of becoming a translational clinical investigator in women’s cardiovascular
health with expertise in epidemiology, population science, advanced cardiac imaging and hypertensive disorders
of pregnancy. The proposed project aligns with the National Institute of Health’s (NIH) mission and highlights the
need for “investigations of the many factors underlying the health of women (https://orwh.od.nih.gov).”"

Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) underlies many spinal disorders and results in debilitating
back pain, disability, and tremendous socioeconomic burden. The intervertebral disc (IVD) is the
largest avascular organ comprised of a hypoxic nucleus pulposus (NP) center surrounded by an
outer, more oxygenated annulus fibrosus (AF). The IVD contains copious amounts of lactic acid,
which has long been viewed as a harmful waste byproduct of anaerobic glycolysis in the NP.
However, we recently made two major advances that challenge this longstanding dogma. We
demonstrated that AF cells can take up and utilize lactate as a carbon source via oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS), thus unveiling lactate-dependent metabolic symbiosis between NP
and AF whereby the hypoxic NP cells make lactate to be used by the more aerobic AF cells as
a carbon biofuel via OXPHOS. We also discovered high levels of IVD histone lactylation, a
newly characterized type of histone post-translational modification (PTM) that uses lactate as a
substrate precursor. Histone PTMs are critical to the dynamic modulation of chromatin structure
and gene expression, and dysregulation of histone PTMs is closely linked with the development
of many diseases. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that disc lactate is not as
a waste byproduct but rather serves as an important biofuel for the nutrient-poor disc
and as a vital metabolic regulator of disc gene expression programming via histone
lactylation. We propose three specific aims to test this hypothesis: (1) Determine whether
lactate functions as an important metabolic regulator of disc gene expression through histone
lactylation using rat disc cell culture models treated with chemical inhibitors of enzymes
responsible for histone lactylation; (2) Determine whether disc histone lactylation and lactate-
dependent metabolic symbiosis malfunction with age contributing to age-related IDD using
young and old Fischer 344 rats; and (3) Determine whether interrupted disc lactate-dependent
metabolic symbiosis disrupts disc histone lactylation pattern and promotes IDD using transgenic
mouse models with AF-targeted genetic depletion to disrupt AF lactate uptake. Completion of
the proposed studies will establish whether histone lactylation exerts epigenetic transcription
regulation that controls disc matrix homeostasis and lactate-dependent metabolic symbiosis.
Demonstrating the influences of lactate metabolism on age-related IDD through the
mechanisms of epigenetic gene regulation and lactate-dependent metabolic symbiosis will be
both novel and significant to identify new therapeutic targets to treat IDD with greater likelihood
of success in the nutrient poor environment. This will be an innovative approach and significant
advance over prior regenerative efforts which have had limited success in this unique tissue."
10898902,"SUMMARY
As the primary mediators of the innate response to viral infection, type I interferons (IFN-I) establish an antiviral
state in both infected and uninfected bystander cells through the induction of several hundreds of interferon
stimulated genes (ISGs). The mechanisms by which the coordinated activities of these ISGs confer resistance
to diverse viruses, and the regulatory circuits that modulate their expression remain poorly understood. Working
with unique samples from individuals with hereditary syndromes of dysregulated IFN-I responsiveness, we have
identified a collection of thirty ISGs that confer resistance to diverse viruses (increased protection against RNA
and DNA viruses with both high and low pathogenic burden). We have also uncovered previously unappreciated
negative feedback mechanisms of IFN-I signaling. We have found that these regulatory circuits, as well as ISG
expression patterns, vary significantly across different cell types at steady state and upon IFN-I stimulation.
Recent technological advances now enable us to explore these cooperative ISG antiviral functions and negative
feedback mechanisms at unprecedented depth and resolution.
In the studies proposed here, we will identify subsets of ISGs sufficient to confer broad protection against multiple
viruses using a novel single cell RNA-Seq strategy. This approach provides the throughput required to conduct
complex combinatorial experiments while maintaining the high resolution to test specific hypotheses. Results
may offer new broad spectrum antiviral therapeutic strategies, which would be of particular value against
emerging viral pathogens. We will also investigate in detail the mechanisms by which IFN-I signaling establishes
a lasting imprint on cellular responsiveness to subsequent IFN-I stimulation. This recently described but
incompletely characterized phenomenon likely has important implications for successive infectious challenges
and viral susceptibilities. Combining a unique collection of clinical samples, cutting edge technologies, and
diverse and complementary expertise in immunovirology from our two laboratories, these studies are expected
to address long standing, fundamental questions in innate antiviral immunity, as well as to pioneer new directions
for developing antiviral therapies."

 The Biomarkers, Biomaterials, and Cellular Models Core is comprised of four laboratories that provide
valuable human biospecimens and core services to internal and external Core users. The PKD Biomarkers
Laboratory maintains a repository of serum, plasma, urine, and urinary exosomes from individuals with early-
stage ADPKD that are being monitored in the Early PKD Observational Cohort (EPOC), a longitudinal clinical
study. The repository also banks samples from at-risk siblings of these ADPKD participants, normal volunteers,
and patients with established ADPKD that come to the PKD clinic at the University of Kansas Hospital. The
current lack of sensitive and specific biomarkers for ADPKD is a major impediment in the development of new
therapies. The Core will assist investigators in the discovery of effective biomarkers for diagnosing and
monitoring the progression of early-stage ADPKD, a critical time before there is reversible damage to the kidneys.
The Core will also perform in-house biomarker analysis of clinic samples to assist PKD investigators on the
evaluation of therapeutic interventions. The PKD Biomaterials Laboratory maintains an established repository of
a broad spectrum of human ADPKD biospecimens, including fixed and frozen cystic tissues, cyst fluids, and
primary cultures of cyst epithelial cells. The Core has been critical for providing ADPKD biospecimens to
academic and industry investigators for the past 14 years. The PKD Cellular Models Laboratory assists
investigators in the use of human primary ADPKD cells, normal human kidney (NHK) cells and immortalized
renal cell lines in carefully controlled in vitro assays. The Core has considerable expertise with in vitro models
for the investigation of pathways involved in cyst epithelial cell proliferation, CFTR-dependent Cl- and fluid
secretion, and in vitro cyst formation. The Core will continue to provide service and training to investigators on
PKD cellular models to investigate mechanisms for cyst growth and for evaluating potential therapeutic
compounds. The PKD Gene Targeting Laboratory assists in the generation of novel PKD reagents through gene-
editing and assists Core users in gene-targeting approaches to test specific hypotheses. The Core will introduce
specific mutations in PKD1 or PKD2 in immortalized cells from human collecting ducts, a prominent site for cyst
formation in ADPKD. This enables investigators to examine the cellular response to a PKD mutation using
isogenic normal and PKD mutant cell lines. The overall goal of the PKD Biomarkers, Biomaterials, and Cellular
Models Core is to provide human ADPKD biospecimens and cellular models to assist investigators in
translational research."
11057545,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
A key goal of “Healthy People 2030” is to improve the health of adults through aerobic physical activity. Soccer,
the most popular sport on earth, is an aerobic outlet for more than 25 million Americans. The potential benefits
of soccer are offset by repetitive subconcussive head impacts (RSHI) from soccer heading. RSHI are associated
with exposure-dependent adverse effects on neuroimaging and on cognitive performance, independent of
collisions and concussion. The tradeoffs between aerobic benefits and RSHI-related harms are not known. The
central aim of this proposal is to examine the aerobic benefits of soccer play, in relation to RSHI harms,
for brain structure and function, and to explore person-level factors that modify this risk-benefit tradeoff.
Beneficial effects of aerobic capacity and adverse subclinical effects of RSHI can be detected with neuroimaging
of white matter. However, little is known about their joint impact on white matter and, in turn, how white matter
features mediate effects on cognitive function. Fundamental knowledge on the RSHI risk-benefit balance can
inform our understanding of RSHI morbidity and its mitigation beyond the specific context of soccer, such as
other sports and combat. Prior work on RSHI effects has not specifically measured aerobic capacity, and little is
known about whether and how white matter mediates exposure-outcome associations. Our proposed 2-year
longitudinal follow up study of 280 young adults, including soccer players with high (n=70) and low (n=70)
exposure to RSHI, non-collision athletes (n=70) and non-athlete controls (n=70), will test the hypothesis that
aerobic capacity-engendered benefits confound and modify the adverse effects of RSHI on white matter
that, in turn, is a mediator of adverse cognitive effects. We will measure aerobic capacity (VO2max) and
RSHI over 2 years and perform Myelin Water and Microstructure MRI of white matter as well as cognitive
assessments, at enrollment and 2 years later. We will address the following specific aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the
joint effects of VO2max and RSHI on white matter myelination and microstructure. Aim 2: Assess mediation by
white matter of the known associations of VO2max and RSHI with cognitive performance. Aim 3: Explore the
BDNF-Val66met and ApoE-ε4 gene variants as modifiers of the tradeoff of VO2max and RHSI-mediated effects
on white matter. Delineating risk vs. benefit to cognitive performance from soccer can transform perception of
risk by stakeholders, facilitate choice and guidance on soccer participation and heading. Choices that impact
young adult players, with high RSHI exposure and decades of future needs, have the potential to impact their
wellbeing, healthcare footprint and productivity for decades."

The objective of our LAUNCH program is to continue our global health research training program called the
Global Health Equity Scholars (GHES) designed to create a new community of researchers, educators, and
professionals who are prepared to address new and emerging global health challenges. We will build on the
last nine years of this training program to create a cadre of new researchers who will dedicate their research
careers to address the health problems that arise out of the inequity of human conditions prevalent in
informal human settlements (slums). Rather than addressing one disease at a time, we propose to provide a
comprehensive, multidisciplinary and integrated approach to deal with urban and rural informal human
settlement health issues, developed over many years by the participating faculty members of this program.
This program will comprise four US partner institutions (Consortium)--Yale University, Stanford University,
University of Arizona, and University of California at Berkeley, each led by a leader in global health research
with more than 10 years of collaboration among themselves. Together, core faculty mentors from these
institutions conduct research at 25 institutions in 21 countries, representing regions of Africa, Central and
South America, the Caribbean; Asia, the Pacific, and Eastern Europe. The GHES program will address a
wide range of health research topics including HIV/AIDs, emerging and high- consequence infectious
diseases, non-communicable diseases (NCD), women’s health, environmental health, mental health,
interpersonal violence, substance abuse, injuries, and the interaction of all of these health issues within the
framework of slum health. Training will target US postdoctoral fellows and pre- doctoral students and low
and middle-income country (LMIC) postdoctoral fellows. We plan to recruit 9-10 trainees/year with 60% of
them as US postdoctoral fellows. The trainees will spend 8-12-months at an LMIC site under the supervision
of the Consortium and their collaborating LMIC mentors. Didactic workshops on global health research
methods will be conducted both in-person and online. LMIC trainees will spend 2-3 months at US institutions
to undergo training in methods not provided at their institutions. All of the trainees will be provided with
research and career mentorship throughout their training and tracked for career development after
completion of their GHES-supported research work. Thus, under this program, we expect the trainees to be
exposed to one important theme in global health research--health equity--through research that deals with
health concerns of vulnerable populations residing in informal human settlements, and provide them with an
opportunity to become experts in this new global health discipline. The overall impact of this training program
is, therefore, to create a new cadre of global health researchers and leaders who address the emerging
health issues arising out of ever-expanding informal human settlements of LMICs."

Meiosis is the specialized cell division cycle that gives rise to haploid gametes. Although meiosis is essential
for sexual reproduction, there is a surprising degree of variation in the meiotic program across model and
emerging model organisms. Exploring both these distinct differences and commonalities is crucial to our
understanding of how meiosis is regulated to ensure the production of euploid gametes. Nowhere is this more
important than in our own species, in which defects in meiosis are responsible for the extremely high rates of
infertility, miscarriage, and birth defects, such as Trisomies 18 and 21. The meiotic program encompasses
unique molecular processes underlying cell cycle control and checkpoint activation, DNA repair and
recombination, chromatin architecture, chromosome movements, and gene expression. This immense
complexity can inform a wide variety of biological sub-disciplines, including germ cell biology, DNA repair and
cancer, gene regulation and epigenetics, and chromosome dynamics and segregation. Partial support is
requested for the premier international meeting on Meiosis as part of the Gordon Research Conferences
(GRC), and the accompanying trainee-led Meiosis Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), taking place at Colby-
Sawyer College in New London, NH on June 2-7 and June 1-2, 2024, respectively. The goals are: (1) To
harness the strength of various model systems and state-of-the-art technical approaches to shed light on the
molecular mechanisms underpinning meiosis; (2) To identify novel scientific themes and collaborations that
can accelerate the pace of discovery in our field; and (3) To promote an environment of inclusivity and to
identify key ingredients for success of all members of our community, regardless of career stage, gender, or
racial or ethnic background. The GRC will gather 180 participants to present and discuss cutting-edge, mostly
unpublished research addressing critical topics in meiosis. The program comprises 9 plenary sessions that
broadly address current issues in the initiation and progression of meiotic recombination, meiotic progression
and cell cycle checkpoints, regulation of meiotic gene expression, chromosome pairing and synapsis,
chromosome dynamics, and chromosome (mis)segregation. Four poster sessions will allow researchers to
present their data and ideas, and to engage in critical discussions about their work with others in the field. An
open forum Power Hour will be convened with the aims of addressing the challenges faced by women in
science, and supporting the professional growth of women in our community. The GRS consists of three
plenary and two poster sessions, and will include 60 participants, including several invited faculty mentors. The
GRS provides opportunities for trainees and those new to the field to present their work, network, and discuss
the topics that will be covered in more depth during the GRC. Our community enjoys and promotes strong
representation by women, but we will further enhance our diversity by offering attendance support to under-
represented minorities, young investigators, and researchers from predominantly undergraduate institutions."

 Science for Neglected Zoonotic Disease Control in Peru
PROJECT SUMMARY
 The mission of this D43 application is to develop and establish an innovative transdisciplinary
training program in implementation science and epidemiology for Neglected Zoonotic Disease (NZD)
control in Peru. NZDs affect mainly the poor and have devastating effects on the affected individuals
and their families and communities. Due to migration and travel, high-income countries and their
health systems are also affected by NZDs. Despite NZDs impact and importance, there are no formal
training programs to allow professionals to focus on these diseases in Peru. This D43 application is a
collaboration between Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, the leading biomedical institution in
Peru; the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a world-renowned
academic health institution; and the Tulane School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, a global
powerhouse for tropical infectious disease training, with additional input from experts from other
institutions in the US and overseas. It proposes to prioritize training for young scientists from
disadvantaged areas in Peru, leveraging existing related infectious disease and implementation
science programs, while capitalizing on the extensive network and reach of collaborating institutions
and research hubs across various regions. This network includes a stellar group of faculty with
diverse research projects. The Principal Investigators’ distinctive set of skills: a clinical epidemiologist,
a veterinary epidemiologist, and an implementation scientist, make them a perfect “One Health” team
to train scientists to tackle zoonotic diseases in Peru and Latin America.
 Throughout the 5-year grant period we propose to: a) train 8 Peruvian students per year (40
total) in the Diploma of Operational Research and Implementation Science; b) train 4 Peruvian
students per year (20 total) in the Master’s in Control of Infectious and Tropical Diseases; c) train 2
Peruvian scientists between years 2-5 (8 total) in the Penn Summer Implementation Science Institute;
and our ultimate goal, d) train 5 Peruvian students in PhD programs in Peru and the US.
 Focusing on coursework and hands-on experiences in implementation science and
epidemiology of NZDs will provide our trainees with new tools and perspectives to improve
interventions, conduct well-designed studies, and build policies and programs to reduce NZDs and, in
turn, reduce inequalities in health. As former Fogarty trainees ourselves, we will apply the FIC
philosophy to build local individual research capacity and move us toward the WHO goal of ending

10899305,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) encompasses a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases caused by focal
and progressive atrophy of frontal and/or temporal lobes and is the leading cause of dementia before the age
of 60 and the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease (AD). There is no cure.
Among several variants within the FTD spectrum, the behavioral variant (bvFTD) is the most prevalent,
accounting for nearly 50% of all FTD cases. bvFTD is characterized by marked changes in personality,
impaired judgement and social conduct, and blunted emotion and affect, including a loss of empathy, which
represents arguably the most distressing and defining feature of bvFTD. The underlying neural mechanisms
are unknown. About 40-50% of FTD cases are familial and associated with mutations of over a dozen genes
with diverse molecular and cellular functions, among which GGGGCC (G4C2) hexanucleotide repeat
expansions (HREs) in the chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72, or C9) gene is the most common
genetic cause of FTD. We established an bvFTD mouse model of empathy loss and observed that aged
somatic transgenic mice expressing G4C2 HREs in C9orf72 exhibited blunted affect-sharing and failed to
comfort distressed conspecifics by affiliative touch. Our preliminary studies found that a marked reduction of
pyramidal neuron excitability in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) in aged mutant mice underlies
their lost empathy. Remarkably, restoring dmPFC neuronal excitability rescued the empathy deficits in mutant
mice, even at advanced ages when substantial cortical atrophy had occurred. These results establish dmPFC
hypoexcitability as a potential pathophysiological basis of empathy loss in bvFTD. The goals of this R01
application are to define the prefrontal circuits mediating empathy-driven consolation behavior (Aim 1),
delineate the intrinsic, synaptic, and circuit mechanisms of lost empathy in C9-bvFTD mouse models (Aim 2),
and explore therapeutic strategies that can rescue, reverse, and prevent empathy loss in mutant mice (Aim
3). The proposed studies are fundamentally important and highly significant because they have the
immediate potential to uncover novel pathogenic mechanisms and treatment strategies for FTD and related
dementia."
10874540,"Vestibular migraine (VM) is among the leading causes of dizziness in general population. The VM pathophysiology
is unknown with a major gap being lack of understanding neural mechanisms underlying symptoms related to spatial
disorientation in these patients. While VM patients do not have peripheral vestibular dysfunction, their symptoms
triggered by changes in the head position or visual surroundings indicate dysfunction at the high-level cortical mech-
anisms or their interactions with the lower-level vestibular functions. We have studied spatial orientation in a novel
context of Bayesian spatial model (BSM), which is built on decades of insights into neurophysiology of multisensory
processing and integration for spatial orientation. Within this framework, sensory components that encode head
and eye positions are taken into account to quantify spatial orientation. In prior work from our group, we showed
that VM patients have altered spatial orientation with changes in the head tilt position as well as heightened sensi-
tivity to visual motion. These findings suggest abnormal sensory integration for spatial orientation in VM patients.
Using the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we have shown that the multisensory vestibular cortex
within the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is involved in sensory integration for spatial orientation. We have also
developed a novel neurophysiological technique that can probe modulating effect of TPJ on vestibulo-ocular func-
tion, using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Through application of these methods, the overall objective
of this proposal is to delineate mechanisms and neural correlates of VM spatial disorientation with links to clinical
symptoms in patients. Our central hypothesis is that VM patients exhibit altered TPJ function within the vestibulo-
cortical network associated with abnormal sensory integration for spatial orientation. To test this hypothesis, we (i)
uncover distinct sensory mechanisms related to VM spatial disorientation, (ii) investigate whether such mechanisms
are linked to clinical signs and symptoms (validated measures of visuospatial symptoms and postural instability),
and (iii) delineate TPJ contributions to VM pathophysiology considering its role in both high and low level vestibular
functions, and whether TPJ can be targeted using TMS to modulate spatial disorientation in these patients. These
steps are crucial towards devising effective treatment strategies for debilitating dizziness and spatial disorientation
in VM patients."
10874542,"Project Summary/Abstract
Language is a defining feature of being human. No other animal has the ability to systematically order words or
signs so as to communicate complex thoughts, nor does such complex communication play nearly as central a
role in other species. According to the NIDCD, roughly 1 million people in the United States have some form of
aphasia, or loss of linguistic ability. The consequences are devastating for individuals and families.
The power of language derives from a unique evolutionary development: syntax, the abstract rules that allow us
to combine finite words into infinitely many possible strings. Without syntax, communication is painstaking and
error-prone. Despite its centrality, little remains known about its neural instantiation. Previous research has
attempted to experimentally isolate syntax so as to localize it in the brain, but this approach has produced mixed
and inconsistent results. We take a novel approach, using electrocorticography (ECoG) to investigate a well-
defined component of syntax: sequencing, or selecting words in an order determined by syntax.
A main impediment to progress in understanding syntax at the neural level is a granularity mismatch problem.
Neuroscience tends to deal in broader conceptual distinctions, as evidenced by experimental manipulations that
attempt to isolate all of syntax. However, psycholinguistic models tend to be much finer grained, portraying
syntactic abilities as a conglomerate of processes and representations rather than a monolithic entity that can
be turned on or off. Here, we leverage computationally explicit models to make linking hypotheses between
cognitive processes and commensurate neural mechanisms. For instance, sequencing critically relies on a
binding mechanism for linking particular words to positions in a syntactic tree. The central hypothesis of this
proposal is that binding between syntax and words is instantiated as neural synchrony between regions encoding
syntax and those encoding words.
Our approach has a number of strengths. (1) As ECoG is largely insensitive to production artifacts, we will employ
a production paradigm, allowing us to more clearly isolate particular syntactic processes than traditional
comprehension studies. (2) ECoG has unparalleled spatial and temporal resolution. (3) Our research draws not
only from findings in neuroscience, but from computationally explicit psycholinguistic models, allowing us to test
hypotheses that have a high probability of being at least partially correct.
This project leverages the applicant’s expertise in linguistics and cognitive psychology, and complements this
background with additional training in neuroscience and signal processing. The applicant will be embedded in a
world-class research and clinical environment, with dedicated mentors who are leading experts in ECoG and the
neurobiology of language. The findings will deepen our understanding of normally functioning communication,
in line with the NIDCD’s first priority area, by shedding light on the mechanisms affected in word order deficits,
which are common in a range of disorders including aphasia and specific language impairment."
10874656,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy that, despite being treatable with well-
defined chemotherapy regimens, is ultimately fatal in over half of all cases categorized as high-risk AML.
Mutations in MLL, FLT3, DNMT3A and P53 are associated with high-risk AML. Even targeted FLT3 anti kinase
therapy, which constitutes 30 % of AML, failed to engender durable response in this group of AML. Co-operative
oncogenic signaling” was attributed to poor therapeutic outcome, but lacks mechanistic understanding. Based
on our recent publication and new preliminary data, we found that co-operative oncogenic signaling converges
on c-FOS and DUSP1, which results in an increased apoptotic threshold in cancer cells and confers drug
resistance. Thus, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of c-FOS and DUSP1 sensitizes cancer cells to
chemotherapy (Kesarwani, et. al. Nature Medicine 2017). We show greater expression of c-FOS and DUSP1
in high-risk AML patients, but not in low risk-AML patients. Both genetic and chemical inhibition of c-FOS and
DUSP1 results in increased drug sensitivity to both TKI and conventional chemotherapeutic drugs in a model
of high-risk AML (FLT3ITD+MLLAF9). Thus, we hypothesize that co-operative oncogenic signaling in AML
induces the expression of c-FOS and DUSP1 resulting to drug resistance and disease relapse due to elevated
apoptotic threshold. In Aim 1, we will determine whether c-FOS and DUSP1 are necessary and sufficient for
transformation in a most frequent, aggressive, and fatal AML driven by FLT3ITD+DNMT3Amut+NPM1C and
FLT3ITD+P53mut mutations. We will examine the cellular basis of c-FOS and DUSP1 dependency in the high-
risk AML mouse models and primary patient samples by genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of c-
FOS and DUSP1. Next, we propose experiments to understand the mechanistic basis for how co-operative
oncogenic signaling via c-FOS and DUSP1 contributes to transformation and treatment failure in AML, with the
goal for novel treatment strategies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that c-FOS and DUSP1
signaling converges upon oncogenically-activated enhancers mediated by specific AP-1 transcriptional
complexes. In the presence of c-FOS and DUSP1, AP-1 complexes consist of c-FOS-JUN, which mediate
oncogenically-active enhancers, while in the absence of c-FOS and DUSP1, Jun family homodimers (JUN-
JUNB, JUNB-JUND, JUN-JUND) predominate which are unable to support the leukemic cell state. In Aim 2,
we will molecularly link c-FOS-JUN AP-1 and DUSP1 activity to global enhancer chromatin dynamics.
Moreover, we will exploit chromatin-embedded target-gene-reporter alleles to provide a detailed analysis of
functionally-relevant downstream genes at a single-cell level in high-risk AML. The proposed work is expected
to delineate the necessity of c-FOS and DUSP1 signaling in high-risk AML, as well as to provide deep
molecular insight into the mechanisms underlying leukemic transformation and drug resistance. We expect that
this information will be informative not only for AML, but also the broad group of treatment resistant tumors."

Mechanisms of Motor Neuron Injury in Acute Flaccid Myelitis
Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is an infectious disorder of motor neurons that resembles poliomyelitis. AFM
predominantly affects children and has tragic consequences, often leading to lifelong paralysis. Concerningly,
the incidence of AFM has increased exponentially with each recent outbreak. Effective treatment options for
AFM are lacking, owing primarily to our poor understanding of disease pathogenesis. In the proposed work, I
will investigate mechanisms of motor neuron toxicity in AFM. The majority of cases of AFM are caused by
Enterovirus D68 (EV68). Therefore, I will focus on the infection of motor neurons by EV68 as a model of AFM.
First, I will evaluate the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport in motor neuron toxicity following EV68 infection.
This pathway is known to be altered in enterovirus infection and is also a key determinant of motor neuron
toxicity in neurodegenerative disease. I will further define the mechanism of disruption of the nuclear pore
complex by EV68, its effects on nucleocytoplasmic transport and motor neuron toxicity, and whether it can be
pharmacologically targeted to prevent motor neuron death in vitro. Second, to better define the pathologic
cascade following EV68 infection, I will investigate early pathologic events in a novel co-culture system
including motor neurons and muscle fibers. I will specifically investigate changes in motor neuron morphology,
electrophysiologic activity, and neuromuscular junction integrity. Third, I will determine whether host genetic
background influences EV68 infectivity or subsequent motor neuron toxicity by studying iPS motor neurons
derived from AFM patients compared to unrelated controls. Collectively, these studies will advance our
understanding of pathogenic mechanisms in EV68-associated AFM and evaluate putative therapeutic targets.
The experiments will also develop and refine model systems for the study of AFM and generate important
preliminary data for future studies leading to scientific independence. The training plan will provide new
training in virology methods and extend my expertise in iPS-based neurologic disease modeling and advanced
microscopy."

Circadian rhythms are fundamental to living organisms. The mammalian circadian system, which controls daily
rhythms of behavior and physiology, is a multi-oscillatory system composed of a master pacemaker in the
hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and many other oscillators in peripheral organs. However, the
SCN is not the only pacemaker. When arousing stimuli are present, circadian behavior rhythms are observed
even when circadian clocks in the SCN and peripheral tissues are disabled. The molecular mechanisms,
anatomical loci, and functional significance of these extra-SCN pacemakers are not known. We have
assembled molecular and imaging toolsets and technologies to identify the neural circuitry and physiological
outputs of those extra-SCN pacemakers. The proposed studies will uncover the functional significance of the
enigmatic extra-SCN circadian pacemakers in mammals.
The discovery of the loci and physiological roles of the extra-SCN pacemakers will expand our understanding
of the molecular and physiological processes of the circadian system. Importantly, our studies will investigate
how the SCN and extra-SCN pacemakers interact to regulate feeding and sleep. Disruption of circadian
rhythms and sleep by shiftwork and exposure to artificial light at night increases the risk of human diseases. In
addition, sleep and circadian rhythms are impaired in several neurological disorders and in persons with drug
addictions. Therefore, understanding how extra-SCN pacemakers control circadian rhythms will elucidate novel
processes that could be manipulated to manage circadian disruption in humans."

capacity at network institutions. One mechanism for this investment is the availability of INBRE Alteration and
Renovation (Alt & Reno) funding. Roger Williams University (RWU) is one of six RI-INBRE network primarily
undergraduate institutions and is in the early stages of expanding its biomedical research capacity. In this
renewal application, we propose using Alt & Reno funds to construct a rodent housing facility (i.e., vivarium) at
RWU. This facility represents an important investment in RWUs commitment to research and engaged learning,
and it is designed for use by both investigators and research courses. RWU has identified an available ground
floor area with the appropriate square footage, low ambient noise level, and infrastructure to support the
renovation. Importantly, RWU has made a significant institutional commitment to this effort and will contribute
57% of the cost of the renovation. This project will allow investigators to conduct rodent experiments in-house
instead of traveling to Brown University. In addition, the new vivarium will be critical to RWU’s ability to attract
new investigators with robust biomedical research programs. This Alt & Reno project represents a critical

 The Roybal Center for Elder Mistreatment Intervention Research will contribute significant, impactful scientific
progress to the elder mistreatment (EM) field by addressing the overarching research question: How can we
reduce exposure to EM and prevent its mental and physical health impacts among community-dwelling
older adults and their family caregivers? The scientific premise underlying this Roybal Center is as follows:
most known modifiable intervention targets for, and outcomes of, EM have an established evidence base guiding
behavioral interventions drawn from related fields. There is a need to rapidly and effectively adapt, refine, and
implement these interventions to fit the context of EM. Thus, we will initially focus on pilots addressing Stages
0-2 of behavioral intervention development. We will provide robust services and support through Cores designed
to ensure translation and progression of the pilots through the NIH stage model by targeting known barriers to
research progression for EM. The activities and infrastructure proposed to overcome these barriers are described
in the Administrative Core and Behavioral Intervention Development Core (BID) Core and include novel
components such as a human subjects safety pre-review panel and a Participant-Reported Outcomes Advisory
Team. By addressing barriers in EM research at the pilot stage, we hypothesize that investigators can build
sustainable and impactful long-term research programs to achieve mechanism-focused EM intervention
development and evaluation. Based at UTHealth Houston this center is uniquely qualified to lead the
advancement of EM intervention research and support new cohorts of EM investigators with one of the largest
teams of funded EM researchers in existence. This Roybal Center is further supported by accomplished
treatment outcomes and implementation science investigators who will support the transition of projects through
the stages of intervention development. This Roybal Center is designed to overcome crucial barriers preventing
significant, impactful progression of EM intervention development research. This center will significantly impact
the field of EM by providing a rigorous evidence base to inform clinical practice guidelines (e.g., USPTF), public
policy, and service delivery -- ultimately reducing rates of elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation while
supporting older adult and caregiver well-being."
10874479,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Audiologists frequently encounter patients who complain of speech-in-noise perception difficulties despite having
normal hearing sensitivity. The neurobiological bases of such deficits are currently debated and remain unknown,
which limits development of precision diagnostics and targeted treatment strategies to help these patients. As a
consequence, many may suffer untreated and debilitating communication impairments in real world situations,
causing social withdrawal, limiting academic achievement, and/or constraining vocational opportunities. Limited
evidence suggests that the efferent auditory pathway, which descends from the brain to the inner ears and
putatively filters out noise before it enters the nervous system, may be impaired in some of these patients. This
research project investigates relationships between inner ear efferent activity and subcortical processing of
speech-in-noise during active listening in audiometrically-normal adults with and without clinically-documented
speech-in-noise deficits. Specifically, we have developed a method for simultaneously measuring pre-neural
(i.e., otoacoustic emissions; OAE) and neural (i.e., frequency following responses) biophysical responses evoked
by naturalistic continuous speech. This approach makes it possible, for the first time, to directly study the
influence of cochlear efferent effects on neural processing and perception of speech-in-noise. We hypothesize
that: 1) “traditional” passive assays of cochlear efferent activity (i.e., OAE inhibition with contralateral noise)
underestimate efferent modulation of cochlear mechanics during active listening to speech-in-noise; 2)
attentional modulation of cochlear activity predicts attentional modulation of subcortical neural activity; and 3)
cochlear and neural attention modulation effects can be used to statistically model speech-in-noise perceptual
performance. The outcomes of this research will clarify the role of the efferent system in naturalistic speech-in-
noise processing and may elucidate “sites of lesion” responsible for speech-in-noise deficits in audiometrically-
normal listeners. Further, our findings may inform development of assistive listening devices and/or brain-
computer interfaces that are inspired by typical neurophysiologic auditory function to aid listeners with speech-
in-noise deficits."

While breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women in the U.S., it is extremely rare
in men, accounting for less than 1% of all breast cancer cases. Although there are several factors
that may increase the risk of developing male breast cancer, the fundamental disease-defining
molecular pathway of this rare cancer remains unknown. As a result, male breast cancer has
been considered similar to female breast cancer even though accumulating evidence indicates
that breast cancers in men may be genetically and epigenetically distinct. Unfortunately, unlike
female breast cancer, the lack of model systems hinders the investigation of male breast cancer.
The ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) plays a critical role in the regulation of protein quality
control through protein degradation. Dysregulation of the UPS has been implicated in several
diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The UPS is composed of 3 critical
enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin
ligases (E3). While E3 ligases are often found to be dysregulated in cancer, the
pathophysiological significance of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes remains elusive. UbcH7
(also known as Ube2l3) is one of the E2 enzymes ubiquitously expressed in various tissues and
organs. Our lab has recently discovered that UbcH7 heterozygosity (UbcH7+/) significantly
promotes the incidence of male breast cancer in MMTV-Neu mice, a mouse model of HER2+
human breast cancer. Importantly, the loss of one copy of UbcH7 does not have any effects in
female breast cancer. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first transgenic mouse model that
promotes breast cancer only in males. Based on these results, we hypothesize that UbcH7 plays
a unique role in the prevention of male breast cancer by promoting the degradation of an
oncoprotein which only influences mammary tumorigenesis in males. The ultimate goal of this
project is to identify the “male-specific oncoprotein” in breast cancer. Towards this goal, we will
first investigate the pathophysiological conditions of UbcH7+/- male mice, especially focusing on
mammary gland development (Aim 1). We will then perform in vivo 2H2O-labeling and mass
spectrometry-based proteomics to identify the substrates of UbcH7 in male mammary glands (Aim
2). Furthermore, we also plan to conduct RNA-seq to identify an altered signaling pathway(s) in
UbcH7+/- mammary glands. Despite numerous studies on breast cancer, the mechanisms that
regulate male breast cancer remain poorly understood. We expect that our studies will place
UbcH7 as a novel predisposition gene for the development of male breast cancer, serving as a
breakthrough that will open up a new direction of research in this field."

Goal: We will develop and validate a microphysiological platform of human cardiac sympathetic innervation for
in vitro modeling of the human cardiac sympathetic innervation and apply autonomic neuron specification and
its interaction with a fatal cardiac disease. The heart is heavily innervated by the autonomic nervous system that
consists of both parasympathetic and sympathetic nerves, providing feedback control and regulate overall
cardiac performance. Historically, the development of new therapeutic agents targeting cardiac neuropathies
have utilized animal models, which exhibited various limitations due to the disparity in homeostatic mechanisms
of autonomic nervous systems and the inability to recapitulate accurate human disease phenotypes. In our

expect to recapitulate ACM syndromic phenotypes and examine the diseased cardiac sympathetic innervation
on our microphysiological platform, conducive to understanding neuromodulation as well as the neuronal

culture platform in multi-well format to monitor electrophysiology properties of cardiomyocytes, sympathetic
neurons and neuro-cardiac junction, followed by evaluation of the platform’s ability to support functional synapse
formation with optogenetic neuronal stimulation (Aim 1). We will also generate the developmental trajectory of
hiPSC-cardiomyocytes connected to hiPSC-sympathetic neurons through single cell transcriptomic analysis, as
well as structural and functional changes in hiPSC-CMs following neuronal stimulations (Aim 2). Furthermore,
we will examine whether the innervation affects cell fate choice (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will employ ACM patient-
derived hiPSC/hESCs harboring desmosomal gene mutations onto our microphysiological platform and
investigate the role of sympathetic innervation in pathogenic phenotypes presented by ACM, which will be
validated in vivo. The proposed in vitro model of cardiac autonomic innervation could provide broad applications,

10893360,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The long-term goal of this proposal is to uncover mechanisms of pathogenicity of Cryptococcus neoformans
(Cn) focusing on how Cn adapts to host temperature. Cn is a fungal pathogen that, upon entering the lung and
disseminating through the bloodstream, causes a life-threatening meningo-encephalitis primarily in HIV/AIDS
patients. Current anti-cryptococcal therapies can have devastating side effects. Thus, new treatment strategies
are warranted to eliminate mortality associated with cryptococcosis. The objective of this proposal is to
determine how the temperature is sensed by Cn and transmitted to downstream effector pathways critical for
pathogenicity. The central hypothesis is that filament-forming GTP-ases called septins provide an essential
hub protein complex which links temperature sensing to a compensatory signaling response and plasma
membrane (PM) homeostasis. It is proposed that exposure to host temperature results in increased fluidity and
curvature within the PM and the elevation of PM-associated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)
leading to enrichment of septins at the PM based on PIP2 binding, which has two-fold role in Cn adaptation to
host temperature: it maintains PM homeostasis and facilitates stress signaling via phospholipase C (PLC), and
protein kinase C (PKC) pathways. In support of this hypothesis, experiments with recombinant septins or
studies employing model organisms suggest that septins recognize membrane curvature via their propensity to
bind PIP2. Importantly, recombinant septins prevent temperature-induced changes in lipid bilayer composition.
Preliminary data supporting this application are: 1) Cn PIP2 levels increase at 37°C. 2) Septins associate with
the PM when Cn is shifted to 37°C. 3) Septin-deficient mutants exhibit increased PM permeability and
sensitivity to drugs that perturb PM. Published and preliminary data also demonstrate phenotypic similarity
between septin-deficient and PLC signaling-defective mutants. The central hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing two aims. Aim1: Dynamics of septin assembly at the PM will be defined with TIRF microscopy.
Genetic and pharmacological approaches will determine whether septin complexes are enriched at the PM
based on increased levels of PIP2. An innovative light switchable allele of Cdc42 (GTPase involved in septin
assembly) will help to establish effectors down-stream of Cdc42 acting in septin complex formation. A septin
mutant lacking the amphiphatic helix (AH) will be utilized to test the role of AH in recruiting septin complex to
the PM. Aim2: An impact of septin complexes on PM lipid composition, PM biophysical properties, stress
response signaling dependent on PIP2, and pathogenesis in animal infection model will be determined. The
proposed research is significant because it will elucidate a novel mechanism through which septins contribute
to sensing high temperature and regulating PM-dependent stress response signaling pathways crucial for the
pathogenesis of Cn. Outcomes will be better understanding of how Cn adapts to host temperature and a new
foundation upon which to develop improved anti-cryptococcal therapies in HIV/AIDS patients."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States and worldwide. Around ~80%
of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage.
Immunotherapy, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), has dramatically improved survival outcomes
and is now the standard of care for treatment of advanced NSCLC without targetable oncogene mutations.
However, only ~20% patients respond to ICIs radiologically and ~35% will experience durable clinical benefit.
Given the potential toxicity and financial burden of these treatments, it is critical to identify which patients will
benefit from ICIs as early as possible. Unfortunately, existing tissue-based biomarkers do not accurately
predict ICI response for an individual patient. Moreover, they suffer from fundamental and practical limitations,
including intra-tumor heterogeneity, insufficient sample quality and quantity. There is a critical need for reliable
biomarkers of immunotherapy response and clinical benefit in NSCLC.
To address this unmet need, we will develop noninvasive imaging and blood-based biomarkers and integrate
these complementary approaches to improve prediction of immunotherapy response and outcome in NSCLC.
Specifically, we will: (1) develop knowledge-guided radiomics and biology-informed deep learning models to
enhance generalizability and interpretability; (2) propose novel methods to extract therapy-induced information
from longitudinal images; and (3) integrate imaging and blood-based biomarkers to further improve prediction
of response and outcomes. We will leverage a large institutional dataset for model training and establish the
clinical validity through rigorous prospective validation. Successful completion of the project will afford a
noninvasive approach to accurate prediction of immunotherapy response and clinical benefit in advanced lung
cancer. This may lead to response-driven personalized treatment strategies by distinguishing patients who will
respond to immunotherapy and for whom current standard treatment is sufficient; versus patients who will not
respond and may benefit from novel combination treatment strategies. Additionally, early response evaluation
using on-treatment imaging and blood information could be used to guide decisions of subsequent treatments.
Given the routine use of CT scans and blood samples in lung cancer care, the proposed biomarkers can be
readily integrated to current clinical workflow and may have a positive impact on broad patient populations."

This proposal requests support for the 2024 GRC and GRS meeting on Chromatin Structure & Function (focus on
“Chromatin's Impact on Genome Function Across Size and Time-Scales”) at the Bryant University in Rhode Island
from July 6 - 12, 2024. The 2024 Gordon Conference on Chromatin Structure and Function will bring together
outstanding international experts to discuss their latest and most exciting research on chromatin as a powerful
regulatory platform that shapes genome function. The conference addresses how chromatin-based genome
regulation impacts all essential DNA-dependent processes, both at the most fundamental and mechanistic level,
and also at the level of disease pathologies, and therefore is highly significant.
The field is evolving at a rapid pace due to adoption of novel interdisciplinary approaches, from fields such as
genomics, chemical biology, and structural biology. These approaches have enabled new ways to visualize
conformation and dynamics from the scale of single nucleosomes and their regulators to the scale of whole
chromosomes. Such advances are allowing for in-depth testing of existing models such as heterochromatin
spreading using novel synthetic biology approaches as well as the discovery of new mechanisms for major
unanswered questions such as dosage compensation. At the same time, it is also becoming clear that many
mechanisms discovered in model cells vary in usage based on cell type and therefore at an organismal level, it is
critical to understand tissue-specific chromatin regulation. Such tissue specific studies are particularly critical for
understanding the origin of various cancers.
This conference has a long history of attracting top researchers and new entrants in chromatin research. It has been
an important forum for fostering new ideas, and collaborations, and this tradition will be continued in 2024. We will
continue to integrate new members into this growing field. A large number of talks will be reserved for early-career
scientists and for scientists from under-represented groups, and all applicants will have the opportunity to present a
poster on their work. Additionally, “poster previews” will highlight selected posters in short oral presentations.
Sufficient discussion time will be scheduled to promote the lively and free exchange of ideas and interpretations and
there will be ample time set aside in the afternoons and after the evening sessions for the informal interactions that
have always played a key role at this conference. The GRC will be preceded by a GRS which we expect to further
enhance interactions and networking among the younger conference participants."

Human Tissue Network (CHTN), offering high quality human tissue and biofluid specimens procured, stored
and shipped under optimized standard operating procedures. A team of consent staff recruit subjects at
UVA clinics, with the consent including provisions for genetic sequencing and data sharing as well as
donating tissue, blood and bone marrow samples. Staffing, procedures & infrastructure are in place to
minimize procurement times and tissue samples are quality controlled by histologic examination by Board-
certified Pathologists. Procured tissue specimens are made available in fresh-frozen, chemically-fixed,
paraffin-embedded and viable form. UVA is joined by two satellite donor sites to increase geographic and
racial/ethnic diversity: the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), which has a significantly higher
percentage of African-American patients than UVA, and by the University of New Mexico (UNM), which has
a significantly higher percentage of Hispanic patients than UVA. We propose to continue procurement at
these 3 sites for the next funding period. As one of the few current CHTN divisions able to procure fresh and
frozen samples of prostate cancer, we propose to continue to offer this precious resource to CHTN
investigators. We also propose to continue our focus on constructing tissue microarrays (TMAs) for the
CHTN, to help supplement the traditional strengths of the CHTN (prospective customizable procurement of
tissue) with larger cohorts of specimens in TMA format, with more rich annotation of clinical data. Our ability
to provide annotated data is enhanced by an established tumor registry. We will also continue to provide
specimens from a large legacy collection of lung cancer biospecimens from the Lung Cancer Biospecimen
Resource Network. We will provide histology guided-macrodissection services to create value-added target
tissue enrichment and histologic quality control and will provide viable freezing of dissociated tissue and
isolated white blood cells, as well as DNA/RNA isolation from tissue specimens. To support new areas of
research, we will 1) create digital pathology scans of all tissues procured for research purposes at UVA for a
repository of well-annotated histology images for image analysis and machine learning projects and 2) will
create a repository of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with cancer-causing germline mutations."

Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) are major causes of death and disability in the United
States, with the number of adults with ADRDs projected to reach 13 million by 2050. Among these, the
frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) spectrum disorders are among the most common causes of dementia in
younger individuals (<60y), resulting in high social and economic burden. Diagnosis of FTD is challenging,
typically requiring subspeciality expertise that is not widely available in a timely manner. Many FTD spectrum
disorders manifest in speech, and speech changes can help differentiate FTD subtypes. Prior research
supports the clinical utility of speech-based prediction of FTD presence and subtype. Unfortunately, rigor of
these prior studies is limited for several reasons, including small sample sizes, failure to follow predictive
modeling best practices, use of research grade speech recordings, and lack of prospective validation. We
propose a highly innovative approach to speech-based prediction of FTD that avoids the weaknesses of prior
work. Central to our approach is the insight that FTD may be too rare to use powerful deep learning models,
but the abnormal speech characteristics seen in FTD are also seen in other disorders. Training a model to
recognize these characteristics in FTD does not require limiting the dataset to FTD patients. We plan use this
to our advantage. In Aim 1 we will use a self-administered, web-based speech exam to create a large dataset
of all disorders seen in our speech clinic. Recordings will be made in a standard exam room using mobile
phones or tablets. Our expert speech and language pathologist will annotate the recordings with perceptual
speech characteristics, such as abnormal rate or vocal strain. The large sample size will enable us to use deep
learning for what it excels at – trainable feature extraction optimized for the task at hand. We will follow
predictive modeling best practices, including use of a validation set. In Aim 2 we will apply these trained
models in a large cohort spanning the FTD spectrum and extract the data from the last layer in the network,
just before it makes its prediction. This is a low dimensional representation of the speech signal, but which
contains the information necessary for predicting perceptual characteristics. We will use these representations
to develop a nearest neighbor classifier for FTD. Essentially, the model matches a new case to similar ones in
a labeled set based on the low-dimensional representation and uses the neighborhood to assign a label for the
new case. Finally, in Aim 3 we will combine our self-administered speech exam and the models from Aims 1
and 2 into a single tool and perform a prospective validation study to test performance in a clinical setting. The
predicted increase in ADRDs and lack of access to specialists will necessitate a shift in clinical practice from a
few expert centers to a distributed system of non-expert providers. The digital tool we propose meets this
challenge head on through scalable and easy to use automated speech analysis and prediction of FTD."
10884722,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Agents that interfere with the bioactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) offer benefits over
standard care laser treatment of the peripheral avascular retina in severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
Our lab provided proof of concept that regulating VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling in retinal endothelial
cells (ECs) not only inhibited disordered intravitreal neovascularization (IVNV) in severe ROP, but also
facilitated ordered EC division to allow vascularization into peripheral avascular retina (VPAR). VPAR occurs
after intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment in infants with ROP, but reactivation with IVNV is difficult to distinguish
from VPAR. To avoid complications from reactivated IVNV, clinicians tend to treat all new angiogenesis, but
laser reduces potential VPAR and associated expanded visual field. Also, some anti-VEGFs reduce systemic
VEGF levels with reports of adverse events in treated infants. There is the need to safely target pathologic
VEGFR2 signaling to only inhibit IVNV and not VPAR. Our lab strives to understand signaling mechanisms that
permit VPAR but inhibit IVNV in ROP without damaging the retina or the infant. We found that specifically in
retinal ECs, regulation at the level of VEGF receptor 2 extended vascularization into the peripheral avascular
retina, whereas endothelial STAT3 or the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) either increased or inhibited IVNV. In
our novel retinal EC culture model, we distinguished VEGF-activated tyrosine sites on the C-terminal domain
(CTD) of VEGFR2. Sustained VEGFR2 signaling, important in p-ERK-mediated IVNV, activated the tyrosine
(Y1175) site but not the Y1214. We also found that the adaptor proteins, MEMO1 and IQGAP1, sustained
signaling through VEGFR2 leading to disordered or invasive angiogenesis in disease models. In transgenic
humanized mice, signaling through the EPOR improved retinal function following oxygen induced damage.
Based on our findings, we developed the hypothetical framework that regulation of angiogenesis leads to
IVNV or VPAR and is mediated by signaling events involving1) activation of tyrosine phosphorylation sites on
VEGFR2 or 2) adaptor proteins, e.g., MEMO1, IQGAP1, and that 3) crosstalk between EPOR and VEGFR2
signaling provides retinal vascular/neural protection. We propose 3 aims to test the prediction that: 1) IVNV will
be increased by OIR- induced VEGF signaling through VEGFR2 in mice expressing mutant Y1212 (analog of
human Y1214); 2) to test prediction that adaptor protein, MEMO1, interferes with Y1175 activation, whereas
adaptor protein, IQGAP1, leads to Y1175 activation, retinal EC proliferation and IVNV; and 3) To test the
prediction that crosstalk between VEGFR2 and EPOR signaling supports polarized retinal EC migration, as in
VPAR, and that recovery of retinal neural function through EPOR involves EPOR-mediated vascular protection
against high oxygen-induced damage. Methods include: novel mice with CRISPR-engineered mutations
combined with conditional inducible knockout; optical coherence tomography; Micron IV imaging; OIR;
OptoMotry and ERG."
10884723,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sensory and motor dysfunctions are potential biomarkers of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as they may
precede cognitive impairments. However, how the sensory and motor dysfunctions affect the brain functional
connectivity (FC) between white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) remains uninvestigated. This is because
previous functional MRI analyses have overlooked WM due to weaker signal in WM. We recently demonstrated
that FC between WM and GM (i.e., WM-GM FC) is reliably detectable and sensitive to AD, confirming its potential
in capturing brain function and its changes. However, three major methodological obstacles hinder accurate
evaluations and analyses of WM-GM FC at multiple scales. First, the unique topology of WM-GM FC network
cannot be adequately modeled by a conventional graph model. Second, the most advanced WM spatial
smoothing method, which requires diffusion MRI data for guidance, is complex and impractical for standalone
fMRI data. Third, the elongated shape of WM functional architecture compromises traditional group-level voxel-
scale statistical analysis. Therefore, our overall goal is to develop and apply a novel family of methods to
investigate multi-scale alterations in the WM-GM functional connectome resulting from sensory and motor
dysfunctions in preclinical AD. This goal will be achieved through two aims. Aim 1 is to develop innovative
methods to characterize, detect and analyze WM-GM FC at multiple scales, including network-, region-
and voxel- scales. Specifically, we will develop a bipartite-graph model to characterize WM-GM FC networks
and quantify network properties, create a 4D atlas composed of diffusion-informed smoothing kernels for all WM
voxels to simplify WM smoothing for any fMRI images, and develop a functional tract-based spatial statistics
(fTBSS) method to optimize group-level voxel-scale analysis. Aim 2 is to apply the developed methods to
investigate changes in WM-GM FC at multiple scales resulting from motor dysfunctions in preclinical
AD. Exploiting our developed methods and existing databases, we will test three hypotheses. 1) specific WM-
GM FC network metrics, especially within the somatomotor-related networks, may alter in preclinical AD subjects
with MD relative to elderly controls and more altered WM-GM FC metrics may be associated with more severe
MD; 2) the relationship between MD and WM-GM FC metrics may be moderated by other biological factors (e.g.,
sex, APOE ε4 status and brain atrophy). 3) the WM-GM FC metrics may act as mediators in the relationship
between amyloid deposit and MD. The outcomes of this project will fill the gaps in our knowledge of how sensory
and motor dysfunctions influence WM-GM functional connectome in preclinical AD and enrich the set of
biomarkers for prediction of early AD, which will eventually enhance the well-being of both the aging population
and their caregivers. The released code and atlases will benefit a broad community of investigators interested
in the functional connectome."
10885573,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) are multifactorial disorders with complex pathological
mechanisms. Proteinopathy, neuronal impairments, and neuroinflammation are well-known hallmarks of ADRD.
Lipid dysregulation is also a prominent feature of AD pathology. Genes that control lipid metabolism are
implicated in AD, and plasma and brain lipid levels are altered in disease. Therapeutically modifying lipids might
alleviate behavioral and cognitive decline and risk of neurodegenerative disease, but additional studies are
needed to better understand lipid-related molecular changes and their effects on brain function and disease.
Astrocytes are essential for brain lipid homeostasis due to astrocytic enrichment of lipid-related factors and the
dependence of neurons on astrocytes for lipid turnover and various lipid-based processes. However, the effects
of dementia-associated pathological factors and disease cascades on astrocytic lipids have not been defined.
Moreover, how changes in astrocyte lipids are regulated and how they influence forebrain neurons is unclear.
Further investigations are required to define astrocytic lipid signatures and lipid-based alterations and how they
influence neuronal function and vulnerability to disease.
 Our preliminary data suggest that proteinopathy and neuroimmune factors influence astrocyte lipid
synthesis and release, which may affect astrocytic-neuronal interactions and neuronal health in aging and
disease. Based on our novel results, we hypothesize that AD-related proteinopathy and neuroimmune signaling
induce maladaptive changes in astrocytic lipid metabolism and release that promote neuronal vulnerability in
dementia. In the proposed R21 study, we will use lipidomics and other advanced approaches in mouse models
to characterize the spatiotemporal alterations in astrocyte lipids during aging and disease (Aim 1) and investigate
how alterations in astrocytic lipids are regulated and may promote neuronal impairments and vulnerability to
disease (Aim 2). We will perform innovative lipidomic profiling in astrocytes at different ages and across brain
regions, which will address previously underappreciated molecular signatures in astrocytes. We will also use a
novel approach of spatial lipidomics to resolve lipid-based changes across brain regions and use isolated mouse
astrocytes and human iPSC-derived astrocytes to identify cell-autonomous effects and molecular mechanisms
that regulate astrocyte lipids and lipid-based astrocytic-neuronal interactions. In summary, the proposed study
seeks to elucidate novel lipid signatures and molecular mechanisms associated with ADRD, which may reveal
new therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disorders."

There is a profound need to improve venous thromboembolism [VTE] treatment and prevention, particularly in
patients with inflammatory bowel disease [IBD]. This Pathway to Independence Award application is submitted
by a pharmacoepidemiologist committed to improving VTE prevention and treatment in populations who are
often excluded or vastly under-represented in randomized clinical trials [RCTs]. Of the 3 million Americans
affected by IBD, ~1–7% will develop VTE, a significant source of morbidity and mortality, in both the outpatient
and inpatient settings. While attention has been paid to the role of anticoagulants for VTE prevention in IBD
patients, there are key barriers to prescribing anticoagulants in this population including: (1) absence of data
on the effectiveness of anticoagulants for the prevention of VTE in IBD patients; (2) fear of bleeding
complications; and (3) lack of evidence on the safety of anticoagulants in high-risk subgroups such as patients
with active disease flares or postpartum IBD patients, who are at an increased risk of adverse complications.
The overarching goal of this research is to evaluate the use, effectiveness, and safety of anticoagulants in IBD
patients in the inpatient and outpatient settings. The applicant will achieve the proposed aims of this K99/R00
award under the guidance of established researchers who span the disciplines of epidemiology, biostatistics,
gastroenterology, and hematology at the University of Pennsylvania. First, the applicant will use a combination
of machine learning and advanced methodological techniques to examine predictors of use, effectiveness, and
safety of anticoagulants in the inpatient setting (K99 phase). In the R00 phase, the applicant will use linked
electronic health records/claims database to examine the comparative effectiveness and safety of direct oral
anticoagulants, warfarin, and heparins in IBD patients in the outpatient setting. The research proposed in this
K99/R00 is critical since it provides timely needed information on the risks and benefits of anticoagulants in
IBD patients, data that will not be forthcoming from large RCTs in the foreseeable future. The proposed career
development and training goals will provide the applicant with training in predictive modeling, time-varying
adjustment, and machine learning. The successful completion of the proposed training, infrastructure, and
institutional support at the University of Pennsylvania will guarantee the applicant's success and transition to
scientific independence."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is a major global
healthcare burden. However, there is still no effective disease modifying therapy for AD and
clinical trials with the aim of preventing or stabilizing cognitive impairment have largely failed.
Decision making in both clinical practice and research is highly dependent on practical predictive
tools, which can effectively predict cognitive or functional outcomes in individuals. Such models
could be potentially used in clinical research to boost the power of trials by enrollment of
participants who are most likely to show disease progression during the trial’s timeframe.
Alternatively, these models could be used to identifying individuals who would benefit from
primary or secondary prevention once there are effective treatments for AD. In this project, we
aim to provide a framework for practical prediction of cognitive decline with aging and prodromal
AD, by applying a novel ML framework to multiple dimensions of data (demographics, genetic risk
scores, neuropsychological measures, structural MRI, and amyloid imaging). Our ultimate goal is
to arrive at a new “Machine Learning predictive framework for aging and AD” (ML4AD), comprised
of dimensions each of which each will add incremental value to the predictive models, hence
increasing the performance of predictive models while keeping the costs and burden of research
at a minimum. The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award
(K23), Dr. Ali Ezzati, is a Neurologist whose career goal is to develop predictive tools to help
research and clinical decision making in cognitive aging and dementia. The proposed research
will leverage the rich clinical and biomarker dataset available from several ongoing international
studies, but will also provide a unique avenue of investigation for the candidate. The candidate's
career development will benefit from close mentorship and scientific guidance of outstanding
investigators in aging/AD neurobiology (Dr. Lipton), machine learning and computational
neuroscience (Dr. Davatzikos), and biostatistics (Dr. Hall). The findings from this study will inform
future secondary prevention trials, in which sensitive indicators of early AD will be necessary to
identify high-risk subjects and track early clinical decline. This work will serve as the foundation
to move forward in independent research focusing on development of predictive tools in AD and
related neurodegenerative disorders.

10885706,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy for women; standard of care surgery and
chemotherapy treatment can provide a short period of remission but cannot eradicate the disease and
prevent recurrence. Cancer immunotherapy has shown great potential in treating cancers, but no clinical
success has been reported for ovarian cancer. One major hurdle for cancer immunotherapy that is needed
to overcome is to convert the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). The goal of this proposal
is to develop effective nanomedicines that are capable of reprogramming and converting the suppressive
TME for ovarian cancer treatment. To achieve this goal, I will utilize viral nanoparticles (VNPs) to incorporate
various functionalities targeting different aspects of the TME through bioengineering approaches. The two
VNPs that will be used in this proposal are cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) and hepatitis B virus capsid (HBVc),
which both have well-characterized and stable structures for in vitro bioengineering. Toll-like receptor (TLR)
agonists have been demonstrated to be potent to activate the innate immune system and modulate the TME.
CPMV is a triple TLR 2, 4, and 7 agonist and is effective to reprogram the TME of ovarian cancer. In the
mentored K99 phase, I will focus on using CPMV as a triple TLR agonist to develop an adjuvant and antigen
combination in-situ vaccine for ovarian cancer treatment (Aim 1) and developing multi-TLR agonists to
investigate the mechanism of action (MOA) of CPMV and multi-TLRs activation in cancer treatment to design
potent TLR agonists combination for downstream applications (Aim 2). During my independent R00 phase,
I will use HBVc as a nanotechnology platform to develop multiple functional therapeutic nanomaterials
aiming to reprogram the suppressive TME to treat ovarian cancer and investigate the MOA. First, I will
develop HBVc-based TLR agonist and pro-inflammatory cytokine combination therapies, which can exert
the functions of reprograming the TME and killing cancer cells concurrently (Aim 3). Secondly, I will develop
HBVc into a “smart” nanoparticle that functions as a TLR agonist and targets and converts the pro-tumor M2
macrophages into anti-tumor M1 macrophages (Aim 4). During my graduate study, I have been trained in
manipulating HBVc in vitro assembly and genetic engineering of HBVc to design novel structures. In the
past two and a half years as a postdoc in Dr. Steinmetz’s lab at UCSD, I have been trained systematically
in the bioengineering of VNPs and the application of engineered VNPs for cancer treatment. A further two
years of training in Dr. Steinmetz’s lab will allow me to enrich my background in cancer immunology,
immune-oncology, and tumor modeling. With the help and guidance from my advisory committee, by the
end of my mentored phase, I will be able to secure a tenure-track faculty position in a top-tier research
institute to establish my independent research program focusing on using HBVc as a nanotechnology
platform to develop novel and effective multi-functional nanomedicines for cancer patients."

Among women, incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) increases in midlife, when hormonal changes
promote visceral fat accumulation and higher circulating inflammatory markers. Lifestyle behaviors are well-
established risk factors for cardiometabolic disease, but less is known about the potential for short-term
changes in health behaviors to reduce inflammation and MetS during peri-/menopause, when women are more
likely to seek health care. Phthalates and phenols, 2 classes of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found
in foods, plastics and personal care products, have been linked to higher MetS among women primarily in
cross-sectional studies. Inflammation is one plausible pathway connecting these EDC exposures to the
development and progression of MetS in midlife but literature on toxicants infrequently accounts for health
behaviors as confounders or effect modifiers. Thus, evaluating the interaction between toxicants and other
lifestyle factors--including diet, sleep, and physical activity--is a critical gap in understanding the role of EDC
exposures on changes in inflammation and MetS development among women in mid-life. Epigenetic
alterations may also serve as biomarkers of EDC-metabolic relationships, since these EDCs have the potential
to affect the epigenome; i.e. heritable alterations to gene expression that do not alter the DNA sequence itself.
The influence of gestational exposures on the offspring epigenome is well-known, but other life course periods
potentially vulnerable to effects of toxicants through epigenetic mechanisms—including aging--are less studied.
The Early Life Exposures in Mexico to Environmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) cohort is uniquely positioned to
address these research gaps, given length of follow up and repeated measures of toxicants and diet, sleep and
physical activity. Among 600 women followed since pregnancy who now span peri-/menopausal ages, we will
leverage archived data and biospecimens from adulthood in 2008, and newly collected data from 2 mid-life
visits over 3 years (2019-20, 2022-24). Specific Aims are to: 1) Ascertain the role of exposure to phenols and
phthalates in adulthood on the development and progression of MetS in mid-life; 2) Investigate the
inflammatory mechanisms that underlie associations between exposure to phenols and phthalates and
changes in metabolic outcomes over 2 mid-life visits; 3) Uncover other biological pathways that link phenol and
phthalate exposures prospectively to MetS and progression in midlife using an epigenetics approach. MetS
prevalence is increasing dramatically worldwide--understanding the impact of EDCs that women are exposed
to daily on midlife cardiometabolic risk and the exact nature of these pathways will provide critical new
knowledge to aid in prevention and management of MetS in women as they age."

 Our long term goal is to reduce postoperative infections. We will start by developing a system to accurately
and completely identify their occurrence by applying machine learning algorithms to electronic health record
(EHR) data. We will utilize a comprehensive audit and feedback system to create reports of risk-adjusted rates
and specific details of postoperative infectious complications that are shared with surgeons and other
healthcare providers to facilitate their awareness. We call this system the Automated Surveillance of
Postoperative Infections (ASPIN). ASPIN will be piloted in the four major hospitals of the University of
Colorado Health system (UCHealth) with a combined surgical volume of approximately 80,000 patients per
year. We expect this will supersede the costly and laborious manual partial sampling of postoperative
infectious complications which is current utilized by many hospitals.
Specific Aim 1. Expand and enhance models for preoperative risk prediction and postoperative identification
of surgical infections using EHR and ACS NSQIP data from patients who underwent operations at four
UCHealth hospitals.
 Specific Aim 1a) Enhance previously-developed models for identification of postoperative infections by
controlling Type-I errors via “knockoffs,” a recent statistical innovation for high dimensional model selection
using false discovery rate correction.
Specific Aim 1b) Deploy natural language processing methods using EHR text reports of these patients to
identify additional indicators of postoperative infections and further refine the models.
Specific Aim 1c) Create preoperative risk models for infection using EHR data - similar to the models
 implemented in the AHRQ-funded Surgical Risk Preoperative Assessment System - but that do not require
 additional data entry by the health care providers.
Specific Aim 2. From the beginning of the study, develop ASPIN with input from an Advisory Committee
composed of administrators and surgeons from all four UCHealth hospitals. Additional feedback from surgeons
will be obtained through focus groups and semi-structured interviews at several steps of ASPIN development
and implementation planning.
Specific Aim 3. A pilot implementation of ASPIN will utilize the RE-AIM framework to guide and examine the
preliminary effectiveness and feasibility of ASPIN at UCHealth. We will recruit 30 surgeon participants from all
four UCHealth hospitals to use ASPIN, and we will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, and
implementation of ASPIN.
 This research responds to AHRQ priorities by utilizing existing data to develop a learning health system
with a distinct focus on improving surveillance and reporting of postoperative healthcare-associated infections."

The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is mutated in over half of all human cancers, but the mechanisms through
which p53 suppresses cancer in vivo remain incompletely understood. Notably, there are no standard-of-care
cancer therapies based on the p53 pathway. In this proposal, we strive to deconstruct the pathways through
which p53 suppresses cancer to illuminate pathways dysregulated upon p53 loss that could ultimately be
targeted therapeutically. Our previous work using transcriptional activation domain mutant mice suggested that
the transcriptional programs underlying p53 acute DNA damage responses are not essential for tumor
suppression, prompting us to search for new mechanisms of p53-mediated tumor suppression. We thus
performed unbiased in vivo shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 screens for p53 target genes important for tumor
suppression. We identified several p53 target genes with tumor suppressor activity, including Zmat3 – the top
hit in both screens. We found that Zmat3 expression is highly p53-dependent across contexts and that Zmat3
suppresses lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in autochthonous mouse
models. Zmat3 encodes a zinc finger RNA-binding protein that we found acts by modulating alternative
splicing, revealing a new branch of p53-mediated tumor suppression. As recent work has revealed a critical
role for alternative splicing in cancer, we hypothesize that studying p53 pathways at the post-transcriptional
level, such as through splicing and proteomics analyses, will yield novel insights into p53-mediated tumor
suppression. In Theme 1, we propose to identify p53-dependent splicing and proteome changes, including
both Zmat3-dependent and Zmat3-independent ones, that could explain tumor suppression in mouse LUAD
and HCC. We will also identify genes that cooperate with Zmat3 to suppress cancer downstream of p53. We
will test the importance of genes found in these analyses for LUAD and HCC suppression using a quantitative
in vivo tumor assay known as Tuba-seq. In Theme 2, we will pursue our observation that p53 repurposes a
role in lung regeneration, in which it drives alveolar type 1 cell differentiation upon lung injury, to suppress
LUAD. Through single cell (sc)RNA-seq and scATAC-seq analyses, we will ask how p53 status dictates the
evolutionary path of KrasG12D-expressing alveolar type 2 cells and how p53 transcriptional programs change
with cell state across LUAD evolution in mouse models. We will also ask how cells in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) affect cancer cell trajectories in wild-type and p53-deficient tumors. To define genes
functionally important for cancer cell state transitions and crosstalk between cancer cells and TME
components, we will employ scPerturb-seq. Studies of LUAD evolution, in which we express KrasG12D and
analyze subsequent events at both the cancer cell and TME levels through a detailed kinetic analysis, will
deconstruct p53-mediated tumor suppression in vivo at an unprecedented molecular depth. Collectively, these
studies will provide crucial new insight into how to modulate p53 pathways in therapeutic strategies for cancer."

cancer therapies based on the p53 pathway. In this proposal, we strive to deconstruct the pathways through
which p53 suppresses cancer to illuminate pathways dysregulated upon p53 loss that could ultimately be
targeted therapeutically. Our previous work using transcriptional activation domain mutant mice suggested that
the transcriptional programs underlying p53 acute DNA damage responses are not essential for tumor
suppression, prompting us to search for new mechanisms of p53-mediated tumor suppression. We thus
performed unbiased in vivo shRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 screens for p53 target genes important for tumor
suppression. We identified several p53 target genes with tumor suppressor activity, including Zmat3 – the top
hit in both screens. We found that Zmat3 expression is highly p53-dependent across contexts and that Zmat3
suppresses lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in autochthonous mouse
models. Zmat3 encodes a zinc finger RNA-binding protein that we found acts by modulating alternative
splicing, revealing a new branch of p53-mediated tumor suppression. As recent work has revealed a critical
role for alternative splicing in cancer, we hypothesize that studying p53 pathways at the post-transcriptional
level, such as through splicing and proteomics analyses, will yield novel insights into p53-mediated tumor
suppression. In Theme 1, we propose to identify p53-dependent splicing and proteome changes, including
both Zmat3-dependent and Zmat3-independent ones, that could explain tumor suppression in mouse LUAD
and HCC. We will also identify genes that cooperate with Zmat3 to suppress cancer downstream of p53. We
will test the importance of genes found in these analyses for LUAD and HCC suppression using a quantitative
in vivo tumor assay known as Tuba-seq. In Theme 2, we will pursue our observation that p53 repurposes a
role in lung regeneration, in which it drives alveolar type 1 cell differentiation upon lung injury, to suppress
LUAD. Through single cell (sc)RNA-seq and scATAC-seq analyses, we will ask how p53 status dictates the
evolutionary path of KrasG12D-expressing alveolar type 2 cells and how p53 transcriptional programs change
with cell state across LUAD evolution in mouse models. We will also ask how cells in the tumor
microenvironment (TME) affect cancer cell trajectories in wild-type and p53-deficient tumors. To define genes
functionally important for cancer cell state transitions and crosstalk between cancer cells and TME
components, we will employ scPerturb-seq. Studies of LUAD evolution, in which we express KrasG12D and
analyze subsequent events at both the cancer cell and TME levels through a detailed kinetic analysis, will
deconstruct p53-mediated tumor suppression in vivo at an unprecedented molecular depth. Collectively, these
studies will provide crucial new insight into how to modulate p53 pathways in therapeutic strategies for cancer."

Exposure to stressful life events (SLEs) is involved in the etiology of most forms of psychopathology, and SLEs
occurring early in development are particularly strong predictors of mental health problems. Most adolescent
disorder onsets are temporally preceded by a major SLE. Yet, the mechanisms linking SLEs to the onset of
adolescent psychopathology remain poorly understood. Prior research on mechanisms linking SLEs with youth
mental disorders has focused largely on severe forms of adversity like abuse, neglect, and institutionalization.
It is unknown whether similar mechanisms are involved in the link between less severe SLEs and
psychopathology. Perhaps more critically, existing work has relied largely on cross-sectional between-subjects
designs that compare children with exposure to some type of SLE to children without that experience. There is
a dearth of longitudinal studies examining how SLEs influence emotion, cognition, behavior, and neural circuits
within-individuals over time in ways that predict the emergence of psychopathology. The proposed research
addresses this gap, using a novel methodological approach that permits examination of dynamic changes in
emotion, cognition, social behavior, and neural function and connectivity following SLEs at a sufficiently fine
grained level of temporal specificity to identify mechanisms underlying the link between SLEs and adolescent
psychopathology as they unfold in real time. Specifically, the project will examine how monthly fluctuations in
exposure to SLEs within-individuals predict subsequent changes in emotional processing in the Negative and
Positive Valence Systems, Cognitive Control, Social Processes, and neural function and connectivity over a
12-month period. In addition to monthly assessments of SLEs, psychopathology, and potential mechanisms,
passive monitoring of activity, sleep, and social behavior (e.g., interaction with peers through text and social
media) through smartphones and wearable devices will allow additional mechanisms to be assessed passively
and without subject burden. The study will investigate whether monthly variation in these emotional, cognitive,
social, and neural processes predicts later increases in internalizing and externalizing problems in an
accelerated cohort design with monthly assessments spanning age 11-18 years, producing 1,680 monthly
observations over the study period. The longitudinal design and high-frequency assessments are innovative
in allowing the identification of mechanisms that are altered by SLEs and prospectively predict
psychopathology with high temporal specificity during a developmental period associated with increases in
SLE exposure, stress vulnerability, and risk for psychopathology. Study findings will provide critical information
regarding the specific domains of emotion, cognition, social behavior, and neural function that are altered by
exposure to SLEs and increase vulnerability to psychopathology. These mechanisms represent modifiable
targets for interventions to prevent the onset of stress-related psychopathology in children and adolescents."

There is increasing evidence that early intervention for psychosis in coordinated specialty care (CSC) services
improves outcomes and lives. The outcome of early course psychosis (EP) is heterogeneous, ranging from early
full recovery to treatment resistance and functional decline from the onset of illness. This heterogeneity limits
our ability to predict individual level outcomes needed for treatment planning and for tailoring the type, duration
and intensity of therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers as well as clinical and demographic features, early in the
illness can predict outcome, but taken individually, their prognostic value is limited. Our Bipolar- Schizophrenia
Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP) consortium has recently developed, replicated and validated a
biomarker (EEG, eye movement testing, and neurocognition) based categorization (Biotypes 1, 2 and 3) in a
trans-diagnostic sample of cases with idiopathic psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar
disorder with psychosis), ranging from 18-35 years of age. In this study, we will leverage this categorization,
along with clinical and biomarker data to predict illness trajectory and outcome during follow-up at 1, 6 and 12
months in 320 EP patients across CSC clinics at the five B-SNIP sites. First, we will characterize outcome
trajectories and Biotype structure in EP. Our available data indicate the Biotype structure will be the same in EP

To date more than 200 genetic variants are known to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
The majority of these have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The individual
Genetic Research Centers (GRCs) and the collective NIDDK IBD Genetics Consortium have successfully
interacted for the last fifteen years to lead many of these discoveries. However, despite significant progress it
is still unknown how the majority of these variants or other risk factors lead to development of IBD and its two
major subtypes - Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Answering these questions is critical to
advancing our knowledge of IBD pathophysiology.
Since 2002, Dr. Silverberg has established a very large, comprehensive registry of well characterized,
longitudinally followed IBD patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in addition to accompanying biospecimens stored
at his laboratory at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute to facilitate research in IBD. Utilizing these
resources and applying new expertise in cellular, genomic and immune profiling, it is anticipated that the
proposed studies will help to make significant progress in the unmet needs described above. The IBDGC
working together with the UTGRC will study comprehensively the genetic architecture of non-European
ancestry IBD populations and utilize the power of its infrastructure to better elucidate the pathophysiology of
acute severe ulcerative colitis and perianal Crohn’s disease. The UTGRC, specifically, will advance the
understanding of UC pathophysiology by integrating imaging mass cytometry, spatial transcriptomics and
scRNA-seq, in conjunction with tissue-associated microbiome analysis, to develop a comprehensive
understanding of the immune, genomic, cellular and microbial factors that contribute to persistent histologic
inflammation and mechanisms of clinical relapse in UC. Utilizing the power of these technologies, also
provides a unique opportunity to go “back in time” to study critical events that lead to the development of
colorectal cancer in UC – a poorly understood complication with significant mortality. By applying similar
techniques in a retrospective cohort, the cellular and immune factors that lead to treatment refractory CD.
Despite the progress in advanced biologic therapy, there are still a significant portion of patients who fail
multiple therapies and have persistent inflammation. Taken together, through the studies proposed, it is
anticipated that significant advances will be made toward better understanding the functional biology of IBD
genetic variation and to enable the translation of these data to clinically meaningful tools that will lead improved
outcomes for individuals affected by IBD."

 During the past four years, we have witnessed global challenges of historic proportion. In Montana,
COVID-19 and extreme weather events (including fire and flooding) have irreversibly changed communities
and exposed the fragile status of health and well-being for people already experiencing health disparities. The
MT INBRE network is culturally and economically diverse. Our experience shows that bringing together
engaged community members, researchers from local institutions, and experienced biomedical researchers
can facilitate research that improves health and well-being. The MT INBRE program is particularly important for
Montana because the state does not have a medical school. This program serves as a major driver of health
improvement through research-based interventions.
 We believe that Montana communities should drive research questions and contribute to finding solutions
to mitigate the health disparities they experience. Therefore, MT INBRE V will use its well-established network
to further strengthen collaborations among rural and Native communities with tribal colleges, primarily
undergraduate institutions, and research universities. We believe tribal colleges should be conduits for
research on the reservations and primarily undergraduate institutions conduits for rural health research. MT
INBRE V will bring together strengths in bench research, community based participatory research (CBPR), and
healthcare workforce development as a unified front taking aim at health issues critical to Montana and the
Western IDeA states. Our experience shows that building partnerships on a foundation of diverse perspectives
and personal investment leads to measurable outcomes.
 MT INBRE V is focused on two main goals: 1) diversify the biomedical/health sciences research network
and student pipeline in Montana, and 2) improve the health of rural, urban and Native Montanans through
sustainable research. MT INBRE V will realize these goals and research targets through a detailed plan for
enhancing diverse perspectives and four specific aims: Specific Aim 1. Build a diverse, equitable, and inclusive
foundation for biomedical research and data science in Montana; Specific Aim 2. Build the state’s research
base and capacity by providing support to faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students at participating
institutions; Specific Aim 3. Engage students from primarily undergraduate institutions, community colleges,
and tribal colleges in research; and Specific Aim 4. Reduce redundancy, increase interdisciplinary research
collaborations among faculty, and broaden research and education opportunities for students in Western IDeA
states through the Regional Alliance of INBRE Networks (RAIN)."

There remain clear clinical and public health needs to improve the early detection of breast cancer. While
mammography is an effective tool, there are issues with respect to optimizing its use and performance, and
despite widespread screening breast cancer remains the 2nd most common cause of cancer related death
among U.S. women. Through the current EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC) led by Dr. Li we have
validated 15 candidate biomarkers through a series of Phase 2 and Phase 3 validation studies that involved
successive series of three independent sets of preclinical samples. Outside of EDRN funding, Dr. Partridge
has led the development of novel strategies to improve breast cancer detection based on quantitative markers
derived from screening MRIs in high-risk women and application of artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in
collaboration with Microsoft. Our overarching goal is to conduct Phase 2 and 3 validation studies of blood-
based biomarkers and imaging strategies that will be integrated and jointly assessed in a Phase 4 validation
study. Supporting this goal we propose the following 4 projects: Project 1: Phase 3 validation of early detection
biomarkers for ER+ breast cancer; Project 2: Phase 2 and 3 validation of protein biomarkers for the early
detection of breast cancer discovered using a mass spectrometry-based platform; Project 3: Phase 3 validation
of quantitative markers and AI algorithms applied to MRI screening exams for the early detection of breast
cancer in women at high risk; and Project 4: Phase 4 validation of blood-based biomarkers and imaging
algorithms for the early detection of breast cancer. Additionally, we will provide biospecimens and expertise to
support high quality PRoBE compliant EDRN discovery and validation studies across several cancer types.
With the combined expertise of our multidisciplinary team of investigators and our engagement with key
commercial partners, this CVC will both lead well-justified, rigorously designed validation studies and provide
abundant resources to EDRN. Given the strength of our biomarker candidates, the sets of biospecimens that
will be used, the study designs employed, and the clearly delineated clinical applications proposed, we
anticipate that this work will yield near-term clinical impact."

Significance: Tenofovir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir (TLD) has become the predominant first-line
antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). While virologic failure on TLD is relatively
rare currently, rates will inevitably increase over time, threatening epidemic control in the region. The optimal
management of virologic failure on TLD is currently unknown, and policies vary widely in SSA. Innovation: We
propose the first randomized clinical trial to determine the optimal management strategy for virologic failure on
TLD in SSA. The trial will evaluate a novel individualized care strategy, which seeks to address diverse patient-
level determinants of virologic failure, including adherence challenges, pill burden, patient preference, regimen
tolerability, and drug resistance. The individualized care strategy incorporates a point-of-care urine tenofovir
assay, as well as genotypic resistance tests, with a goal of salvaging once-daily regimens among individuals
with virologic failure on TLD. Investigators: Our expert team of clinical epidemiologists (Suzanne McCluskey),
implementation scientists and clinical trialists (Mark Siedner, Monica Gandhi), global partners (Winnie
Muyindike, Richard Lessells, Mahomed Yunus Moosa), biostatisticians (Susanne Hoeppner), and decision
scientists (Emily Hyle), led by an early-stage investigator (McCluskey), is uniquely positioned to provide policy-
guiding data in response to this question of great public health significance. Approach: We will leverage an
established pragmatic clinical trial infrastructure which recently completed an NIH R01-funded randomized trial
in Mbarara, Uganda and Durban, South Africa to complete the following Specific Aims: Aim 1) We will
conduct the RESOLVE trial, an open, parallel arm, randomized clinical trial in six public sector clinics to
determine the optimal strategy for management of virologic failure on first-line TLD in SSA. We will randomize
participants to one of the following strategies: a) Maintenance on TLD with switch to protease inhibitor (PI)-
based second-line ART if virologic failure persists past six months, similar to current guidelines in South Africa;
b) Individualized Care, with regimen choice based on results of genotypic resistance tests and urine tenofovir
assays; or c) Immediate Switch to PI-based second-line ART, similar to current guidelines in Uganda. The
primary outcome will be viral suppression (<50 copies/mL) at 48-weeks post-enrollment. Aim 2) We will
populate the Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications-International model with the clinical trial
data from Aim 1 to project long-term clinical outcomes and cumulative lifetime costs. We will use simulation
modeling to examine the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of strategies to improve viral
suppression after virologic failure on TLD. Impact: We will respond to this priority research gap with data to
guide global HIV policy by determining the most clinically effective and cost-effective strategy for management
of virologic failure on TLD. In doing so, this proposal directly responds to NIH HIV research priorities to improve
viral suppression and to ensure that optimal treatment responses are achieved."

data processing pipelines that are cloud-native and FAIR. Starting with an already established portfolio of
BICCN pipelines and community relationships developed in previous funding, this portfolio will be updated and
extended in collaboration with the BICAN community. Leveraging and improving existing integration between
the BICCN molecular (NeMO) archive and cloud-computing environment (Terra), this team will process data
sets, prioritized by the BICAN community and in support of joint analysis for atlas building. These pipelines will
produce data with a comprehensive panel of metrics that our team will leverage to perform quality control and
assure rigor in data processing and use. This team will work with analysis groups to confirm outputs of the
pipelines are compatible with downstream analysis and are extended to incorporate critical downstream steps
as they mature and are agreed upon by the BICAN community. The cloud computing environment used by this
team will be open and available to the BICAN community and supported by a helpdesk, documentation,
forums, and an annual workshop. As this infrastructure spans institutes, Terra is currently enabling BICCN
working groups to share cloud resources and jointly analyze data in a common scalable space; this will
continue to be true in the BICAN community. To enable visualizing, sharing and publishing of data, this team
brings cloud programming environments (Terra), specialized scalable resources (Cirrocumulus, Pegasus), and

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong disorder that has consequences throughout adulthood. Recent
population health studies indicate that aging autistic adults have shorter life expectancy and increased rates of
physical and mental health problems. However, there is a paucity of studies that have focused on the progression
of health and wellness with aging in ASD and factors that can contribute to better or worse outcomes. In this
Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Network project, the Interdisciplinary Science to Learn about Autism – Aging
(ISLA-A) Network will deploy a harmonized, optimized, and innovative protocol to investigate the effects of aging
in autism in one of the largest prospective longitudinal cohort studies of autistic adults to date. The aims of the
ISLA-A center are 1) to establish and follow a large cohort of autistic male and female adults, siblings and age-
and sex- matched non-autistic adults with a comprehensive harmonized research protocol to investigate multi-
modal aspects of aging, including measures of clinical severity, physical and mental health, cognitive aging,
brain structure and function, and epigenetic measures of biological aging; 2) to characterize both group and
individual age-related changes in autism severity, health, wellness and brain measures with aging; 3) to
investigate the relationships between clinical, health, and brain imaging measures; and 4) to investigate whether
biological aging is accelerated in autism using new epigenetic measures of aging. The overarching goal of the
ISLA-A Network is to create a comprehensive, harmonized, and high-dimensional dataset that will characterize
trajectories of aging in autism that may be used to investigate whether early or accelerated aging is a hallmark
feature of autism, and how aging in autism influences health and brain outcomes. The inclusion of siblings, who
share genetics with the autistic adult cohort, will help to identify autism-specific factors related to aging and
outcomes. The ISLA-A study results will identify candidate factors that are predictive to autism aging outcomes
and will guide the development of interventions and services to improve outcomes. This new large, multi-modal,
longitudinal, and generalizable dataset will be shared with the autism research community for independent
studies. Overall, the ISLA-A Network study will generate a rich, high-impact resource for better understanding of
aging in autism, with the ultimate goal of improving the health and support of autistic adults."

 Depression is a debilitating psychiatric illness that commonly emerges during adolescence, a period of
dynamic brain and behavioral development. Cognitive and motivational deficits are prominent in depression
and occur in neural systems that undergo adolescent-specific developmental changes. Given the emergence
of these deficits in the context of ongoing development, a better understanding of how cognition and motivation
interact in adolescent depression is critical for designing prevention strategies and treatments.
 I am proposing complementary studies designed to examine cognitive-motivational interactions in
adolescent depression, and provide me the training I need to become an independent investigator focused on
the neurobiology of cognition and emotion in developmental psychopathology. With my primary mentor, Dr.
Anticevic, I have designed an incentivized spatial working memory paradigm for neuroimaging that has been
translated from classic tasks in non-human primates, and adapted to measure the effects of incentives on
spatial working memory accuracy. We propose to use this task in adolescents with depression and
neurotypical peers in order to examine differences in spatial working memory and incentivized spatial working
memory performances, and the neural circuits underlying each. All participants will be followed longitudinally to
compare the impact of depression and typical development in these circuits. They will return at 9 months after
the first visit to chart symptoms and behavior, and at 18 months to chart symptoms, behavior, and repeat the
incentivized spatial working memory neuroimaging paradigm. To complement our cross-sectional study of
adolescent depression, we propose to characterize the variation in cognition and motivation in a large group of
typically developing children from the multi-site Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. We
will apply data-driven methods to cognitive and motivational measures collected by the ABCD study and
quantify the shared neurobehavioral variation that may distinguish cognitive-motivational phenotypes. This
characterization would serve as a vital platform for future studies to examine risk for depression in
adolescence.
 The proposed set of studies provides training in developmental research and neuroimaging,
longitudinal study design and analysis, and data-driven analytics applied to neurodevelopmental questions. My
mentors are a multi-disciplinary team of experts based mostly at Yale who will guide and support me in
achieving these training goals. Collectively, this K23 application provides the vital additional training and
experiences I need to successfully transition to an independent physician-scientist focused on the neurobiology
of cognition and emotion in developmental psychopathology."

Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death by infectious disease worldwide. Current therapy requires at least six
months of treatment and there is no effective vaccine that prevents pulmonary disease. There is a critical need to
develop new therapies that will shorten treatment time and activate protective responses to prevent TB progression.
Unfortunately, we continue to lack a fundamental understanding of the host immune pathways that protect against
TB. While the cytokine interferon γ (IFNγ) is absolutely required, the precise mechanisms that drive IFNγ-mediated
protection remain unclear. This is because IFNγ is a pleotropic mediator that controls both bacterial growth and the
inflammatory response in the lungs, while bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses. To dissect the
complex regulation of IFNγ responses, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR Cas9 screens in macrophages to
define the networks required for the IFNγ-mediated surface expression of MHCII. This screen uncovered an important
role for the glycerol 3 kinase beta (GSK3b) in controlling IFNγ-dependent MHCII expression. Using chemical and
genetic approaches coupled with transcriptome analysis we found that GSK3b and the paralog GSK3a contribute to
the expression of a subset of IFNγ-inducible genes. Further mechanistic studies found that the loss of
GSK3a/b blocks the ability of macrophages to serve as antigen presenting cells to CD4+ T cells ex vivo and results
in dysregulated cytokine production by macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection. Thus, GSK3a/b balances the
cellular response to IFNγ to protect against infection without driving inflammatory tissue damage. These data lead to
the hypothesis that GSK3a/b is a critical mediator of the IFNγ response during TB in vivo. This proposal will use
genetic approaches combined with in vivo models to dissect the role of GSK3a/b-mediated control of IFNγ responses
and TB. Aim 1 will understand the mechanisms that regulate GSK3a/b control of IFNγ responses and determine how
M. tuberculosis modulates GSK3a/b activity. In Aim 2, we will use unique models of bacterial control and inflammation
to examine how the loss of myeloid-specific GSK3a and/or GSK3b disrupts the IFNγ-mediated control of M.
tuberculosis growth and tissue damage. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use M. tuberculosis specific TCR-transgenic T cell
mice to test the hypothesis that the loss of myeloid GSK3a and/or GSK3b results in reduced T cell responses and
ineffective protection against TB. Together these aims will dissect the role of GSK3a/b in controlling IFNγ-responses
and protecting against TB. These mechanisms can then be leveraged to develop new therapies that may shorten
treatment times and prevent TB disease progression."

Cancer cells must activate a telomere elongation mechanism and acquire genomic alterations to survive. Many
of the most lethal cancers rely on the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) telomere elongation pathway.
ALT is strongly associated with recurrent mutations in genes encoding chromatin modifiers such as the ATRX-
DAXX chromatin remodeling/histone deposition complex. These disrupt the assembly of telomeric chromatin,
provoking replicative stress and double-strand breaks (DSBs) that stimulate specialized homology-directed DNA
repair (HDR) mechanisms to repair and extend telomeres. Thus, the ALT pathway represents a valuable target
for cancer therapy development. Despite significant advances in understanding these unique ALT-associated
HDR (ALT-HDR) mechanisms, the ALT pathway remains unexploited for cancer therapy development.
 The mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) of chromatin has recently emerged as a key sensor and
initiator of the DNA damage response. MARylation predominantly occurs on serine residues and relies on HPF1,
which interacts with PARP1. MARylation of specific serines on histones seeds further PARylation that
destabilizes nucleosomes proximal to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and licenses the recruitment of the first
wave of DNA repair complexes. ARH3 is the only known enzyme capable of removing MAR synthesized by the
HPF1-PARP1 complex. Despite biochemical evidence supporting its fundamental role in genome maintenance,
the identity of additional cellular targets of serine MARylation, and effects of its deregulation, remain obscure. In
Aim 1 we will assess the impact of ARH3 and HPF1 disruption on ALT-HDR mechanisms and survival of ALT
cancer cells. In Aim 2, we will employ novel approach to track histones as they are being deposited at telomeres
and evaluate the impact that this has on transcription of TERRA and the recruitment of major mediators of ALT.
We will also employ innovative proteomics to identify telomeric targets of MARylation. The successful completion
of these aims will contribute to the understanding of this important chromatin mark during ALT-HDR and its
impact on cancer cell survival."
10875669,"In adult brains, neural progenitor/stem cells (NSCs) are responsible for the generation of new neurons
for the maintenance of the existing circuitry and after injuries. Deficiency in NSC maintenance and/or
neurogenesis contributes to both developmental defects and neurodegenerative diseases
for which aging is a major risk factor.
 The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to determine the molecular and cellular
mechanisms of NSC regulation in both young and aged animals, which can lead to the development of
effective therapies for neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is a highly conserved cellular process for
degradation of bulk cytoplasmic materials for maintenance of cellular homeostasis, and dysfunctions in
autophagy have been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegeneration and other age-related
disorders. FIP200 (FAK-family Interacting Protein of 200 kDa) was initially identified in our laboratory and
subsequently shown as one component of the ULK1/Atg13/FIP200 complex essential for the induction of
autophagy. In the previous funding period, we found that, deletion of Fip200, but not other autophagy genes
Atg5, Atg7 and Atg16L1, led to defective NSC maintenance and neurogenesis, suggesting a potential role for
the non-canonical function of FIP200 in NSC regulation through controlling p62 aggregate formation. In
additional prelim studies, we obtained rigorous genetic evidence that non-canonical function of FIP200 is
required for NSC maintenance and neurogenesis by generation and analyses of another unique mouse model
with FIP200-4A mutation in NSCs that blocks autophagy function of FIP200 specifically. Additionally, we found
that the FIP200 C-terminal region (FIP200-CT) could interact with p62, consistent with recent studies showing
its importance in degrading p62 aggregates. Moreover, we found that FIP200 can regulate TBK1 activation,
which can phosphorylate p62 to regulate its degradation, and that FIP200 also interacts with the TBK1 adaptor,
AZI2. In a second set of prelim studies, we analyzed the role of another autophagy gene Beclin1 in NSCs
employing new Becn1 KI mice and found that increased autophagy protected NSC pool and their neurogenesis
in aged Becn1 KI mice without affecting NSC in young mice. Lastly, we obtained additional prelim data
suggesting that oxidative stress may synergize with autophagy-deficiency to promote p62 aggregate formation.
Building upon these preliminary and prior studies, we propose to 1). investigate the mechanisms of non-canonical functions of FIP200 and potential synergy with its autophagy function in the regulation of NSCs, 2).
analyze the role and mechanisms of enhanced autophagy to prevent NSC pool decline and promote
neurogenesis in Becn1 KI mice, and 3). explore the role and mechanisms of NSC maintenance and
neurogenesis in autophagy-deficiency mice after oxidative insult and during aging. Together, these studies will
significantly advance our understanding of the regulation of NSC and neurogenesis by autophagy genes that
may contribute to future design of effective therapies for neurodegenerative and other related diseases."
10875672,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The fragile population of children with medical complexity (children with congenital or acquired multisystem
disease, neurologic impairment and/or dependence on medical technology) accounts for up to one third of all
pediatric medical expenditure. Systematic investigation of the contribution of nutrition to chronic disease burden
in this population has not been done and is urgently needed, as it has vast potential to optimize clinical outcomes
such as feeding intolerance, improve quality of life and reduce healthcare cost. Dr. Bridget Hron is a pediatric
gastroenterologist and nutrition specialist with advanced training in the nutritional regulation of metabolism and
inflammation who is perfectly suited to address this critical unmet need. Her career goal is to direct a clinical
research program focused on discovering evidenced-based, state of the art nutritional interventions that
transform the clinical care of the most vulnerable pediatric population.
In Dr. Hron's recent work, she has shown that blenderized diets, which are pureed high quality table foods such
as fruits, vegetables, meat and legumes administered via gastrostomy tube have a beneficial effect on health
care utilization, reducing admissions for pulmonary reasons by 53%. Over the course of this career development
award, Dr. Hron will study the effect of blenderized feeds varying in viscosity on gastrointestinal symptoms and
on esophageal and gastric function. The innovative aggregate randomized, controlled N-of-1 study design
outlined in this proposal allows each individual participant to determine diet of maximal efficacy, but also allows
for estimation of population effect of the interventions.
The exceptional mentorship and original scientific training proposed in this career development award are critical
for Dr. Hron's academic development. Dr. Rachel Rosen, primary mentor, is an expert in aerodigestive medicine,
and Dr. Christopher Schmid, co-mentor, is an expert in biostatistics with a focus on N-of-1 trials – both have
outstanding backgrounds in clinical research with deep commitment to mentorship. She will be supported by her
Scholarship Advisory Committee consisting of Drs. Wayne Lencer, Christopher Duggan, Jay Berry and Sharon
Donovan, who lend content-area expertise. Her formal training will include a Master of Science: Concentration
in Food Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advanced courses in statistical analysis at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH), personal instruction on mediators of esophageal and gastric
motility by Dr. Rosen, and professional development courses through HSPH and Harvard Catalyst. Her training
and research activities will be conducted in the unparalleled academic environments of Boston Children's
Hospital and Harvard Medical School, which are firmly committed to Dr. Hron's successful transition to an
independent research career."
10876324,"Cell-surface receptors and intracellular regulatory proteins are preeminent mediators of cellular
signaling as these proteins are involved in a host of interactions and pathways. Therefore,
various stages of their signaling cycles provide unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention.
This project presents computational studies integrated with experimental data to resolve the
mechanisms of recognition of novel peptide mimetics and analogues targeting extracellular
domains of receptor proteins of the insulin family and small-molecules targeting intracellular
protein-protein interactions in regulatory proteins of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR)
family. The proposed studies are timely in that several recent structural studies have revealed
the binding modes of the native hormone insulin and homologous growth factor peptides and we
have developed dynamics-based computational approaches that have opened the avenues for
designing novel peptide-based agonists and antagonists. Toward this direction are our
proposed studies of three classes of peptides: (1) synthetic insulin mimetics, (2) viral-insulin-like
peptides (VILPs), and insulin-like peptides from cone snail venom. Our second research
direction aims to develop small-molecule inhibitors targeting a key intracellular protein-protein
interaction between regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins and the alpha-subunits of
G-proteins. As opposed to the conventional approach of directly targeting the protein-protein
interface, we propose to target allosteric sites on RGS proteins to inhibit the protein-protein
interaction. Through preliminary studies on a model protein, we have shown that allosteric
control and targeting is feasible and through this project we propose to broaden the scope of
these promising studies to new protein targets involved in cancer and visual signaling. Overall,
we anticipate that the mechanistic paradigms emerging from these studies will have broader
applicability to other protein families and will facilitate the design of novel therapeutic strategies."
10876325,"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are self-renewing cells essential for adult spermatogenesis that hold promise
for treating male infertility. In this proposal we focus on two topics revolving around SSCs. First, we will identify
“transcription factor (TF) circuits” critical for SSC establishment. Identifying such TF circuits will allow us to
ultimately define a functionally defined (not merely “omics” defined) TF network that drives immature germ cells
to become stem cells. Second, we will follow-up on our surprising finding that knockout (KO) of a transcription
factor important for spermatogenesis causes expansion of SSCs. Understanding the underlying mechanism for
this potential compensatory response to genetic insult has the potential to reveal insights into how human SSCs
respond to toxic insults and infertility.
The molecular mechanisms by which SSCs are initial generated in vivo are poorly understood. One of the few
proteins that have been shown to drive SSC establishment is the homeobox TF, RHOX10, which we showed
promotes SSC precursor cell differentiation and the initial seeding of SSCs in the seminiferous epithelium. Given
that TFs are regulatory factors that control batteries of downstream genes, our discovery that RHOX10 drives
SSC establishment provided an opportunity to define key genes critical for this process. Indeed, we recently
identified scores of direct RHOX10-target genes, including a remarkably large number of TF genes with known
roles in SSCs. This led us to hypothesize that a TF network is critical for SSC establishment, which we propose
to test. This is critical, as even though other studies have identified hundreds of downstream genes regulated
by TFs at various germ cell stages, it has not been ascertained which of these downstream genes are functionally
important for the action of a given TF. In Specific Aim 1, we will perform functional experiments to determine
the regulatory relationships of TFs, thereby allowing us to define functional TF circuits. As evidence of feasibility,
we recently defined—through rescue experiments—3 TFs that function in a TF circuit to drive SSC precursor
cell differentiation. The other focus of this proposal revolves around our unexpected recent discovery that adult
Rhox10-null mice have expanded numbers of SSCs. Understanding the mechanisms that drive SSC expansion
is critical for devising approaches to treat infertility. Our preliminary data support 3 testable models to explain
the SSC expansion in these KO mice, including a compensatory mechanism model in which SSCs undergo
proliferative expansion when they sense downstream spermatogenic defects. In support of such a feedback
mechanism operating in humans, it was recently reported that cryptozoospermia infertility patients have a
selective and robust increase in the number of SSCs, as defined by single-cell RNAseq analysis. In Specific
Aim 2, we will determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the expansion of SSCs in
Rhox10-null mice. Elucidating mechanisms controlling SSC expansion in vivo has the potential to translate into
approaches into expanding SSCs in vitro for clinical applications."
10876457,"Cannabis use in pregnancy is becoming increasingly common despite recommendations from healthcare providers and
professional organizations for abstinence. Evidence exists that cannabis exposure in utero, particularly after the first
trimester, is associated with risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes and negative effects on the long-term
neurodevelopment of the exposed neonate. Despite this, approximately one in four pregnant women who uses cannabis
will continue to use throughout her pregnancy.
The data that exist currently suggest that continued use in pregnancy is associated with the highest risk of adverse
outcomes. However, most of our understanding of patterns of use come from cross-sectional surveys and consist only of
the binary outcomes of continuation or abstinence. There is a need for longitudinal data evaluating trajectories of
cannabis use during pregnancy, including changes such as decreases in use. Defining these trajectories will help to
further delineate if a dose-dependent relationship between exposure and outcomes exist. Equally as important,
understanding both baseline and time-varying factors that are associated with different cannabis use trajectories can be
used to inform counseling, support and treatment efforts with the ultimate goal of improving maternal and child health.
We plan to recruit 1,200 pregnant people who present for prenatal care at six different clinical sites across two
institutions in Maryland and California. The cohort will include 800 people who self-report cannabis use within the 30
days prior to pregnancy recognition and 400 who do not. We will collect baseline demographic information, health and
mental health history and detailed information on frequency, quantity and mode of cannabis use and other substances
prior to and since recognition of pregnancy. We will then follow these women throughout pregnancy with monthly,
electronic surveys using Timeline Followback to quantify use. In addition to self-report of use, we will use urine drug
testing for confirmation. Latent Variable Mixture Modeling will be used to define varying trajectories of cannabis use in
pregnancy. In order to evaluate both baseline and time-varying factors associated with differing trajectories of use, we
will also capture data on mental health status, pregnancy symptoms, motivations and intentions for use and social
determinants of health at enrollment and once per trimester throughout pregnancy. We will compare birth outcomes
between different cannabis use trajectories and those of women who do not use.
We intend to 1) define trajectories of cannabis use during pregnancy among women who used cannabis within the
month prior to pregnancy recognition 2) determine both baseline and time-varying factors associated with different
cannabis use trajectories 3) compare birth outcomes across cannabis use trajectories to those of pregnant people who
do not use cannabis.
The results of this study will aid in the development of more comprehensive approaches to cannabis use counseling and
treatment with the goal of improving maternal health and decreasing rates of substance exposed newborns.
Additionally, our results will inform future studies on the effects of in utero cannabis use exposure."

analysis. We also offer video monitoring services and extensive thermoregulatory services including continuous
core body temperature monitoring, calculation of thermal conductance, thermal gradient tests, and measures of
brown adipose tissue and tail-temperature that can be performed at any ambient temperature using temperature-
controlled chambers. As the EB Core is the sole provider of these services in the Seattle area, the UW NORC
plays a critical role in the productivity and scientific advances of the nutrition and obesity research community.
 Specific Aim 2: To create an organizational structure that ensures that services are provided to AIs
in a timely, efficient and cost-effective manner and that quality control for all services is routinely
assessed.
We optimize the scope of services offered and ensure that they fit seamlessly and without overlap with services
offered via other UW programs and centers. To ensure services are provided to AIs in a timely and efficiency
manner, the EB Core has implemented a streamlined process for animal transfers and handling; have highly
skilled and trained personnel with extensive experience managing technically demanding equipment to ensure
consistency and quality control; and strong leadership with expertise in the design, performance, analysis and
interpretation of rodent metabolic phenotypes related to nutrition and obesity.
 Specific Aim 3: To develop new services that keep pace with relevant technological advances and
address the evolving needs of our user base.
 Over the past 5 years, we have incorporated a number of innovative techniques into our expanded menu of
offered services. We obtained a thermocline and temperature-controlled metabolic chambers for adaptive
thermogenesis studies and introduced quantitative approaches to measure thermal conductance. In addition,
we devote time and resources to teaching and training activities both to our NORC AIs and the broader scientific

10877125,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Gene Modulation in Cancer Cell Models (GMCCM) Shared Resource 
The complexity and heterogeneity of cancer demand appropriate and adaptable cell-based models that enable 
researchers to uncover key genes, pathways, interactions, and modifications that drive cancer development 
and to devise effective and personalized therapeutics. The Gene Modulation in Cancer Cell Models (GMCCM) 
Shared Resource provides DLDCCC members with a versatile combination of cutting-edge technologies, 
genomic resources, and advanced instrumentation. Directed by Drs. Dan Liu and Jean Kim, who combined 
have extensive expertise in developing technologies and cancer cell models (e.g., high-throughput genetic 
screens and stem cell manipulation), GMCCM houses essential elements for single-gene analyses to whole- 
genome screens, including genome-wide libraries of short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), cDNAs, and CRISPR 
sgRNAs, as well as multiple automated robotic platforms for library manipulation. In addition, the Shared 
Resource offers CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-editing services in a variety of cell types including induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from cancer patients. The ever-expanding functionalities of

10877129,"PROJECT SUMMARY: High-Parameter Cytometry Shared Resource (HPCSR)
Cytometry is an essential and broadly applicable technology for cancer research to assist with elucidating
mechanisms of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, cell-cycle progression, transforming viruses, and to evaluate
cancer therapies. It is integral to studies of cancer stem cells, angiogenesis, inflammation, transcriptional
regulation in tumor cells, and mechanisms of DNA break and repair. The goal of the High-Parameter Cytometry
Shared Resource (HPCSR) is to provide a wide range of Cancer Center investigators with access to cost-
effective state-of-the-art instrumentation, expertise and training for their cell sorting, and analysis needs. This
technology continues to develop at a rapid pace, especially with the advent of novel tools and reagents,
increased computational capacity, and more cost-effective equipment. To keep pace with changing technologies,
increased utilization, and growth of users over the past 4 years, the HPCSR has expanded its space with new
lab renovations, acquired substantial upgrades of existing equipment, and acquired new major equipment
utilizing mass, imaging, high-parameter, and large and small particle cytometry. The main facility is housed in
centrally located space and is available to trained users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by key-card access.
Current major instrumentation includes a mass cytometer and imaging system, high-parameter fluorescent
cytometer, an imaging cytometer, 4 florescence-activated cell sorters, 7 flow analyzers, and magnetic and large
particle cell sorters. The Resource is directed by Dr. Christine Beeton and Mr. Joel Sederstrom, whom both have
over 20 years of experience in flow cytometry and is staffed by 5 full-time experienced flow cytometrists who
perform operator-assisted cytometry and assist users with data analysis. To ensure optimal use of services,
HPCSR provides consultations, group and individually tailored training, and protocols for sample preparation,
flow analysis, and cell sorting. This is a heavily used Shared Resource that provided service for 119 Cancer
Center investigators during the last year, a substantial increase from 87 users in the first year of the CCSG
award. It serves all Programs of the DLDCCC with the Programs in Cell Signaling and Metabolism (CSM),
Nuclear Receptor, Transcription and Chromatin Biology (NRTCB), Breast Cancer (BCP), Mechanisms in Cancer
Evolution (MCEP), and Pediatric Cancer (PCP) being the biggest users of this Shared Resource. This use
translates into an average of 50 publications annually. Future plans include development of new technologies
and instrumentation for mass, high-parameter, imaging, large and small particle, and spectral cytometry that are
pushing the boundaries of conventional cytometry beyond 50 parameters. Further expansion of space and
research staff are required for these new technologies and anticipated continued growth of HPCSR."
10877132,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Proteomics Shared Resource (PSR)
Proteins are the ultimate executors of biology, with nearly all cellular processes being dependent on the
molecular work performed by protein products of genes. Furthermore, there is a tremendous regulatory potential
that can be acutely utilized through fine-tuning of protein function through reversible chemical post-translational
modifications and interactions with other protein partners. Because of these functionalities, a majority of cancer
drugs act directly on protein targets or create a dependency on a protein function (e.g., DNA damage agents
that overwhelm protein enzymes involved in repair). It is now an increasing realization in the cancer research
field that without knowledge of the dynamics of protein networks (i.e., proteome dynamics), genomic and
transcriptomic data are often insufficient for determination of targetable, or “actionable,” events and mechanisms
of resistance to treatment. The goal of proteomics in cancer research is to define perturbations of complex and
dynamic protein signaling networks that are associated with development and progression of cancer and to use
this information for identification of novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers that can predict response or
resistance to specific therapies. We have established a comprehensive Shared Resource for protein biology with
a strong background in cancer biology and protein biochemistry. Since there is no single technology platform to
analyze all aspects of the cellular proteome, multiple enrichment, purification, and measurement approaches
have been developed to address diverse research questions studied by DLDCCC investigators. Specifically, our
Shared Resource provides targeted antibody-based protein profiling with custom RPPA platform and a suite of
mass spectrometry-based assays for expression profiling and determination of protein interactions. Furthermore,
recognizing the challenges of “big data,” we strive for excellence in data analysis and communication. Our
services are therefore provided as beginning-to-end packages to assist investigators with up-front study design
and feasibility assessment, execution of experimental analysis by various technology platforms, specialized
analysis and interpretation of data, troubleshooting, and decision-making in follow-up studies."
10875098,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Mental health concerns in teachers have escalated since the onset of the pandemic, and the
deterioration of mental health can begin as early as the teacher training period. Accessible and scalable
programs that prepare teachers for the stress of the profession are urgently needed to prevent the deterioration
of mental health and its attendant consequences. The goal of this longitudinal project is to test the feasibility
and acceptability, utility, and candidate mechanisms of an accessible, mobile health, mindfulness-based
intervention, the Healthy Minds Program (HMP), to equip teachers in training (“pre-service teachers”; i.e.,
university students majoring in education) with skills necessary to maintain their mental health as they
transition into the classroom. The project addresses three specific aims. Aim 1: a) Assess the feasibility and
acceptability of the HMP for pre-service teachers and b) identify barriers and facilitators to program
acceptability. Aim 2: Determine the utility of the HMP for preventing depression and anxiety (main outcomes)
and turnover intentions (secondary outcome). Aim 3: Examine HMP effects on candidate mechanisms, and the
effect of mechanisms on outcomes. The results of this project will provide critical insight into the potential for
the HMP to scale up for widespread use in pre-service teacher training programs. Importantly, the project will
provide a unique opportunity for undergraduate research at the University of Alabama, and will strengthen the

10897126,"Project Summary
Regular physical activity induces specific adaptive responses in various tissues, and ultimately improves health
and reduces the risk for cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. To improve the efficacy of physical activity,
many studies have examined the impacts of intensity, duration, frequency, and modality of physical activity on
the adaptive responses. However, timing of physical activity has been rarely considered. It is well-established
that the circadian timing system modulates cardiovascular function and metabolism, generating ~24-h rhythms
in these physiological functions that are in synchrony with the day-night cycle. Thus, physical activity at different
times of day may have different impacts on health due to the circadian control. Indeed, recent breakthrough
animal studies have shown time-of-day dependent effects of exercise on transcripts and metabolites enriched in
metabolic pathways that are related to exercise adaptations and, importantly, linked to the circadian system. We
hypothesize that timing of physical activity modulates the adaptive responses, and can thus be used to enhance
physical activity-induced health benefits. To address this hypothesis, during the K99 phase, I will first utilize the
dataset from an NIH-funded randomized controlled trial with lifestyle intervention and 1-week accelerometer
recording among approximately 2,200 patients with type 2 diabetes to examine 1) the association between timing
of physical activity and markers of cardiometabolic health at baseline, and 2) the association between timing of
physical activity and the improvements in markers of cardiometabolic health at 1-year follow-up. In the R00
phase, I will test the causal relationship by experimentally manipulating the timing of physical activity in
individuals with prediabetes using a randomized, cross-over design with two highly controlled in-laboratory
protocols. This innovative project will advance our knowledge in the interaction effects of the circadian timing
system and physical activity and may help in designing evidence-based lifestyle interventions incorporating

Cardiovascular mortality attributable to hypertension (HTN) has increased by more than 10 percent in the last
decade, due in part to the escalating obesity epidemic. Effective therapeutic options for HTN are limited and
despite a high prevalence of multi-pharmacological approaches, more than 50% of hypertensive individuals
remain uncontrolled. As such, studies that advance understanding of basic mechanisms of blood pressure
regulation in humans are needed to identify novel therapeutic targets. Exaggerated sympathetic nervous activity
(SNA) and vasoconstriction are hallmark features of many cardiovascular diseases including obesity-associated
HTN (Ob-HTN). Causes of exaggerated sympathetic vasoconstriction are unclear, however recent advances in
quantification of sympathetic activity have uncovered unique action potential patterns that influence the
peripheral vasoconstrictor response to stress. In animal models, sympathetic firing patterns during stress
increase co-release of the potent vasoconstrictor neuropeptide Y (NPY) in conjunction with norepinephrine,
causing a shift in the mechanisms of vasoconstriction towards NPY-mediated signaling. NPY causes
vasoconstriction via activation of NPY 1 receptors (Y1R), and facilitates α-adrenergic mediated signaling causing
exaggerated sympathetic vasoconstriction. We hypothesize that physiological stressors like obesity and hypoxia
alter sympathetic action potential patterns that cause vasoconstriction to rely on NPY-mediated signaling. The
overall aim of this proposal is to 1) identify how sympathetic action potential patterns change in response to
chemoreflex and mental stress 2) to assess the impact of action potential patterns on mechanisms of
vasoconstriction in healthy adults and in patients with Ob-HTN. To accomplish these goals, we will we will assess
beat-by-beat vasoconstriction in response to endogenous bursts of SNA during pharmacological manipulation
of α-adrenergic receptors and Y1Rs to determine the mechanisms of exaggerated sympathetic vasoconstriction
during chemoreflex/mental stress in healthy adults and Ob-HTN patients. We anticipate that these investigations
will 1) further understanding of the basic signaling mechanisms responsible for neurovascular transduction in
humans including the interaction between action potential patterns, neurotransmission and vasoconstriction 2)
identify new mechanisms underlying exaggerated neurovascular transduction in Ob-HTN and 3) provide
avenues for research in other patient populations characterized by elevated SNA and exaggerated
vasoconstriction including sleep apnea, metabolic disease, and heart failure."
10874974,"The peritoneum is the third most common site of metastasis in colon cancer. Despite the common occurrence
of peritoneal metastasis and its dire prognosis, very little is known about its origins and characteristics. The lack
of basic research into peritoneal metastasis has stymied treatment advances. We have spent the last 4 years
studying the genetics of colorectal cancer peritoneal metastasis in a large international collaboration. Building
on the findings from this effort, we here propose three aims to advance basic science and clinical care in this
crucial area. All aims will take advantage of a large, retrospective cohort of peritoneal metastasis patients
(N=103) that will undergo multi-region genomic analysis. The goal of the project is to rigorously define the
evolutionary history and genetic characteristics of peritoneal metastases and to tie these features to clinical
outcomes. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine how cancer cells reach the peritoneal cavity and how their
seeding routes impact the genetic diversity of peritoneal metastases. Our preliminary data show profound
differences in genetic diversity between synchronous and metachronous peritoneal metastases. The former are
genetically homogeneous and closely related to the deep invading edge of the primary tumor, while the latter
are heterogeneous and do not appear to originate at the invasive front, indicating that their seeding routes may
be distinct (direct growth through the serosa vs. cancer cell release during primary tumor surgery). In this aim,
we will map the routes by which peritoneal metastases are seeded and study how their origins shape genetic
diversity, using a combination of high-efficiency phylogenetic reconstruction and deep exome sequencing. In
Specific Aim 2, we will determine the genetic characteristics of cancer cells that succeed in colonizing
the peritoneum. We have previously found that cancer cells disseminating to different host organs are exposed
to environment-specific selective pressures. Our preliminary data indicate that genomically relatively intact
cancer cells may be at an advantage over highly mutated or aneuploid cells during peritoneal colonization. We
will use our extensively sampled cohort of peritoneal metastasis cases to compare driver mutations, somatic
copy number alterations (SCNAs), as well as global measures of genetic stability (tumor mutation burden, SCNA
burden) between primary tumors, locoregional, distant and peritoneal metastases. In Specific Aim 3, we will
study how the characteristics of peritoneal metastases relate to survival outcomes. Prognostic factors to
help clinicians estimate the likelihood of different survival outcomes are urgently needed. We will collect detailed
follow-up data on our peritoneal metastasis patient cohort. In Aim 3A, we will study the association between
survival and the genetic characteristics investigated in aims 1 and 2. In Aim 3B, we will broaden our inquiry to
the microenvironment and examine via single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) and multi-color
immunofluorescence whether the composition and transcriptome of stromal and immune cells present in
peritoneal metastases correlate with survival."

The primary objectives of our proposed Fundamental-Plus project are to continue to maintain
capacity for enhanced occupational illness and injury surveillance in Connecticut, and to
perform more in-depth data analysis, investigations, and intervention activities to address new
workplace vulnerabilities and health and safety challenges. The Program’s specific aims
include surveillance activities, in-depth and follow-back investigations and assessments, as well
as development, implementation, and evaluation of public health policies in specific workplaces
and/or involving targeted worker health and safety issues of interest. These specific aims have
been developed to continue to expand capacity for occupational illness and injury surveillance in
Connecticut and to maintain continuity in our surveillance and intervention programs for the
duration of the project period. These programs and the staff they support provide the basis for
the protection of worker health in our state, not only through surveillance and intervention
activities but also through the generation of ideas for how to make our program activities more
efficient, effective, and beneficial to the Connecticut workforce."
10875838,"Project Summary/Abstract
Chiral amino functionalized molecules are common motifs in a variety of bioactive molecules. They are also
important chiral building blocks in organic synthesis such as the chiral ligand frameworks that are the pillars in
several fields of asymmetric catalysis. The functional importance of these molecules renders their synthesis
continuously in high demand. Catalytic processes that can directly utilize abundant chemical feedstocks to
achieve the synthesis of these functional molecules are ideal. However, significant challenges remain for the
development of such catalytic reactions. The main objective of this program is to develop new classes of
catalytic and asymmetric alkene difunctionalizations and other processes that will meet the demands of these
challenges and expedite access to chiral amino functionalized motifs. Specifically, this proposal will introduce
chiral hypervalent iodine and halonium catalysis as platforms to resolve the regiochemical and enantioselective
challenges often encountered in these reactions. Our preliminary data and proposed studies will enable us to:
1) utilize chiral hypervalent iodine catalysis to achieve asymmetric induction for practical olefin oxyamination
and explore this class of catalysts as a new element for regiochemical control; and 2) initiate the use of a non-
covalent interaction (NCI) – halogen bonding for catalysis development and chemical reaction engineering. Our
proposal is innovative based on common and classic intermediates that are comprehensive to undergraduate
students to introduce several means of new strategies for regiochemical control and engage an uncommon
NCI for catalysis development. These methods use only simple and ubiquitous bifunctional reagents such as
amide, urea, carbamate, alcohols, etc as the functionalization reagents. Importantly, our strategy will enable a
straightforward route for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amino functionalized motifs."
10877980,"The number of medical conditions for which the results of genetic testing change the medical management of
patients is exponentially increasing. However, a minority of eligible patients receive genetic testing, despite the
implications for downstream care. System- (methods to identify eligible patients and return results), clinician(
e.g., knowledge, limited workforce), and patient- (e.g. , concerns about costs and adverse effects) level
barriers foster uncertainty and a tendency to rely on the status quo - failing to use genomic information to guide
medical care. Implementation science methods and frameworks are ideal for addressing this practice gap,
especially those that consider multi-level barriers and the role of human decision-making in contexts with
uncertainty. Our team has built the infrastructure to address system-barriers to delivering genetic testing
across our health system - an integrated system within the electronic health record (EHR) that enables direct
ordering and resulting of genetic tests as structured data - now with multiple requests for dissemination. Our
team also is using behavioral economics as an implementation science framework to improve healthcare by
using nudges (EHR defaults, patient priming) to overcome clinician and patient barriers, concurrently
addressing health disparities (e.g., higher practice gaps among racial minorities). Merging these areas, we
propose a highly innovative project that will evaluate, for the first time, the use of nudges to clinicians (EHR
defaults for either: 1) referring to genetics clinic or 2) ordering for genetic testing) and/or nudges to patients
(communication to prime patients about the benefits of genetic testing prior to appointment). In Aim 1, we will
develop electronic phenotyping algorithms for 10 clinical conditions, which will drive diagnosis-specific genetics
referral and testing; we will refine our nudges working with a Stakeholder Advisory Council. In Aim 2, we will
conduct a hybrid type 3 implementation study, using a cluster randomized design with 228 clinicians
(physician, Advanced Practice Practitioners) as the unit of randomization (N= 120 clusters) and 16,500 patients
with one of the 10 conditions to examine the impact on the rate of genetic testing of: the patient priming nudge,
the two clinician nudges, combining the patient and each of the clinician nudges, vs. a generic best practice
alert (BPA) (no clinician or patient nudge). We will examine patient (e.g., race), clinician (e.g., specialty), and
system (e.g. , community vs. academic center) moderators of nudge effects on genetic testing rate and assess
an effectiveness outcome (rate of clinician action following identification of a pathogenic variant). In Aim 3, we
will engage in systematic methods to disseminate our EHR integration of genetic testing, EHR-based
algorithms, and other materials and systems built for the clinical trial through Epic, PheKB, NHGRl's AnVIL,
and GitHub. Our study will be immensely impactful, as it will yield a novel, effective, and transferrable EHRbased
infrastructure that enables the sustainable delivery of genomic medicine, greatly advancing the field."

10877865,"Light chain amyloidosis (AL) is a devastating disease caused by the clonal expansion of a plasma cell that
secretes a destabilized, amyloidogenic immunoglobulin light chain (LC). In the serum, these LCs aggregate
into toxic oligomers and amyloid fibrils that deposit in peripheral target tissues such as the kidneys and heart
causing organ malfunction and eventual death. Current AL treatments use chemotherapy and autologous stem
cell transplantation to ablate the underlying diseased plasma cell population, reducing AL amyloid pathology by
removing the cells secreting the destabilized, aggregation-prone LC. While this strategy is effective for 70% of
AL patients, the remaining 30% of patients are too sick from LC toxicity on the heart or kidney to tolerate
chemotherapy. This necessitates the development of new strategies to decrease AL amyloid pathology and
allow chemotherapeutic access to the diseased plasma cells in this patient population. In the previous funding
period of this award, we showed that activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR)-associated
transcription factor ATF6 has significant potential to reduce AL-relevant LC toxicity through two distinct
mechanisms. We found that stress-independent ATF6 activation selectively reduces the secretion and toxic
aggregation of destabilized, amyloidogenic LCs. Furthermore, ATF6 activation in AL-relevant target tissues
including the kidney and heart induces expression of anti-oxidant genes that protect these tissues from diverse
types of oxidative stress – the same mechanism by which LCs induce toxicity in these tissues. These results
suggested the possibility that activating ATF6 using small molecules could mitigate AL amyloid pathology
through two complementary, tissue-specific mechanisms: 1) reducing the secretion and subsequent toxic
aggregation of amyloidogenic LCs in AL plasma cells and 2) increasing resistance of peripheral target tissues
to LC-associated oxidative stress. To address this potential, we are using first-in-class compounds established
during the previous funding period that selectively and robustly activate ATF6. Here, we test the hypothesis
that our ATF6 activating compounds can mitigate AL amyloid pathology through two distinct, tissue-specific
mechanisms. We are using these compounds to define their potential to mitigate LC-associated toxicity
through complementary, multi-tissue mechanisms in both plasma cells and peripheral target tissues such as
the kidney and heart. We will show that our ATF6 activators induce ER proteostasis remodeling in AL patient
plasma cells to selectively reduce the secretion and toxic aggregation of amyloidogenic LCs. Furthermore, we
will show that pharmacologic ATF6 activation in primary heart or kidney cells attenuates LC-associated toxicity
through increased expression of anti-oxidant genes. Through these efforts, we will show that our ATF6
activators offer significant translational potential to reduce AL amyloid pathology through distinct, multi-tissue
mechanisms and allow chemotherapeutic access to the underlying AL-associated plasma cells in the currently
untreatable population of AL patients suffering from severe kidney or cardiac involvement."

The Postgraduate Training Program in Medical Imaging (PTPMI) provides recent doctoral graduates with
research training in medical imaging technology as it pertains to normal and pathophysiological functions
applied to nuclear medicine (PET and SPECT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Optical Imaging, Image
Processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The importance of the field of Medical Imaging Sciences has been
recognized by the establishment of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB).
And within medical imaging science, imaging research and technology and more recently AI have
revolutionized the practice of Radiology. Trainees may enter the field of medical imaging research after study
of a curriculum that focuses directly on radiological science or after earning a doctoral degree in the physical
sciences, mathematics, biophysics, or computer science. MDs with established professional interest in
quantitative imaging research are also encouraged to apply.
The PTPMI provides trainees an innovative training and strong background via customized and diverse
mentoring as well as structured didactic courses and seminars, enabling graduates to critically evaluate the
field and develop their own research ideas. Trainees participate in leading--‐edge research, with the
opportunity to interact with a world--‐class multi-institutional faculty in a setting that combines the resources of
the Harvard Medical School (HMS), and the Harvard--‐affiliated Teaching Hospitals.
The rationale for this program is based on several factors: 1) the growing need for basic scientists with
training in medical imaging sciences applied in modalities such as PET, SPECT, MR, CT and optical; 2) the
availability of outstanding research programs that provide exciting opportunities for trainees in imaging
technologies and AI; 3) the availability of cutting-edge facilities with commercial and prototype imaging
systems; 4) an unusually strong and diverse group of mentors and, in addition, a faculty who provide
additional expertise and extend the range of contacts available to trainees; and 5) long--‐standing, diverse
collaborations, both within the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) as well as HMS, other HMS--‐affiliated
hospitals, Harvard University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
PTPMI has been characterized over the past funding period by exceptionally strong outcomes in terms of
inclusion and diversity with 32% of T32 trainees URM and 36% women, as well as in terms of career
outcomes with 60% T32 alumni in academic positions and 40% in industrial R&D positions, all in areas
directly related to NIBIB priorities in biomedical imaging and bioengineering technologies."
10878000,"Role of BCL10 somatic mutations in lymphomagenesis and response to BCR-targeted therapies
ABSTRACT
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoid malignancy and a molecularly
heterogenous disease. Two recent genomic profiling studies of large DLBCL patient series subclassified these
patients in five distinct genomic groups. Both studies essentially agreed in their classification and described a
previously unnoticed subtype reminiscent of Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL), namely C1 or BN2 lymphoma.
This C1/BN2 subtype is characterized by frequent translocations of BCL6 and activating mutations of NOTCH2
and NF-κB signaling genes. Among the latter, 30% of the patients displayed BCL10 mutations, which are rare
in other DLBCL subtypes (<2%) but relatively common in MZL (8%). In fact, BCL10 is critical for MZ B-cell
development and its overexpression mediates hyperproliferation and eventually lymphomas of MZ origin.
However, the effect of BCL10 mutations on lymphomagenesis has not been studied.
BCL10 forms a high order complex (CBM) with CARD11 and MALT1, also lymphoma oncogenes. This complex
serves as a docking platform for recruitment and activation of other proteins leading to NF-κB activation. BCL10
somatic mutations in DLBCL can be classified in: CARD domain missense and C-terminus truncating mutants.
BCL10 CARD mediates CARD11-BCL10 and BCL10-BCL10 interactions while BCL10 C-terminal domain
mediates BCL10-MALT1 interaction. In preliminary studies, both classes of mutants accelerate BCL10
polymerization, rewire complex structure and composition and, induce constitutive activation of NF-κB mediated
transcription and MALT1 protease activity.
We hypothesize that CARD and C-terminal mutations induce gain-of-function and drive lymphomagenesis by
activating CBM complex activity and its downstream signaling pathways including NF-κB and that they will do
so through distinct molecular mechanisms. Based in our preliminary results, we predict that: i) BCL10 gain-of-
function mutations will enhance CBM complex activity by disrupting BCL10 auto-inhibitory structure through
distinct molecular mechanisms based on specific biochemical effects of CARD missense or C-terminal truncating
mutations; ii) this will cause acceleration of lymphomagenesis in cooperation with NOTHC2 activating mutations,
and iii) BCL10 gain-of-function mutations will confer resistance to classical BCR pathway kinase inhibitors such
as Ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor), thus requiring targeting downstream proteins such as MALT1 inhibitors or alternative
pathways.
Our goals for this proposal are to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which specific BCL10 somatic mutations
classes alter the high order molecular structure of the CBM complex, to determine how this impacts MZ B-cell
growth and survival to cause lymphomas, and to leverage this information to design of novel therapeutic
approaches for C1/BN2 lymphomas."

2) the considerable costs to society associated with their care; 3) the limited efficacy and effectiveness
of available treatment and prevention programs; 4) the small number of active investigators in the field;
and 5) the emergence of relevant scientific and technological advances that have yet to be fully realized.
Over the past 34 years, we have recruited 107 T32 Postdoctoral Fellows. A majority of these trainees
have been women (56%) and close to 20% have been underrepresented minorities. In the last 15 years,
86% percent of the trainees completed at least two years of the T32 Fellowship. A majority of trainees,
80% continue to be actively involved in research concerning Childhood Neuropsychiatric Disorders.
Most trainees have published multiple peer-reviewed papers and many trainees have obtained

international acclaim and many of our graduates are leading figures in their respective fields. Uniquely,
this T32 program is fully united with a highly successful six-year integrated child, adolescent and adult
research and clinical residency training program in child psychiatry. In this renewal, we seek to expand
upon our existing collaborations involving joint training opportunities with adjoining departments and
with nearby academic institutions with an emphasis in child mental health. We include explicit training
in team science. We believe this training will augment the success of our trainees, reorienting the culture
of the academic institution to better support, greater reward, and an enhanced quality of mentorship in
clinical and translational research. We will continue to place a major emphasis on career development
by providing individual mentoring along with experiential training in team science, complemented by
didactic activities. A personalized training plan is developed for each trainee early during the course of
the Fellowship and is monitored closely throughout. Enhancement of writing skills, guidance on
balancing personal life and professional career, and exposure to cross-disciplinary co-mentors
characterize our T32 Fellowship program."

Most importantly, we find that the combination of ultrasound, TLR7/8 agonists with aCD40 and checkpoint
inhibition (building on a protocol in emerging human studies) efficiently eliminated implanted multisite invasive
KPC murine pancreatic tumors. Recent studies have provided compelling evidence as to the utility of agonist
CD40 (aCD40) antibodies within multicomponent protocols to treat pancreatic cancer, and studies combining
aCD40 with checkpoint modulators and chemotherapy have shown highly encouraging data. CD40 is expressed
on a subset of pancreatic cancer cells and the overwhelming majority of peritumoral lymphocytes. For PDAC,
the aCD40 monoclonal antibody also promotes stromal degradation, dendritic cell maturation and alters
macrophage phenotype, and therefore is an attractive approach for immunotherapy. While NCT03214250
(combining gemcitabine and Abraxane with aCD40 and aPD-1 immunotherapy) yielded very promising results
in which all patients receiving all components demonstrated regression of metastatic pancreatic cancer, T cell
activation was not observed and patients were not cured. Reliably delivering these treatments in human
pancreatic cancer is challenging due to the dense stroma and limited vascular supply. Initial studies of MR
guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) to ablate human pancreatic tumors are scheduled to begin in early 2020
at Stanford. Here, we will combine MRgFUS with an aCD40+checkpoint inhibitor strategy. We will immediately
work to translate such a strategy if results are promising. Further, recent work has also demonstrated that toll
like receptor (TLR)7/8 agonists have therapeutic utility, particularly in pancreatic cancer. TLR7/8 agonists are
desirable for translation due to the distribution of receptors on subsets of DCs. Our preliminary data demonstrate
synergy between TLR7/8 and aCD40, and we build on the combination of TLR7/8 agonists and aCD40 in Aim
2. While TLR7/8 agonists can be delivered intradermally, the direct delivery of TLR agonists to tumors yields an
in situ vaccination that facilitates efficacy by exposing activated immune cells to cancer antigen. Our preliminary
data indicate that with 2 treatments (with intravenous injection of TLR7/8 and CP4) up to 100% of directly-treated
tumors and 60% of distant KPC tumors were eliminated. A major challenge for human studies is to deliver
sufficient quantities of TLR7/8 agonists and antibodies to pancreatic cancer without dose-limiting toxicity. We
have developed a temperature-sensitive liposomal (TSL) strategy to assure adequate delivery of TLR7/8
agonists to pancreatic cancer and add this in Aim 2. With such a strategy, it is feasible to deliver 8% or more of
the injected dose to a human tumor (at least 20 fold more than free drug) and limit systemic toxicity. In summary,
within Aim 1, we will incorporate MRgFUS ablation into clinically-relevant aCD40+checkpoint therapy. Within
Aim 2, we will further add TLR7/8 agonists to an aCD40 protocol. As an additional step toward translation, we
will assay primary human pancreatic cancer cells as to the effect of TLR7/8 and aCD40 on proliferation."

The capacity to regulate stem and progenitor cells for regeneration is widespread in the animal kingdom and
has attracted investigation for centuries. Evolution has selected for mechanisms involved in wound repair and
tissue regrowth that are the dreams of regenerative medicine. Uncovering the principles of regeneration in
case study organisms should identify processes that naturally promote or limit regeneration, enabling future
development of therapeutic approaches to tissue damage repair. Planarians are flatworms capable of
regenerating any missing body part, including new heads. Their regenerative powers have combined with ease
of experimentation to make them a classic regeneration model. Planarian regeneration involves adult stem
cells called neoblasts, which we previously showed can display pluripotency at the single cell level
(cNeoblasts). A major direction of our research addresses how fate specification occurs in regeneration.
Extensive work indicates that fate choices are made within the neoblasts (called specialized neoblasts), with
the regeneration outgrowth at the wound (a blastema) being a composite of different fate-specified cells. This
highlights the step of fate-choice in neoblast stem cells as central for understanding the mechanistic basis for
planarian regeneration. We seek to understand ""specificity"" in regeneration, in which diverse injuries appear to
result in responses tailored to the identity of missing tissue. We aim to distinguish between the possible
existence of surveillance systems indicating the presence or absence of differentiated cell types and what we
named target-blind regeneration. In target-blind regeneration, progenitor production occurs at a low basal rate
sufficient for repair from small wounds, without needing tissue surveillance; we hypothesize tissue-specific
progenitor production is primarily regulated by wound-induced proliferation combined with positional
information. We aim to understand how positional information regulates stem cell fate choice during tissue
turnover, and dynamically during regeneration. Our prior work on a planarian whole-animal cell-type
transcriptome atlas indicates the existence of over 100 adult cell types. We seek to understand what processes
within neoblast stem cells regulate how they make any one of so many possible choices. We will study the
pattern of fate choices using spatial transcriptomics and seek to distinguish between a highly regulated fate-
specification process, such as by extrinsic local tissue cues, and a more stochastic process internal to the stem
cells. Finally, we will investigate how adult progenitors generated from stem cells bring about the restoration of
tissue architecture in regeneration. Our prior work indicates that migratory targeting by extrinsic cues combines
with self-organization of progenitors with their target tissue to generate and maintain tissue pattern in
regeneration. We will study the molecular bases for these processes, which will be critical to elucidate for
understanding the basis for tissue repair and regeneration."
10879131,"PROJECT SUMMARY. Significance. Great progress has been made toward the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals
worldwide, and novel methods for HIV prevention are beginning to decrease the size of the epidemic.
However, much work on the HIV continuum of care remains. Racial and ethnic diversity among HIV
researchers will be critical in developing new approaches to address the “10-10-10” gap that currently eludes
the best behavioral science conducted to date. Yet, funding rates for underrepresented in medicine/public
health (URM) researchers are well below those of white researchers (~15% versus 25%) and only 6% of K
career development award applicants have been URM trainees. Approach. In Aim 1, the proposed Fostering
Diversity in HIV Research Program will follow Social Cognitive Career Theory and the Mentoring Across
Difference framework to train mentors in key skills to successfully support URM trainees. Workshops will be
held annually with additional quarterly sessions. In Aim 2, the program will provide structured research
mentorship exclusively to URM trainees to address the HIV continuum of care. Trainees will be identified
through residency and post-doctoral fellowship programs at Massachusetts General Hospital (Departments of
Medicine, Infectious Disease, Psychiatry, Obstetrics/Gynecology) and master’s degree and PhD programs at
the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health (Departments of Behavioral and Social Science, Global Health
and Population, Epidemiology, Immunology and Infectious Diseases); recruitment will also involve active
outreach efforts. Trainees will receive formal didactics on the HIV continuum of care and career development,
focusing on issues particularly relevant for URM trainees (e.g., implicit bias). Mentors will support URM
trainees in gaining knowledge about behavioral HIV research, as well as provide the hands-on technical and
professional skills needed to develop successful research careers. All activities will be tailored to the needs of
URMs and each individual’s stage of training. Research will address the following areas of the HIV continuum
of care both domestically and globally: PrEP delivery and adherence; HIV testing and outreach; linkage,
retention in care, and ART adherence; chronic care and complications of treated HIV; maternal health and
perinatal transmission. Primary outcomes of the program will be HIV research mentors with the necessary
mentoring competencies to successfully support URM trainees, as well as high quality, satisfying, and
impactful mentorship of URM trainees who achieve core research competencies. Other outcomes include
trainee scholarship (i.e., manuscripts and grants), progression of trainees through the academic research
pipeline, and fidelity of program implementation. Innovation. The Fostering Diversity in HIV Research Program
is innovative in its 1) targeted training of mentors to effective support URM trainees, 2) focus on the transition
periods when many trainees leave academic research, 3) creation of a broad-based Community of Practice
among URM trainees, and 4) interdisciplinary focus, fostering cross-collaboration and team science."

This application will address cancer health disparities in Black residents of metropolitan Detroit, specifically
evaluating racial differences in genetic regulation of anti-tumor immunity in HER2+ breast cancer as an example
of the type of transdisciplinary work that will be catalyzed through the robust grant-planning infrastructure
developed in this P20. Black women with HER2+ breast cancer have substantially poorer outcomes overall and
among those treated with trastuzumab compared to White patients, even after controlling for clinical and
sociodemographic factors, suggesting biologic factors may also contribute. Endogenous adaptive immunity may
be a requirement for sustained tumor protection after monoclonal antibody treatment, and the role of genetic
regulation of immune tolerance, autoimmunity, and tumor immunity is well documented. Further, there is strong
evidence for racial differences in both immune pathway genetic variation and the tumor immune
microenvironment. A better understanding of the mechanisms regulating response to anti-HER2 antibodies is
critical for the development of improved clinical strategies, and the inclusion of a diverse patient population and
consideration of group- and individual-level genetic differences is essential for ensuring that these strategies are
equitable. We have assembled a strong multidisciplinary team of investigators committed to understanding the
biological underpinnings of racial disparities in cancer. The overarching goals of this P20 are (1) to identify
ancestry-specific genetic regulators of macrophage function and response to anti-HER2 antibody therapy that
potentially underlie racial differences in response to this targeted immunotherapy and (2) to establish a robust
infrastructure to support and develop innovative, productive immuno-oncology and health disparities research
collaborations. The application comprises one Research Project and an Administrative Core at an NCI-
designated comprehensive Cancer Center in Detroit, Michigan, where the majority of census tracts are medically
underserved areas based on HRSA definitions. The aims of this P20 are (1) to accelerate translational research
to reduce racial disparities in HER2+ breast cancer outcomes by characterizing race-specific immune profiles
with respect to the tumor environment and host genetic background to determine their contribution to response
to treatment with anti-HER2 antibody therapies and (2) to strengthen the existing programmatic structure to
facilitate intersectional, translational research on immuno-oncology and the biology of cancer health disparities,
achieve R01/P01-level funding, and ultimately reduce cancer health disparities in immuno-oncology outcomes.
This work will provide the basis for moving towards a more race-inclusive, equity-focused precision medicine
approach to the use of immunotherapies to improve overall treatment response, identify novel biomarkers, and
reduce racial disparities in outcomes."
10885611,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a complex, multifactorial, slowly progressive, neurodegenerative disorder that
causes dementia and cognitive decline. It is common to delineate AD into familial AD (FAD) and late-onset AD
(LOAD), with the former with an early age of onset, having defined genetic origins (mutations in PSEN1, PSEN2,
and APP genes), while the latter has no specific gene mutations and the genetic background determinants are
unknown. Both AD forms manifest similar phenotypes, including memory loss and cognitive decline, the
formation of plaques and tangles in the brain and death. There is no known effective cure for AD. The major
barriers to our inability to identify drugs that will address this neurodegenerative disorder include (a) the absence
of reliable and accurate AD models that can faithfully recapitulate human AD, (b) a lack of incisive and
comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms (endotypes) underlying the onset and progression of the
disease, and (c) absence of screening strategies in the model systems to assess the efficacy of drugs that will
address all aberrant endotypes. Solutions to these barriers form the leitmotif of our proposal. Our first objective
is the development of brain organoids which are realistic models of the human brain from human induced
pluripotent cells (hiPSC). In aim 1 of the proposal, we plan to derive six isogenic mutant hiPSC lines (4 PSEN1,
1 PSEN2 and 1 APP) from a young, healthy individual. Similarly, derive isogenic mutation-corrected control
hiPSC lines from three FAD patients (each PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP mutations). Develop brain organoids from
these hiPSC cell lines and characterize them using biophysical and omics methods. In addition, we plan to
develop brain organoids from two aged non-demented control subjects. These brain organoids will be developed
with and without microglia additions and characterized using a repertoire of biophysical and omics methods as
a function of their development. We plan to investigate them at 1, 3, 6, and 10 months of organoid development.
These models will help us understand the role of genetic background in the disease process apart from the
deterministic FAD mutations. They will also help us understand AD disease evolution mechanisms (Aim 2) and
be a better tool for validating therapeutics screening (Aim 3). In Aim 2, We will use the multiome sequencing
methods to profile these organoids' molecular and cellular functional states. The multiomics measurements will
be analyzed using extant and innovative systems biology methods to identify ""endotypes"" that are disease-
causing and those that are distinct across the mutations and across time. We will relate these endotypes to the
biophysical and phenotypical measurements to develop causal mechanistic models that can help identify
potential disease mechanisms to target therapeutically. In Aim 3, we plan to validate the endotypes that are
disease causing using genetic perturbation strategies. Furthermore, we will test these model systems' validity
for investigating therapeutic screening and development as a preliminary step toward drug discovery."
10885684,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mounting evidence from our team and others suggests a potential bi-directional relationship between sleep and
Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in older adults, in which sleep disturbances precede clinical
ADRD, in addition to commonly occurring after disease onset. This bi-directional relationship has important
implications for the early intervention of ADRD, yet it remains debatable whether sleep disturbance is a prodromal
or modifiable risk factor of ADRD. Research to disentangle the role of sleep in ADRD requires the use of a life
course approach to address the directionality of the association, particularly given the long neurodegenerative
processes leading to ADRD before symptoms onset and the large variations in sleep disturbances across the
life course. Our long-term goal is to develop preventive strategies for ADRD by addressing the role of sleep
disturbances across the life course. The objective of this proposal is to determine the effects of objective and
subjective sleep disturbances on age-related cognitive decline and risk of ADRD across the life course in diverse
populations, and to elucidate mechanistic pathways contributing to this association at different stages of life. Our
central hypothesis is that objective and subjective sleep disturbances over the life course are associated with
life-course cognitive trajectories and risk of ADRD, with varying magnitude and different underlying pathways for
each stage of life. We have an unprecedented opportunity to leverage data from six well-characterized
longitudinal cohorts, two with 40-50% Black or Mexican American participants, to create a synthesized diverse
cohort of ~35,000 (age 30-104) adults with objective (polysomnography and actigraphy) and subjective sleep
measures, and cognition assessed regularly spanning up to 60 years. We will also perform replication analysis
using data from the UK Biobank, a study of 500,000 UK adults aged 40-84 years. By applying an innovative life
course approach both in the synthesized and each individual cohort, we will address the following aims: 1)
Identify age trends in objective and subjective sleep disturbances and cognition from early adulthood to the
oldest old; 2) Evaluate the longitudinal association between sleep disturbances at different stages of life and
cognitive performance over the life course including incident ADRD; 3) Elucidate and compare novel pathways
linking sleep disturbances to ADRD at different stages of life. The research is highly significant because it helps
to address the timing of sleep disturbances in relation to cognitive aging over the life course and thus the
directionality of the relationship. The creation of the first-ever synthesized diverse cohort of sleep and cognition
across the life course will also develop foundational resources for future research to disentangle the bi-directional
link between sleep and ADRD. This work has a large impact as a critical step towards elucidating the role of life-
course sleep disturbance as a prodromal or modifiable risk factor for ADRD. This will directly inform the early
detection of ADRD and the design of intervention trials, especially in establishing the optimal timing for sleep
intervention to mitigate dementia risk, a topic with profound public health implications."

 This is a K01 award application for Dr. Hang Hai, a young investigator with a strong commitment to
reducing alcohol-related health inequities among people of color (long-term goal). This K01 award will provide
mentorship and research experience to advance her intermediate goal of becoming an independent NIAAA
investigator with expertise in developing scalable, culturally appropriate, technology-enhanced, spirituality-
integrated alcohol interventions for Latinx young adults (YAs). This award will facilitate Dr. Hai’s achievement of
the following training goals (TG): to develop critical knowledge and skills in 1) the development of mobile health
alcohol interventions, 2) qualitative research methods for cultural adaptation of alcohol interventions for Latinx
populations, 3) the role of spirituality in alcohol use disorder (AUD) recovery and spirituality-integrated alcohol
interventions, including 12-step programs, and 4) alcohol misuse among YAs. Dr. Hai has assembled a
multidisciplinary mentorship team with internationally recognized experts in each training area. She will achieve
her training goals through mentored training and research, directed readings, formal coursework, and training
institutes/programs. To acquire hands-on research experience in all training areas, Dr. Hai proposes an
innovative, mentored research study focused on developing a smartphone-app-based intervention for Latinx YAs
with AUD. Latinx YAs are a large and rapidly growing population particularly vulnerable to alcohol-related
disparities. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) has the potential to help lift this public health burden but is underused
by Latinx YAs. 12-Step Facilitation (TSF), an evidence-based, professionally delivered, spirituality-integrated
intervention specifically designed to promote AA engagement, is a promising tool to help leverage AA. However,
literature and preliminary data show that adaptation is needed to ensure TSF is effective, accessible, scalable,
and culturally appropriate for Latinx YAs. In response to this need, the proposed research aims to adapt TSF in
three critical ways: 1) to increase TSF’s socio-cultural appropriateness for Latinx YAs, we will add an intervention
component to address the link between drinking problems and minority status-related factors, such as ethnic
discrimination and acculturation stress; 2) update TSF’s spirituality-related language and content to better
resonate with Latinx YAs; and 3) adapt TSF into a smartphone-app-based intervention (eTSF) to maximize
intervention accessibility and scalability. The proposed research aligns with the NIH-wide strategic plan’s aim to
“improve minority health and reduce health disparities” and NIAAA’s strategic plan Objective 4a to “Improve
existing behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder” through “use[ing] electronic health technologies including
mobile devices.” This study will lay the groundwork for testing a fully powered randomized trial (R01 submission
in Year 5) and expanding eTSF’s scope to include other minoritized populations in the future."

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a rare form of dementia that affects thousands of patients in the US and for
which there is no cure. FTD usually manifests with changes in personality, behavior or mood, memory loss,
confusion, and difficulty with day-to-day tasks. This symptomatology arises from neurodegeneration in the
frontal and temporal lobes, which are areas of the brain that control personality, emotions, behavior, and some
forms of cognition. One of the most common forms of FTD in the US is caused by mutations in Tau (sporadic
and genetic) causing Tau intracellular accumulation and aggregation, synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death,
and severe memory loss. Currently there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies
for FTD, and there are no treatments that can stop or alter the course of disease progression. Therefore, there
is an unmet need for the development of therapeutic strategies that can improve the quality of life of patients
with FTD. We previously showed that the serine/threonine Protein kinase CK2 alpha prime (CK2α’) is a
pathological sensor activated in the presence of protein aggregation and synaptic dysfunction in different
human proteinopathies such as Huntington’s disease (HD) that contributes to neurodegeneration and
behavioral alterations. Our previous and preliminary data demonstrated that some forms of FTD present
similarities in the mechanisms that lead to neurodegeneration and behavioral deficits with HD. Our preliminary
data removing one allele of CK2α’ in the FTD PS19 mouse model expressing a Tau mutation (P301L)
associated with hereditary FTD restored the expression of glutamate related signaling (GRS) genes, increased
soluble Tau levels and rescued memory deficits assessed in the Barnes maze task. These results represent a
strong foundation for the pharmacological inhibition of CK2α’ as a potential therapeutic strategy for the
treatment of neurodegeneration and memory decline associated with FTD. In this proposal we will investigate
the therapeutic potential of the pharmacological inhibition of CK2α’ in the treatment of memory deficits
associated with FTD using the FDA approved CK2 inhibitor Silmitasertib (CX4945). CX4945 is currently in
clinical trials for the treatment of several cancers, is oral bioavailable and safe in humans, and if proven
efficacious in the amelioration of memory loss in FTD mice it could become a potential therapeutic strategy for
the treatment of FTD. We will treat two different groups of mice (pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic) and
will evaluate the impact of CX4945 in learning and memory by conducting three different behavioral tasks (Y
maze for spatial working memory, T-maze for spatial reference memory and Barnes maze for spatial learning
and memory). We will conduct RNA-seq analyses in the FC of mice to assess the impact of CX4945 on GRS
and other synaptic genes and its association with Tau/TauP levels and neuronal function using Ca2+ imaging
analyses. Successful completion of this study will consolidate the role of CK2α’ in FTD and will establish proof
of concept for the therapeutic potential of using CK2 inhibitors for the treatment of memory loss in FTD."

 High-energy pilon fractures are associated with an increased risk of post-traumatic arthritis and poor
patient outcomes. The risk of arthritis is over 25% in many series and can be upwards of 50% in more highly
comminuted fracture patterns. Intraarticular fractures result in an increase in the synovial concentrations of
inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. Animal models have demonstrated the irreversible
damage a persistent hemarthrosis may have on cartilage viability suggesting that prolonged exposure to blood
in this highly pro-inflammatory milieu may further exacerbate the chondral damage from the initial injury.
However, the impact of these local inflammatory processes on the risk of post-traumatic arthritis and patient
outcomes remain unclear.
 The long-term goal of our research is to develop treatment modalities including surgical and
pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the risk post-traumatic arthritis and dysfunction following intraarticular
fractures. The objective of this study is to determine the effect of ankle joint lavage on the risk of post-
traumatic arthritis and patient outcomes following high-energy pilon fractures. First, we will obtain synovial fluid
samples from the ankle joint of patients undergoing temporary external fixation of a pilon fracture for cytokine
analysis. Then, we will randomize patients to undergo standard treatment with or without ankle joint lavage at
the time of external fixation. Patients will undergo repeat synovial fluid analysis at the time of definitive fixation
to determine the effect of lavage on the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Last, patients will be
followed for a period of six months after surgery to determine the impact on functional outcomes.
 The information generated in this study will substantially add to our understanding of the pathogenesis
of post-traumatic arthritis in high-energy pilon fractures."
10889076,"Adolescence is an age of increased vulnerability to psychopathology, including drug abuse. My work concerns
the molecular events underlying the maturation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in adolescence and the
effect of stimulant drugs on these processes. My ultimate goal is to unravel the molecular factors mediating risk
and resilience in adolescence to the deleterious effects of drugs of abuse in males and females. Our work has
focused on the impact of amphetamine (AMPH) on the development of the dopamine (DA) innervation to the
mPFC. We discovered that DA axons are still growing toward the mPFC across adolescence, remaining
particularly susceptible to disruption. This delayed DA axon growth is controlled by the guidance cue receptor
DCC, which determines whether, when, and where DA axons stop or continue to grow. Notably, AMPH in early
adolescence dysregulates DCC expression and also induces profound changes in mPFC DA synaptic
connectivity/function and causes deficits in cognitive control in adulthood. Until very recently all our studies
have been focused on male mice only. In addition, we have been investigating only AMPH effects of doses that
reach plasma levels equivalent to those seen in recreational drug users. Our recent preliminary data suggest,
however, that the vulnerability to the effects of AMPH on mPFC DA development is sex-specific. Also, recently
published results show that therapeutic-like doses during this time induce opposite, even beneficial enduring
effects. The experiments now proposed are designed to test the following working hypotheses: (a) that the
vulnerability to AMPH-induced disruption of mPFC development at particular adolescent time windows is
sexually biased, (b) that this dimorphism also impacts detrimental drug effects on adult cognitive processing,
(c) that sex-specific control over DCC receptor expression in DA neurons mediates differential drug
vulnerability/resilience (d) that these effects are dependent upon recreational- versus therapeutic-like
exposure. Methods: To address these questions, we will conduct molecular, anatomical, neurochemical, and
behavioral experiments in male and female mice. Our studies will combine dual viral transduction strategies
and quantitative neuroanatomical analyses to track DA axon targeting and growth in adolescence. To measure
DA function, we will use novel and temporal-sensitive measurements of in vivo DA signaling (dLIght1) in freely
moving mice. To identify mechanisms underlying the dimorphic vulnerability to AMPH, we will perform gain-
and loss-of-function experiments using neuron optimized CRISPR and Cre-Lox recombination strategies."
10889077,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cancer survivors experience age-related diseases at earlier age than cancer-free persons, suggesting that
cancer survivors have accelerated aging. Accelerated aging among cancer survivors could be caused by
cancer treatment, but it could also be related to immune response and chronic inflammation. Chronic
inflammation is also found in individuals who subsequently develop cancer with subsequent risk of cancer
development, and it is possible that accelerated aging starts even before cancer diagnosis. To assess
biological aging before and after cancer diagnosis, we will use existing proteomic data and construct and
validate proteomic aging clocks in the prospective population-based Atherosclerosis Risk in the Community
(ARIC) cohort. The proteins have been already measured three times over 20 years using highly sensitive
SomaScan assay. The proteomic aging clocks will be externally validated in the Multi-Ethnic Study of
Atherosclerosis (MESA). The strengths of proteomic aging clocks are that these clocks are easily measured,
accurately predict biological aging, and are associated with age-related diseases and mortality. However, it is
unknown whether proteomic aging clocks predict cancer risk or outcomes in cancer survivors, and there is no
agreement about the optimal clock in the context of cancer. To overcome this gap in knowledge, we will
construct and validate proteomic aging clocks in ARIC participants who are cancer free but may have other
conditions, i.e. these clocks will be cancer-specific proteomic aging clocks (so called, CaPACs). In addition,
we will examine the previously published and validated proteomic aging clocks. Our central hypothesis is that
accelerated aging is associated with (1) increased cancer risk in persons who are cancer-free at baseline and
(2) premature mortality and morbidity among cancer survivors at middle and later age. In the first aim, we will
examine the associations between age acceleration for all CaPACs and the risk of overall cancer and specific
cancer types in ARIC and MESA. The associations will be also stratified by sex and race. In the second aim,
we will examine associations between age acceleration for all CaPACs and all-cause mortality, mortality from
causes other than their index cancer, and frailty among cancer survivors in ARIC. In addition, we will compare
associations with mortality among cancer survivors and those without cancer history. The use of existing data
from the ARIC and MESA studies will allow for quick and cost-efficient testing of our hypothesis. The
quantification of proteomic aging in cancer is clinically important because the knowledge of biological age will
not only inform risk-stratified cancer screening and post-diagnosis cancer surveillance, but also facilitate the
development of anti-aging drugs.

10899467,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Calcium is a critical mediator of many cellular processes, including muscle contraction,
mitochondrial activity, transcription, cell division, and synaptic vesicle release. Paradoxically,
calcium can also trigger cell death and cellular necrosis. Therefore, dysregulation in calcium
signaling can affect cells in different ways and to varying degrees. Consequently, calcium levels
need to be tightly controlled. Indeed, defective calcium signaling has been implicated in many
neurodegenerative diseases, muscular dystrophies and heart disease. To understand the
mechanisms regulating calcium signaling and how defects in this process can lead to cellular
dysfunction, we are exploiting the model system Caenorhabditis elegans to identify critical
processes that are involved in the regulation of calcium handling. We have recently
demonstrated that SEL-12, the C. elegans presenilin ortholog, has a role in mediating
endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Disruption of presenilin function
results in an increase in mitochondrial calcium levels and alters mitochondrial metabolism
promoting protein homeostasis collapse and neurodegeneration. Presenilin is a highly
conserved protein found from plants to humans that is extensively found on endomembrane
structures (e.g., endoplasmic reticulum and lysosome) of most cell types. However, the role
presenilin has in the endomembrane system is not clear. Importantly, mutations in human
presenilin are the most common cause of early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. Despite the
identification of the involvement of presenilin in Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the
functional consequences of mutations in presenilin causing Alzheimer's disease are not
understood. To gain further insight into the role presenilin has in mitochondrial calcium
homeostasis and neuronal fitness, we have developed a novel and highly selective RNA
interference screen to identify gene products that meditate the elevated endoplasmic reticulum
to mitochondrial calcium signaling observed in sel-12 mutants. From this screen, we have
identified several proteins known to mediate endoplasmic reticulum calcium release and
mitochondrial calcium uptake but we also identified several gene products with an
uncharacterized role in endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial calcium signaling. We propose
to utilize a multifaceted approach that combines genetic manipulation, high resolution live cell
microscopy to analyze endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial dynamics, mitochondrial
activity assays, and behavioral assays to determine the role these gene products as well as sel-
12 have in mitochondrial health and neuronal fitness."

have shown application in organic synthesis; however, it suffers from achieving product selectivity and lacks
the ability to construct stereogenic centers.
The overall goal of this project is to integrate electrochemistry and transition-metal catalysis to provide
solutions on the challenges in organic synthesis particularly in the assembly of chiral and radiolabeled drugs.
This grant builds on existing collaboration between the Minteer Lab (electrocatalysis, electroanalysis) and
the Sigman Lab (asymmetric catalysis, data science) in the development of electroactive compounds for
battery and synthesis applications. Integration of my expertise (organic chemistry, transition metal catalysis,
and organometallic chemistry) with Minteer and Sigman will bring a collective capability to accomplish the
overall goal. The central hypothesis of this application is that through the use of electrochemical energy,
non-toxic TM can be used as electrocatalysts to selectively install functional groups/atoms that are often
used as radioactive elements in PET tracers while generating a stereogenic center. Specifically, we will (Aim
1) develop cobalt electrocatalytic asymmetric reactions to convert organohalides into chiral carboxylic acids,
nitriles, and fluorinated compounds. This electrocatalytic approach will also allow us to discover new
reactions that are valuable in medical applications. Through catalyst design and electroanalysis, we will
develop (Aim 2) TM-electrocatalysts capable of activating and functionalizing inert amide bonds (most
represented polar bond in organic and biomolecules). This will provide a late-stage functionalization in
amide-containing marine products and polypeptides. Radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging require rapid
preparation and delivery to patients due to their short-lived radioactivity (t1/2 = 20.4 and 110 min for 11C and
18F radionuclide, respectively). For the first time, we will use the strategic merger of electrochemistry and
TM-catalysis to provide a new synthetic approach to deliver chiral radiopharmaceuticals (Aim 3). The
transformations in Aims 1 and 2 were carefully chosen based on their high potential to be adapted for the
assembly of radiopharmaceuticals. Overall, this project will deliver unique, organic transformations that will
directly impact the complex process of drug discovery."
10899776,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Chronic opioid usage after surgery is a major contributor to the opioid epidemic, which poses a
major crisis in public health. 51 million patients undergo surgery each year in the United States.
Between 9-13% of surgical patients continue chronic use of opioids, leading to opioid use disorder
in 8-12% of cases of chronic use. However, under half of surgical patients report adequate
postoperative pain relief, which hinders recovery, increasing mortality, and length of stay. Best
outcomes require personalization of treatment from patient to patient, accounting for the
detrimental effects of both excessive opioid administration and uncontrolled pain. However,
current clinical guidelines on pain management do not provide clear guidance on how best to
adjust courses of treatment. Moreover, assessment of pain is reliant upon patient self-report, and
is hindered when patients are sedated or have altered mental status.
This project seeks to quantitatively understand the relationships which govern the efficacy of post-
operative pain management strategies, and to characterize how different real-time physiological
measures may be used to assess pain and opioid requirements. This will be accomplished
through the analysis of a large dataset of electronic health record data from over 100,000 surgical
procedures performed at Massachusetts General Hospital, as well as intraoperative
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings for a subset of several thousand of these procedures.
Aim 1 of this project is to model analgesic response to opioids, identifying cases of excessive as
well as inadequate opioid usage. We propose to model pain evolution over time using neural
ordinary differential equation models, and to use learned dynamics to compute optimal treatment
policies. Aim 2 of this project is to identify cases where can be improved through usage of non-
opioid treatment modalities. This can also be accomplished through modeling of pain dynamics,
or through statistical analyses of the outcomes of cohorts of patients receiving different treatment
modalities. Aim 3 of this project is to compute intraoperative correlates of postoperative pain state
from EEG data. Signal processing methods as well as deep learning will be used to extract
features from EEG data related to sedation, loss of consciousness, and pain. We will also study
the relationship between intraoperative interventions and postoperative outcomes.
This project has the potential to reduce excess opioid usage and improve pain management,
improving post-surgical clinical outcomes and reducing the incidence of opioid abuse disorder.
Our results will also provide the ability to objectively assess pain and treatment requirements."

HIV cellular reservoirs, residual inflammation and immune activation persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART)
in people living with HIV (PLWH), and are a barrier to eradicating HIV and achieving cure. Therefore, we urgently
need to elucidate pathways induced by persistent HIV and the mechanisms that drive immune activation, viral
rebound and co-infection. While most studies have focused on memory CD4 T cells as latent HIV reservoirs,
growing evidence supports a role for macrophages. Proviral DNA and RNA have been detected in alveolar
macrophages (AMs) from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of PLWH, implicating AMs as potential reservoirs for
HIV. We previously reported that AMs from PLWH on ART are impaired compared to those to are HIV-uninfected,
with altered inflammatory phenotypes and high levels of oxidative stress, consistent with the higher susceptibility
to pulmonary infections like bacterial pneumonia and tuberculosis (TB) seen in PLWH on ART. However, lung
compartments from PLWH have not been well studied and AM responses to common co-infecting pathogens
such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) are poorly understood.
We hypothesize that AMs from PLWH on ART contribute to residual inflammation and immune activation in lung
compartments, serve as reservoirs for persistence of HIV DNA/RNA/proteins and mount aberrant inflammatory
responses to co-infection with respiratory pathogens. Our hypotheses are supported by published and
preliminary data from single cell transcriptomics, flow cytometry, metabolism and immunologic studies of BAL
from PLWH on ART. To test these hypotheses, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in
lung immunology/respiratory infections (Rengarajan, MPI), HIV virology/macrophage reservoirs (Baek Kim,
MPI), HIV and pulmonary medicine (Staitieh, MPI), and clinical collaborators (Marconi, Auld, Flenaugh) with
extensive experience in research bronchoscopy studies at the Ponce Center/Grady Health System, Atlanta, GA.
We will conduct human BAL studies from PLWH on ART, and immunological non-responders (INRs) who are
virologically suppressed but fail to reconstitute CD4 counts, to comprehensively investigate AMs as HIV
reservoirs. We will use cutting-edge technologies, virologic and immunologic approaches to uncover the
mechanisms driving immune dysfunction in PLWH on ART. In Aim 1 we will determine the contribution of AMs
as reservoirs for HIV persistence by defining the HIV proviral DNA, RNA and protein landscape in cellular
subpopulations from the BAL of PLWH on ART, INRs and HIV-uninfected persons. In Aim 2 we will test the
hypothesis that lung compartments of PLWH on ART show dysregulation of AM and T cell immunometabolism,
phenotype and function. In Aim 3 we will define the mechanisms that drive impaired AM and T cell responses
bacterial pathogens in ART responders and non-responders living with HIV. Together, our proposed studies will
provide unprecedented new insights into AM and HIV dynamics, identify mechanisms that drive defective AM
responses to clinically relevant pulmonary infections in PLWH, and novel targets for therapeutics."

10891200,"Project Summary: Brain MRIs are widely used in children for diagnosis and treatment monitoring. A typical
exam comprises multiple sequences with different contrast preparations, and often requires 20+ minutes to
complete. Potential motion during such lengthy acquisitions necessitates sedation or anesthesia. However,
repeated sedation or anesthesia in children increase the risk of long-term detrimental effects on cognitive
development. 40% of these pediatric scans also require gadolinium (Gd) based contrast agent (GBCA)
administration. It has been recently shown that Gd is retained in the brain and body, which may be particularly
harmful to children since their developing brains are more susceptible to heavy metal exposure, and free
lanthanides are known to be neurotoxic. Pediatric brain exams are excessively long because of inefficient use
of parallel imaging technology that only provides R=2–3-fold acceleration. Acceleration in two dimensions,
including the slice/partition axis, through controlled aliasing in parallel imaging (CAIPI) has enabled R=4–6-fold
speed-up, and has become popular in functional/diffusion imaging using simultaneous multislice (SMS)
encoding. Unfortunately, adoption of SMS in clinical sequences has been extremely slow. Acceleration via
Compressed Sensing (CS) is a promising solution, but its availability as a product solution is variable among
MR vendors, and it often comes at the cost of low-contrast image features. Deep learning (DL) has emerged
as a powerful reconstruction and image enhancement tool. Vendors’ DL solutions include denoising and super-
resolution enhancement, but these are limited to the newest software versions and host computers with GPUs.
While promising a better trade-off between image quality and scan time, they are currently implemented for a
small number of sequences on different vendors, and are therefore constrained by poor availability and
scalability. Thus, current clinical technologies have been hampered by limited availability and faster has often
meant suboptimal quality. Lastly, no vendor has DL-based solutions for Gd dose reduction for either adults or
children. Given the need for repeated injections of sedatives and GBCA in children who are scanned
periodically for treatment monitoring, there is an unmet need in imaging technology that makes these young
populations vulnerable to severe and long-term health risks. We propose data acquisition, reconstruction and
contrast enhancement strategies to address this unmet need. In Aim1, we will develop a rapid, comprehensive
brain exam by combining our advanced controlled aliasing strategy, wave-CAIPI, and extend this to SMS
encoding for rapid FLAIR/TSE imaging. Combining this with DL super-resolution reconstruction will enable
R=9-fold acceleration with high fidelity to create a 6-min protocol. In Aim2, we will develop and validate a DL-
based contrast enhancement algorithm to synthesize full dose images from 5× reduced Gd dose in pediatric
exams using our rapid protocol from Aim1. To that end, our novel technologies would speed up the clinical MR
exams and minimize both the amount of sedation and the injected contrast agents dose in children."
10892027,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Individuals of lower socioeconomic status (SES) lose only half as much weight in behavioral weight loss
interventions as those of higher SES. This is a clinically meaningful difference in outcomes that has been
consistently documented. The overarching aim of this project is to identify the mechanisms that account for
SES-related disparities in behavioral weight loss outcomes, which would enable the development of more
effective obesity treatment approaches for lower SES populations. One potential mechanism is present bias,
which is a tendency to focus on one’s immediate needs that may result from exposure to harsh and
unpredictable environments. Present bias is a compelling candidate as a mechanism of SES-related disparities
in weight loss outcomes because it is much more pronounced in lower SES populations, and it has been linked
to obesity risk, maladaptive eating behaviors, and poor diet quality. A second set of potential mechanisms
includes adverse daily experiences such as stress, cognitive demands, and exposure to tempting foods. Stress
and cognitive demands are more prevalent or severe in the lives of lower SES populations, and can disrupt the
executive functions that are important for adhering to weight control behaviors during obesity treatment.
This project will allocate equal numbers of subjects of lower and higher SES to a standard-of-care weight loss
intervention. Importantly, the SES groups will be balanced with respect to ethnic/racial minority status. Weight
loss outcomes and adherence to three key weight control behaviors (dietary lapses, dietary self-monitoring,
and physical activity) will be rigorously measured across six months of follow up. Individual differences in
present bias will be thoroughly assessed at baseline. Ecological momentary assessment will be used to
capture exposure to adverse daily experiences, as well as momentary changes in present bias. Aim 1 is to test
whether present bias accounts for SES-related disparities in behavioral weight loss outcomes and adherence
to key weight control behaviors. Aims 2a and 2b will characterize the role of adverse daily experiences in SES-
related disparities in weight loss outcomes and adherence to weight control behaviors, both overall and among
present-biased individuals in particular. Aim 3 is to explore the contribution of race to SES-related disparities in
weight loss outcomes, which has been challenging to elucidate in prior studies due to significant confounding
of race and SES at the societal level. The results of this study could lead to a new understanding of how
socioeconomic disadvantage impacts adherence to behavioral treatment for obesity, and suggest entirely new
treatment approaches focused on mitigating present bias or delivering tailored intervention content during
“moments of risk” for lapses in adherence."
10892157,"Project Summary/Abstract
 In natural vision, it is rare to encounter an isolated object presented on a blank background. Instead, natural
scenes are often complex and contain multiple entities. Image segmentation refers to the process of partitioning
visual scenes into distinct objects and surfaces, which includes segmenting a figure from the background (figure-
ground segregation) and segmenting multiple objects/surfaces from each other. Segmentation is a fundamental
function of vision and is a gateway to perception, recognition and visually guided action. However, the neural
underpinning of segmentation remains to be understood. A key question is to understand how the brain
represents multiple visual stimuli such that information regarding individual stimuli can be extracted from the
activity of populations of neurons. We address this question in the proposed project to elucidate the neural
mechanisms underlying segmentation and the principles of coding sensory information in neuronal populations.
Visual motion and depth provide potent cues for segmentation. Therefore we focus on understanding how the
brain uses motion and depth cues to achieve segmentation. We have made substantial progress in defining how
middle-temporal (MT) cortex, an area important for motion and depth processing, represents multiple overlapping
visual stimuli. We found that MT neurons show various types of response biases toward one component of
multiple stimuli, revealing a set of novel rules by which multiple stimuli interact within neurons’ receptive fields.
These physiological findings together with our preliminary data on natural scene statistics led us to hypothesize
that the visual system exploits the statistical regularities in natural scenes that differentiate figure from the
background and represents multiple visual stimuli efficiently to achieve segmentation. To test this overarching
hypothesis, we will integrate the approaches of natural scene statistics, neurophysiology, and theoretical
consideration of optimal coding. Specifically, we will characterize natural scene statistics of depth and motion
pertinent to image segmentation, elucidate the functional roles of stereoscopic depth in figure-ground
segregation, define the rules by which neurons in area MT represent multiple spatially-separated stimuli, which
are commonly encountered in natural vision, and determine the signal transformation across multiple brain areas
in the dorsal visual pathway to achieve segmentation. Finally, we will use an Information-Maximization approach
to determine whether the neural representation of multiple visual stimuli is optimal for segmentation. The
proposed study rigorously explores the interaction of multiple stimuli and is expected to provide important insight
into how the visual system solves the challenging problem of segmentation in natural vision."
10892159,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) neurons express a cell-autonomous molecular clock that
generates circadian rhythms and regulates physiological rhythms throughout the body. The molecular clock
produces a circadian pattern of neuronal activity that feeds back onto the molecular circadian clock and
strengthens its activity. Intercellular communication between SCN neurons and astrocytes further strengthens
and synchronizes these neuronal rhythms. This integrated SCN network activity is critical for generating
precise circadian timing signals, stabilizing the circadian clock, and determining an animal's behavioral
circadian phenotype. Although small in size, the SCN expresses a diverse population of neurons with unique
functional properties, spatial locations, and efferent projections that regulate different physiological and
behavioral rhythms. SCN neurons expressing vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP+) or arginine vasopressin
(AVP+) are the most extensively studied. These neurons have distinct SCN locations and unique roles in
photic entrainment, circadian timing maintenance, and different downstream circadian rhythms. The unique
functional properties of the dorsal and ventral SCN regions reflects differences in the number and the coupling
mechanisms and strength of oscillating neurons.
 Most SCN neurons utilize GABA as a neurotransmitter, and GABAergic neurotransmission in the SCN is
rhythmic at synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA receptors and shows significant regional variation. Astrocytes
regulate GABA neurotransmission by releasing transmitters that modify GABA release and expressing GABA
transporters that control the extrasynaptic GABA concentration. Multiple small-molecule transmitters and
neuromodulators regulate GABA neurotransmission, but the cellular mechanisms of this regulation are poorly
understood. GABA refines the action potential firing pattern, a critical component in refining the SCN circadian
clock output. A complete understanding of how the SCN network generates circadian timing signals requires
more detailed knowledge of the signaling pathways that mediate communication between SCN neurons and
astrocytes and a deeper understanding of how these signaling pathways differ in different parts of the SCN.
Our research's long-term goal is to identify the signaling pathways by which neurons and astrocytes
communicate to generate and entrain circadian rhythms. Our short-term goal is to determine the mechanisms
mediating GABA neurotransmission and regulating the coupling strength between individual SCN neuronal
oscillators and SCN regions. The Specific Aims of the application are: 1) Investigate the different roles of
synaptic and tonic GABA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in regulating the activity of SCN. 2) Investigate
the mechanisms regulating GABA transporter activity in astrocytes and whether GABA released from
astrocytes contributes to the tonic GABA current. 3) Examine the role of glutamate released from astrocytes in
regulating GABA synaptic and tonic GABA currents and the activity of AVP+ and VIP+ neurons in the SCN."
10892184,"Project Summary
Survival is contingent upon physiologically and behaviorally adapting to a changing nutritional environment,
and in mammals this homeostasis is largely mediated by nutritional hormones acting in the brain. Recent
decades have seen substantial progress in our understanding of the neural mechanisms mediating energy
intake and total food intake, but how animals sense individual macronutrients and self-select between them
remains poorly defined. Our lab has recently discovered that the liver-derived hormone FGF21 acts in the brain
as a signal of protein status. While normal mice adaptively ‘sense’ protein restriction and alter food intake in
order to specifically seek and consume protein, this response is lost in mice lacking FGF21 or brain FGF21
signaling. The project will define the brain areas and neural phenotypes mediating FGF21-dependent changes
in feeding behavior, and in doing so will provide the first insight into the neurobiology governing macronutrient
choice. Despite the importance of dietary composition and food choice to health, and despite persistent dietary
advice to change eating habits, we know almost nothing about how the brain controls dietary macronutrient
choice. Thus the work proposed in this application will substantially impact the field by rigorously probing the
novel mechanisms controlling feeding behavior."

Immune checkpoint therapies block inhibitory receptors on T cells to augment anti-tumor immune responses.
The Programmed cell Death-1 (PD-1) pathway is a critical inhibitory checkpoint for T cells, and antibodies
blocking PD-1 promote immune-mediated identification and clearance of malignant cells. Cancer
immunotherapies, including anti-PD-1 antibodies, represent a powerful therapeutic paradigm because they are
applicable to a wide variety of tumors and can produce durable clinical responses. Unfortunately, only a
fraction of patients demonstrates clinical benefit from current agents. As such, there is an urgent need to
develop therapeutics that more effectively target PD-1 signaling as well as other checkpoint inhibitors. We
have employed phosphoproteomic protocol to identify proteins that regulate downstream signaling of PD-1.
With this approach, we identified the protein PAG as an effector of PD-1 immune checkpoint signaling. We
have discovered that PAG is required for PD-1 signaling and inhibition of T cell function and our preliminary
genetic and biochemical studies confirm PAG as a target for reversing T cell inhibition. The immediate goal of
this proposal is to validate PAG as checkpoint inhibitor candidate. Our long-term goal is to translate our
findings and to generate novel immunotherapies for patients with malignancies. We will accomplish these
goals with the following aims: Aim 1. Define the mechanism by which PD-1 induces PAG phosphorylation to
promote immune checkpoint activation. Using high resolution microscopy, we will determine how PD-1 and
PAG cluster at the immunological synapse. Using mutagenesis, we will define the requirement for specific
tyrosine within the cytoplasmic region of PAG for PD-1 function and immune synapse clustering. Aim 2. To
assess PAG-mediated immune inhibitory potential, in vivo. We will assess tumor growth in syngeneic models
using PAG knockout mice. Aim 3. To develop anti-PAG functional antibodies. We will develop strategies to
target PAG in vivo. Together, these studies will uncover the mechanism by which PAG mediates inhibitory
signals in T cells and its value as a novel target for immune checkpoint blockade."
10904766,"Meiosis is precisely regulated to ensure the transmission of half the genome into gametes. During meiosis, germ cells 
undergo one round of DNA replication followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation. In mammalian females, 
meiosis is an error-prone process, resulting in a high fraction of eggs with missing or extra chromosomes or that are 
not competent for fertilization. These errors can cause severe consequences including miscarriage, trisomy conditions, 
infertility, germ cell tumor formation, and ovarian germ cell cancer. Therefore, determining the molecular 
mechanisms underlying meiotic regulation is critically important for understanding the etiology of these disorders. 
The objective of this proposal is to investigate how meiosis II is controlled to ensure an egg competent for fertilization 
and to understand how errors in meiosis II regulation result in uncontrolled cell proliferation and the formation of 
germ cell tumors. These studies employ the use of mouse as a mammalian model system to use the tools available to 
address mechanistic questions. Female mice are used to study the oogenesis-specific question of how eggs arrest in 
meiosis II to await fertilization from sperm before completing the second meiotic division. The rationale for the 
proposed research is that the questions were chosen to focus on the understudied and poorly understood process of 
meiosis II regulation, which is important to ensure competent eggs and to prevent germ cell tumor formation. These 
findings are likely to be highly conserved in mammals, such that the results from mouse oogenesis will uncover 
general mechanisms of meiotic regulation during human oogenesis. The experiments are guided by the following 
specific aims proposed: 1) Determine how CDK-cyclin B1 activity is regulated for meiosis II and meiosis II arrest; 
and, 2) Investigate how mos-/- mutant eggs undergo inappropriate cell divisions and identify other meiotic regulators 
whose loss could cause ovarian germ cell tumors. For Aim 1, novel hypotheses are tested that address how protein 
translation and degradation are regulated during meiosis II and how RNA-binding proteins release mRNAs with 
appropriate timings. In Aim 2, the results will reveal how meiosis is mis-regulated when the MOS/MAPK signaling 
pathway is disrupted. Finally, new meiosis II regulators will be discovered. The innovative approaches of combining 
the latest imaging and genomics technologies with the power of in vitro oocyte maturation will allow the discovery of 
new mechanisms of meiotic regulation. The proposed research is significant because the results will reveal general 
principles of meiotic regulation and will identify new targets for germ cell cancer prevention."

therapeutics with novel mechanisms of action. The Conte Center for Neuroimmune Studies was
created to build on our discovery that the biology underlying the most significant schizophrenia
common genetic risk variants involves neuroimmune mechanisms of synaptic pruning. We have
found that risk variants of the complement component C4 genes are correlated with increased
C4A expression in the brain and CSF, and that overexpression of human C4A in a mouse model
results in excess synaptic pruning and social behavioral deficits. We have further shown that
additional neuroimmune molecules encoded at schizophrenia risk loci, CD47 and CSMD1,
influence synaptic pruning and complement activity. Lastly, schizophrenia is unusual among
neurodevelopmental disorders in its late-adolescent/early-adult onset, and childhood adversity is
a major non-genetic risk factor for schizophrenia; yet the biological underpinnings of adolescent
psychiatric vulnerability are wholly unknown. We have identified a critical period of circuit
refinement in the mouse frontal cortex that we propose can be exploited to better understand the
unique vulnerability of adolescent brain development to psychiatric risk factors.
 The goals of the Center in our next five years are to both deepen the focus on C4-mediated
synaptic pruning as a pathophysiological mechanism, and expand the scope of our investigations
to create a fuller picture of neuroimmune pathways, their upstream regulators, their cellular
effectors, and their downstream circuit-level and behavioral impacts. Project 1 will investigate the
role of astrocytes, the main source of C4 in the brain, by manipulating schizophrenia risk genes
in these cells and assaying the impacts on synapse formation and function. Project 2 will spatially
map the brain’s transcriptional response to C4 overexpression, and test the therapeutic
hypothesis that inhibition of C4 activity may rescue over-pruning and associated behavioral
phenotypes. Project 3 will examine the circuit specificity of the adolescent critical period, the
impacts of gene-by-environment risk factor interactions, and the roles of the brain borders. Project
4 will explore circuit-level interactions between the basal ganglia and frontal cortex in the context
of adolescent development, psychiatric risk factors, and risk/reward decision-making. We will also
lay the groundwork for expanding neuroimmune studies of psychiatric risk to a non-human
primate model, the marmoset. Finally, our Administrative Core will facilitate interdisciplinary
collaboration that exploits the full range of expertise across the four labs, and coordinate outward-
facing activities including the annual research symposium."

Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly critical threat to human and animal health. In the US
alone, >23,000 individuals die each year because of infections with antimicrobial resistant
organisms. A common source of resistant bacterial pathogen exposure is food, in particular fresh
retail meat products. Most foodborne bacterial pathogens present in retail meat products also
colonize the gastrointestinal tract of food animals during production. Contamination of meat
products occurs during the slaughter process when GI contents, including fecal bacteria,
contaminate the carcass. Despite improved food safety, the burden of foodborne illness has
remained relatively unchanged for the past decade, affecting 1 in 6 individuals in the US annually.
To help address this important public health problem, we propose to accomplish the following
specific aims: 1) Contribute to national surveillance of foodborne pathogens and indicator
bacteria as part of the NARMS retail food surveillance program, 2) Support outbreak
investigations of foodborne disease by providing field epidemiology and laboratory support to
other agencies in Ohio, and 3) Conduct field research to understand the reservoirs for zoonotic
foodborne transmission, and the molecular epidemiology of antimicrobial resistant pathogens
and indicator bacteria in fresh retail meat products.
To accomplish these specific aims, we will serve as a NARMS retail meat and seafood surveillance
project contributing laboratory. As a large cluster surveillance site, we will sample retail poultry,
beef, pork, and seafood from retail stores within both metropolitan and rural Ohio. Forty-eight
monthly samples will be cultured for specific pathogens and indicator bacteria. The resulting
isolates will be further characterized and shipped monthly to FDA for antimicrobial susceptibility
testing, with duplicate isolates maintained in our culture collection. We expect to successfully
sample 528 packages of retail beef, pork, poultry, and seafood annually that will help to track the
current state of antimicrobial resistance among foodborne pathogens and indicator bacteria
found in retail meat and seafood but will also impact future FDA policy and regulations and
monitor the success of actions and interventions. In addition to our contributions to the retail
food surveillance program, as a NARMS participating laboratory we will be available to support
foodborne disease outbreak investigations in Ohio and nearby states as needed."

Early toxic stress can lead to enduring long-term effects on neurodevelopment and behavioral
outcomes in children. One mechanism that may mediate these associations is the gut
microbiome. There is robust evidence that patterns of gut microbiota may influence
neurodevelopment and anxiety-related behaviors in rodents, but there is sparse literature on this
association in humans. Recent findings from our research team are the first to reveal that the
gut microbiome significantly predicts fear behavior in 1-year-old children. Thus, the proposed
study will examine the influence of psychosocial stress on the development of gut microbiota,
mediated by chronic HPA axis activation, as well as the bidirectional relationship between the
developing microbiome and behavioral inhibition across the first four years of life. We will
measure alterations in brain development across this time as a mediator of the relationship
between the microbiome and behavioral inhibition. During this sensitive period the microbiome
and brain are rapidly developing and may be most susceptible to environmental input.
Participants (n = 200) will be drawn from a prospective longitudinal cohort study funded by NICHD
(Brain and Early Experience Study (BEE); R01 HD091148-01A1). Assessments will be conducted
during lab visits at 36 and 54 months and home visits at 6 and 24 months of age. Psychosocial
stress will be assessed via observational assessments of negative parenting behavior and
household chaos at 6 and 24 months, and HPA axis activation will be measured via hair cortisol
at these visits. At all ages, fecal samples will be collected to assess microbial diversity and
maturity and behavioral inhibition will be assessed via maternal report and observational
measurement. Neuroimaging using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor
imaging, and resting state fMRI will provide measures of volumetric growth of the mPFC and
hippocampus from 15 months to 54 months, and structural and functional connectivity between
the amygdala and mPFC. Finally, at 54 mos a brief structured diagnostic interview for major
pediatric psychiatric disorders will be conducted (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview).
This study will be the first to investigate the influence of early psychosocial stress on the gut
microbiome, neurodevelopment and anxiety related behavior. Our long-term goal is to
determine how colonization of the gut microbiome impacts human brain development and later
risk for psychopathology in order to prevent the onset of psychiatric illness or reduce its
severity. Findings from this study, during a sensitive period of early childhood, will provide
important information that could inform intervention and prevention efforts soon after birth."
10878501,"Project Summary/Abstract:
The cycle of the seminiferous epithelium is a characteristic of spermatogenesis in mammals. The cycle serves
to distribute the developmental stages of spermatogenesis in constant periodic intervals along the seminiferous
tubules. The function of the cycle is to assure a constant source of spermatozoa over the relatively extended
developmental time period. We have previously shown in the mouse testis that the cycle is initiated by pulses
of retinoic acid (RA) originally generated by the Sertoli cells at stages VIII and IX of the cycle. The pulse of RA
forces the undifferentiated spermatogonia to irreversibly enter the differentiation pathway. At stages VIII and
IX we have shown in the adult mouse that the Sertoli cells demonstrate an increased abundance of hundreds
of transcripts that allow for multiple functions such as RA synthesis, junction formation, uptake of residual
bodies, spermiation, and others. In the absence of germ cells there are no cyclic activities of Sertoli cells
detectable along the tubules, thus, accentuating the requirement for interactions between Sertoli and germ
cells for normal spermatogenesis. We propose to examine the influence of spermatogonia at stages VIII and
IX on the transcriptome of Sertoli cells and their functions during the development of complete
spermatogenesis. We propose that this influence on the transcriptome and on the generation of the RA pulse
is partially or wholly a result of Sertoli-germ cell interactions through the Notch signaling pathway. We will test
this hypothesis by examining the influence of germ cells with Notch ligand gene deletions on the transcriptome
and RA biosynthesis in normally developing Sertoli cells and in Sertoli cells with Notch receptor deletions. We
will utilize a new technology designated capped small RNAseq or nTIseq to obtain information on active
promoters and transcriptional start sites in the presence and absence of an intact Notch signaling pathway.
We will pay special attention to transcripts regulating RA biosynthesis such as RDH10. The results of this
study will clarify the interactive roles of germ and somatic cells in spermatogenesis and possibly implicate the
Notch pathway in the etiology of male infertility."
10874659,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our long-term goal is to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying PI5P4K-driven growth and to elucidate
how their dysregulation contributes to breast tumorigenesis. In this proposal, we will set out to provide a
comprehensive understanding of a new signaling network that is critical to integrate metabolic information and
determine how the related proteins and pathways interact to maintain cellular homeostasis.
Phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinases (PI5P4Ks) are a family of non-canonical phosphoinositide kinases
which we have shown to be critical for preserving nutrient availability and fuel growth yet how they are regulated
themselves is largely unknown. Using a comprehensive in vitro kinase screen, we have discovered the core
kinases of the Hippo pathway, MST1 and MST2 as direct negative regulators of the PI5P4Ks as well as the lipid
substrate of the PI5P4Ks, PI-5-P to interact with the Hippo adaptor protein MOB1 which in turn effects the activity
of the Hippo downstream effector YAP. The Hippo pathway is known to be important for development, growth
and organogenesis, and dysregulation of this pathway leads to tumor progression.
While PI5P4Ks have been linked to tumor growth, exactly how the PI5P4Ks are regulated is poorly understood.
Furthermore, how the PI5P4Ks actually command cell growth under both physiological conditions and
pathological contexts such as breast cancer is incomplete. To answer these important questions, we will perform
the following Aims:
In Aim 1 we will use very feasible biophysical and structural biology to determine atomic-resolution details of the
interface between PI-5-P and MOB1 and quantitate how PI-5-P regulates MOB1 binding to other Hippo pathway
components in vitro.
In Aim 2 we will investigate how the activity of the PI5P4Ks control the activation of the MOB-LATS complex
downstream of MST1/2, exploring one potential mechanism for PI5P4K tumorigenic properties.
In Aim 3 we will establish the biological significance of the PI5P4K-Hippo axis in breast cancer using a panel of
TNBC cell lines, novel mouse breast tumor models, and patient breast tumor samples.
This project seeks to combine quantitative structural biology with molecular cell genetics to decipher how PI-5-
P regulates the Hippo pathway for breast cancer cell growth. Given that PI5P4Ks are exciting ‘druggable’ targets
for breast cancer, characterizing how PI5P4Ks connect to the Hippo pathway reveals a possible strategy for
future anti-cancer therapies."
10874661,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The capability to precisely control behaviors of biomolecules in living cells is a challenging task. Current methods
can be classified into chemical-based and laser-based approaches. For example, small molecule inhibitors or
activators can be introduced into the biological system for manipulating enzyme activities. However, it is
impossible to control the interaction locations with high precision, which poses off-target effects. Protein control
using genetic methods such as gene silencing or editing might selectively impact a targeted protein, but requires
transfection and incubation, and cannot be performed in real-time. Optical techniques such as optical tweezers
can manipulate small targets at the laser focus, but can only interact with a few targets at a time. Current laser
manipulation and ablation methods usually require a pre-acquired image together with a manual selection of
target locations on samples. This method is not only time-consuming but also unsuitable to apply to highly
dynamic living biological samples. Optogenetic methods can control neuron functions using light radiation and
light-sensitive ion channels, but only at the single-cell level. There’s no existing technology that can select
molecular targets in cells and control only these targets at sub-micron resolution in real-time.
In this application, we develop a real-time precision opto-control (RPOC) platform that can selectively and
precisely control biomolecules only at the desired interaction site using lasers. RPOC is based on a high-speed
laser scanning system. First, during the laser scanning, an optical signal is generated at a specific pixel from the
target molecule. Then, this optical signal will be compared with a preset threshold and to send out an electronic
signal to control an acousto-optic modulator which is used as a fast switch to couple another laser beam to
interact with the same pixel. The optical signal detection, processing, and laser control happen within 20 ns,
much faster than the pixel dwell time. Digital logic circuits will also be designed with the comparator circuits to
control the interaction laser beam based on the logic output from multiple signal channels. We will use photo-
switchable proteins and design photo-convertible inhibitors and activators to demonstrate precision control of
enzyme activities on site. Furthermore, we will use multiple continuous-wave lasers and acousto-optic tunable
filters to design a portable and multicolor RPOC that can operate outside an optical lab. RPOC can accurately
control and manipulate biomolecules in real-time without affecting other biomolecules in the system. It is highly
chemical selective since the optical signal can be selected from fluorescence, Raman, or absorption signals. It
will allow biologists to control and interrogate only the biomolecules of interest during laser scanning without
affecting other parts of the sample with sub-micron precision. RPOC would be widely applied to study enzyme
activities in cells, understand organelle interactions, improve controlled-release of drugs, and perform precision
neuromodulation."
10874769,"More than 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD); this
number is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. Racial and ethnic minorities disproportionality suffer.
Minority Persons With Dementia (PWD), particularly community-dwelling, lack high quality continuous primary
care and have poor outcomes such as high rates of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) use.
Policymakers caution that health disparities will widen as we face a shortage of primary care physicians. Nurse
practitioners (NPs), the fastest growing primary care workforce, could mitigate these challenges. NPs
disproportionality deliver care to minorities and practice in underserved areas where many minorities live. Yet
little is known about how to optimize primary care practices employing NPs, which often lack the organizational
and structural attributes needed to ensure continuity of care and better outcomes for minority PWD. Little is
also known about how to enhance community resources to eliminate health disparities for PWD. Our mixed-
method national study will fill this gap. We will achieve three specific aims: Aim 1. Assess the effect of NP
practice attributes (i.e., care environment and structural capabilities) on racial and ethnic disparities in ED visits
and hospitalizations among PWD and the extent to which the effect is mediated by continuity of care. Aim 2.
Assess the effect of community socioeconomic factors and primary care availability on disparities in ED visits
and hospitalizations among PWD. Aim 3. Identify practice and community barriers and facilitators of caring for
PWD in high- and low-performing NP practices. We will use data on community-dwelling Medicare beneficiary
PWD cared for by NPs in 2017-2018 and will collect survey data from NPs (n= 4,414) about care environments
and structural capabilities using both mail and online survey methods. All data about patients, NPs, practices,
and communities will be merged and analyzed in multilevel models. We will also identify practices with low
rates of hospitalizations and ED visits (i.e., high-performing practices) and high rates for hospitalizations and
ED visits (i.e., low-performing practices) among PWD and collect qualitative interview data from NPs using a
positive deviance approach. We will conduct individual telephone or online interviews with ~40 NPs from high-
performing and ~20 NPs from low-performing practices. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed. Data will
undergo content analysis. Quantitative and qualitative findings will be triangulated to inform administrators and
policymakers seeking ways to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in acute care use among PWD through
practice, policy, and community interventions. We will identify modifiable factors of high-performing practices
that could be introduced in low-performing practices to enhance care to PWD and practices and communities
that can most benefit from such interventions and future investments. This innovative study has the potential to
make clinical and policy contributions by promoting continuous primary care to millions of minority community-
dwelling PWD and is in response to High-Priority Research Topic NOT-AG-18-056 and NOT-MD-19-016."

Lung transplantation (LTx) is a therapeutic option for patients with advanced lung diseases. Long‐term survival
after LTx is, however, limited by chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD). CLAD most commonly manifests
itself as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and about 50% of recipients (LTxRs) will develop BOS within
5 years post-LTx. Epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and fibrosis have been implicated in the
pathogenesis of BOS. We demonstrated that liver kinase 1 (LKB1), a tumor suppressor gene, is
downregulated in BOS but not in stable biopsies using both western blotting and aldehyde bead conjugated
exosomes by flow cytometry. We also demonstrated that LKB1 knockdown induces exosome release from
airway epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, and another human airway epithelial cell line, HPBEC. Exosomes released
from LTxRs with BOS also induces EMT which was regulated by LKB1 in BEAS-2B and HPBEC. NanoString
analyses identified LKB1 knockdown induced PDGFRβ expression in human airway epithelial cells. We also
demonstrated that biopsies from BOS LTxRs had reduced LKB1 and increased PDGFβR with inverse
correlation. These novel findings indicate an important role for the tumor suppressor gene LKB1 in the
regulation of PDGFβR and, therefore, fibrosis development. Studies proposed using both clinical samples and
in vitro cell culture model, we will define the mechanism by which exosomes with downregulated LKB1
released from transplanted lungs mediate EMT leading to CLAD. Aim 1 of the proposal is to determine serially
whether inactivation of LKB1 in exosomes isolated from plasma from LTxRs with known risk factors (primary
graft dysfunction [PGD]), acute rejection [AR] and respiratory viral infections [RVI]) can be useful as a non-
invasive biomarker for LTxRs at risk for CLAD. Our hypothesis is that persistent downregulation of LKB1 in
exosomes will be a biomarker for LTxRs at risk for developing CLAD. The second goal is to determine and
quantitate exosomes with LKB1/AMPK1 using serial retrospectively stored plasma from LTxRs with known
clinical diagnosis will be a more sensitive marker for CLAD and to determine its potential to differentiate
restrictive allograft syndrome and BOS by defining their immunological and molecular properties. Our third goal
is to define the mechanisms by which loss of LKB1 results in EMT and upregulation of PDGFRβ and promotes
the pathogenesis of CLAD. Towards this; a) we will define the regulatory mechanisms suppressing LKB1 in
LTxRs with PGD, AR and RVI, risk factors for CLAD, and b) we will determine the mechanisms by which LKB1
downregulation leads to upregulation of PDGFRβ and its signaling pathways which contributes towards
development of fibrosis. Results from these studies will provide novel information for the role of LKB1, in EMT
and fibrosis related pathologies including CLAD following LTx."
10874776,"Project Summary
Clinical testing for peripheral auditory dysfunction focuses on the audiogram. However, many auditory perceptual
deficits, such as tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty with speech perception, cannot be fully explained by the
audiogram. Cochlear deafferentation (i.e., loss of inner hair cells, spiral ganglion cells, or cochlear synapses),
may contribute to these perceptual problems. However, there is currently no method for diagnosing
deafferentation in living humans. This prevents us from determining the prevalence of deafferentation in humans,
identifying deafferentation risk factors and perceptual consequences, or testing potential drug treatments.
Several non-invasive physiological measures are sensitive to loss of cochlear synapses (a form of
deafferentation) in animal models, including the auditory brainstem response (ABR), the envelope following
response (EFR), and the middle ear muscle reflex (MEMR). However, it is unclear how cochlear gain loss (e.g.,
due to outer hair cell damage) impacts the relationship between deafferentation and these physiological
measures, hindering translation to a diagnostic test for deafferentation. The overall objective of this proposal is
to develop a computational model that can estimate deafferentation from non-invasive physiological
measurements in humans with varying degrees of cochlear gain loss. The central hypothesis is that cochlear
gain loss can be predicted from distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) and deafferentation can be
predicted from a combination of ABR, EFR, and MEMR measurements. This hypothesis will be tested by
pursuing four specific aims: 1) Expand a computational model of the auditory periphery (CMAP) to predict ABR,
EFR, MEMR, and DPOAE responses in mice and humans based on both cochlear gain and afferent function, 2)
Validate and refine the CMAP by collecting physiological and histological data from mouse, 3) Predict
deafferentation in individual human subjects from physiological measurements by fitting the CMAP using
Bayesian regression, and 4) Evaluate deafferentation predictions for their relationship with risk factors and
predicted perceptual consequences of deafferentation. This approach is innovative because it extends prior work
to animal and human models with both cochlear gain loss and deafferentation, uses computational modeling to
bridge the gap between model systems, and combines multiple physiological measurements to predict
deafferentation in individual human subjects. The proposed research is significant because we currently have
no means of diagnosing deafferentation. Thus, the prevalence, associated risk factors, and perceptual impacts
of this condition are unclear. This project is expected to result in a biomarker of deafferentation for individual
patients that is based on their physiological measurements. This will enable us to identify peripheral auditory
damage that is independent of cochlear gain loss. If the biomarker is correlated with risk factors such as noise
exposure and auditory perceptual deficits such as speech perception difficulty, it will allow for the development
of targeted treatments for auditory perceptual deficits and strategies for damage prevention."
10874779,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adverse auditory environments in indoor spaces present constant challenges to children during everyday
learning and social interactions. Spatial hearing provides access to auditory cues that promote auditory and
speech perception in these difficult listening situations. However, auditory spatial cues are distorted in most
indoor spaces due to reverberation—the excessive sound energy reflected from room surfaces arriving at the
listener shortly after the initial sound directly from the source. The perceptual consequences of reverberation on
spatial hearing have not been characterized in children with normal hearing, leaving a critical gap in our
knowledge of benchmark abilities to assess hearing device fitting outcomes for children with hearing loss during
real-world listening.
In the proposed work, our goal is to reveal the developmental trajectories of functional spatial hearing abilities
under realistic reverberation between 6- to 18-year-old children. This age range reflects the protracted
development of perceptual abilities, which underlies a multitude of immaturities in children’s processing of
auditory information particularly in difficult listening situations. This work takes an innovative and unprecedented
approach to study the impact of reverberation in auditory virtual reality, in which realistic auditory environments
mimicking children’s learning environments are simulated to maximize ecological validity.
Across the specific aims, we examine three aspects of functional spatial hearing abilities under virtual
reverberant environments that vary in interaural coherence—a metric that describes reverberation severity. In
Aim 1, we will investigate developmental changes in apparent source width—a measure of perceived auditory
object size that is critical for auditory scene analysis. In Aim 2, we will investigate the development of minimum
audible angle, the smallest detectable angular separation between two sounds—a well-tested metric for auditory
spatial acuity. In Aim 3, we will investigate developmental changes in minimum angular separation—a novel
measure of spatial unmasking based on the smallest spatial separation required to receive a target speech
benefit in competing babbles. By correlating the three outcome measures from the independent aims, we will
assess the inter-relationships between auditory object perception, spatial acuity, and spatial unmasking in
reverberant environments among school-aged children.
Findings from the proposed work will (i) establish our understanding of typical developmental trajectories of
functional spatial hearing in realistic reverberant environments, and (ii) elucidate the role of auditory object
perception in spatial acuity and subsequently spatial unmasking in children. Together, this work will provide
intervention benchmark to assess fitting outcomes for children with hearing loss, and will generate substantial
feasibility and pilot data for a planned R01 to develop fitting strategies for children with hearing devices."
10874784,"Pharmacies are nationally emerging as frontline public health practicing spaces due to their ubiquity, accessibility
to medication and screening, and rapid scalability. Independent pharmacies, in particular, have successfully
expanded services with greater ease due to the absence of corporate restrictions, including delivery of harm
reduction services. Today, linkage to and retention in buprenorphine treatment and HIV prevention and care
remains suboptimal in many underserved, HIV burdened communities. The goal of this application is to further
expand public health pharmacy practice by exploring on-demand harm reduction services delivered by
pharmacy staff in two communities experiencing healthcare system and local community-based services
disruptions during COVID-19 (i.e., Harlem and South Bronx in New York City). Building upon two decades of
disparities-focused pharmacy-based intervention research via Pharm-Link Studies (2001-2021), and due to
recent innovations including telemedicine-based buprenorphine treatment, our team leveraged the NYC
Health+Hospitals Virtual Buprenorphine Clinic (VBC) to investigate Pharm-Link/VBC+ which entails in-
pharmacy delivery of opioid use disorder (OUD) services (i.e., low-threshold access to telemedicine-based
buprenorphine treatment initiation, naloxone dispensation/overdose prevention counseling) linked with HIV
services access (i.e., HIV testing/ counseling, PrEP/PEP dispensation, HIV treatment re/initiation) for
community/hospital EHR-recruited PWUO. Pharm-Link/VBC+ will also include public health-minded pharmacy
staff trained in harm-reduction and social determinants of health-focused patient navigation (SDH-PN) based on
use of a SDH checklist and fostered partnerships between pharmacy and community-based services staff. In
brief, the specific aims for this developmental R34 proposal are to: (Aim 1) Develop Pharm-Link/VBC+ using in-
depth interviews among 3 stakeholder groups (n=10 per group): frontline providers (pharmacists/ technicians/
clerks, buprenorphine prescribers, HIV providers, community-based organization providers), administrators
(pharmacy administrators, health department officials), and PWUO with OUD treatment history; (Aim 2) Assess
feasibility and usability of implementing Pharm-Link/VBC+ using (a) semi-structured surveys (baseline, 6-, and
12-weeks) among PWUO (n=30) across 3 sequential waves (n=10 per 12-week wave); and (b) administrative
data collected from the study pharmacies and Bellevue Hospital EHR; and (Aim 3) Finalize Pharm-Link/VBC+
for R01 scale-up using focus groups (n=3; 6-8/group) among same 3 stakeholder groups, utilizing findings from
Aim 2; and conducted and analyzed sequentially such that each group informs the next. These Aims will be
accomplished through existing partnerships with two Black-owned independent pharmacies with demonstrated
research capacity. Bolstering multi-sectoral approaches to OUD/HIV services infrastructure in low-income Black
and Latinx communities experiencing escalating rates of opioid overdose deaths and high HIV burden aligns
with federal guidelines to reduce health inequities among PWUO."

The transition from pediatric to adult care is an exceptionally precarious time in adolescent HIV care. Yet, little
is known about which interventions might be most effective in supporting adolescents through this period. We
will build on our well-established community-health platform and existing intervention research with adolescents
living in Lima, Peru, to provide critical data on the effectiveness, cost, and implementation of a promising
community-based differentiated care intervention that supports adolescents as they transition to adult HIV care.
Our recent pilot study among a diverse group of 30 adolescents in Peru, the first of its kind in Latin America,
demonstrated broadscale acceptability and convincing evidence of effectiveness with regard to outcomes of
adherence, social support, self-efficacy and transition readiness. The intervention consists of stabilization of
acute needs (e.g., housing instability or homelessness); health systems navigation to overcome administrative
barriers to care (i.e., insurance changes, health center transfers); accompaniment to appointments in the adult
clinic; social support groups; education and skills-building sessions; and mental health screening and referrals.
The intensity of support and duration of the intervention (6 months or 12 months) will be differentiated based on
patient-level factors such as adherence, viral load suppression, presence of familial support, and transition
readiness.
We will conduct a two-arm randomized clinical trial to determine the short- and long-term (i.e., post-intervention)
efficacy of the intervention with regard to retention with viral load suppression as well as other indicators of well-
being. We will compare the cumulative incidence of unsuccessful transition at 12- and 24-months, and stratify
findings by the differentiated care pathway (i.e., the intensity of the intervention received). We will estimate the
cost and cost-effectiveness of the study intervention in terms of cost per additional successful transition
achieved. And, we will provide data on implementation considerations essential for uptake, sustainability, and
successful adoption by the public sector. These include the reach of the intervention and the effectiveness and
relative importance of each intervention component over the short and long-term. In pursuing these aims we will
address a critical disparity of information with regard to interventions for adolescents living with HIV in the Latin
American context."
10874550,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Changes in dietary behavior and weight loss have been linked to malnutrition and to the onset of dementia;
however, current assessment tools are not designed to detect subtle prodromal changes in behavior that can
occur up to six years prior to symptom onset. With an estimated global burden of 107 million dementia cases
by 2050, there is a critical need for objective assessment tools to identify changes in food-related behavior and
associated function that could be predictive of Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders (ADRD). The overall
goal of this project is to address this critical need through the proposed research and mentored training of the
applicant. The Life Laboratory Assessment Platform (Life Lab) is a paradigm shift towards studying the behav-
iors and patterns of change among individuals using in-home, unobtrusive, objective, and ecologically-valid
measurements in real time (pervasive computing, sensors, and other technologies). The platform is part of the
Oregon Center for Aging and Technology under the direction of Dr. Kaye (proposed primary mentor) who is
currently deploying the platform in homes of older adults, a portion of whom have mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) and early-stage dementia. The proposed research takes the Life Lab into a novel research space by col-
lecting objective measures of dietary behavior. The scientific goals of this proposal are to identify feasible digi-
tal measures of longitudinal dietary behavior, compare automated, home-based system outcome measures to
current conventional outcome measures, and detect composite objective functional outcome metrics and ob-
jective behavioral-functional signatures of malnourished patients. Intensive longitudinal data (daily, weekly and
quarterly assessments for up to 18 months) from 80 participants (mild cognitive impairment, early AD, and age-
matched peers) currently enrolled in Life Lab projects will be used to characterize longitudinal body mass fluc-
tuations, and identify viable digital measures of food seeking behavior and sustained dietary supplement intake
providing a baseline of activities and behaviors to contrast for future trials. The applicant will gain a new set of
skills in order to conduct the proposed study and prepare for an independent research career by training in (1)
clinical geriatrics, gerontology and aging biology, (2) design and statistical analysis of data-rich research ap-
proaches using digital technology, and (3) acquiring nutrition data from older adults using technology. The pro-
posed team of mentors each provide expertise in one or more of these areas and are committed to collabora-
tively facilitating the applicant’s training. The detailed training plan contains multi-modal learning (e.g. formal
coursework, seminars, and workshops; application-based training; and national and international scientific
meetings). The applicant will apply these new skills to the proposed research project and obtain R01/R61 sup-
port to conduct longitudinal studies using digital biomarkers to identify prodromal changes in dietary behavior
and to develop effective single and multi-domain lifestyle and non-pharmaceutical interventions for maintaining
functional independence and improving cognition in older adults with or at risk for ADRD."
10874663,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor and non-motor
symptoms. The hallmark pathology of PD in the brain is the presence of alpha-synuclein (α-syn) aggregates,
along with the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The brain α-syn pathology is thought to
start in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, since both GI dysfunction and the presence of α-syn aggregates in the GI
tract usually precede motor symptoms by many years. In addition, experimental models show that α-syn
aggregates can reach the brain from the gut via the vagal nerve. To understand GI tract contributions to PD,
we performed a study that identified the human appendix as a key GI tissue that impacts the risk for PD. This
study demonstrated that α-syn aggregates are abundant in the appendix and that removal of the appendix was
associated with a reduced risk of PD. It also showed that the appendix contains aberrant truncated forms of α-syn, analogous to those in the PD brain, and that these were more abundant in the appendix of PD patients
than in healthy individuals. This innovative work provides the basis for a unique opportunity to understand how
the appendix contributes to PD.
The proposed study will determine how the appendix, and the α-syn aggregates within, can impact the
development of PD. Specifically, this project aims to establish: 1) what gene regulatory changes are prominent
in the PD appendix compared to that of healthy controls; 2) the specific truncated forms of α-syn enriched in
the PD appendix and their capacity to seed further aggregation; 3) the consequences of initiating α-syn
pathology in the appendix on the subsequent development of PD-like pathology in the brain, in vivo. This study
will generate detailed genome-wide maps of epigenetic abnormalities in the PD appendix – a resource for
understanding gene regulatory and biological pathway changes in the PD GI tract. Profiling the epigenetic
mark DNA methylation will be accompanied by an integrative network analysis with transcriptomic data to
determine key genes dysregulated in the PD appendix. Next, the identification of the truncated α-syn
proteoforms elevated in the PD appendix, will be carried out using top-down mass spectrometry, the gold-standard for intact protein identification. Furthermore, seeding activity for pathogenic α-syn in the appendix of
PD cases, will be determined and compared to controls, using powerful biochemical assays. Finally, the
capacity for α-syn pathology triggered in the mouse cecal patch – aka the appendix – to lead to the
development of PD-like neuropathology in the brain, will be determined. We will also determine if intestinal
inflammation in combination with α-syn pathology in the cecal patch augments brain pathology relevant to PD.
Together, this study will provide new insights on the mechanisms underlying α-syn abnormalities in the PD gut
and its capacity to induce brain neuropathology. Moreover, this work can help shape the development of early
PD diagnostics and treatments directed to the accessible GI tract."

More than 520,000 patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) underwent routine dialysis in the US in 2017.
Conventional hemodialysis (HD) uses floor-standing instruments, which contributes to the dominance of center-
based dialysis for the HD delivery space. Wearable HD systems could be employed to improve clinical outcomes
and quality of life for patients with ESRD by enabling continuous dialysis. Wearable HD also enables frequent
dialysis on a flexible treatment schedule. While there are potential benefits of more frequent dialysis, this comes
at a cost of increased burden on lifestyle, risks of access malfunction, and health care costs. Also, episodic
treatments provide insufficient time to remove large toxins (small diffusion coefficients) and protein-bound toxins.
The barrier is the size of the current membranes which are bulky and not easily integrated into a wearable system
and require large amounts of extracorporeal blood flow to achieve appropriate toxin clearances. Achieving
significant improvements will require highly efficient membranes that enable prescribed toxin removal in small
device formats.
Our group has developed a variety of ultrathin (< 100 nm) nanoporous, silicon-based membranes and have
established their value in improving the efficiency and precision of molecular separations. Because
nanomembranes are 100 to1000 times thinner than conventional hemodialysis membranes, we hypothesize
their ability to reduce the format for hemodialysis by orders of magnitude. We have recently developed a lift-off
technique to produce sheets of nanoporous nitride (NPN) membrane material separated from the supporting
silicon wafer. We propose to develop, using COMSOL Multiphysics modeling, a two-stage hemodialyzer
incorporating two NPN membrane sheets in series. The fist NPN sheet membrane (100-nm pores) will filter out
the cellular material generating plasma that will then be dialyzed by the second membrane (20-nm to 30-nm
pores). The two-filter system will be tested on the benchtop for its ability to separate uremic toxins from whole
blood and measured for hemocompatibility (hemolysis, complement activation etc.). The devices will also be
bench tested for their ability to withstand the pressures exerted by the extracorporeal blood flow and designed
ultrafiltration. The two-stage hemodialyzers will be tested in a small-animal model (male and female Sprague-
Dawley rats). We expect, based on previous clearance studies with chip-based NPN membranes, that NPN
sheet membranes can be used to construct a mechanically reliable hemodialysis device that achieves
homeostatic levels of toxins through continuous operation. By enabling effective hemodialysis is small formats,
our membrane technology will hasten the adoption of not only wearable HD therapies, but of portable and
implantable HD therapies. This effort supports the recently created “Advancing American Kidney Health initiative”
to transform how ESRD therapy is delivered."
10874666,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal
infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance
poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the
pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed
40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective,
cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to
improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.
 To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement
on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for
rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies
on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple,
robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly
abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen
identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables
phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth-
arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature
Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change
in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify
susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.
 This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization
probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that
together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these
rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive
detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional
changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in
response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best
classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that
were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real
clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from
a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture."

Radiation therapy (RT) is a standard-of-care oncological treatment for the central nervous system
(CNS). However, during cranial RT, normal brain tissue adjacent to the tumors is inevitably
irradiated, causing transient reversible abnormalities as well as progressive irreversible late
toxicities. Approximately 100,000 patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors per year in
the United States survive long enough (>6 months) to develop radiation-induced brain injury,
including cognitive impairment and/or neurological sequelae, significantly impeding the quality of
life. These symptoms occur in 50-90% of adult patients after treatment and can be seen without
clinical and radiographic evidence of histological changes. In this proposal, we aim to establish a
novel, robust, cell-based 3D brain organoid model that closely mimics the complexity of the
human brain microenvironment, serving as a platform to study pathophysiological processes and
neuroinflammation induced by RT in the normal brain tissue. Further, leveraging the established
UCLA portfolio of radiation mitigators, the brain organoid model could be a promising screening
and testing platform that recapitulates the human brain responses to therapeutic agents. Overall,
this proposal will not only characterize the real-time and dose-dependent physiological responses
of normal brain tissue to ionizing radiation, but will also provide proof-of-principle evidence to
support the use of human brain organoid model as a platform for screening and testing radiation
mitigators, enabling thus the development of adequate countermeasures against radiation.
Considering that patient-derived iPSCs may be leveraged to develop personalized testing models,
our novel biomimetic model holds significant promise in the screening of patient-specific radiation
mitigators in the era of precision medicine in the near future."

Cardiovascular tissue engineering with pluripotent stem cells has emerged as a means to generate human
cardiac tissues that can be used to model myocardial function and disease or for clinical implantation. However,
existing tissue models are limited by low thickness and a lack of structural and functional maturity, due to the
poor proliferative capacity, maturation, and embryonic-like phenotypes of stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes
(CMs). During mammalian development, the epicardium provides critical signals to the myocardium, enabling
ventricular compaction by secreting pro-mitogenic factors and contributing coronary vascular smooth muscle
cells (CVSMCs) and cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) to the heart. While these cells can be harnessed to improve
proliferation and maturation of CMs in vitro, there is a limited understanding of the underlying cellular
mechanisms that drive these effects in human cells. In this proposal, we seek to elucidate the intermediate
signals driving human epicardial-myocardial interactions by developing a 3D printed cardiac tissue model with a
functional epicardial cell layer, utilizing CMs and epicardial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from human induced
pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). This laminated 3D-tissue model is designed to enable EPCs to undergo
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and migrate into the tissue bulk, and also provides a unique
environment to probe ECM remodeling by epicardial derived cells (EPDCs), a process we hypothesize is one of
the key mechanisms by which these cells drive maturation of cardiac tissue. Utilizing gene editing and high-
throughput proteomic analysis, we will identify EPC-secreted growth factors that promote hiPSC-CM proliferation
as well as EPDC-secreted ECM proteins that are critical to structural and functional maturation of cardiac tissue.
We will then incorporate an epicardial layer onto a more geometrically complex model - a 3D printed, human
chambered myocardial pump. We will investigate the impact of the epicardium with and without imposed
volumetric pressure on pump function and clinical parameters like stroke work and ejection fraction. Insights
gained from this work will expand our knowledge of developmental processes and propel the next generation of
engineered cardiac tissues. These studies will, for the first time, elucidate details of epicardial-myocardial
signaling in a human model and establish a link between EPDC ECM secretion and cardiac tissue maturation.
Additionally, these studies will advance the structure and function of a clinically relevant myocardial pump model
that has the potential to be used for drug testing, device testing, and modeling of diseases – especially those
that manifest in altered pressure-volume dynamics"

During the past 2-3 decades important work has been done to resolve the mechanisms of light and dark
adaptation as well as disease in the mammalian rod and cone photoreceptors using mouse as a model system.
However, the mouse is a nocturnal animal that lacks the macula, a specialized central region in primate retina
that provides high-acuity color vision critical for human everyday survival. Consequently, mechanisms of human
daytime vision or diseases that disrupt photoreceptors in the macula, such as Age-Related Macular
Degeneration (AMD), are challenging to study in mice. For example, there is no effective treatment for the dry
form of AMD, the most common cause of blindness among the elderly. Thus, there is a critical need to better
understand the biology of the photoreceptors in the human macula in health and disease. This is particularly true
of cone photoreceptors compared to rods that have been more extensively studied. Recent studies have
established both light-independent and light-dependent pigment regeneration pathways within the mouse retina
isolated from the pigment epithelium (RPE). These pathways regenerate pigment via Müller cells in cone-specific
pathways (light-independent and -dependent intraretinal visual cycles) or in the photoreceptor cells themselves
by a cell-autonomous regeneration mechanism. However, nothing is known about these mechanisms in the
human macula or fovea. The goal of this proposal is to determine the contribution of the RPE-independent
pigment regeneration pathways to the ability of cones to dark adapt quickly and maintain sensitivity in bright light
specifically in the human macula. Our central hypothesis is that the canonical visual cycle that operates via the
RPE is too slow to maintain vision in bright light or mediate dark adaptation during rapidly changing levels of
illumination in the human macula. The work is organized into two specific aims. These are to determine the
contribution of the light-independent intraretinal visual cycle (Aim I) and photic pigment regeneration pathways
(Aim II) to dark adaptation and maintenance of light sensitivity of human macular cones. The experiments will
employ ex vivo electroretinography and single cell suction electrode recordings. These techniques are well
suited for assessing the role of visual cycles and cell-autonomous pigment regeneration pathways in dark
adaptation and maintenance of light sensitivity, respectively. We will leverage our experience and collaborations
with Eye Banks that we have established during the past three years to develop donor criteria and protocols to
record light-evoked responses of macular cones from organ or research donor human eyes 1 – 5 hours
postmortem. Results of these studies will determine the contribution of different visual cycle pathways to human
vision mediated by the cones across geographical regions of the retina, including the fovea. This information will
provide a basis for studies to elucidate pathogenesis of macular dystrophies and potential targets to improve
vision or prevent vision loss in aging or diseased human eye."

The majority of highly diverse biological processes are enabled through proteins, protein post-translational
modifications/proteoforms, protein interactions, PIs (e.g., protein-protein, PPIs, protein- ligand, PLIs), and
aberrations of abundances, activities, functions, and integrity of such interactions can lead to severe diseases,
including cancer. Furthermore, disruption of these protein-based characteristics by novel targeted therapies
can be an important biomarker for the response to these drugs in personalized medicine approaches. Clinical
and biological specimens are often available in limited amounts, which greatly hampers the progress in
diagnostics, therapy development, and biomedical research. Microbiopsy and liquid biopsies containing rare
cell populations such as circulating tumor cells, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and immune cells may
contain only low thousands or hundreds of cells and be heterogeneous. Traditional techniques to study
proteomic profiles, proteoforms, protein complexes, and PPIs (e.g., conventional proteomics, NMR, X-ray
crystallography, yeast two-hybrid screening and immunoaffinity purification (IP) followed by mass spectrometry
(MS)) cannot be readily used for the analysis of small cell populations, microscopic clinical samples and
individual cells mainly due to limitations in sensitivity. Therefore, many biological and clinically relevant studies
are not undertaken because of the lack of technology for such low level samples. Here, we propose to
develop analytical platforms that will enable high sensitivity analysis of scarce samples at the level of
digests, intact proteoforms, and native complexes. This task will demand the development of novel
approaches in sample preparation, ulra-low flow liquid phase separations interfaced with MS, MS data
acquisition, and data analysis. Developing such novel methods for thorough profiling of microscale samples
and integrating them in innovative “plug-and-play” automated platforms capable of efficient and high sensitivity
characterization of intact proteoforms, protein complexes and PTMs by MS will be highly desirable for gaining
biological insights into molecular mechanisms of the disease and discovery of therapeutic targets and
biomarkers for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The developed platforms will be evaluated using well-
controlled model systems and applied in the most clinically relevant settings to examine (1) model systems for
cell differentiation and activation; (2) the interactome and biological role of STAT3, the transcription factor
which is aberrantly activated in the vast majority of ovarian cancer cell lines and primary samples; and (2)
MHC-associated neontigenic peptides."

Breast cancer rates among African-American (AA) women continue to rise and may further widen breast
cancer disparities experienced by AA women, who are more likely to develop aggressive tumor types with a
worse prognosis. The biological reasons for these differences remain largely unknown. Recent genome-wide,
high-throughput studies highlight an emerging role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as a novel class of
regulatory molecules in cancer. LncRNAs form an important regulatory layer in global gene expression, and
increasing evidence indicates that abnormal expression of specific lncRNAs can contribute to breast cancer
carcinogenesis and progression. Studies to date, however, are focused exclusively on EA women, have not
commonly used high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) to provide unbiased comprehensive
profiling, and mostly do not incorporate rigorous normal tissue controls. Motivated by these research gaps and
limitations, we recently completed a pilot study of genome-wide lncRNA expression profiling in normal and
tumor breast tissues from AA and EA women. LncRNA expression data showed clear tissue- and subtype-
specific expression patterns. Importantly, we noted a number of differentially abundant lncRNAs between AA
and EA women by estrogen receptor (ER) status. These results indicate that there are unique lncRNA
expression patterns in AA tumors, which we hypothesize contributes to aggressive tumor biology and high
breast cancer-related mortality. We propose a cost-effective study in a well-characterized cohort of AA breast
cancer patients in the Women’s Circle of Health Study (WCHS), which has available tumor tissue blocks, and
extensive data on tumor characteristics, clinical outcomes, treatments received, lifestyle factors, and genome-
wide DNA methylation. As such, our Specific Aims are: 1) Perform tissue lncRNA expression profiling using
total RNA sequencing (1181 AA cases from WCHS and 100 AA controls from Komen Tissue Bank) to
determine lncRNAs that are breast cancer- and ER subtype- specific (tumor, ER+, ER- vs. normal) and those
associated with clinico-pathological factors (e.g., grade); 2) Examine associations of lncRNA expression levels
with breast cancer survival, and use a machine learning approach to identify a combined panel of lncRNAs
associated with breast cancer survival; and further perform computational prediction and in vitro functional
assays to determine their biological relevance; and 3) Integrate paired data on lncRNA expression and DNA
methylation to determine which of these cancer- and prognosis-relevant lncRNAs are regulated by DNA
methylation, and explore whether diet, obesity and other lifestyle-related factors are associated with aberrant
DNA methylation. This work is novel and findings are anticipated to advance our understanding of molecular
mechanisms contributing to aggressive tumor biology and poor cancer prognosis observed in AA women that
can be translated into the development of targeted strategies for prevention and therapeutics."

Depression and anxiety disorders are common in patients in the primary care setting and have clear evidence-
based guidelines for screening, diagnosis, and treatment. However, rates of screening, detection, and
treatment among Medicare beneficiaries remain low. Without proper treatment, these patients may experience
persistent depression and anxiety symptoms, difficulty co-managing other chronic conditions, worsening
functional status, and avoidable and expensive acute medical events. In 2017, Medicare launched the Quality
Payment Program (QPP) to incentivize delivery of high quality, low cost, evidence-based care in the outpatient
setting. The program covers a variety of alternative payment models (APMs) such as patient-centered medical
homes (PCMHs) and accountable care organizations (ACOs). Across all payment models, clinicians are paid
for their performance based on the quality and cost of care they deliver to patients. However, the effects of the
QPP on treatment of depression and anxiety disorders by primary care providers (PCPs) are unknown. There
is a critical need for research on the effect of the QPP on access to care and delivery of evidence-based
treatment for depression and anxiety disorders in the primary care setting, as well as the subsequent outcomes
for patients. Our scientific premise is that the QPP, which is a program targeted at the general patient
population, is likely to produce mixed incentives and unintended consequences for primary care delivery to
patients with depression and anxiety disorders. On one hand, the QPP incentivizes PCPs in higher-risk bearing
APMs such as ACOs and PCMHs to adopt innovative and collaborative care models that may increase rates of
evidence-based treatment. However, on the other hand, the QPP does not risk adjust for the most prevalent
types of depression and anxiety disorders when judging clinician performance, which creates a financial
disincentive to PCPs for caring for patients with these conditions, potentially threatening their access to care.
The objectives of this R01 application are to conduct a longitudinal study using real-world data to evaluate the
effect of the QPP on: 1) access to PCPs across payment models for patients with depression and anxiety
disorders; and 2) delivery of evidence-based treatment for these conditions and subsequent patient outcomes.
This study will pursue two specific aims. For aim #1, we will conduct a retrospective cohort study using
longitudinal data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
Virtual Research Data Center, and Physician Compare for 2017-2020 to investigate two hypotheses: 1)
beneficiaries with depression and anxiety disorders will have less access to PCPs in higher risk-bearing APMs;
2) PCPs who disproportionately treat beneficiaries with these conditions will receive lower QPP performance
scores and payments. For aim #2, we will use the same data to investigate the hypotheses that beneficiaries
with these conditions with access to PCPs in APMs, such as ACOs and PCMHs, will: 1) receive higher rates of
evidence-based treatment; 2) have better health and cost outcomes."

In its earliest stage Alzheimer’s disease does not manifest cognitive impairment while dementia is a late
manifestation. A biomarker to identify preclinical Alzheimer’s dementia is crucial for treatments aimed at its
prevention. Alzheimer’s disease can also degrade non-cognitive functions like mobility that precedes and
predicts cognitive impairment in many older adults. To use mobility as a biomarker, it is crucial to identify the
metrics that best predict Alzheimer’s dementia and the mechanisms that account for this association.
We must think to move. Mobility requires motor and cognitive abilities that derive from distinct brain regions.
This may explain why mobility is an early predictor of dementia. Yet, motor testing usually only quantifies
movement duration. So, the role of cognitive abilities in the association of mobility with Alzheimer’s dementia is
unclear. Unobtrusive sensors can be used to assess cognitive and motor metrics crucial for mobility.
This study will use novel digital mobility phenotyping to improve the prediction of Alzheimer’s disease
dementia and identify brain pathologies and proteins that inform on this association.
This study responds to NOT-AG-20-053 and will add new resources to those available from 1000 older adults
in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (R01AG17917). To improve the prediction of Alzheimer’s dementia, we
will add cognitive mobility metrics e.g., motor planning and attentional metrics to a single-testing session. To
capture the varied cognitive demands during everyday mobility, we will also add new multi-day mobility metrics
obtained from a wrist sensor. Motor planning is related to supplementary motor area (SMA) and task attention
and executive function are regulated by dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). So, we focus on these regions
to identify mechanisms shared by mobility and Alzheimer’s disease dementia. In 200 decedents with available
brain pathologies, we will collect new proteome data from SMA to complement the available DLPFC proteome.
Aim 1 will add new digital cognitive mobility metrics to motor metrics obtained from a single-testing session as
well as novel multi-day mobility metrics to improve the prediction of Alzheimer’s dementia. Sensors yield large
numbers of mobility metrics. Aim 1 will isolate individual metrics that predict Alzheimer’s dementia. Aim 2 will
analyze these novel metrics with a second approach to identify different mobility subgroups that may have
varied risks of Alzheimer’s dementia. To inform on the mechanisms underlying the association of mobility and
Alzheimer’s dementia, Aim 3 will use brain pathologies to determine the pathologic bases for these mobility
subgroups. Aim 4 will collect proteome from SMA and DLPFC to identify cortical proteins independently
related to mobility subgroups when controlling for ADRD pathologies. From the set of proteins related to
mobility, we will identify a subset that are also related to Alzheimer’s dementia. This study will inform on why
mobility predicts Alzheimer’s dementia and optimize its use as a biomarker for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease.
Targeting the proteins identified may catalyze new treatments for both immobility and Alzheimer’s dementia."

 The Latino Ancestry-Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (LA-GPC) is an expansion of the GPC into the Latino
population. LA and other minority populations have been poorly represented in large-scale genomic studies,
and yet these populations (i) suffer the largest disparities in health care and outcomes, and (ii) have the
potential to broaden our knowledge of human genetics. In particular, LA genomes are admixed and are
characterized by different haplotype blocks than European ancestry (EA) populations. As a consequence,
genetic polymorphisms that are in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Europeans may be broken-up by
recombination events in LA genomes, allowing the contributions of different genomic intervals to be assessed
independently.
 Progress to date: The GPC has enrolled and assessed over 5,000 new LA participants and we have
recently published a pilot GWAS including both LA and African Ancestry (AA) participants. GWAS meta-
analysis of PGC-SCZ2 with pilot results for 4,324 (cases and controls) LA-GPC participants yielded 8 new
schizophrenia-associated risk loci, and for 9 loci there was a concomitant reduction in the number of SNPs in
the associated interval. Crucially, the resultant cross-ancestry summary statistics, informed by multiple
ancestrally diverse cohorts, yielded individual-level polygenic risk scores that explained more variance than
analogous scores based on either ancestry alone
 In Phase 1 of this renewal: we will study genome-wide common variation in our existing LA-GPC and VA-
CS#572 combined cohort of 16,124 LA participants. In Phase 2, we will perform an expanded analysis by
adding 8,000 new participants ascertained in the LA-GPC, 35,000 additional participants from the VA, 8,000
participants from the NeuroMex study (PI. Koenen), and 10,000 participants from the Colombian study (PI.
Freimer). This meta-analysis will include over 77,000 LA participants, a sample of non-Caucasians with the

Pennsylvania (Penn). The candidate has had a strong record of mentorship, leadership, and research
productivity during the initial award period. Her research program encompasses POR studies at the
intersection of endocrinology and geriatrics. The scientific goals of this proposal are to investigate the age-
specificity of the cardiovascular risks of mild subclinical hypothyroidism and to examine thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) testing and levothyroxine prescribing patterns in older individuals. These studies are required
to support a change in the upper limit of the TSH reference range for individuals aged 65 years and older. This
change would improve the health and reduce health care costs for millions of older Americans through
prevention of unnecessary prescription of thyroid hormone treatment, reduction in excessive TSH monitoring,
and avoidance of iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis. The mentoring goals of this application are to support the
candidate’s six current K-award mentees’ transition to R01 funded independence and to engage a new
generation of Penn fellows and junior faculty to conduct POR in aging. The career development goal of this
application is to support the candidate’s professional development and program building in clinical
investigation. This will be achieved through focused learning about biomedical informatics, engagement in
Penn’s CTSA to enhance lifespan research, and ongoing leadership to promote the visibility of aging research
in the endocrine community. The institutional environment for clinical and translational science at Penn is
outstanding, and the proposal integrates multiple programs from Penn’s CTSA. The Department of Medicine at
Penn has made a substantial commitment, including protected time and dedicated space, toward the
candidate’s sustained success as a patient-oriented researcher responsible for training a new generation of
junior investigators who conduct POR in older participants. Renewal of this application will allow the candidate
to cement the programmatic gains achieved during the initial award period and to assure their sustainability

Clinical Research have provided a foundation for this work, which will leverage the resources of the Atlanta
Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) and Emory Specialized Center of Research Excellence (SCORE) on
Sex Differences. During this Award, I will be mentored by Dr. Igho Ofotokun, an HIV translational researcher
and PI of the Atlanta WIHS and SCORE, Dr. Gretchen Neigh, a basic scientist with experience in sex hormone
biology, and Dr. Arshed Quyyumi, a cardiologist and researcher with extensive experience in translational
vascular studies. I will complete advanced coursework in longitudinal data analysis, hands-on training in
laboratory methods to measure estrogen receptor gene expression and translation, vascular function, and
carotid artery wall thickness, and receive directed mentorship in CVD pathogenesis in women, sex hormone
biology, and HIV clinical research. HIV is a risk factor for CVD, and young women living with HIV (WLWH)
have an especially high risk for CVD compared to their HIV-uninfected counterparts. The mechanisms behind
this phenomenon are poorly understood, but we postulate that differences in estrogen activity may play a role.
Our prior work showed that CRP, a biomarker associated with CVD in the general population, does not predict
subclinical CVD progression in WLWH, as it does in HIV-uninfected women, suggesting that there is a different
mechanism driving the pathogenesis of CVD in WLWH, possibly related to estrogen activity. Estrogen affects
inflammatory pathways via its interactions with estrogen receptor (ER) and ER, which are encoded by the
genes ESR1 and ESR2, respectively. We found that the association between ESR1 and ESR2 expression on
PBMCs and carotid intima-media thickness differs by age and HIV status in women in WIHS. We hypothesize
that ESR1 and ESR2 expression and translation into ERα and ERβ is lower in WLWH than in HIV-negative
women, and reduced ESR1 and ESR2 expression and translation are associated with greater subclinical CVD
prevalence and progression. We propose a cohort study of virologically suppressed WLWH and at-risk HIV-
negative women with the following aims: 1) To determine the effect of HIV infection in ESR1 and ESR2
expression and translation on PBMCs over time, 2) To determine if ESR1 and ESR2 expression and
translation predicts prevalent subclinical CVD as measured by carotid artery wall thickness, endothelial
dysfunction and arterial stiffness, and 3) To determine the association between ESR1 and ESR2 expression
and translation in and subclinical CVD progression. Leveraging ongoing cohort studies that are actively
recruiting will greatly enhance the feasibility of these aims. Completion of these aims will separate me
scientifically from my mentors and position me to transition to independence as a clinician-scientist."

measurement, analysis and interpretation of patient-reported outcomes (PROs); (2) Survivorship Research: 
improve cancer survivorship by studying biological, behavioral and sociocultural determinants of optimal 
survivorship; and (3) Intervention Development and Delivery: develop and implement targeted interventions to 
promote cancer control and reduce acute and long-term effects of cancer and related therapies. The Program is 
comprised of 32 faculty members from 13 departments and 3 schools. Total peer-reviewed funding is 
$10,236,948 (direct), with $3,769,564 from the NCI and $6,467,384 from other peer-reviewed sources. During 
calendar year 2016, a total of 975 participants were enrolled in program studies, with 313 enrolled in intervention 
studies and 662 enrolled in observational or correlative studies. During the current funding period there were 
575 cancer-relevant publications, with 21% representing intra-programmatic collaborations, 29% representing 
inter-programmatic collaborations, and 88% representing inter-institutional collaborations. 
Over the current funding period, the CCS Program has made significant gains and its members have conducted 
high impact studies. For example, CCS members have developed and implemented brief, validated and 
clinically-relevant PRO measures, and identified contextual and modifiable factors associated with health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL) during survivorship. CCS members have also contributed to our understanding of neural 
substrates of the toxic effects of chemotherapy using fMRI techniques, documented adherence to quality metrics 
to improve surgical oncology outcomes, and developed and implemented fertility preservation techniques for 
cancer patients and survivors. Studies have also developed optimal processes for survivorship care within our 
clinics and across our community. Our work is grounded in measurement and intervention science discoveries 
made and psychosocial interventions to reduce cancer burden in our communities. The LCC provides significant 
value to the CCS Program by providing pilot funds and access to shared resources. In turn, the CCS program 
adds value to the LCC with strong program leadership, CCS Program meetings and speaker series, catchment- 
relevant and translational research, and by promoting collaborative opportunities that impact the LCC catchment 
area. The LCC and CCS leadership have developed a strategic plan to guide our future vision. The primary goal 
is to further strengthen our research across our aims by adding depth and breadth. Over the next 5 years, we 
will expand into cancer care delivery, precision oncology, pediatric survivorship, and dissemination and 
implementation science. We intend to renew our successful T32 grant; and develop PO1 submissions in prostate 
cancer and lifestyle factors in cancer survivors."

 One of the grand challenges of modern biology is to understand how gene activity is controlled in space and
time, in the context of native chromosomes and in individual living cells. The goal of this proposal is to tackle
exactly this challenge: we will develop new approaches to measure and manipulate long-range chromosomal
interactions and quantify their effects on gene expression, in real-time and in living cells and tissues. By
quantitatively mapping the relationship between transcription factor assembly (e.g. formation of biomolecular
condensates), chromosome organization and transcription kinetics, our study will define how gene expression is
controlled at unprecedented resolution.
 Transcriptional regulation forms the basis of cellular differentiation during organismal development, and its
defects underlie a variety of disease states, from developmental disorders to cancer. Yet current methods are
limited: traditional live-imaging lacks the spatial resolution to accurately define chromosome organization at the
scale of individual genes, while bulk assays using fixed material are ill-suited for studying temporal dynamics. In
addition, membrane-less nuclear condensates, which form through liquid-liquid phase separation, are thought to
play key but as-yet-undefined roles in regulating transcription.
 To address these challenges, we will develop new imaging methods to measure chromosomal distances in
living cells and build optogenetic tools to assemble/disassemble chromosome loops and nuclear condensates.
We will deploy these tools to examine regulatory interactions at genomic scales characteristic of enhancer–
promoter interactions in flies and mammals (from tens to hundreds of kilobases), and study their implications in
the context of cell fate specification in the developing Drosophila embryo. The resulting technologies will be
applied to analogous transcriptional loci in mouse embryonic stem cells and organoids derived from these cells.
Together, the proposed studies will help reveal how robust mechanisms of cell type specification emerge from
stochastic processes such as transcriptional bursts, fluctuations in the size and stability of biomolecular
condensates, and dynamic instability of chromatin architecture. The overall goal of this project is to establish a
quantitative link between chromatin architecture and transcriptional activity, which will ultimately allow us to take
control of gene activity by re-engineering the transcriptional programs underlying developmental and disease
processes."

According to the Global Burden of Diseases data, sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces the highest burden of
zoonotic food-, water- and vector-borne diseases in the world. Through our renewal D43 application, the One
Health Eastern Africa Research Training (OHEART) program, we focus on two countries: Kenya and Ethiopia,
which collectively have more than 170 million people whose lives are intertwined with animals. Livestock and
people constantly move across borders in search of pasture and better livelihoods, exacerbating zoonotic
disease transmission. Recent epidemics and pandemics that originate from animals include Highly Pathogenic
Avian Influenza (birds), Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (camels), Ebola Viral Disease (fruit bats), and
COVID-19, among others. Therefore, building the health research and training workforce using the One Health
approach has become increasingly crucial. In the last two cycles, our OHEART D43 trained a total of 18 PhD,
five postdoc and 46 laboratory technologists that are making impactful contributions. In the upcoming cycle, we
propose a research-training program using an integrated One Health approach to address priority zoonotic
pathogens of public health significance in the region. We emphasize building and strengthening capacity at the
interface of humans, animals, and the environment. We made transformative changes to ensure sustainability,
which include transitioning program leadership to eastern Africa under the leadership of Kenya Medical
Research Institute (KEMRI). The program will focus on four core institutional partners from Kenya (KEMRI and
University of Nairobi) and Ethiopia (University of Gondar and Armauer Hansen Research Institute). These
institutes represent the leading national global health research and training institutes with the mandate to train
professionals in diverse areas including infectious diseases at PhD and postdoctoral levels. Our specific aims
include: 1) Strengthen One Health research capacity in eastern Africa by expanding a sustainable pool of
research leaders; 2) Foster research collaborations between Kenya and Ethiopia, and The Ohio State
University, in major zoonotic transboundary infectious diseases; and 3) Facilitate and nurture an inter-
disciplinary collaborative environment among disciplines including medicine, veterinary medicine, nursing,
public health, environmental health and data science. We propose to scale up and train future infectious
diseases researchers and leaders in targeted priority endemic and emerging zoonotic infectious diseases
using approaches that include omics, data analytics, implementation science and applied research leadership.
Building on the success of the past two cycles, we will use two research-training tracks: Track 1.A. train six
PhD level pre-doctoral PhD fellows (three per country) with two phases of mentored research in Kenya (6-mo)
and OSU (9-mo) and remainder period at home institute; Track 1.B. two postdoctoral fellows for two years
each with 3-mo visiting fellowship at OSU using a sandwich program approach and Track 2- we will train 16
laboratory technologists via a short-term certificate program in global one health using defined competencies."

College drinking continues to be a major public health concern in the United States and a priority area within
NIAAA. About 1 in 3 students report heavy episodic drinking (HED; 4+/5+ females/males) and 1 in 10 engage
in high-intensity drinking (HID; 8+/10+ females/males). Students who engage in risky drinking behaviors (HED
or HID) are at risk for experiencing alcohol-induced blackouts (AIBs; i.e., absence of memory for all or part of a
drinking episode). AIBs are critical to reducing harm because they are associated with experiencing higher
numbers of consequences and more severe consequences, even after controlling for drinking. A secondary
data analysis of ~800 student drinkers over 18 weekends showed that on nights when AIBs occurred, students
experienced ~3.5 more consequences than on non-AIB nights. At least one of these additional consequences
were considered to be severe. AIBs also occur at a high frequency to warrant their examination. Our pilot data
showed risky drinking students experienced AIBs on 1 out of every 3 drinking days. Although AIBs are
associated with risky drinking, there are many unanswered questions about why and when AIBs occur (which
events result in an AIB). The overall goal of the proposed research is to extend the field by using objective
transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) sensors to increase our understanding of why and when AIBs occur.
The proposed study will utilize a comprehensive theoretical model which includes psychosocial variables (e.g.,
willingness to drink and experience AIBs, drinking/AIB attitudes/subjective evaluations, expectancies, and
norms), behavioral constructs (e.g., self-report drink counts, protective behaviors), and a novel biometric
assessment (i.e., TAC sensors) to examine the associations between risky drinking and AIBs. TAC sensors
assess alcohol use in near real time measuring features of intoxication repeatedly to provide a curve of
biological alcohol intoxication for every drinking day. Prior research suggests that the manner individuals
consume drinks (via TAC sensors) may differ when reporting the same number of drinks (e.g., speed of
drinking, time spent drinking). I served as a Co-I on a small pilot study (n=33) using similar methods to support
the proposed research. Students wore TAC sensors and completed 12 event-level drinking surveys over 4
weekends (Thurs, Fri, Sat). The preliminary findings included: 1) high compliance to study protocols (91%
retention/TAC use/event survey completion); and 2) 70% reported at least 1 AIB during the 12-weekend day
period, and 55% reported multiple AIBs at a rate of 1 out of every 3 drinking days. These findings are
encouraging and demonstrate my ability to carry out the proposed study. The aims are as follows: Aim 1
utilizes a comprehensive theoretical model to examine why and when AIBs occur (which events result in an
AIB); and Aim 2 examines trait constructs (self-regulation and sensation-seeking) and sex as moderators for
the associations between psychosocial constructs, TAC drink features, and AIBs."

 Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) cause a disproportionate burden of mortality and
morbidity in Sub-Saharan Africa. This D43 training program builds upon an existing, successful
multidisciplinary research partnership focused on CNS infectious diseases which has been ongoing
since 2005, particularly in the realm of HIV-related cryptococcal meningitis and TB meningitis. This new
application proposes a Minnesota-Makerere-Mbarara training program in Uganda for neuro-infectious
diseases with multidisciplinary training in clinical research, biostatistics, epidemiology, immunology,
microbiology, neurology, ophthalmology, pharmacology, and psychiatry.
 The meningitis research platform has in the past decade published >150 manuscripts, enabled 3
Ugandans to secure independent NIH research funding as a PI, facilitated funded PhD training for 6
Ugandans, as well as provided research projects and support for 16 Ugandan Master's students. We
seek to continue this successful partnership and training portfolio through providing translational
research training in the gap after Master's of Medicine (MMed) graduate medical training (i.e.
equivalent to a U.S. graduate medical residency) and before PhD training or research faculty posts.
We propose a 2-3 year intensive mentored research experiences to publish Master's theses, gain new
research skills, generate preliminary data for new projects, and apply for funded PhD training, research
grants, and/or faculty appointments.
The D43 training faculty draws on 19 primary research mentors of whom, 9 are Ugandan, and 10 are
American with a multinational training advisory committee overseeing the D43 program.
Specific Aim 1. Expand needed research expertise in Uganda in the areas of neuro-infectious
diseases by training at least 12 physician scientists. Post-graduate fellowships represent a current
career gap between initial research experiences in MMed graduate medical training and future PhD
training positions and/or faculty appointments.
Specific Aim 2. Build research capacity in Uganda through workshops and short-term training focused
on: scientific communication, leadership, research methodologies, clinical trial experiences, applied
biostatistics, and translational laboratory mentored research experiences in Uganda and with short term
U.S. exchange visits, as needed.
D43 Fellows will have the opportunity to gain clinical trial experience as well as implement nested
research projects into ongoing investigator-initiated randomized clinical trials for cryptococcal
meningitis, TB meningitis, or advanced HIV disease."

Polymorphism in the APOE gene is the leading risk modulator for late onset Alzheimer’s Disease
(LOAD). Despite extensive studies, the molecular mechanisms by which Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)
influences AD risk remain poorly understood. A growing body of research is pointing towards a
significant role for ApoE/heparan sulfate interactions in AD pathogenesis. Heparan sulfate (HS) is
ubiquitously present on neuronal and glial surface and facilitates ApoE cell surface binding and
cellular uptake. In our recent studies, we have shown that ApoE/HS binding affinity correlates with AD
risk and that ApoE recognizes a rare HS modification, 3-O-sulfation. In addition, we demonstrate an
increase in the 3-O-sulfated HS in AD brains. In preliminary data, we show that ApoE4 allele further
increases the level of 3-O-sulfated HS, leading to differential interaction between ApoE isoforms and
HS in the brain. We hypothesize that the differential binding modes between ApoE isoforms and HS
contribute to AD risk. This hypothesis will be tested on multiple levels using an interdisciplinary
approach in three aims. Aim 1, Delineate the glycan determinants of ApoE-HS interaction in AD. Aim
2, Define isoform specific ApoE-HS interaction at atomic resolution. Aim 3, Study isoform specific
ApoE-HS interaction in cellular and animal models. Successful completion of this project will provide
novel insights into how ApoE isoforms modulate AD risk through their distinct interactions with HS,
and will identify new drug targets for AD."

Up to a third of elderly patients recovering from cardiac surgery experience postoperative delirium (POD), an
acute state of confusion marked by inattention and global cognitive dysfunction. POD is a burdensome clinical
and patient-centered outcome associated with long-term cognitive deficits like Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and
Related Dementias (AD/RD), prolonged hospitalization and institutionalization, higher readmission rates, and
increased mortality. We recently found elevated tau in the serum of patients that developed POD after cardiac
surgery and an association between tau and POD severity, suggesting that perioperative stressors exacerbate
latent ADRD pathology, and evidence to suggest that dexmedetomidine modifies the association with
preoperative tau. Recent studies have suggested that approximately 30% to 40% of POD may be preventable.
However, multicomponent nonpharmacological POD prevention strategies are resource intensive and
increasingly challenging to implement given the current labor shortage in healthcare. A recent Enhanced
Recovery and Perioperative Quality Initiative Joint Consensus Statement on POD Prevention highlighted the
need for a safe and easy-to-implement prophylactic pharmacological strategy. At present, definitive guidelines
or large clinical trials do not support the administration of any medication for POD prevention. In the pilot
Minimizing ICU Neurological Dysfunction with Dexmedetomidine-induced Sleep (MINDDS) randomized
controlled trial, we found that nighttime intravenous dexmedetomidine significantly reduced the incidence of POD
in patients older than 60. However, replication in a large, more pragmatic trial is warranted to support the
widespread implementation of nighttime dexmedetomidine for POD prevention. This proposal will study nighttime
intravenous and sublingual dexmedetomidine to provide definitive evidence for POD prevention efficacy.
Additionally, it will create a biorepository to aid biomarker discovery and insights into POD and cognitive recovery
after cardiac surgery. In Aim 1, we will perform a large (n = 1800), pragmatic, phase III, randomized, blinded,
double placebo-controlled, three-arm study of nighttime dexmedetomidine for POD prevention and cognitive
improvement in elderly patients following cardiac surgery. In Aim 2, we will examine the effect of nighttime
dexmedetomidine on patient-reported outcomes, morbidity, and mortality. In Aim 3, we will establish a

Asthma is a common chronic respiratory disease and is considered to be an umbrella diagnosis for several
sub-diseases with distinct biological pathways and clinical presentations. Moreover, asthma has a strong
genetic predisposition and is associated with early-life factors and environmental exposures.
Previous studies identified several associations between asthma and omics factors, but the exact
mechanisms underlying most findings remain unclear. Multi-omics approaches were proposed as a tool to
dissect asthma endotypes and heterogeneity.
In this application, we aim to utilize multi-omics data to disentangle asthma heterogeneity, identify endotypes,
and investigate biological mechanisms underlying established risk factors. The analyses will take advantage
of three cohorts of (asthmatic) children with high-quality multi-omics data and extensive phenotype
information. In Aim 1, we will analyze the interplay between genetic, epigenetic, and metabolomic factors in
the development of asthma. In Aim 2, we will identify asthma endotypes based on genetically predicted multi-
omics levels, directly inferring the genetic basis of these distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, we will
investigate omics signatures of parental asthma history at birth and during childhood (Aim 3). We will
characterize the clinical and molecular features associated with significant results throughout the aims. The
aims require innovative methodological advances derived as part of the project to unfold the full potential of
the data resources and utilize the unique advantages of the family-based designs. Overall, achieving the
research objectives demands skills covering respiratory biology, statistics, multi-omics expertise, and data
science/causal inference.
Julian Hecker, Ph.D., MS, is a statistical geneticist whose long-term career goal is to establish himself as an
independent research scientist in the study of asthma and respiratory diseases. The detailed career
development plan will support Dr. Hecker to achieve the following training goals and close knowledge gaps:
1.) gain expertise and experience in integrative omics analyses and the processing of multi-omics data, 2.)
deepen understanding of asthma pathophysiology, and 3.) improve apprehension of causal inference
techniques in epidemiological analyses. Dr. Hecker’s strong theoretical background, in combination with his
experience with family-based approaches and analyses, will position him to accomplish these training goals
and the aims of this proposal, as well as prepare him for the transition to an independent research role. He
will take advantage of the unique research environment in the Channing Division of Network Medicine and
Harvard Medical School. The support from his experienced mentoring team and the advisory committee will
ensure the proposed project's success."

Exposures to ambient air pollution, especially fine particulate matter (PM2.5), have been associated with
increased risks of many chronic illnesses, including Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD).
Identification and understanding the role of modifiable risk factors is essential for AD disease prevention.
Despite the observed epidemiological evidence, three central and unsolved questions are 1) what components
of PM2.5 (e.g., sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, elemental carbon, organic carbon, metals, etc.) are most neurotoxic,
2) the role of other ubiquitous air pollutants (carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3))
which often co-occur with PM2.5, and 3) what biological response occurs in the brain following PM2.5 exposure.
A better understanding of the specific exposure components and underlying causal pathways revealing the link
between PM2.5 and AD/ADRD will provide valuable insight into disease etiology and pathophysiology and
inform environmental regulation and health policy to reduce disease burden. Although omics applications in
environmental health research are still nascent, several studies conducted by our team and others
demonstrate that the blood metabolome can be used to sensitively map internal biological perturbations
following exposures to air pollution. The brain and the blood metabolome have also been shown to play an
important role in the development of AD/ADRD. However, most previous studies had limited sample sizes
(N<200), and only focused on associations between PM2.5 and the blood metabolome or on associations
between the metabolome and AD/ADRD markers. No study has looked at these associations with PM2.5 and
AD/ADRD in a cross-tissue analysis of blood and brain to elucidate their interconnections. We propose to
investigate the molecular connections underlying the neurotoxicity of individual and mixtures of air pollutants
using high resolution spatio-temporal modeling of air pollution mixtures, and untargeted cross-tissue
metabolomics approaches in three well-characterized, diverse studies with comprehensive assessment of
AD/ADRD and related indicators and biomarkers. Specifically, we will 1) investigate associations between
exposures to air pollution mixtures and indicators of AD/ADRD, 2) characterize cross-tissue (blood and brain)
metabolomic signatures of air pollution mixtures and indicators of AD/ADRD, and 3) identify early changes in
the blood metabolome as potential biomarkers of the neurotoxicity of exposures to air pollution mixtures by
leveraging prospective assessments of AD/ADRD risk among cognitively normal individuals. This study
provides a critical opportunity to address research gaps in molecular mechanisms underlying air pollution
neurotoxicity and its role in the development of AD/ADRD. These findings will provide key insights into the
relationship between air pollution mixtures, biological response profiles, and ADRD, supporting future efforts
that aim to inform environmental regulation and health policy to mitigate air pollution-related risk for AD/ADRD."
10885635,"Project Summary/Abstract
Over 2 million people in the United States with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) engage in
some form of SPB (self-injury, aggression; Crocker et al., 2006). For these individuals, SPB can impair
functioning, produce injury, strain healthcare and other service systems, and lead to restrictive placement.
Behavior-analytic treatments are the current gold standard for reducing SPB, with functional communication
training (FCT) being among the most common behavioral treatments. Such treatments are most effective when
implemented by trained staff in highly specialized settings (e.g., inpatient and outpatient clinics). In these
settings, treatment is initially implemented with a high level of intensity (e.g., dense schedules of reinforcement
for appropriate behavior) and with high treatment fidelity (e.g., reinforcement for appropriate behavior at the
prescribed schedule, etc.). Unfortunately, treatment gains obtained in these specialized settings sometimes fail
to maintain in the face of treatment challenges, such as when treatment is generalized to new agents or
settings, or when alternative reinforcement is reduced. The current proposal focuses primarily on two types of
treatment challenges: (a) context changes and (b) decrements in alternative reinforcement, each of which each
of which can that produce two common forms of relapse: renewal and resurgence, respectively (Podlesnik &
Kelley, 2015). These relapse phenomena may also be compounded when they occur simultaneously (e.g.,
“super-resurgence”; Kincaid et al., 2015), such as when there is a context change that co-occurs with
decrements in reinforcement (e.g., a novel caregiver implements treatment and fails to deliver reinforcement
for an appropriate response). As planned and unplanned treatment challenges that can lead to relapse are
inevitable, the question is how we can mitigate relapse when they occur. This proposal describes an
exploratory single-arm clinical trial to evaluate specific tactics designed to mitigate renewal, resurgence, and
super-resurgence of SPB among individuals with IDD. Broadly, these relapse-mitigation tactics include: (a)
multiple context training, (b) incorporation of extinction-correlated stimuli, (c) systematic caregiver fading
procedures, (d) provision of effective competing stimuli that reduce excessive bidding for functional reinforcers
during schedule thinning, and (e) application of probe-based schedule thinning procedures. These tactics have
preliminary empirical support but have primarily been examined in isolation, or predominantly evaluated in
translational research using analog paradigms. The current proposal combines multiple these relapse-
mitigation tactics and evaluates their feasibility and preliminary efficacy for mitigating both renewal and
resurgence with individuals with IDD undergoing FCT for SPB. Outcomes will be evaluated using a single-case
experimental design with embedded treatment challenges to examine renewal, resurgence and super
resurgence (see Haney et al., 2021). In addition to the practical benefits of identifying tactics to mitigate
relapse, this work will also advance knowledge on the underpinnings of relapse, which will have both practical
and scientific value."

Changes in protein N-glycosylation are a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the molecular mechanisms
for alterations in protein N-glycosylation are unknown. Mannosidases are key enzymes in protein N-glycosylation
that participate in glycan processing in the Golgi. Only two pre-mRNAs involved in protein N-glycosylation form
abundant circular RNAs (circRNAs): MAN2A1 and MAN1A2. CircMAN2A1 expression correlates with
Alzheimer’s disease, whereas circMAN1A2 remains constant. We found that circMAN2A1 is translated after it
undergoes adenosine to inosine RNA editing, catalyzed by ADAR1-p150 (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA).
During AD progression, the overall RNA editing of circRNA increases, suggesting that circRNA-encoded proteins
will be more and more translated. Due to their generation through backsplicing, circMAN2A1 encoded proteins
lack the endoplasmic signal sequence and are cytosolic. Two of the three circMAN2A1 encoded proteins contain
the catalytic active site and could be active. Transfection studies followed by lectin blots showed that
circMAN2A1-encoded proteins change protein N-glycosylation. We hypothesize that the expression of
circMAN2A1-encoded proteins correlates with AD progression and alters protein N-glycosylation. Similarly, the
increase in circRNA editing will increase circMAN1A2-encoded protein expression. The hypothesis will be tested
in two specific Aims, where in Aim#1, we characterize the expression of circMAN2A1 and circMAN1A2 in brain
during AD development using immunohistochemistry, Western blot and RNAseq on tissue from AD subjects,
test their suitability as biomarkers and determine their intracellular localization. In Aim#2, we will determine the
influence of circMAN2A1 and circMAN1A2-encoded proteins on glycan formation, using in vitro assays and cell
transfections followed by glycan analysis.
The work is highly innovative, using the first antisera against circRNA-encoded proteins and investigates for the
first time the role of an endogenous circRNA-encoded protein. It is significant, as it addresses protein N-
glycosylation as a key pathological feature for AD, for which no molecular mechanisms are known so far."

Human and nonhuman primates are highly visual animals that are predominantly active during the daylight hours.
Yet our understanding of the neural mechanisms supporting spatial navigation is largely based on studies of
nocturnal, burrowing rodents with poor vision. Indeed, studies of human and nonhuman primates have already
demonstrated that spatial positions can be encoded in the hippocampus exclusively by visual inspection of a
scene (i.e. spatial-view cells). At the same time, primate hippocampus also comprises populations of neurons
that encode self-position in a scene during locomotion (i.e. place cells). Ultimately, primate representations of
space must integrate these parallel threads of spatial information, but precisely how this occurs within the primate
hippocampus is entirely unknown. Here we propose to address this fundamental question by leveraging several
conceptual, technical and computational innovations to examine the neural basis of spatial representations in
the hippocampus of marmoset monkeys. Aim 1 complements our previous work demonstrating canonical place
cells in marmoset hippocampus during free-navigation to characterize whether neurons in this neural structure
can also encode space through visual exploration of a scene. Aim 2 seeks to systematically characterize
behavioral strategies in marmosets when searching for food in naturalistic 3-dimensional `forest' environments.
Specifically, we will test how visual exploration and physical navigation of the landscape complement each other
in marmoset spatial behavior. Experiments in Aim 3 build on these results to record the activity of hippocampal
neurons of freely-moving marmosets in the same 3D naturalistic environments. By integrating head-mounted,
wireless eye-tracking technology and video tracking of the animals position in space, we will explicate the role
of different primate hippocampal subfields for exploration and navigation."

cause of death in the United States. Roughly one-third of the U.S. population is obese, and it is estimated that
nearly half of the population will be obese within the next two decades. To date, studies investigating the neural
contribution to body weight control have focused largely on neuropeptidergic signaling in the hypothalamus, a
key brain region involved in feeding behavior. However, signaling from extra-hypothalamic brain regions has
also been implicated in regulating nutrient metabolism, appetite, and satiety. We have recently uncovered a
novel mechanism by which glutamatergic signaling in the basal forebrain strongly influences feeding and body
weight control. This discovery provides intriguing evidence that specific glutamatergic signaling pathways in the
brain critically regulate feeding behavior and body weight homeostasis. To elucidate the mechanisms by which
forebrain glutamatergic signaling influences body weight management, feeding behaviors, and metabolism, we
will test the hypothesis that glutamatergic basal forebrain circuits modulate metabolic and appetitive programs
to regulate body weight. Using a combination conditional genetic targeting, optogenetic manipulations,
electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis, we will set out to determine the role for basal forebrain glutamatergic
signaling in body weight control and obesity."

Transgender/gender expansive (TGGE) individuals are those whose gender identity does not align with
society’s expectations of their sex designated at birth. Despite an increase in TGGE health research over
the last ten years that have illustrated alarming health disparities, there are significant gaps in knowledge
to fully inform healthcare practices and system level policies that address inequities experienced by TGGE
persons and optimize individualized care. An interprofessional approach to TGGE health research which
engages community members, researchers, public health professionals, and mental and physical health
clinicians in transformative and participatory research is critical to overcoming the social, environmental,
and structural barriers to health. The Healthcare Interprofessional Gender Health, Education and
Research (HIGHER) Academy will create an adaptable, reproducible, sustainable year-long research
course for interprofessional graduate students that is taught exclusively by TGGE individuals and
cisgender women. The course will include asynchronous modules that will focus on health disparities,
opportunities in the delivery of clinical care, and opportunities in research methodology (with a focus on
intersectionality and participatory methods) and engage HIGHER scholars in interprofessional team-
based collaboration to design a research proposal aimed at promoting TGGE health (Aim 1). The course
curriculum will be informed by a newly established community-academic advisory board (Aim 2). This
initiative will be developed at the University of Cincinnati, a large urban public research institution that
has momentum in increasing education and training in gender-informed clinical care and research in
several colleges. The HIGHER Academy will be the impetus to create a community of practice among
interprofessional faculty across the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy, Allied Health Sciences,
Human Services and Arts & Sciences that will offer new opportunities for research collaboration and
mentorship for students (Aim 3). The HIGHER Academy efforts will be evaluated using summative and
participant-engaged formative performance methods and will collect quantitative and qualitative data.
Collectively, these aims will augment the TGGE health research workforce and improve the health of
TGGE individuals, with an emphasis on participation of those with TGGE experience as instructors,
advisors, and scholars."

Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is inhaled and subsequently encounters a
phagocytic cell in the lung and uses this cell to escape the lungs and disseminate to the central nervous system,
where it leads to life-threatening meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis occurs in approximately 225,000 individuals
with AIDS each year, resulting in over 181,000 annual deaths. Currently available antifungal drugs are not very
effective, they are highly toxic to the host, and the pathogen is developing resistance against these drugs. There
is an urgent need to develop new antifungal drugs for cryptococcal infection. Our previous studies showed that
individual dendritic cell (DC) lysosomal proteins nostrin, human neutrophil elastase (HNE), matrix metalloprotein
25 (MMP25), coronin, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) kill C. neoformans and are not toxic to mammalian cells. By
identifying the mechanism(s) of action and therapeutic potential of these compounds, we can begin to develop
novel therapies that can address this public health problem. In fact, therapies that target the fungal pathogen in
the lung before it disseminates to the brain would be critical in preventing dissemination – currently no such
therapies exist. We hypothesize that these compounds kill C. neoformans by causing fungal cell wall and
membrane damage, leading to lysis of the organism and that these compounds will be effective at
treating the lung stage of cryptococcal disease. To test this, we will first identify physical attributes of damage
to the fungal cells following treatment (misshapen cells, holes in the membrane and cell wall, etc). We will then
conduct experiments to determine mutations in fungal genes required for resistance. We will do this by screening
C. neoformans mutant libraries and by conducting studies to identify spontaneous suppressor mutants following
treatment. We will then test the compounds for antifungal activity in vitro in cell culture before verifying their lack
of toxicity in a mouse model. Finally, we will test the efficacy of the antifungal DC lysosome proteins in vivo in a
mouse model of pulmonary cryptococcal disease. These proposed studies will offer many opportunities for
training undergraduate and graduate students in the laboratory. We will first identify physical effects on C.
neoformans following treatment with DC lysosomal components (Aim1). Next, we will identify the mechanisms
of antifungal activity by DC lysosome compounds (Aim 2). Finally, we will test the efficacy of novel antifungal
compounds in cell culture and in a murine model of pulmonary cryptococcosis (Aim 3)."
10875846,"SUMMARY
Vision is how most organisms perceive and respond to their environment, making the development and function
of this sensory modality paramount. Visual experience is necessary to refine visual processing, a form of
experience-dependent plasticity. The majority of this refinement occurs during a brief developmental window
known as a critical period, when visual input can produce extensive changes. During the visual critical period,
the absence of visual experience is associated with amblyopia (lazy eye) in humans and impaired visual acuity.
The circuity underlying visual transformations are well established, including the cortical changes imposed by
visual experience. However, subcortical circuits (e.g. the thalamus) also exhibit a critical period and visual
experience driven changes. Compared to cortical plasticity the mechanisms instructing thalamic visual plasticity
are poorly understood. This gap in knowledge means we have an incomplete understanding for how visual
experience refines visual circuit function and processing. In established models, technical obstacles exist to
address this gap, such as anatomy (thalamus is a deep brain structure), extensive cortical feedback, and in vivo
study is complex in delicate early stage animals. Here, we use a novel visual critical period model in larval
zebrafish. The advantages to our zebrafish model are that visual plasticity can be demonstrated using a
straightforward visuomotor behavior, absence of a cortex and thalamic feedback, larvae are robust and
amendable to in vivo study, and the whole brain is optically accessible –providing a unique thalamus-centric
vertebrate model for visual plasticity. Last, our prior work has demonstrated that genetically-defined thalamic
neurons encode visual experience and display asymmetric patterns of activity that correlate with behavioral
performance. Therefore, we have a system where visual experience, thalamic physiology, and changes in the
performance of visuomotor performance can be correlated in single animals. We will use this system to determine
how visual experience instructs changes to thalamic function through the entire visual critical period until
behavioral onset (Aims 1). Changes in inhibitory signaling are well-established to regulate the duration of cortical
visual plasticity, yet the role of inhibition in the thalamus is incompletely understood. In Aim 2-3, we will take
advantage of our new system to define how visual experience modulates inhibitory input and development in the
thalamus. The zebrafish model positions us to address current gaps in knowledge about the basic mechanisms
that drive critical period plasticity in the thalamus, and to directly correlate experience with behavioral output.
The lab has an established track record of undergraduate training, productivity, and pursuing further STEM
opportunities including terminal biomedical degree training or biomedical related careers. This proposal will
support continued undergraduate involvement in research, with an emphasis on gaining hands-on practical
experiences that create a foundation for long-term success in STEM."
10875847,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is a standard treatment for heart failure (HF) by coordinating the
function of the left and right ventricles. However, 30-40% of CRT recipients do not have improved clinical
symptoms and cardiac functions. The main reasons for CRT non-response include: (1) Selection of patients
based on electrical dyssynchrony measured by ECG under current guidelines is not optimal. (2) Mechanical
dyssynchrony is proven effective but is not fully explored. (3) The CRT left ventricular (LV) lead may not be
placed in an appropriate position in a significant number of patients. Due to the complexity of HF and the
mechanism of CRT pacing, the advancement of image-guided approaches for CRT is still limited: existing
predictors that measure electrical dyssynchrony and mechanical dyssynchrony are insufficient to characterize
the severity of electrical/mechanical dyssynchrony in all ventricular segments; on the other hand, numerous
complicated inter-correlated predictors entangle multi-stage clinical decision making for CRT delivery.
The objective of this research is to improve CRT patient selection and LV lead pacing by integrative
analysis of electrical dyssynchrony on ECG and mechanical dyssynchrony on gated SPECT myocardial
perfusion imaging (MPI). Different from existing studies, which use supervised machine learning (ML) to
combine all clinical factors to predict CRT response, this translational approach is dedicated to knowledge
discovery and clinical decision-making support; we will use unsupervised machine learning to find patient
subgroups that have a higher likelihood to respond to CRT and use reinforcement learning (RL) to both optimize
and explain the multi-stage clinical decision-making process of CRT patient selection, and design a new method
incorporating electrical dyssynchrony, myocardial viability, and mechanical dyssynchrony to recommend the LV
pacing sites. Completion of this proposed project will result in the discovery of new clinically interpretable
knowledge and computer techniques to improve CRT response in clinical practice. It is important to note that all
the new algorithms and knowledge will receive rigorous validations.
The proposed research shows our continuous effort and innovative methods to investigate this long-lasting and
significant cardiovascular problem. It utilizes state-of-the-art computer algorithms and techniques to analyze
cardiovascular images for improved medical treatments, and will greatly benefit our students, offering
opportunities for them to engage in cutting-edge cardiovascular research. It will thus diversify university research
by introducing clinical cardiology practice to our well-established computing programs and promoting integrative
education and discovery-based learning for undergraduate students. The preliminary data, the PI’s experience
in developing innovative computer algorithms on medical image analysis and machine learning and supervising
undergraduate research students, and our interdisciplinary collaboration, have fully prepared the team for the
execution of this project."

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States and a potential risk
factor for developing Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). To date, no
effective therapeutic agents have been identified from TBI clinical trials. There is a compelling need to develop
novel therapeutic treatments for TBI. The objective of this project is to test and develop a tetrapeptide N-acetyl-
seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP) as a novel treatment for TBI, and to investigate mechanisms underlying
AcSDKP treatment-enhanced functional recovery after TBI. Our data demonstrate that 3-day subcutaneous
infusion of AcSDKP initiated 1h after TBI significantly improves functional outcome in a rat contusion model of
TBI induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Our data further show that AcSDKP not only provides
neuroprotection by reducing fibrin accumulation, lesion volume and hippocampal neuronal loss but also
promotes neurovascular remodeling including angiogenesis, synaptogenesis, and neurogenesis. These findings
indicate that AcSDKP has promise as an effective treatment for TBI. Our preliminary data demonstrate that
AcSDKP treatment significantly decreases transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) and nuclear factor-kappa
B (NFkB) in the brain of TBI rats. Of significance, AcSDKP selectively reduces the histone deacetylase 4
(HDAC4) nuclear translocation and increases histone H3 acetylation, suggesting that HDAC4 nuclear
translocation contributes to TBI pathophysiology. Based on literature and our robust data, we will test the central
hypothesis that AcSDKP treatment improves functional recovery after TBI by reducing neuroinflammation,
enhancing neuroprotection and neurovascular remodeling by inhibiting TGF-β1/NFkB signaling, and reducing
nuclear translocation of HDAC4. To test the central hypothesis and to accomplish the objectives of this
application, we propose three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will determine the dose-response and the effective
therapeutic windows of AcSDKP for improvement of functional recovery in male and female rats after TBI. Aim
2 will determine effects of AcSDKP at optimal dose and therapeutic window on angiogenesis, neurogenesis,
axonal remodeling and neuroinflammation in male and female rats after TBI. Aim 3 will determine whether TGF-
β1/NFkB and HDAC4 nuclear translocation signaling pathways contribute to TBI pathophysiology and AcSDKP-
induced therapeutic benefits in male and female rats after TBI. Completion of this project will aid our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying AcSDKP-promotion of functional recovery after TBI. This proposal
is highly clinically relevant, and if successful will provide essential information for facilitating development of
AcSDKP as a novel therapy for TBI and have a significant impact on quality of life for TBI patients."

Lymphocytes that stably reside in peripheral tissues play a critical role in defending against foreign pathogens,
suppressing tumorigenesis and facilitating organ repair. Many of these cells first establish themselves in peripheral tissues
during “critical windows” of early postnatal development and are maintained throughout life within specific
microanatomic niches, which provide the necessary factors for their survival and function. Understanding how tissue
resident lymphocytes are established and maintained is of fundamental importance in our attempts to functionally
manipulate these cells for therapeutic benefit. Abnormalities in tissue-resident lymphocytes and/or their tissue niches are
thought to contribute to autoimmune and allergic inflammation. We have discovered that regulatory T cells (Tregs) in
neonatal skin play a major role in suppressing the formation of a niche for T helper type 2 (Th2) cells in this tissue.
Transient loss of Tregs in neonatal mice results in the aberrant outgrowth of a novel subset of stromal cells that
preferentially express genes involved in type 2 immune responses (termed 'type 2 stromal cells' or `type 2 SCs').
Concurrently, a population of Th2 cells establishes residence in the same region of skin as type 2 SCs and persists into
adulthood, long after complete restoration of the Treg compartment. We hypothesize that neonatal Treg dysfunction
early in life predisposes to aberrant Th2 immune responses in adulthood by facilitating the establishment of a
pathogenic Th2 cell niche in skin. Humans with congenital loss of Tregs have dysregulated Th2 immune responses in
skin and develop severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Thus, we further postulate that Treg dysfunction early in life
contributes to the development of human AD and that augmenting Tregs in AD skin will preferentially suppress
Th2 immunity. Experiments outlined in this proposal will comprehensively define the Th2 niche in skin and determine
the consequences of this niche for lifelong susceptibility to atopic inflammation. We will first mechanistically test whether
type 2 SCs support Th2 cells and determine the molecular factors necessary for Th2 cell accumulation and maintenance in
the skin. We will then test whether the establishment of the Th2 niche in neonatal life predisposes to atopic inflammation
and aberrant AD-associated antimicrobial immune responses in adulthood. Finally, we will determine whether our
findings translate to patients with AD. We will elucidate whether Tregs are defective in skin of pediatric patients with AD,
whether a type 2 SC-Th2 cell axis exists in these patients, and whether Treg augmentation can suppress Th2 immune
responses in AD skin. We have discovered a new stromal cell population in skin and have the tools to genetically
manipulate these cells, allowing us to test a novel hypothesis centered around 'tissue imprinting' of immune cell niches
early in life. We will utilize highly innovative technology to quantify T cell responses to cutaneous microbes. In addition,
we will employ a novel ex vivo functional assay with human skin and a newly generated protein that selectively and
potently activates Tregs. Thus, the experiments outlined in this proposal represent an innovative, comprehensive, and
multidisciplinary approach to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin cutaneous type 2 immune
cell niches in both mouse models and in human disease."
10876849,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cannabis use during pregnancy is increasing with its legalization in many states and the belief by many that it
is a safe and effective treatment for pregnancy-related nausea. This proposal investigates to what extent
prenatal maternal supplementation with phosphatidylcholine (PChol) mitigates the effects of prenatal cannabis
exposure on the fetus and subsequent child behavior. Higher maternal levels of choline have been shown to
improve brain development. Choline in the amniotic fluid activates fetal alpha7-nicotinic receptors, before
cerebral cholinergic innervation fully develops, late in gestation. Alpha7-nicotinic receptors and cannabinoid
CB1 receptors are expressed on the same cerebral interneurons. Choline activation promotes interneuron
development, whereas THC, by interfering with endogenous signaling, retards their development. Consistent
with this translational model, a preliminary clinical observational investigation found that mothers with higher
gestational choline levels have newborns with more normal fetal development of cerebral inhibition, even if
mothers continued moderate cannabis use during pregnancy despite clinical advice. The child’s subsequent
ability to pay attention is increased. We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
phosphatidylcholine supplementation in 120 pregnant women who use cannabis during pregnancy. Pregnant
women will be randomly assigned to receive (1) 7200mg PChol, equivalent to 1028mg choline (Treatment
Group, n=60) or (2) corn oil placebo (Placebo Group, n=60). The first aim of this project tests the hypothesis
that maternal choline supplementation will interact with maternal cannabis use on the P50 auditory evoked
response inhibition, an electrophysiological marker of the development of inhibitory neurotransmission, one
month after birth. Aim 2 tests the hypothesis that maternal choline supplementation will interact with maternal
cannabis use to mitigate its adverse effects on offspring’s development of attention, temperament, and
cognitive behaviors. Prenatal cannabis use, assessed from mothers’ self-report and urine and serum
metabolite levels, returned pill count, estimates of choline intake from the mother’s recall of her diet, and
plasma levels of choline and its metabolites will be obtained at 14, 16, 22, 28, 34 and 40 weeks of gestation.
Cannabis use in the postnatal period and breast milk cannabinoid and choline levels will also be measured.
Neonate and infant hair will be analyzed for cannabinoids to detect 3rd trimester and postnatal exposure. The
two aims together will document the possible effectiveness of prenatal choline supplementation to protect the
fetus’s brain development from exposure to cannabis during gestation. The outcomes of this proposal could
have an innovative public health effect to protect the brain development of fetuses whose mothers continue to
use cannabis despite medical advice to abstain. These effects may result in decreased risk of mental problems
in the children."

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most pressing public health priorities. AMR is thought to be re-
sponsible for more than 35,000 deaths in the US with a projection of 300 million deaths worldwide by 2050. My
original K24 application sought to increase my ability to conduct patient oriented research (POR) on antibiotic
resistance and mentor a new generation of clinicians scientists on different aspects of this important public
health threat. With support from the K24 award, I was able to markedly increase my research portfolio, launch
a microbial genomics mission and increase my mentoring activities. Thus, the overarching goal of this com-
petitive K24 renewal is to fully transition to an established investigator by continuing and further strengthening
my POR portfolio and mentoring abilities. I also aim to fortify my leadership skills to expand an ambitious re-
search and training program, focused on AMR. Supported in part by my original K24 award, I founded the Cen-
ter for Antimicrobial Resistance and Microbial Genomics (CARMiG) at UTHealth. The vision of CARMiG was to
amalgamate the world-class expertise available in the Houston’s Texas Medical Center (TMC) to serve as a
major platform for cutting edge research programs and integrate a training mission to the highest level. I also
led the creation of the Gulf Coast Consortium on Antimicrobial Resistance (GCC-AMR), an inter-institutional
hub for AMR researchers across the TMC to interact and foster collaborations. We developed a robust training
program on AMR, recruiting and supporting the career of a diverse pool of trainees (MD, PhDs and PharmDs)
at different stages of their careers. My trainees have secured 4 NIH K developments awards (2 with perfect
scores), and equivalent independent grants. Furthermore, the number of trainee’s publications has markedly
expanded (94 publications as firs/corresponding author). Our NIH grant portfolio also grew with more than $ 20
million brought in as PI of NIH grants in the last 5 years, including a recent P01 program ($11m). We were also
able to secure the first post-doctoral inter-institutional T32 training program on AMR. Thus, the foundations of
my initial K24 program put me in an ideal position to sustain and further strengthen my research and training
objectives. In my original K24 program I focused on the clinical and genomic aspects of vancomycin-resistant
enterococci (VRE) one of the most challenging organisms in clinical settings. Using the expertise acquired in
VRE, my K24 renewal will support new areas of research, including the intersection of microbiome science and
AMR, genomics and molecular epidemiology of Gram-negative pathogens and use of machine learning to es-
tablish clinical/genomic correlates in patients infected with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO). The spe-
cific aims are: i) strengthen my portfolio of POR related to AMR as the foundation for trainees to develop their
careers, and ii) mentor talented young investigators in translational and POR focused on AMR. I plan to con-
tinue my robust mentoring program that integrates the understanding of the molecular and genomic bases of
resistance and their translation into clinical practice."

 Social attachments form the basis of human relationships at every level of social organization, from
relationships between parents and children, romantic partners, to peers and group affiliation. Disruptions in
attachment occur across the spectrum of mental illness, and severe neuropsychiatric disorders often manifest
with a dramatic collapse of social attachment and cognition. Despite this critical role of social attachment, little
is known regarding the neural and genetic mechanisms underlying attachment. Mice and other genetic model
organisms do not exhibit enduring social attachments, precluding genetic analysis of these behaviors.
 Prairie voles are small rodents that display social monogamy, or pair bonds, between mates. Pair bond
formation results in dramatic changes to many other innate social behaviors. Thus, prairie voles engage in a
rich repertoire of social behaviors that strikingly mirror attachment in humans. Pioneering work identified the
peptide hormones vasopressin (Avp) and oxytocin (Oxt), as critical mediators of pair bonding in voles and
social cognition and behaviors in humans. These findings suggest that the genetics and neural control of social
attachment may be conserved, and indeed, have inspired clinical trials seeking to use these hormones to
ameliorate disruptions in social cognition due to neuropsychiatric conditions. Nevertheless, how these
pathways and other genes function to control specific aspects of complex social behaviors remains unknown.
 Until now, we have been unable to understand how OxtR and V1aR function to control patterns of
neural activity in response to partners or strangers. We have generated prairie voles bearing mutations in OxtR
and V1aR that completely eliminate the function of these receptors, and developed approaches for optical
recording of neural activity in freely moving animals during behavior and profiling of gene expression in prairie
voles. Using this powerful system, we can now test the hypothesis that OxtR and V1aR control distinct aspects
of 1) pair bonding and adult social attachment behaviors, 2) partner- or stranger-specific patterns of neural
activity in specific regions of the vole brain during social interactions, and 3) changes in gene expression
underlying social attachment in these neural populations. Our preliminary work suggests that OxtR signaling is
not required genetically for pair bonding in prairie voles, and, thus, that a more refined understanding of the
neural and molecular pathways underlying social attachment may provide new insights into the pathways that
mediate the formation of such long term social memory and affiliation. These studies will elucidate the
mechanisms by which OxtR and V1aR facilitate attachment and, eventually, inform new therapeutic
approaches across the spectrum of mental illness."

 Our prior Stage III Randomized Clinical Trial (n=1496) evaluating ethnic differences in response to
brief intervention showed that, compared to non-Latinxs Whites, Latinxs were more likely to reduce alcohol use
in response to standard brief alcohol interventions that are not adapted to be culturally responsive (NA-BMI)
versus treatment as usual1. In Stage I Community Based Participatory Research (Stage I CBPR), we
developed a culturally informed brief motivational intervention (CI-BMI) which adopts a harm reduction
approach and focuses on reducing alcohol problems and increasing treatment utilization 2. Through a flexible
core approach, CI-BMI introduces substantial modifications to standard brief alcohol interventions to be
culturally responsive and is theoretically grounded in self-determination theory (SDT)3-5. The result of Stage I
CBPR was CI-BMI which 1) leverages cultural values and strengths while addressing the process of
acculturation and acculturative stress; 2) is explicitly designed to meet the basic psychological needs of
autonomy, relatedness, and competence by supporting autonomy to enhance autonomous motivation to
change drinking behavior; and 3) focuses on harm reduction. Our Stage I CBPR (n=87) demonstrated that CI-
BMI is feasible and acceptable in pretesting in a Level I Trauma Center5. We hypothesize that CI-BMI will lead
to increased engagement in protective drinking behaviors, fewer alcohol problems as well as reduce barriers to
help seeking and increase treatment utilization among underserved, non-treatment seeking Latinxs who
engage in at risk drinking and are seriously injured. The proposed Stage II Efficacy Trial of CI-BMI will
randomize 600 Latinxs admitted to a Level I Trauma Center at University Medical Center in El Paso, Texas to
either NA-BMI or CI-BMI conducted by research staff from The University of Texas El Paso. Following
admission for medical treatment of an injury, eligible Latinx patients will be those who screen positive for
drinking at the time of their injury or engage in at risk drinking. The primary aims of the proposed study are to
1) test the efficacy of CI-BMI in comparison to NA-BMI on alcohol related harm reduction behaviors, alcohol
problems, barriers to help seeking and treatment utilization among non-treatment seeking Latinxs and 2)
examine the theoretically informed mechanism of behavior change based on SDT including providing
autonomy support to meet the basic psychological needs that enhance autonomous motivation. Because the
psychological processes underlying the intrasession mechanisms of change remain poorly understood, CI-BMI
based on SDT will significantly advance the science and practice of brief interventions6. In addition, planned
secondary data analysis will assess the influence of multi-dimensional acculturation/enculturation orientations
and acculturative stress on alcohol related outcomes. The results of this study will lead to a theoretically
informed and culturally response brief motivation intervention with enhanced generalizability to effectively
address alcohol related health disparities and treatment inequities among non-treatment seeking Latinxs."

The aberrant incorporation or retention of ribonucleic acids (RNAs) in the genome is a common cause of genomic
instability, rendering it susceptible to hydrolysis and downstream mutagenesis. The enzyme RNase H2 is one of
the primary mechanisms protecting against this destabilization of the genome by removing these genome-
embedded RNAs.
Our lab recently uncovered a novel mechanism of regulation of RNase H2, by uncovering that replication
termination factor 2 (RTF2) is involved in localizing and regulating the levels of RNase H2 at the replication fork.
Further elucidation of this interaction is required to understand the basic biology behind the regulation and
function of how RNase H2 prevents genome instability. Interestingly, copy number loss of RNase H2 is commonly
found in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), in over 30% of cases. In my preliminary work, I have developed
various cellular models in which RNase H2 and RTF2 can be depleted, and I have expressed and purified
recombinant RNase H2 and RTF2, allowing for both in vivo studies of which RNase H2 activities are regulated
by RTF2 and in vitro studies of their interaction. Furthermore, I have developed a novel assay allowing a
quantitative analysis of ribonucleotide incorporation in the genomes of human cells. This assay will be used to
study the regulation of RNase H2 by RTF2, and will be assessed in its applicability to predict CLL responses to
PARP-inhibitors. The direct mechanism behind tumor progression in the loss of RNase H2 has not been studied.
In this proposal, building on my above preliminary work, I will test the hypothesis that RTF2 interacts directly with
and regulates the activities of RNase H2 at the replication fork and examine the mechanism behind how loss of
RNase H2 compromises genomic stability and leads to tumor progression.
I am an MD/PhD student at the Weill Cornell/Rockefeller/Sloan Kettering Tri-Institutional Program, where I am
in the laboratory of Dr. Agata Smogorzewska at The Rockefeller University. My long-term goal is to become a
physician scientist, practicing as a hematologist-oncologist as well as running an independent basic science lab
as an academic university hospital. The plan outlined in this proposal, along with the support and mentorship of
Dr. Agata Smogorzewska, my thesis research committee, and the Tri-Institutional MD-PhD program will help me

Although epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death in women in the U.S.—with
worse survival in African-American (AA) women than European-American (EA) women—little is known about
factors affecting survival among AAs. The causes for this disparity are likely multifactorial and need to be
examined from multiple levels, including factors affecting the neighborhood social environment and individual-
level factors. We posit that inflammatory exposures may explain some of the disparity in EOC survival among
AA women due to important role of inflammation on carcinogenesis and prognosis and the higher levels of
inflammatory biomarkers present among AA women. The African American Cancer Epidemiology Study
(AACES) is a multi-site epidemiologic study of AA women in diverse geographic regions. Due to
comprehensive data collection, pathology assessment and length of follow-up, AACES is uniquely positioned
to evaluate factors influencing the survival of EOC in AA women. AACES has enrolled an unprecedented
number of AA participants during a previous funding period, making AACES the largest study of ovarian cancer
in AA women to date: 595 AA women with invasive EOC and 752 controls. Prior to AACES, no epidemiologic
study of ovarian cancer had enrolled more than 150 AA cases and 150 AA controls. The overarching goal of
this proposal is to assemble the first cohort study of AA EOC survivors by expanding recruitment to reach a
sample size of ~944 cases and continuing follow-up of existing AACES cases. We propose a novel multi-level
approach to evaluate the impact of neighborhood, lifestyle factors and biomarkers on survival. We propose the
following aims that build on our current infrastructure and accomplishments: 1) investigate the effects of the

characteristics and EOC survival; 3) characterize inflammatory tumor markers that may be key treatment
targets; and 4) use multi-leveling modeling to integrate the impact of the Aim 1-3 variables. Our multi-
disciplinary investigative team has extensive experience in all facets of ovarian cancer research, which
ensures comprehensive, synergistic approaches to understanding factors that affect survival in AA women
diagnosed with invasive EOC. The critical deficit of information on the epidemiologic and prognostic factors for

We propose to develop statistical methods for the analysis of longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET)
data for patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Disease biomarkers identified from PET data are necessary for
integrating these imaging modalities in observational studies and in clinical trials for drug development for AD.
We propose statistical methods for the analysis of PET images including dimension reduction and biomarker
extraction from voxel-wise intensity analysis that incorporate disease progression in two observational studies
including data on early-onset and late-onset AD participants. Our methods allow for integration of MRI atrophy
measures in the analyses to obtain multimodal predictors of disease severity and progression. The proposed
methods will utilize the complex data and noise structure for developing powerful tools for biomarker identification
that can be used for finding differences of disease progression between populations of interest. Particularly, our
proposed biomarkers incorporate information on shape and texture of radiological images for prediction. The
proposed methods can be incorporated to analyze data in future studies in most AD data collection centers as
well as to apply in radiomics of imaging data in general."

Female genital fistula is a debilitating injury that affects 2 to 3 million women, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa.
Women with fistula have uncontrollable leakage of urine and/or feces (among other physical symptoms), are
heavily stigmatized, and experience high psychiatric morbidity. Preliminary evidence has identified risk of
fistula recurrence, incontinence, and pregnancy complications following fistula repair. However, the evidence
base regarding the factors contributing to these adverse outcomes is severely underdeveloped, limiting the
development of clinical interventions to reduce these adverse risks to women, preventing them from re-
experiencing the consequences of fistula, and to improve pregnancy outcomes and quality of life.
In an effort to improve the physical and psychosocial quality of life for women affected by fistula, we propose to
address the critical gaps in knowledge on risk of adverse outcomes following fistula repair by conducting a
longitudinal cohort study of 800 women repaired for fistula in fistula repair facilities located in Uganda and
Kenya. We seek to identify predictors of post-repair fistula breakdown and recurrence (Aim 1), to identify
predictors and characteristics of post-repair incontinence (Aim 2), and to engage key stakeholders in a theory-
guided iterative process to develop a roadmap of intervention strategies likely to be feasible and acceptable
within this setting (Aim 3).
Our approach overcomes limitations to prior research through employing a longitudinal design; focusing on a
broad range of patient, fistula, and behavioral characteristics; and enrolling the largest number of women (800)
with the longest follow-up (3 years) to date for robust estimation. Data will be collected at time of surgery and
at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and quarterly thereafter for 3 years through a combination of interview-
administered patient questionnaire and structured medical record abstraction, with clinical exams conducted
per standard of care and as necessary based on symptom experiences. In-depth interviews with key
stakeholders (n~80, including longitudinal participants and a range of other important roles) guided by
prevalent behavior and implementation change theories will help us to understand facilitators and barriers of
behavior and implementation targets to inform potential intervention strategies at multiple levels.
Our sample size will allow us to detect a minimum difference in effect of 20% for all outcomes. Analyses will
describe estimate the individual and joint-effects of patient, fistula, fistula repair, and post-repair characteristics
on incidence of post-repair fistula breakdown and recurrence and incontinence using proportional hazards
frailty survival models. Our findings will inform counseling and clinical care models for optimizing post-repair
outcomes for women following fistula repair."
10885683,"Project Summary
The relationship between education and Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD) is well-
established; however, inequalities in access to education are a fundamental social disparity, resulting in
differential cognitive outcomes in diverse contexts. Country, birth cohort, and gender disparities in access to
education and occupation can be a source of natural experiments to reveal trends and mechanisms for the
relationship between education and cognitive outcomes such as ADRD, including how genetic propensities
both manifest and change across diverse historical and social settings. We propose to leverage the Interplay of
Genes and Environment across Multiple Studies (IGEMS) consortium of longitudinal twin studies of
development and aging to clarify the role of educational inequalities for ADRD. The IGEMS consortium is a
collaboration involving 18 longitudinal twin studies of adult development and aging. Established in 2010, the
consortium has developed standard processes for collaboration, data sharing, data harmonization, and data
analyses. The current application proposes a new direction for the IGEMS consortium to support novel
investigations of the education-ADRD association in the context of country, birth cohort, and gender disparities
in access to educational opportunities, integrating multiple indicators of education. First, in addition to
harmonized International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) scores across countries and birth
cohorts, IGEMS includes polygenic scores for education (PGSED). Second, parental education measures allow
for a study of intergenerational mobility and clarifies potentially spurious relationships between education and
ADRD that result from family background effects. Third, we will examine the impact of birth cohort and country,
comparing access to educational and occupational opportunities using indexes of educational inequality
(GINIED) as well as measures of social disparities. Dynamic gender disparities that vary over context and time
will also help us to explain established gender differences in the relative protective effects of education and
occupation for cognition including ADRD. The twin structure of our data permits use of established twin
methods to test hypotheses on the nature of gene-environment (GE) interplay, while genotyping allows us to
confirm and extend these twin analyses through analyses of PGSED and polygenic scores for dementia.
Importantly, IGEMS is a multidimensionally diverse sample that spans multiple countries and historical periods,
allowing us to determine whether models of GE interplay established at the micro-level (i.e., individual) might
vary at the macro-level (i.e., country/historical period). We propose the following research aims. AIM 1:
Investigate mechanisms of educational influences on cognitive functioning and ADRD risk at multiple levels:
genetic (PGSED), individual (ISCED), inter-generational (parent ISCED), and environmental (GINIED). AIM 2:
investigate the impact of women’s differential educational and occupational opportunities across cohorts and
countries on education-cognition and ADRD relationships and gender differences in ADRD risk."

The Electroencephalography (EEG) Core from Phase 1 will be transformed into the Cognitive Neuroscience
(CN) Core in Phase 2 by adding a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and repetitive TMS (rTMS) suite
coupled with EEG. Located at Kansas State University (K-State), the CN Core will provide resources,
equipment, and technical support to enhance the research capabilities of CNAP projects and programs. The
CN Core will purchase TMS/rTMS equipment, enabling research using virtual lesions and neuromodulation,
two important techniques allowing causal tests of cognitive and neural plasticity. The new equipment
developments will occur in consultation with Dr. Jeffrey Johnson, an EEG/TMS expert and former Co-Director
of the High-Density EEG/Neurostimulation Core at North Dakota State University’s COBRE Center for Visual
and Cognitive Neuroscience (CVCN). The CVCN is a CNAP Scientific Exchange Network (SEN) member. Dr.
Johnson will help establish the new TMS/rTMS with integrated EEG suite, and planned collaborations with him
(e.g., with research project leader Wisniewski) will continue to strengthen the SEN. The CN Core will provide
researchers access to structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) facilities at the Hoglund
Biomedical Imaging Center (an SEN partner at the University of Kansas Medical Center) and structural MRI at
a local hospital (Ascension Via Christi, Manhattan, KS). Access to MRI is crucial for targeting brain areas of
interest in TMS research and greatly increasing source localization accuracy in EEG research. To further
develop a critical mass of researchers, the CN Core will hire a new tenure-track faculty member in
Psychological Sciences with research expertise in TMS/rTMS. It will also provide collaborative opportunities for
Dr. Wisniewski, several researchers with current and proposed EEG and/or TMS projects (Bailey, Pitts,
Loschky, Young, Zakrzewski), and other CNAP members. The CN Core will provide training to new users,
such as workshops by CN Core experts and equipment manufacturers. Outreach activities such as wireless
mobile EEG demonstrations will increase CN Core visibility both on- and off-campus. These activities will
promote initiatives to develop a critical mass of researchers in cognitive and neural plasticity. The CN Core will
utilize the Neuroinformatics (NI) Core to support EEG, MRI, and TMS/rTMS data analyses and storage. The NI
Core’s powerful computing resources are crucial for the CN Core high-density EEG, MRI and TMS/rTMS
capabilities. CN and NI Core GRAs will expand ongoing independent components analyses (ICA) and neural
decoding analyses to develop novel machine learning/artificial intelligence tools for users to model data. By
providing access to EEG, TMS/rTMS, and MRI equipment, resources, and training opportunities, the CN Core
will promote CNAP researchers’ ability to successfully compete for extramural funding by providing both key
technologies and technical support to answer the most challenging questions in cognitive neuroscience."

Ongoing brain dynamics impact memory for events as they occur. This is evident in nonhuman and human 
neuroelectromagnetic recordings (e.g., electroencephalography - EEG) where prestimulus oscillatory brain 
states have been shown to determine neural plasticity and predict later memory retrieval. However, a reliance 
on correlational data, restrictive memory paradigms, outdated analysis techniques, and a bias to use visual 
and/or language stimuli has left open questions in the state of knowledge. It is still not clear whether 
prestimulus brain states causally impact memory, whether their impacts are related to the cortical source of 
oscillatory activity, and whether effects only apply to a subset of tasks. This makes it difficult to develop 
approaches that use prestimulus brain dynamics with health-relevant goals (e.g., systems that induce brain 
dynamics that can facilitate memory). The proposed research employs innovative methodological approaches 
to examine the central hypothesis that oscillatory prestimulus brain dynamics impact memory for sound. The 
data produced will fill gaps in the state of knowledge and identify directions that can be taken to exploit 
prestimulus brain dynamics to produce positive health outcomes. Aim 1 will determine how prestimulus 
oscillatory EEG dynamics relate to auditory memory performance. High-density (104 channel) EEG will be 
recorded while subjects encode sounds in memory tasks with the capability of assessing memory accuracy 
and precision. Analyses will reveal the prestimulus EEG oscillatory dynamics that are predictive of these 
memory performance metrics. Source modeling will reveal the cortical areas responsible for these effects and 
allow a characterization of how interactions among different sources influence memory. Aim 2 will modulate 
prestimulus brain dynamics and measure resulting impacts on memory. Both a sensory entrainment and 
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocol will be used to induce oscillatory brain states in 
subjects. Because brain states will be purposefully manipulated, this will provide a causal viewpoint on 
prestimulus oscillatory activity regarding memory performance. This project stands to produce theoretical 
insights on the functional roles of oscillatory brain activity in memory processes. For instance, it is directly 
relevant to theory on alpha (~8-13 Hz) oscillations which proposes that the phase and power of ongoing alpha 
should gate the processing of incoming events. Methods that allow causal inference will inform the ongoing 
debate in neuroscience as to whether oscillations play a functional role in processing or are merely 
epiphenomenal. Through its use of multiple methods (EEG, sensory entrainment, rTMS), the project also 
stands to identify the most useful directions to take in the development of rehabilitative/assistive devices. The 
project will link with all three of CNAP Phase 2 crosscutting themes (The Neurobiology of Learning and 
Memory, Neuromodulation and Assessment, and Advanced Computational Modeling) and will rely on the 
Neuroinformatics and Cognitive Neuroscience Cores."

lifespan, sex and race are needed for the atlas to be broadly usable. The technologies generating data include
paired single nucleus chromatin accessibility and RNA expression (snRNA/ATAC-seq -cell type and state

cure for ALL individuals. The overall goal of this P30 application is to provide the needed infrastructure and
training to enhance clinical and translational research in MSK disorders through the use of state of the art
technologies that connect phenotypes to comprehensively evaluate factors that contribute to poor MSK health.
The Specific Aim of the Administrative Core is to facilitate cross disciplinary clinical research. The Administrative
Core will focus on the following Goals: Goal 1) The Administrative Core will provide overall administrative support
and periodic review to the MSK-Methodology and MSK-Resource Cores, including budget oversight,
coordination of scientific and project meetings, and tracking of users, grants and publications and serve as the
liaison to investigators, collaborators, Advisory Boards, NIH-NIAMS, and external academic and industry
collaborators. Goal 2) The Administrative Core will lead internal communication by providing advice and direction
for the enhancement of clinical research in MSK disorders through individual consultation, engagement with
Thematic Teams, and presentations and organization of symposiums and workshops. The Administrative core
will lead external communication and outreach efforts by promoting the use of our cores and the addition of end
points of MSK health in prospective trials or cohort studies of chronic disease, raise awareness and educate
health care professionals and laypersons, and coordinate with the CTSI Community Health Engagement
Program to enhance community engagement with racially and ethnically diverse populations to encourage

10888261,"Musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries and diseases are the leading cause of disability across the lifespan. The
pathophysiology of MSK disease is complex, and clinical research requires a broad range of data types including
electronic health record (EHR) data (patient characteristics, treatments, and clinical outcomes), standardized
physical performance measures, bone imaging, laboratory measures, omics data (e.g. genomics, proteomics,
metabolomics), patient reported outcome tools, and social determinants of health. A lack of integration of these
complex ‘big data’ sources impedes access and utilization by investigators. The goal of the Indiana Center for
Musculoskeletal Health-Clinical Research Center is to provide access to state-of-the-art informatics
resources and technology to define and characterize MSK biology and disease genotypes; computable,
molecular, functional, and clinical phenotypes; and the social factors, collectively mediating MSK health, disease
and disability across the lifespan, and to develop cures. In our initial P30 funding period, we established a
Musculoskeletal Informatics Methodology (MIM) Core, leveraging a large inter-organizational integrated
health information exchange of EHR data to detect several computable (assessed from the EHR) MSK
phenotypes, that incorporate diagnosis and other codes, medications, laboratory values and/or clinical text notes.
We integrated such computable phenotypes with the measurements (physical performance and bone
assessments) and associated biospecimens from the ICMH-CRC FIT Core, to support investigators in clinical
study design, feasibility assessments, and translating bench discoveries to humans. In the current proposal, the
MIM Core will expand our support of investigators in multi-disciplinary clinical and translational research
leveraging the use of novel informatics methods and resources, to improve musculoskeletal health. The MIM
Core will develop a large facile, secure Musculoskeletal Data Mart that integrates and makes ready for clinical
research, data from multiple resources including: 1) EHR systems of the Indiana Network for Patient Care, using
computable phenotypes to generate a cohort of more than 880,000 patients with MSK disorders, 2) community
data systems information on social determinants of health and other risk factors, and 3) the full data from the FIT
Core musculoskeletal phenotyping, biospecimens, and genomic data. This Data Mart will facilitate feasibility
analyses, grant support, and retrospective and prospective studies to support translational research from bench
to bedside and back. The MIM Core will also provide statistical support for clinical trial design, and informatics
and data science approaches such as applying natural language processing to extract EHR text data, health
informatics analyses of outcomes, integrative genomic analyses, and applying machine learning models to

10888263,"Musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions are the leading contributor to disability worldwide. There is a reciprocal and
perpetuating relationship between the MSK system and chronic disease. Chronic health conditions contribute to
abnormal muscle and bone leading to fractures and impairments in physical function and mobility. The MSK and

adverse outcomes. The overarching goal of the Indiana Core Center for Clinical Research (ICCCR) – the Indiana
Center for Musculoskeletal Health Clinical Research Center (ICMH-CRC) is to provide resources and
training to enhance clinical research to improve MSK health across a broad range of diseases and populations.
In our initial P30 funding period, the Function, Imaging, and Tissue Resource Core (FIT Core) was developed
to provide outcomes to generate MSK phenotypes at the functional (i.e. physical function) & morphological (i.e.
organ- & tissue-level properties) levels. The core offered a battery of standardized physical function tests in
research and community participants via a centralized Institutional Review Board protocol, operationalized MSK
imaging resources developing a centralized resource for investigators to navigate, access, and obtain MSK
outcomes, and partnered with the CTSI-supported Indiana Biobank to create a unique biospecimen and tissue
resource. In collaboration with the MSK Informatics Methodology (MIM) Core, the FIT Core linked physical
function and imaging outcomes with biospecimens and an individual’s electronic health record to enable
investigators to formulate and address novel questions related to MSK health. In addition, the FIT Core used the
data it collected to develop and disseminate novel normative data calculators and scorecards for physical
function and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography outcomes. In the proposed funding
period, growth of the FIT Core will be fostered by taking the Core “on the road” to community health centers and
organizations to diversify the tested population and develop race and ethnicity specific normative data. We will
continue to innovate imaging outcomes to meet investigator needs and expand the number and access to
specimens related to MSK health in the Indiana Biobank. We will also perform whole exome sequencing on DNA
collected from participants to expand the utility of the functional (physical function), morphologic (imaging), and
computable (electronic health record) phenotypes by linking with genomic data. These goals will serve to
overcome barriers of incorporating MSK outcomes in non-traditional fields of study and generate unique
resources to promote and advance clinical research in MSK disorders."

advanced computing infrastructure for ICAN analyses, combining external OA data with ICAN data, and
creating a unique national resource that shares data and results from ICAN analyses with the research
community via a user friendly web-based data portal, mapOA. Each ICAN Project will provide important stand-
alone discoveries but combining and integrating across Projects will enhance statistical power through meta-
analyses, illuminate the potential function of statistical associations (for example, mapping significant loci to
functional gene targets), provide a biologically integrated interpretation through the harmonization of human
studies and animal model studies, and ultimately generate and test hypotheses about putative mechanisms.
For ICAN and the field to leap forward in understanding the individual biological variation that leads to OA,
omics integration is key. The SynC will provide cross-project and research community integration that
facilitates scientific synergy by accomplishing the following Specific Aims:
 (1) align ICAN analyses with milestones set by the Center Steering Committee and coordinate
development of analytic techniques, standards, procedures, and documentation; (2) establish and maintain a
centralized high-performance computing environment and standardized pipelines for data ingestion and omics
analyses; (3) ingest and standardize external OA datasets and conduct integrative analyses across ICAN and
external data; and (4) develop a user-friendly web-based resource, mapOA, for sharing of integrated OA omics
and imaging data within ICAN and with the broader research community.
 Achieving the SynC aims will dramatically increase synergistic integration of ICAN Projects by providing
investigators and the research community with mapOA for easy access to robustly QC’ed and harmonized
results from all projects and ingested publicly available data; providing a standardized HPC environment and
pipelines; and conducting integrative analyses beyond those in individual Projects. The SynC is key to making
ICAN more than the sum of its individual Projects. The SynC team is co-led by Multiple Principal Investigators
Eric Otto Johnson, PhD, and Nathan Gaddis, PhD, who bring expertise in multisite consortia coordination;
addiction research; epidemiology; high performance cloud computing infrastructure; pipeline and workflow
development; data structuring, integration, and processing; omics data analysis in diverse populations; and
data visualization. They are supported by a broad team of statisticians, bioinformaticists, and developers.
Together, they will ensure that SynC maximizes the impact of ICAN research into the biological drivers of OA."

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. This
devastating disease affects 196 million individuals and is predicted to increase to 288 million by 2050. Most of
these patients suffer from the early and intermediate “dry” AMD and are currently without treatment options
due to an incomplete mechanistic understanding of this complex disease. In early and intermediate AMD,
large diffuse lipoprotein-rich deposits, named drusen, are deposited in the macula, and impair vision.
Although drusen are a hallmark feature of AMD, the mechanism of drusenogenesis is unresolved. Drusen
form between the retinal pigmented epithelium basal lamina (RPE BLam) and the inner collagenous layer
(ICL) of Bruch’s membrane (BrM). RPE BLam and BrM are composed of glycosaminoglycans (GAG),
including heparan sulfate (HS). Modification of GAG side chain residues creates binding sites for numerous
growth factors, enzymes, and lipoproteins. This structural variation makes GAGs one of the most complex
macromolecules found in nature and has been shown to be altered with aging and disease, including as an
initiating event in subendothelial deposition of lipoproteins in atherosclerosis. Our understanding of GAGs in
general, their role in BrM health, and how they change with aging and diseases, such as AMD, has lagged far
behind other macromolecules despite their central role in biology. Our preliminary data show that HS is
increased in AMD BrM compared to age-matched controls. In addition, AMD macula is rich in highly sulfated
HS disaccharides (N-, 2-O and 6-O sulfation). Notably, Apolipoprotein E (APOE), a critical component of both
lipoproteins and drusen, has binding sites to N-, 2-O and 6-O sulfated HS. In this proposal, we propose to
test the hypothesis that an age-related increase in HS sulfation (N-, 2-O and 6-O) induces lipoprotein
retention in BrM in early AMD. To address this hypothesis and elucidate the pharmacologic potential of this
pathway, we propose the following aims: Aim 1: Determine what AMD risk factors are associated with BrM
GAG composition. Aim 2: Determine if BrM HS structure or content promote lipoprotein binding in AMD. Aim
3: Determine if HS sulfation regulates lipoprotein retention in vivo in mice. If successful, the proposed
experiments will establish alterations in HS sulfation as an initiating event in drusenogenesis and identify
therapeutic targets for HS and lipoprotein binding for AMD. The mentored training program is designed to
acquire new skills to support a career as a physician-scientist with expertise in glycobiology and lipoprotein
biology. Towards this goal, a team of mentors have been assembled at UC San Diego, with expertise in
heparan sulfate and lipoprotein metabolism."

of therapy for thromboembolic conditions. However, individual variability in OAC response can result in lack of
efficacy (thromboembolism) or safety (hemorrhage), with OAC-related hemorrhage a serious adverse effect.
Ancestry and sex influence OAC response and variable drug levels, therapeutic target levels, and clinical OAC
responses have been observed. Differences in pharmacogenomic variant frequencies, gene expression, and
metabolite profiles by ancestry and sex may explain variable drug response. However, pharmacogenomic
evaluations of DOAC response have been limited in diversity, evaluated candidate genes, and lacked
evaluation of sex-related predictors. Furthermore, metabolomics signatures of variable OAC response have not
been evaluated. This is a major barrier to establishing therapeutic drug and biomarker levels and personalizing
OAC therapy. The NIH recognizes the importance of identifying factors that affect treatment response among
diverse patients and the use of pharmacogenomics and metabolomics to identify and develop new therapeutic
targets/ biomarkers. With the support of this K23 award, Brittney Davis, PharmD will identify and evaluate
ancestry and sex-related pharmacogenomic and metabolomic signatures of variable OAC response, including
pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and clinical outcomes (hemorrhage). This will be achieved
through integrated research and training aims that build on her prior clinical and research background.
Specifically, she will evaluate pharmacogenomic predictors of DOAC PK (drug levels) and PD (anti-Xa levels),
and integrate pathway and functional effects to characterize drug response pathways (Aim 1). To evaluate

10886381,"The combined medical and economic impacts of addictions currently cost the US over a trillion dollars annually;
their social impact is incalculable. Whether we can mitigate these impacts depends on how successfully we
educate a literate citizenry to understand how many different triggers elicit addictive behaviors because they all
stimulate the same brain responses. Vulnerability peaks in the teen years, yet the skills needed to analyze and
evaluate the risks related to these triggers are rarely addressed in high school biology classrooms, with the result
that nearly half of US adults are ill prepared to make informed health decisions; historically underrepresented
groups (HUGs) are most affected. The skills in understanding and evaluating the science behind health and
disease are also needed to participate in STEM+M careers, so it is no surprise that the same communities are
also disproportionately underrepresented in the STEM+M workforce. Our goal is to redress this balance by
creating an engaging high school biology curriculum about the science behind addiction that dispels the stigma
around substance use, in the context of key competencies required for both health literacy and career
preparedness. The project builds on our extensive experience in high school health-science curriculum design
and teacher professional development (PD). Our specialist co-design team includes scientists and teachers with
experience in addiction and teaching students from HUGs. They will pose core questions - What triggers cause
addictive behaviors? How do they stimulate the reward pathway? How does the reward pathway cause
addiction? How can people prone to addictive behaviors be treated? and then deploy our novel, digitally
supported, role-playing case-based pedagogy that promotes key competencies of data analysis and claims
evaluation within a collaborative problem solving, career awareness framework. Successful implementation of
novel curricula requires intensive teacher support. Our PD model prepares teachers via self-paced, graduate
level, online learning and helps them teach via workshops that model strategies for enactment of novel
pedagogies together with mentor-supported Just-In-Time problem solving as they are in the classroom. But
students require self-efficacy (SE) to prime them for further action, whether changing health behavior or setting
career goals. We will use 3 instruments we designed and validated in a well-matched comparison study to
determine how effectively the curriculum fosters SE in health literacy and career awareness. Our approach meets
the need for high-quality, integrated curricula designed for 21st century learners that helps students build the
key competencies they need to make informed choices about their health and careers, while aligning with NIDA’s
strategic plan to reduce stigma."
10886411,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Suicide is a leading cause of death for individuals 10-24. Crisis counseling is a widely utilized intervention
that can, in principle, reduce the incidence of suicide. Text-message-based crisis counseling, which can be
delivered by smart phone, may be more accessible to teens and young adults than conventional, telephone-
based systems. In recognition of this, a consortium of stakeholders in Utah promoted the development of the
SafeUT crisis text-messaging app, which has been available to teens and young adults throughout the state
since 2017. At present, SafeUT handles over 2300 crisis encounters, or “chats”, per month. We hypothesize that
SafeUT has had measurable effects on critical mental health outcomes, such as emergency room visits for
suicidal behavior, hospitalizations for suicidal behavior, and suicide death, for youth throughout the state. To
evaluate this hypothesis, we will utilize geographically-informed statistical methods to measure the distribution
of these outcomes across Utah and how they change over time in association with SafeUT use. To facilitate
causal inferences, we will compare differences in outcomes before and after SafeUT implementation in Utah to
differences in these outcomes in Colorado over the same period. We also have access to several additional key
data sources—all unique to Utah—that represent mental health outcomes for youth within the state. First,
through the Utah Population Database, we have access to the Utah Department of Health Healthcare Facility
Database and the All Payer Claims Database: the former allows us to obtain information about youth
hospitalizations and emergency room visits for all causes including mental health crises while the latter affords
us access to information related to youths’ utilization of outpatient mental health and primary care appointments.
Data for hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and outpatient visits are available to us for Colorado through
the Colorado All Payer Claims Database. Additionally, we have an established relationship with the Utah state
Office of the Medical Examiner which has curated a database of geolocated suicide deaths. Using these unique
and powerful resources, we will first (Aim 1) evaluate demographic factors associated with SafeUT utilization in
census blocks and (at a different level of analysis) school districts throughout the state. Simultaneously, we will
(Aim 2) assess the effect of SafeUT implementation on emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and outpatient
mental health visits for youth (ages 10-24) in Utah compared to Colorado. Finally, we will (Aim 3) assess the
effect of SafeUT implementation on suicide death in Utah compared to Colorado. Ultimately, findings from our
studies will facilitate alterations in SafeUT to improve service delivery and inform suicide prevention efforts
throughout the country."

Our IRACDA program is a partnership between the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) and
California State University at Monterey Bay (CSUMB), both Hispanic Serving Institutions located in central
California. This program takes a 2-pronged approach to address underrepresentation of minorities in STEM
research: 1) provide postdoctoral scholars with a rigorous research environment at UCSC and with expert
training in inclusive teaching and mentoring skills at CSUMB; 2) shrink the achievement gap of URM students
in STEM by providing CSUMB undergraduate students with additional research mentorship by postdoctoral
fellows.
 Throughout the 4-year training period, structured mentoring by research (UCSC) and teaching
(CSUMB) mentors will ensure that all postdocs receive consistent feedback with respect to the development of
research skills, pedagogy training, and career planning. Mentoring has been shown to be a key factor for
success in obtaining academic faculty positions, especially for trainees from groups underrepresented in
biomedical research. In addition to mentoring and hands-on research and teaching training, the program
incorporates classes and workshops on writing (grants and teaching statements), evidence-based pedagogy,
practice of science (Rigor and Reproducibility, Responsible Conduct of Research), leadership, and interview
skills.
 At UCSC, the IRACDA scholars will join research laboratories affiliated with the Institute for the Biology
of Stem Cells, which includes a large variety of research areas within the focus of the NIGMS mission. At
CSUMB, the Department of Biology and Chemistry will mentor the IRACDA students in lecture and laboratory
classes and in research-focused classes designed predominantly for URM students.
 CSUMB and UCSC have longstanding partnerships, including research collaborations, summer
research programs for CSUMB students at UCSC, postdoctoral teaching mentees at CSUMB, and regular
seminar presentations by UCSC faculty at CSUMB. We anticipate that this IRACDA program will further
stimulate exchange between CSUMB and UCSC to strengthen the overall exposure and opportunities for our
students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty."
10891388,"Project Summary
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a common form of soft tissue sarcoma, and our limited ability to predict
the course of metastatic disease or the risk of recurrence following resection creates significant uncertainties in
patient care. These critical unresolved problems underscore the deficit in biological understanding of factors
involved in GIST oncogenesis and clinical behavior. We have previously characterized the enhancer and
transcriptional landscape of GIST, using this information to identify a transcription factor (TF) network with
elements predictive of patient outcomes. Within this network are core TF members present in all GIST subtypes
and responsible for establishing basal GIST transcriptional output. Additional accessory TFs are present in a
disease state-specific manner, being found exclusively in indolent or aggressive disease. Supporting the TF
network, the MOZ histone acetyltransferase complex is uniquely responsible for establishing enhancers in GIST.
Our central hypothesis is that core TFs and the MOZ chromatin regulatory complex generate the GIST
transcriptional program, which is modified by state-specific accessory TFs to instruct disease behavior
and determine clinical outcomes.
 Understanding how core TFs function to control the GIST epigenome, and how accessory TFs modulate
this oncogenic framework, is of chief relevance to understanding the biology of this disease. Aim 1 of this
proposal seeks to characterize how the core TF network members interact with enhancers and other
transcriptional regulators to exert gene regulation. Because defined accessory TFs are expressed exclusively in
a disease state-specific fashion, Aim 2 will determine how these factors modify the core TF network and
influence transcriptional output through genetic disruption, and accessory TF expression in clinical samples will
be used to associate their expression with clinical outcomes. Finally, Aim 3 will define the role of the MOZ
complex, a unique dependency in GIST, in collaborating with TFs to generate the GIST transcriptional state.
These studies will define the transcriptional machinery that underlies GIST, advance our understanding of
molecular determinants of indolent and aggressive disease, and develop a biological framework for novel
approaches to predicting clinical behavior that may impact the care of patients suffering from this disease.
 As a physician-scientist dedicated to understanding and treating sarcoma, my long-term goal is to
develop an independent research program to generate a detailed understanding of GIST biology that will
transform patient care. During my proposed training period, I will perform mentored research in the laboratory of
Dr. Scott Armstrong at DFCI, with supportive co-mentorship from Dr. George Demetri; my outstanding advisory
committee will further guide my research and career development. This mentorship, together with my exceptional
institutional environment, access to superb educational programs, and myriad training opportunities, will enable
me to advance my career goals and contribute to meaningful sarcoma research."

This Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) proposal will address an urgent
need to advance the science of child obesity prevention in low-income, minority communities, a priority of the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Simultaneously, it will prepare the applicant, Michelle Katzow, MD,
MS, to become an independent investigator specializing in interventions that begin in pregnancy to prevent
child obesity using innovative and scalable delivery platforms. Risk factors for lifelong cardiometabolic
morbidity and mortality related to obesity are identifiable in pregnancy and early infancy, with the highest
prevalence in low-income, Latinx communities. Few interventions have improved child obesity related
outcomes in this high-risk group. The Starting Early Program (StEP) was designed to fill this gap. The program
delivers nutrition and parenting support sessions in the primary care setting and has significant positive
impacts on child obesity-related outcomes. These impacts are dose dependent, such that families who attend
more sessions have significantly better outcomes than families who attend fewer sessions. Many families cite
geographic distance as a major barrier to program engagement. Though the original program was delivered in
person, a second cohort receiving the program in 2020 experienced a rapid conversion to remote,
videoconference delivery due to the global pandemic. Despite many challenges posed by the pandemic,
attendance among participants in this ongoing cohort has been higher than among participants in the original,
in-person cohort. In addition to improving attendance, remote delivery has created opportunities for more
frequent sessions than would be typical in contexts outside of primary care that are otherwise well-suited for
obesity prevention programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, &
Children (WIC). WIC reaches more than half of all infants in the nation and has a high concentration of children
at risk of obesity. However, no studies have examined videoconference-based, longitudinal interventions for
child obesity prevention in WIC. This K23 proposes to develop and test Starting Early to Prevent Obesity Using
Telehealth (StEP OUT), an adapted version of StEP optimized for remote, virtual delivery through WIC. Aim 1
will identify knowledge and attitudes of key stakeholders likely to impact engagement and outcomes of StEP
OUT; Aim 2 will iteratively adapt and test StEP OUT in sequential small cohorts; and Aim 3 will conduct a pilot
randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate acceptability and feasibility of StEP OUT. In the process, the
candidate will obtain essential career development skills in four domains: 1) qualitative methods; 2) CBPR; 3)
iterative intervention adaptation; and 4) conduct of clinical trials in vulnerable populations. The resources of
Northwell Health and an expert team of interdisciplinary mentors and advisors will provide an outstanding
context to launch Dr. Katzow’s career. This project will provide the necessary data for Dr. Katzow’s future R01
submission of a large-scale RCT testing the efficacy of StEP OUT."
10891390,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Many basic processes rely on secretion of bioactive molecules by exocytosis, when membrane-enclosed
vesicles containing neurotransmitters (NTs), hormones or other molecules fuse with the plasma membrane (PM)
and release their contents through fusion pores. Neurotransmission relies on NT release at neuronal synapses,
when a multicomponent machinery senses Ca!""influx triggered by an action potential and fuses small synaptic
vesicles with the plasma membrane on sub-millisecond timescales, releasing NTs into the synaptic cleft to elicit
a post-synaptic response. Other regulated exocytosis is slower, such as hormone release from neuroendocrine
cells when a stimulus provokes large dense core vesicles to release contents after seconds or longer.
In all cases, the membrane fusion step is accomplished by the SNARE proteins, when vesicle-associated VAMP
(the v-SNARE) and two PM-associated t-SNAREs syntaxin and SNAP 25 zipper into a ternary complex, pulling
the membranes together and fusing them. However, the mechanism of membrane fusion remains unclear. Other
components in the machinery block (“clamp”) SNARE-mediated fusion, until the Ca!""signal releases the clamp.
Synaptotagmin (Syt) is the Ca!""sensor for synchronous release, but the molecular identity of the clamp and the
Ca!""-triggered unclamping mechanism are not established. Mutations in SNARE proteins and other NT release
machinery components are associated with neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, and
impaired fusion pore dilation is associated with reduced insulin secretion by β-cells of type-2 diabetics.
The proposed research aims to use mathematical modeling to establish the mechanisms of regulated membrane
fusion and the mechanisms that regulate the vesicle and its pore for controlled contents release following fusion.
From the previous funding period, we have working molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of SNARE-mediated
membrane fusion and of the NT release machinery incorporating the core SNARE and Syt components. The
simulations used sufficiently coarse-grained (CG) representations to achieve the computationally demanding
millisecond physiological timescales of fusion and release. Aim 1 is to advance the SNARE-mediated fusion
simulations with more realistic SNAREs, and to use machine learning to catalogue the pathways to membrane
fusion as a function of the size of the fusing vesicles and other key variables. Mutated SNAREs will be simulated
and compared to experiments by collaborators. Aim 2 is to use continuum mathematical modeling to establish
the structure, energetics and evolution of the fused vesicle-PM complex and its fusion pore, and the mechanisms
of SNARE- and Syt-mediated pore dilation. Aim 3 is to advance the MD simulations of the NT release machinery
by introducing molecularly explicit representation of the membranes, and by incorporating additional components
as their interactions become experimentally characterized, toward a long-term goal of “reconstituting” the
machinery in silico. Simulations will test hypothesized Ca!""-triggered unclamping schemes, and will be run with
mutations in the SNARE and Syt components that will be implemented experimentally by our collaborators."

10891464,"Although glia, the non-neuronal cells of the brain, are increasingly implicated in aging and neurodegenerative disease, we know very little about how these cells interact with neurons during aging. Neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease, are characterized by aggregated misfolded proteins, which can cause cell death and dysfunction. Cells have developed systems to detect and fix these problems in a cellular compartment-specific manner; however, these responses to protein misfolding start to fail as organisms age. We have previously shown that neurons send out signals to alert other cells when they experience protein toxicity and stress, which could be a clue towards how the body could naturally fix protein misfolding in neurodegenerative disease. However, no one has yet investigated how glia respond to protein stress in the cytosolic compartment of the cell.  Our laboratory previously showed that neuronal over-expression of the main regulator of the cytosolic unfolded protein response, heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1), is able to signal to distal cells to increase healthy protein folding effectors and help organisms live longer. Here, we propose that glial cells can also signal the heat shock response to coordinate a pan-organismal response and promote longevity (Aim 1). Our approach in this aim takes advantage of the genetic tractability, short lifespan, and simple imaging of the model organism, C. elegans, to study non-cell autonomous signaling between tissues in aging.  To further address the role of glia in rescuing neurons from protein toxicity, we will examine microglia in the mammalian brain. Here, we ask whether healthy microglia can rescue neurons stressed with tau protein misfolding, which is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and whether aged microglia might be defective in their aid to neurons. We will assess how microglia surveil the internal protein homeostasis of neurons (Aim 2). To do this, we will take advantage of transcriptome analysis, inducible mouse disease models, and rapidly improving cell culture methods.  Data generated through this proposal will shed new light on how the brain deals with protein stress and will identify novel signaling mechanisms of glial cells that will improve our understanding of neurodegenerative disease pathology."

10892823,"Project Summary
 Minimally invasive neural modulation at sub-millimeter spatial resolution remains a critical yet unmet
biomedical need. Researchers have explored a broad spectrum of electromagnetic wave and developed
wireless neuromodulation methods. Due to its long wavelength, transcranial magnetic stimulation does not
provide sufficient spatial resolution to target a functional unit such as a single ocular dominance column in the
visual cortex or a diseased peripheral nerve. On the other hand, photons, with their short wavelength, offer
micrometer-scale spatial precision but can barely penetrate couple hundred micrometers into the tissue, not to
mention the human skull. Microwave (MW), with frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz, fills the gap
between optical wave and magnetic wave, yet, has rarely been explored for neuromodulation. We propose a
minimally invasive neuromodulation device by taking advantage of a microwave split ring resonator (SRR)
design. The SRR has a perimeter of approximately one half of MW wavelength, thus acting as a resonant
antenna. It couples the microwave wirelessly and concentrates the microwave at the gap, producing a
localized electrical field of ~100 μm in space. Our scientific premise is based on the nonthermal neural
inhibitory effect of microwave and the resonance effect of the SRR. The SRR produces concentrated
microwave and allows for neuromodulation beyond the microwave diffraction limit, reaching ~100 μm spatial
precision. In the proposed work, we will design and fabricate an implantable SRR with titanium for its superior
biocompatibility. We will then validate the SRR’s potential in neural inhibition using primary neurons in vitro and
a mouse epilepsy model in vivo. By accomplishing the proposed studies, we will have developed a
biocompatible and implantable neuromodulation device. The centimeter-scale penetration depth provided by
microwave and the sub-millimeter spatial precision provided by SRR promises broad biomedical applications.
For central nervous system, our technology allows minimally invasive transcranial modulation of neural
activities inside brain and for clinical treatment of epilepsy. A multi-disciplinary team with complementary
expertise is assembled to implement the proposed activities."
10892826,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on gene discovery and molecular diagnostics for Mendelian
conditions (MCs) is hard to overstate. However, to provide affected individuals with precise natural history,
recurrence risk, and prognosis in clinical settings, identification of pathogenic variant(s)/genotypes alone is often
insufficient. This is a challenge most notably for genes that cause more than one MC or ~25% of all genes that
underlie MCs. In such an instance, even with a known genotype a patient's phenotype has to be compared to
that of all MCs caused by variants in a gene to determine which MC, if any, is the likely diagnosis or whether
patient instead has a novel condition. This comparison is increasingly difficult because delineation of the ~5,100
MCs currently known has typically been based on subjective grouping of affected individuals by phenotypic
similarity. We propose to develop a quantitative framework for assessing overlap among the distributions of
phenotypes due to pathogenic genotypes the same gene and apply this framework genome-wide. NGS has
enabled identification of causal genotypes in hundreds of thousands of individuals with MCs, providing a
sufficiently large dataset that it is now feasible to use machine learning to quantitatively and systematically
identify “clusters” of co-occurring genotypes and phenotypic features for each known gene. We will refine and
validate our approach by comparing differences between conventionally-delineated and quantitatively-delineated
MCs and by assessing the similarity of individuals with well-studied atypical phenotypes/genotypes to
quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will then apply the optimal strategy across the genome to generate a “next-
generation morbid map” based on quantitatively-delineated MCs. We will also apply machine learning
approaches to identify genomic properties associated with the propensity for each gene to underlie multiple MCs
(i.e., the numeric contribution of each gene to the morbid map or phenotropy). This will enable a more precise
and complete understanding of the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of each MC, enable more objective
diagnosis of individuals with atypical phenotypes, and more robustly identify the existence of multiple MCs
among individuals with non-specific “class” phenotypes (e.g., developmental delay, autism, hearing impairment).
We will make all newly developed methods publicly available via interactive and programmatic web-based tools
to facilitate extension of this work to other human and model organism datasets."
10892827,"SUMMARY
We propose to develop the foundations of a platform for direct sequencing of native, full-length protein strands
using unfoldase-coupled nanopore array technology. In principle, this technology could be used to identify
protein primary sequence, in addition to certain post-translational modifications (PTMs) found in prokaryotic
and eukaryotic cells, with single-molecule resolution. It is a foundational advance over existing and other
next-gen proteomic technologies such as Edman degradation, mass spectrometry, fluorescent label
approaches, and immunoaffinity-based methods that suffer from limitations in read length, throughput,
sensitivity, labeling efficiency, and/or the availability of suitable affinity reagents. Nanopore sequencing of intact
protein strands overcomes these limitations because the ~1 nanometer-long sensor directly interacts with the
protein strand as it is linearly-driven through the pore by the unfoldase motor protein, manifesting
sequence-specific ionic current signals. Thus, complete sequence analysis of native protein molecules can be
achieved. This method is a natural technical extension of current nanopore sequencing platforms that use
molecular motors to control movement of nucleic acid strands through nanopores in DNA/RNA sequencing.
During the grant period, we will pursue three specific aims: 1) Establish baseline methods of controlled protein
translocation through nanopore sensor arrays using unfoldase motors; 2) Develop computational and
bioinformatic methods to translate raw nanopore signal data into protein sequence information (amino acid
calling and PTM detection); and 3) Establish techniques for analysis of native proteins and proteomic samples.
Our team of investigators is uniquely qualified to take on this project:
i) We pioneered the analysis of full-length protein strands using unfoldase-coupled nanopore sensors and
recently demonstrated that the Oxford Nanopore MinION nanopore array device can be used to directly detect
peptide strands and resolve single amino acid substitutions (Nivala).
ii) Co-investigators on this application have elucidated and exquisitely characterized the enzymatic
mechanisms of unfoldase motor activity through in vitro biochemical, single-molecule, and structural studies
(Martin), and have led the development of nanopore raw signal analyses for sequencing of nucleic acids,
including direct RNA sequencing, genome and transcriptome-wide detection of modified bases, and assembly
of a human genome using ultra-long DNA nanopore reads (Jain).
iii) Collaborators will provide access to enabling nanopore technology platforms and expertise, including
highly-parallel nanopore sensor arrays and customized nanopore proteins, and offer natural routes to
technology transfer (Oxford Nanopore), contribute to characterization and comparison of project results to
traditional analysis methods such as protein mass spectrometry (Guttman), and advise on compelling
technological applications that will be enabled by successful execution of this project (Timp)."
10892941,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overarching goal of this renewal application is to elucidate the molecular basis for how human calprotectin
(CP, S100A8/S100A9 oligomer) functions in the metal-withholding innate immune response, and to evaluate its
impact on the physiology of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which cause the majority of urinary tract
infections in humans. Transition metals are essential nutrients for all organisms, and the availability of these
nutrients plays a critical role during microbial infection. Consequently, the human innate immune system
launches a metal-withholding response and deploys metal-sequestering host-defense proteins into the
extracellular space to limit metal availability and hinder pathogen growth. CP is an abundant and functionally
versatile metal-withholding protein; it sequesters multiple metal nutrients including Mn(II), Fe(II), Ni(II) and
Zn(II). Recent studies by our laboratory and others provide compelling evidence that the molecular speciation
of extracellular CP is a heterogenous ensemble of different species that arises from different metal-bound
forms as well as oxidative post-translational modifications. We hypothesize that this complex molecular
speciation of CP, including the occurrence of methionine oxidation and disulfide bonding, has profound
consequences for its extracellular function and lifetime. Recent studies by our laboratory and others also
demonstrate that CP is a Cu-withholding protein. We hypothesize that CP sequesters both Cu(II) and Cu(I) and
that this function impacts the physiology and metal homeostasis in diverse bacterial pathogens including
UPEC. In Aim 1, we will examine disulfide bond formation within and between CP heterodimers, the
biophysical properties of these disulfide-linked species, and their ability to sequester metals from bacterial
pathogens. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the Cu(II/I)-binding properties of CP and the consequences of multi-
metal sequestration by CP on UPEC as a case study. We expect that these investigations will advance the
molecular model for how CP contributes to the metal-sequestering innate immune response, underscore the
importance of considering CP species that result from oxidative posttranslational modification, and elucidate
the molecular basis for Cu withholding by CP. Moreover, we expect that our studies of the interplay of CP and
UPEC will provide new insight into how the host and pathogen compete for Cu and other nutrient metals. We
further expect that the outcomes of this initiative may guide the design and development of novel diagnostic,
preventative and therapeutic approaches for microbial infections and other pathologies such as inflammatory
diseases that involve CP."
10892802,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-associated condition in which a
clonal, somatic mutation that is associated with myeloid malignancies is detectable in the peripheral blood at a
variant allele fraction of at least 2%. Commonly mutated genes include the DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1
genes, all of which are present in myeloid malignancies and are commonly acquired early in the genetic
ontogeny of these cancers. Individuals with CHIP do not have a hematologic malignancy or altered blood
counts, but have a 10 to 50-fold increased risk of progression to hematologic malignancy, depending on the
size of the clone and the specific somatic mutation. We propose to examine the biology of individual mutations
and to understand cell-autonomous and cell non-autonomous mechanisms of clonal dominance. We will
examine progression from CHIP to malignancy and the ongoing addiction of the malignant cells to the truncal
mutations, thereby validating these mutations as therapeutic targets. We will integrate these biological studies
with large-scale genetic studies to examine the risk of malignant transformation and clinical consequences of
specific mutations. Finally, in the context of solid tumors, we will examine how CHIP generates tumor-
infiltrating macrophages with aberrant function, and how these somatically mutated macrophages influence
solid tumor biology, immune response, and response to immunotherapy."
10899175,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Adolescence is a critical period of development characterized by rapid physiological and behavioral changes.
These widespread changes mark adolescence as a period of particular vulnerability to adverse experiences,
such as chronic stress. Indeed, chronic stress during adolescence is widely recognized as a risk factor for the
development of multiple psychiatric disorders, including addiction. With self-reporting of chronic stress on the
rise in adolescents—especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic—there is an urgent need to understand
the effects of adolescent chronic stress on the neural mechanisms underlying behaviors linked to addiction.
Here, I examine one such behavior, punishment-resistant reward seeking, in which animals maintain their pursuit
of reward in the face of negative consequences.
This proposal aims to establish that a projection from the central amygdala (CeA) to the lateral substantia nigra
(SNL) is a key interface between stress and punishment-resistant reward-seeking. I hypothesize that chronic
stress in adolescence leads to enduring hyperexcitability of SNL-projecting CeA neurons, causing increased
inhibition of SNL GABA neurons and a net disinhibition of SNL dopamine neurons. I hypothesize that this
disinhibition of SNL dopamine neurons increases punishment-resistant reward seeking. I will test this hypothesis
using operant behavior, in vivo fiber photometry, and chemogenetics (Aim 1) alongside in vitro patch-clamp
electrophysiology (Aim 2). I will characterize long-term adaptations in the CeAàSNL pathway after adolescent
chronic stress along with the links between those neural adaptations and changes in the propensity for
punishment-resistant reward-seeking. My proposal will aid in the identification of the biological and behavioral
causes of addiction, in accordance with NIDA’s goals.
Over the course of this fellowship, I will receive training in teaching, communication, programming, and grant
writing. I will further my knowledge of drug abuse and addiction through coursework, practice, and conference
participation. Ultimately, this fellowship will support my goal of becoming an independent investigator studying
how perturbations in subcortical circuits during development lead to addiction and other psychiatric disorders."
10892030,"This application is for a new T32 institutional training program to support postdoctoral research in intellectual and
developmental disabilities (IDDs). The Rose F. Kennedy Center and its program of IDD research has for 50 years been in
the forefront of discoveries in brain development, function and disease. Today, we are in an era of unprecedented
discovery of new genes and gene variants, as well as environmental and related conditions, linked to IDD. At the same
time, we are armed with remarkable advances in modern research tools in neuroscience, genetics and in cell and
molecular biology. Our goal here is to create a vibrant new training program that successfully brings together talented
postdoctoral fellows working with world-class investigators and their laboratories to develop the next generation of
highly motivated and successful IDD-focused research scientists. The four broad objectives of this program are (1) to
provide in-depth research experiences and didactic training in biomedical science for highly talented postdoctoral
fellows in a manner that shapes their lifetime career objectives and at the same time fosters discovery and advancement
of our understanding of, and ability to treat, specific types of IDDs; (2) to build effective cross-discipline communication
between basic research laboratories and IDD-focused clinics, sensitizing our postdoctoral trainees to the perspective of
IDD-focused clinicians and vice versa; (3) to extend this network of cooperation between trainees and their laboratories,
and clinicians and their clinics, to encompass whenever possible the parents/care providers and IDD-affected patients;
and (4) to provide career guidance and professional development to our trainees, with this effort coupled to our goal to
recruit and train members of underrepresented minority groups. To accomplish these important goals, we have assem-
bled a team of 36 highly talented primary trainers selected from our 100-member Rose F. Kennedy IDDRC membership.
These individuals come from 15 basic science and clinical departments and span a host of research approaches to IDD –
from human investigations including iPSC studies, to mouse, fish, fly and worm models of IDDs. In addition, we have
developed a structured training program designed to broaden the trainees IDD-focus well beyond the immediate lab
experience. We have also established a plan of mentoring committees to guide our trainees along with evaluation
processes allowing us to continually monitor and modify our program to ensure we are on track to our stated goals.
Finally, we have engaged our clinical partners working with patients with IDDs and established a strong role for them in
the training program. This program brings our institution’s considerable depth, rigorous scientific approach, and
tradition of innovation to bear on the important study of the cause, treatment and prevention of intellectual disability."

Exposure of pregnant women to environmental pollution and toxicants significantly increase risks to mother’s
health after birth. Specifically, pollution is association with increased rates of maternal mortality and morbidities
of infertility, spontaneous preterm birth, asthma, allergy, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, as well
as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. The maternal immune system plays a critical role in establishing,
maintaining, and completing a healthy pregnancy and the constant state of growth and proliferation of this
system makes it sensitive to pollutants. Insufficient immunological adaption in pregnancy is associated with
many diseases during and after pregnancy. Although epidemiologic studies point to links between specific
environmental toxicants and adverse outcomes in mothers, to date, there have been little to no studies of the
effects of air pollution toxicants on pregnant mothers’ immune health during and after pregnancy. We
hypothesize that chronic exposure to ambient air pollution, specifically fine particulate matter PM2.5, will
increase immune dysregulation in pregnant women during, and in short- (immediate postpartum, 1 yr after
birth) and long-term periods (3 years after birth) after pregnancy. Using previously collected biosamples from
pregnant (n=200) and nonpregnant (n=200) women exposed to high and low levels of pollution (chiefly PM2.5),
we will 1) test whether immune cell subsets are different in identity and function in pregnant vs. non pregnant
women exposed to high vs. low pollution; 2) identify and validate epigenetic molecular mechanisms driving
immune dysfunction in pregnancy vs no pregnancy with high vs low PM2.5 exposure using methylation,
EpiTOF, ATAC-seq, and histone ChIP-seq; and 3) map T cell receptor diversity to immune dysfunction in
pregnancy vs non pregnancy with high vs. low PM2.5 exposure. If the aims are met, this study will allow us to
identify the drivers of immune dysfunction and potential modifiable factors for the future. We will explore how
these immune findings are associated with the outcomes of diseases for which we have previously collected
metadata: asthma, infections, allergy, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, preterm birth, and autoimmune disease. Most
importantly, our findings will likely impact public health and policy decisions surrounding air pollution exposure
in a highly vulnerable population such as pregnant women."

Abundant preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that vitamin D possesses anti-neoplastic activity, and that
individuals with higher plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have lower risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)
and improved survival from CRC. Despite compelling evidence implicating vitamin D in CRC, critical questions
remain about whether these findings reflect a true causal relationship, and what the biological mechanisms of
vitamin D activity are. Our central hypothesis is that vitamin D supplementation to achieve sufficient levels of
25(OH)D leads to improved survival in CRC patients, possibly through activation of anti-tumor immunity. We will
test this hypothesis within two novel randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation: a) SOLARIS,
the first phase III RCT of high- vs. low-dose vitamin D3 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with met-
astatic CRC (mCRC) that was borne directly out of the SUNSHINE phase II RCT that we completed during the
current funding period; and b) RCT of preoperative high-dose vitamin D3 vs. placebo in patients with resectable
liver metastases for examination of vitamin D biology in these tumors, which harbor a particularly immunosup-
pressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and account for a significant proportion of deaths from CRC. We will
also conduct a preclinical trial of vitamin D +/- immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in a novel mouse model of
CRC liver metastasis to explore whether vitamin D can overcome resistance to immunotherapy. In Aim 1, we
will investigate the impact of supplemental vitamin D on plasma 25(OH)D levels and progression-free survival
(PFS) among mCRC patients enrolled in the SOLARIS phase III RCT, and explore predictive biomarkers of
clinical efficacy. In Aim 2, we will investigate the impact of supplemental vitamin D on the TME of primary colon
tumors and liver metastases in patients enrolled on the preoperative vitamin D RCT using spatial transcriptional
profiling and multiplex immunofluorescence. In Aim 3, we will investigate the impact of supplemental vitamin D
+/- ICIs on tumor response and anti-tumor immunity in mouse models of microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC with
and without liver metastases using multiparameter flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing. In summary,
this translational proposal leverages unprecedented RCTs of vitamin D, cutting-edge technologies, and multidis-
ciplinary collaborations to extend our previous work and take the next critical steps in understanding vitamin D
in CRC. Our findings will lead to incorporation of vitamin D into standard of care and inform new combination
strategies with immunotherapy, which has thus far been ineffective in MSS CRC. Importantly, the global impact
of an inexpensive and safe therapy such as vitamin D cannot be underestimated for improving the prognosis of
this lethal disease."
10892153,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 SYNGAP1-related intellectual disability is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in
the SYNGAP1 gene. SYNGAP1 encodes SynGAP, which is a highly abundant protein in the post-
synaptic density of excitatory synapses. At synapses, SynGAP functions to repress downstream NMDAR
signaling and AMPAR trafficking through its inhibition of small GTPases. Translocation of SynGAP out of
the post-synaptic density is required to allow NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) in cultured
neurons. In the absence of SynGAP, NMDAR-dependent plasticity is unrestrained leading to alterations
in synapse strength, spine structure, and plasticity. While the functions of SynGAP have been well-
studied in the cortex and hippocampus, the striatum also exhibits high levels of SynGAP expression.
Striatal projection neurons are GABA-ergic neurons covered in a dense array of dendritic spines, which
receive excitatory inputs from the cortex. SynGAP is therefore positioned to play a key role in gating
transmission and plasticity at striatal synapses. Despite this, SynGAP’s functions in striatal neurons have
not yet been defined. Importantly, several of the major symptoms of SYNGAP1 disorder are likely to
involve alterations in striatal activity including motor developmental delay, repetitive and restrictive
behaviors, and other behavioral problems.
 In this project, we will elucidate the consequences of SynGAP loss on striatal synaptic function
and determine whether loss of SynGAP from striatal neurons is sufficient to induce behavioral alterations
relevant for SYNGAP1 disorder. Specifically, we will determine how loss of SynGAP impacts striatal
synaptic development, transmission and plasticity. In addition, we will use imaging approaches to
investigate how SynGAP deficiency affects spinogenesis, spine number and morphology. To determine
whether deletion of Syngap1 from striatal neurons is sufficient to alter disease-relevant behaviors, we will
investigate how haploinsufficiency of Syngap1 in cell type-specific knock-out mice affects motor function,
habit learning, and behavioral flexibility. Finally, we will test whether restoration of Syngap1 expression
selectively in striatal projection neurons can improve synaptic and behavioral abnormalities using genetic
rescue strategies. Together, this work will 1) further our understanding of SynGAP’s functions at striatal
synapses, 2) identify the striatal cell type(s) most relevant for the manifestations of SYNGAP1 disorder,
and 3) define critical periods for the onset and rescue of disease-related phenotypes."

 The impressive amount of data generated by experimental HIV/SIV vaccines has led to the realization
that protection will most likely requires 2 levels of barriers, the initial one at the mucosal port of entry and if
breached, a second set of systemic defenses. The capacity of humoral and cellular immune responses in
mucosal tissues to block or contain replication at the initial stage of virus transmission may have a profound
impact on the ability of a vaccinated host to resist infection, even in the case when virus progresses beyond
the port of entry, allowing the systemic response more time to control or eradicate the incoming pathogen.
 We hypothesized that there are two necessary features for a successful vaccine: 1) A prolonged if not
life-long stimulation of the immune system with viral antigens to maintain “alert” immune responses; and 2) a
targeted immune response at the site of primary replication of HIV. A vaccine approach that simultaneously
addresses these two issues would have the potential to achieve solid, long-term active protection. To fulfill
these requirements, we have developed an original strategy to successfully deliver a vaccine to mucosal sites
that provide antigen stimuli at recurrent intervals and elicit protective mucosal immune responses. Our
strategy leverages epithelial stem cells as permanent but non-expressing source of viral antigen while their
differentiated offspring express and present antigen to the local immune system, along the reproductive cycle.
Using a single cycle SIV (SIVsc) approach, which has been shown to be safe compared to traditional
attenuated vaccines, we have cloned the SIVsc genome under the control of the involucrin promoter (pINV-
SIVsc), a terminally differentiated keratinocyte specific promoter. When administered, the vaccine targets and
transduces basal epithelial stem cells from vaginal tissues. These then proliferate and differentiate into mature
epithelial cells, triggering SIV antigen expression via the promoter and leading to both direct and cross priming.
 For this project, we propose: 1) To confirm and further improve the efficacy and safety profile of the
pINV-SIVsc vaccine in female macaques; 2) To visualize and optimize vaccine delivery, and investigate the
mechanisms of action underlying protection; and, 3) Using our best optimized vaccine strategy, demonstrate
protection from virus acquisition and/or viral replication in vivo and determine the correlates of protection or
control against repeated low-dose vaginal challenges with heterologous SIV."

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompass a wide range of symptoms, including urinary incontinence,
urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, bladder pain, urinary tract infections, and voiding symptoms. There is an
extensive literature describing the many approaches to treatment of LUTS, but less is known about prevention.
The “Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (PLUS) Consortium is a transdisciplinary scientific network
established to expand research beyond the treatment of LUTS to promotion of bladder health and prevention
of LUTS in adolescents and women across the life course. Despite many epidemiologic studies on risk factors
for LUTS, little research has examined factors that promote bladder health. One key gap is in understanding of
what defines healthy voiding and toileting behaviors and how these behaviors affect bladder health over time.
Our overarching hypothesis is that maladaptive voiding and toileting behaviors contribute to poorer bladder
health among adolescent and adult women. The primary aim of this proposal is to continue our participation
as a clinical research center in PLUS and collaborate with other centers to design and conduct a longitudinal
cohort study that lays the foundation for developing future prevention interventions to promote bladder health
and prevent LUTS. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) team is an interdisciplinary group of
investigators with collective expertise in LUTS clinical research, behavioral medicine, geriatric medicine,
adolescent medicine, prevention science, public health, epidemiology, biostatistics, health disparities, and
medical sociology. Our team is poised to contribute expertise on 1) design and conduct of longitudinal studies,
2) evaluation and treatment of LUTS (including clinical examination and bio-specimen collection), 3) qualitative
methods, 4) recruitment and retention of diverse samples of participants with/without LUTS, and 5) community
engagement. The second aim is to build on the longitudinal cohort study to examine two additional potential
risk/protective factors for bladder health and LUTS that are plausible targets for future intervention studies. In
addition to testing a number of other factors in the national cohort, we propose to examine 1) the role of
neighborhood disadvantage in relation to voiding and toileting behaviors, using the Area Deprivation Index, and
2) the association of functional ability with voiding and toileting behaviors using gait speed and bio-markers of
inflammation. Understanding the role of these factors will support the development of models for identifying at-
risk individuals and groups, as well as inform education initiatives. The third aim is to develop and conduct
pilot foundational studies related to promoting healthy voiding and toileting behaviors. The first study aims to
understand voiding and toileting behaviors across environments among adolescents using a mobile application
with geographic information system mapping. The second aims to develop a mobile health self-management
educational program for promoting healthy bladder behaviors. These projects will lay the foundation for the
development of future research on interventions to promote bladder health across the life course."

Precise regulation of M-Phase in oocyte meiosis is essential for successful embryo development and female
fertility. Highlighting this, ~1% of women are subfertile/infertile due to meiotic failure. Despite this, the precise
molecular mechanisms governing M-Phase is only partly understood in oocytes. This research will focus on the
phosphatase PP1 (Protein Phosphatase 1). PP1 is an important regulator of mitotic M-Phase and is
responsible for ~50% of all dephosphorylations. However, the specific roles of PP1 in mammalian oocytes is
unclear. PP1 is a holoenzyme consisting of a catalytic subunit (PP1c) and one to two PP1-interacting proteins
(PIPs). In mammalian cells, there are three PP1cs (α, β, and γ) and >180 PIPs. Historically, PP1 research has
focused on PP1c in isolation, leading to the misconception that PP1c is promiscuous. However, PIPs control
localization, enzyme activity, and substrates of PP1c. Additionally, disease states mediated by aberrant PP1
function (e.g., heart disease) result from changes in the PP1c interactome, and not PP1c. Furthermore, studies
of PP1c in oocytes, using dual PP1/PP2A inhibitors, overexpression, and anti-PP1c antibody injections, have
yielded conflicting outcomes. Importantly, my preliminary data using a specific and novel PIP-based approach
to inhibit PP1c has found PP1 activity is essential for meiosis I completion. To gain further insights into oocyte
meiosis, this proposed research will: (1) determine the essential roles of PP1 in oocyte meiosis and; (2)
develop novel tools for the specific and temporal control of PP1c throughout M-Phase to resolve controversies
and unknowns about the roles of PP1 in oocytes. Aim 1 will determine the function of PP1c in oocyte meiosis
with a new PIP-based manipulation approach combined with inducible protein degradation. In Aim 2, a novel
method for reversible small molecule-mediated caging will be developed -- auxin-controllable caging (ACC).
ACC will be used to specifically and temporally regulate PP1c, further defining the roles of PP1c in oocyte
meiosis. Of note, this new state-of-the-art tool can be used to study any protein-of-interest. Finally, Aim 3 will
use both hypothesis-driven and discovery-driven approaches to determine PP1 holoenzyme function and
formation during meiosis. Specifically, this aim will establish the function of two PP1 holoenzymes
(PP1c:PNUTS and PP1c:NIPP1) during oocyte meiosis, and map the PP1c:PIP interactome throughout oocyte
meiosis. Overall, this project will shed light on a poorly understood, but health-relevant phosphatase, PP1,
elucidating its functions in oocytes and more broadly M-Phase regulation. Ultimately, this work will develop a
highly valuable tool for the research community, and inform the development of novel treatments for M-Phase
based diseases including infertility."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by disabling social impairments and restrictive, repetitive
behaviors that emerge in early childhood and persist throughout the lifespan, affecting 2.2% of adults in the
United States. As they age, autistic adults face a range of adverse outcomes, including significantly higher rates
of chronic disease, neurodegenerative conditions, and early mortality. My recent electroencephalography (EEG)
findings further reveal altered trajectories of functional brain aging in ASD, in line with reports of excessive
cognitive aging. However, the mechanisms underlying these age-related declines remain unknown, and by the
time that
age-related decline manifests behaviorally and cognitively crucial opportunities for risk prevention have
already passed. New ‘epigenetic clock’ techniques index the progression of cellular aging processes based on
DNA methylation (DNAm) patterns, providing proxy measures of biological age that predict later cognitive, health,
functional declines, and mortality. I will explore if these sensitive measures of individual aging trajectories may
help to identify autistic individuals at high risk of poor outcomes before patterns of brain activity or behavior begin
to change, specifically asking: (1) Is biological risk for poor aging outcomes increased in autistic adults at midlife?
(2) Are variations in epigenetic risk linked to brain aging markers? (3) Which clinical and environmental
differences during childhood and early adulthood contribute to biological risk variations in this population?
The proposed career development award will allow me to address these aims through new integrated methods.
Facilitated by a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors (Dr. Lord, Dr. Carroll, Dr. Geschwind, and Dr. Senturk),
I will build upon my existing expertise in developmental neuroscience and ASD to acquire new training in
epigenetic and longitudinal lifespan methodologies. I will collect epigenetic and neural (EEG) aging measures
from a unique and deeply phenotyped cohort of individuals with (N=118) and without ASD (N=39) who have
been prospectively followed since age two and are currently 32-36 years old (The ‘Early Diagnosis Study; EDX).
Biological age will be quantified from saliva-derived DNAm patterns using three different well-established
epigenetic clock algorithms. Brain aging will be measured using EEG markers of peak frequency (7-13Hz), which
captures characteristic age-related oscillatory slowing. Together, these studies will inform potential strategies to
identify and address age-related risks in ASD from earlier in development.
The proposed training goals will be the catalyst for a novel and innovative research program focused on lifespan
changes in ASD across multiple levels of measurement and lay the foundation for a longitudinal R01 investigation
of epigenetic, neural, and cognitive aging in the EDX cohort. This research program will address a crucial gap in
our understanding of long-term lifespan influences in ASD and provide crucial opportunities to mitigate long-term
personal and public health burdens in the rapidly growing population of older autistic adults."

This proposal is responsive to NIA solicitation PAR-22-093/NOT-AG-21-048 for projects involving the
development of digital technology for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. It is motivated by the need for
novel low-cost and noninvasive digital biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease that can flag early changes in at-risk
individuals before cognitive symptoms surface. Changes in sleep patterns have been linked to a future dementia
diagnosis in older adults. These changes can be tracked in a passive and unobtrusive way using a wide variety
of low-cost consumer wearables. Our overarching objective is to deploy cutting-edge wearables for sleep, heart
rate, and activity monitoring in an older adult cohort with elevated genetic susceptibility to Alzheimer’s disease
from the Mass General Brigham Biobank in order to quantitatively evaluate each device, to develop artificial
intelligence (AI) approaches for digital phenotyping of Alzheimer’s disease, and to perform hypothesis-driven
statistical modeling for understanding the interplay between Alzheimer’s genetic risk, sleep, and Alzheimer’s
pathophysiology. To capture early changes, this project will rely on a unique pool of older adult participants who
have elevated polygenic risk of Alzheimer’s disease but are cognitively normal at baseline. We will acquire (i)
electroencephalography (EEG) data using an EEG headband, (ii) heart rate, accelerometry, blood oxygenation,
and temperature data using a smartwatch, (iii) heart rate variability data using a smart ring, (iv) plasma biomarker
measures for amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration (ATN), and (v) cognitive scores. The data will be collected
longitudinally at two timepoints with a gap of 2-3 years from N=260 elderly participants at the highest genetic risk
for Alzheimer’s disease and 40 low-risk controls based on their polygenic risk scores. We will rigorously validate
all three wearables by benchmarking each against polysomnography (PSG), which is the established gold
standard for sleep monitoring, and report their accuracies at measuring sleep and heart rate features. We will
develop an AI model known as a transformer to learn composite features from EEG, heart rate, and
accelerometry data that predict Alzheimer’s pathophysiology. Finally, we will use this data to test the hypothesis
that pathway-specific polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and sleep disruption associates or interacts with
distinct sleep features to predict Alzheimer’s pathophysiological or cognitive endpoints. The project features an
interdisciplinary investigative team with expertise in AI, human wearables studies, sleep genetics, sleep EEG
quantitative analysis, preclinical Alzheimer’s neurology, PSG scoring, fluid biomarkers for Alzheimer’s disease,
and biostatistics. We do not propose this technology as a substitute for lab-based approaches to detect
Alzheimer’s pathophysiology or cognitive change. We envision that the combination of an unobtrusive wearable
device, genetic risk assessment, and AI tools for wearables-based Alzheimer’s digital phenotyping could
identify/flag at-risk individuals in the general population for clinical follow-up. Thus, this project could thus have
broad clinical impact in the Alzheimer’s field."

Racial injustice and oppression are prevalent and devastating causes of health disparities. Black women are 2-
3 times more likely than White women to experience severe maternal morbidity (SMM) and to die from
pregnancy-related causes. The maternal health crisis is particularly profound in Georgia, where Black women
account for 35% of all births and the pregnancy-related mortality ratio is 1.5 times higher than national
estimates. Research that examines disparities in maternal health often focus on individual-level behaviors
when the root of the issues are better conceptualized as being within structures and systems that perpetuate
injustice intergenerationally and over the life course. This study will address three major gaps in the literature
to date. First, traditional measures of structural racial discrimination (SRD) often fail to capture the full range of
historical oppression, and research is needed to explore an array of measures to better understand and
address the contemporary effects of historically unjust practices, policies, and structures. Second, it is unclear
what multi-level strategies could mitigate the impact of SRD on SMM and promote resilience for Black women.
Third, with research seeking to address multi-level inequities, it is important to integrate qualitative methods
that center the experiences of Black women within SRD in order to approach solutions. The objective of this
proposal is to ascertain new information from diverse perspectives using a robust mixed-methods
approach to understand how SRD affects Black maternal health outcomes at the population, health
system, and individual level. At the population level, we will conduct a secondary data analysis to estimate
county-level associations between measures of SRD and Black-White SMM disparities (Aim 1). Recognizing
that provider practices are influenced by individual biases and institutional structures, we will use a causal
attribution framework to characterize physician perceptions regarding the underlying causes of Black-White
maternal health disparities and the racial climate of the organizations in which they practice. (Aim 2). Lastly, we
will assess Black women’s lived experiences of obstetric and institutional racism and how these experiences
influence access to care and health status before, during, and after pregnancy, using a framework of radical
healing for communities of color to identify risk and resilience coping processes. (Aim 3). This multi-level and
mixed-methods study will allow us to contextualize Black maternal outcomes and capture structural
intersectionality constructs that have yet to be studied. Our findings will provide critical insight on potentially
modifiable factors for addressing the current maternal health crisis in a southern state where the legacy of
slavery and oppression lingers."

This project evaluates the contribution of contact activation to the progression of vascular device-related
blood coagulation and thrombus formation. Our work and findings to date have opened the window towards
the development of safer antithrombotic strategies. Our research will generate new knowledge supporting
the development of novel anticoagulants that lack dose-limiting toxicity, and cause less bleeding than current
drugs, while also helping to identify medical conditions that could benefit from the therapeutic use of these
contact activation inhibitors.
Vascular devices such as stents, grafts, hemodialyzers and oxygenators can activate blood and often
require the use of systemic antithrombotics to reduce the incidence or severity of device failure and
thrombotic events. Currently marketed antithrombotic drugs can help reduce clot formation on vascular
devices, but all increase the risk of bleeding. For instance, 30% of severely ill neonates that are treated with
extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) experience severe bleeding complications, including
gastrointestinal, pulmonary and brain hemorrhage, which contribute to the high mortality rate of neonatal
ECMO. These and other vascular device-associated thrombotic and treatment-associated bleeding
complications signify the unmet medical need to improve the outcome of vascular interventions, including
permanent intravascular devices like stents and various forms of temporal extracorporeal organ support.
This program will now take a new direction to study the molecular mechanisms by which vascular devices
activate FXII to initiate thrombus formation at the blood-biomaterial interface, and evaluate the utility of
inhibiting the contact activation pathway in combination with anticoagulants or reduced platelet function. We
focus on FXII and FXI because (1) there appears to be a causal relationship between contact activation and
vascular device failure, and (2) targeting the contact activation pathway as a therapeutic approach is less
likely to have bleeding side effects for patients. Each Aim will have 3 subaims that will translate our (A)
mechanistic in vitro studies to (B) ex vivo blood flow studies of artificial surface-related thrombus formation
and (C) in vivo studies of vascular device-related thrombus propagation in 2 distinct animal models.
The potential significance of this translational project is that the knowledge generated will lead to verification
of promising, safe, and druggable molecular targets within the contact activation pathway to both prevent
and interrupt vascular device-related thrombosis. Our research may ultimately support the rationale for the
development of selective contact activation inhibitors that could benefit a large number of patients exposed
to vascular interventions and devices."

billing codes (that undercount true cases) and binary outcome labels (that induce arbitrary dichotomization),
the rationale for this project is that a system which includes a variety of data sources and generates a
probabilistic outcome along a continuum is needed. The SUD phenotyping framework will support the inclusion
of heterogenous electronic health record data types (including administrative billing codes, medication
information, and unstructured text data) and will be evaluated in multiple organizations. Pairing these SUD
phenotypes with genetic data will enhance our understanding of SUD mechanisms among individuals. That
foundational work could ultimately result in the development of polygenic risk scores and clinical decision
support systems that we could implement prospectively in clinical care. The proposed research is significant
because researchers have a pressing need for SUD phenotyping approaches that can be customized to their
research focus and available data. This proposal’s innovation lies in the creation of a “self-service” approach to
SUD phenotype development in which a research team can specify their own phenotype definitions. The
software will have a graphical user interface that makes the highest-yield rules/heuristics the easiest to use
and can therefore be used by investigators with basic scientific programming knowledge. Through the activities
outlined above, this innovation will directly accelerate genetic studies of SUD while simultaneously developing
a precision phenotyping framework that can be applied to other disease domains."

Wearable sensor for opioids detection based on electrochemical sensor array
integrated with Bluetooth device
 In this Phase II project, we will develop a new electrochemical sensor array with ultra-
high sensitivity (ng/mL limit of detection), enhanced drug specificity, long-term durability,
low power consumption, and cost-effective production. By the end of Phase II, 20
devices (along with 42 sensory cartridges for each) will be produced and ready for
commercialization (TRL 9) upon completion of Phase II. To provide an ultra-high
sensitivity, nanoporous silicon will be employed as a substrate for the working electrode.
Additionally, advancements of the approach include a high level of integration of all
functional modules on one microchip, wireless communication with user interface
(smartphone, computer), low cost and maintenance through long-term durability, low
power consumption, and cost-effective production.
The specific aims of Phase II are as follows:
 • Develop a prototype of the sensory wearable device, which comprises an
 electrochemical sensor array tuned to six target opioids and six non-opioid
narcotics
 • Demonstrate that the prototype is capable of narcotic detection with ultra-high
 sensitivity (within ng/L range) and high selectivity/low cross-reactivity
 • By the end of Phase II, produce 20 devices (TRL 9) ready for commercialization
 In Phase II, the prototype of the wearable device will be further optimized and
developed to the level of commercial readiness. Major objectives of Phase II include
optimization of individual sensors to the lowest limit of detection and fabrication of two
interchangeable sensory cartridges for six opioids and six non-opioid narcotics;
integration of the sensory module with the printed circuit board for data conditioning,
processing, and wireless transmittance; two-level trials with human subjects; submission
of an FDA application; fabrication of 20 devices and cartridges ready for
commercialization (TRL 9); patent filing; and establishing contacts with end-users,
purchasers and venture groups so that product commercialization can be started after
Phase II (we will use the company profit for sales and marketing)."

 Approximately 1.2 million people in the US and ~ 37 million people worldwide are living with HIV-1. In
spite of considerable progress in HIV/AIDS research, anti-retroviral therapy (ART) remains the only treatment
option for HIV-1 infection. While ART has been highly effective in controlling the virus and making HIV infection
a manageable disease, the drugs used in the ART regimens cause adverse side effects. Among the most widely
prescribed antiretrovirals (ARVs) are integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) which block the critical step of
HIV-1 integration into host chromosomes. Unfortunately, recent reports suggest that INSTI use is associated
with treatment-limiting neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Evidently, PLHIV are often comorbid with cocaine use
disorders (CUD) that exacerbates neuronal deficits. Thus, understanding the combined effects of INSTI-ART
and CUD on neuronal dysfunction is critical for the long-term effectiveness of the ART. This proposal will probe
the combined neuronal and neuropsychiatric effects of INSTI-based ART and chronic cocaine use.
 INSTIs are included in all initial ART regimens and are widely prescribed ARVs to control HIV-1 infection
worldwide. Currently approved INSTIs include raltegravir, elvitegravir, dolutegravir, bictegravir, and cabotegravir.
Although generally reported to be safe and effective there is a growing concern about the adverse metabolic and
neuropsychiatric effects associated with the INSTI-based ART. However, the mechanisms and the pathways
that drive INSTI-associated neuronal and neuropsychiatric side effects are unknown. Furthermore, there are key
knowledge gaps in our understanding of any additive or synergistic effects of CUD in INSTI-ART associated
neurological deficits. We hypothesize that INSTI-ART and cocaine-associated neurocognitive deficits are
driven by alterations in glutamate and calcium signaling that affect synaptic function and neuronal
communication in specific brain circuits. To test this, we have developed a multi-pronged approach that
combines biochemical, genetic, and pharmacologic analysis of neuronal function with electrophysiological
studies of neuronal circuits. Using this novel approach, we will test our hypothesis through three specific aims.
In Aim 1, we will assess the effects of INSTI-ART regimens on excitatory glutamate neurotransmission. In Aim
2, we will probe the adverse effects of INSTI-ART on neuropsychiatric circuitry. In Aim 3, we will probe the
combined effects of INSTI-ART and chronic cocaine use on alterations in synaptic neurotransmission within
neuropsychiatric circuitry. To achieve these goals, we have combined the expertise in HIV neuropathogenesis,
to that of neuroscience and neuropsychiatric disorders, and clinical research. Together, these studies will
comprehensively define the molecular, cellular, and neuronal circuit level effects INSTI-ART and CUD. This new
knowledge will promote new and improved therapeutic strategies to reduce the severity of neuronal deficits
among ART-adherent people living with HIV."

 Childhood trauma exposure, particularly in the form of interpersonal violence, increases risk for alcohol
use disorder (AUD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and their co-occurrence throughout the lifespan. AUD
and PTSD frequently co-occur, and comorbidity is associated with a host of negative clinical outcomes, including
greater symptom severity, poorer treatment prognosis, suicidal ideation, and poor physical health. Mechanisms
of comorbidity remain largely unknown, but shared risk in the form of overlapping genetic etiology may play a
role. AUD and PTSD are moderately heritable, overlap in latent genetic risk, and are genetically correlated in
large GWAS studies (rG=0.35), particularly among women. In addition to genetic risk, trauma exposure may be
a shared risk factor for adult AUD and PTSD, the impact of which may be exacerbated by genetic risk. However,
the mechanisms by which trauma increases risk need to be identified. Preliminary evidence suggests that
childhood trauma impacts brain development (i.e., atypical EEG activity observed during adolescence and young
adulthood), which in turn increases risk for AUD and PTSD. Effects were more robust among females and those
with a family history of AUD. Despite these promising findings, little is known about the influence of trauma on
adolescent and young adult brain development and risk for AUD and PTSD, and no other studies have examined
these factors together in a longitudinal paradigm, leaving the complex interactions among childhood trauma,
polygenic, and neurodevelopmental risk for AUD and PTSD poorly understood. The present study will fill these
gaps in the literature in a highly translational set of aims. Building of the research team’s prior work, this study
will assess the impact of childhood trauma on longitudinal trajectories of brain functioning (i.e., EEG functional
connectivity) and risk for adult AUD and PTSD using data from the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of
Alcoholism’s prospective study. Next, using summary statistics from the largest genome wide association studies
(GWAS) on AUD, AUD-related phenotypes (e.g., alcohol use behaviors) and PTSD, we will elucidate the genetic
factor structure of these phenotypes. A novel multivariate genetic method, genomic Structural Equation Modeling
(gSEM), will be used to determine the factor structure, and the resulting best-fit model will be used to produce
polygenic risk scores (PRS) that index shared genetic risk between the phenotypes (e.g., AUD-PTSD), as well
as unique risk for each condition. Finally, these PRS indexing risk unique and common for AUD-PTSD will be
integrated into the longitudinal analyses of childhood trauma, EEG functional connectivity, and risk for adult AUD
and PTSD. Important sex differences will also be examined. Results from this study will shed light on these
important public health conditions and will yield important implications for prevention and intervention efforts."
10898026,"Maternal prepregnancy obesity predisposes offspring to cognitive dysfunction, yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying the transgenerational effects of maternal obesity on offspring brain function and behavior. This traditionally overlooked cognitive health problem is exacerbated by social determinants of health, given that women of disadvantaged socioeconomic status are disproportionately affected by obesity. Currently, there is no consensus on antenatal care for women with prepregnancy obesity or their infants, and new therapies are needed to prevent chronic disease burden in affected children. Genetic and nongenetic factors contribute to obesity; yet, epidemiological studies suggest that diet, independent of genetics, is the primary driver of pathological weight gain and high body mass index. Importantly, host diet regulates the composition of the gut microbiome, and gut microbiota are emerging as powerful regulators of mammalian brain function and behavior. Given that maternal gut microbiota affect pre- and postnatal offspring brain development, contribute to neurodevelopmental programming, and are vertically transmitted from the mother to her offspring, elucidating the relationship between diet-induced dysbiosis of the maternal gut microbiome and adverse cognitive health outcomes in offspring could lead to innovative preventative treatments. Building on our recently published work and exciting preliminary data, we propose an interdisciplinary study combining metagenomics, metabolomics, and neuroscience to test our hypothesis that maternal Western diet (mWD)-induced upregulation of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and associated changes in the microbially-derived metabolome are causally related to cognitive dysfunction in mWD offspring. With the proposed work, we aim to address key, yet unanswered questions: (1) Is WD-induced dysbiosis of the maternal gut microbiome causal in adverse cognitive outcomes in offspring? (2a) Can opportunistic pathogenic bacteria increased by mWD impair cognitive function in offspring? (2b) Which mWD-associated microbially-derived metabolites affect host cognitive function? (2c) And by what mechanism? (3) Could antenatal targeting of the maternal gut microbiome via pharmacological, probiotic, or combination therapies thereof rescue mWD-associated cognitive dysfunction in offspring? Successful completion of the aims will reveal how WD alters microbial community structure in the maternal gut during pregnancy, identify microbially-derived, bioactive metabolites altered by mWD consumption, and the underlying mechanism by which WD-induced dysbiosis of the maternal gut microbiome impairs cognitive function in offspring. Most importantly, our findings have the potential to transform antenatal care for women with prepregnancy obesity by identifying a new class of preventative antenatal interventions to improve neurocognitive health outcomes in affected children."
10898028,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
Ligand-triggered events are central to many processes in neuroscience, endocrinology, virology, immunology,
and pharmacology. However, molecular and ultrastructural changes that follow the stimulus are difficult to
visualize because they involve rapid nanoscale motions and modifications of proteins and membranes. State-of-
the-art techniques are insufficient to capture these spatiotemporal changes. For example, live fluorescence
imaging is limited by the spatial resolution (diffraction-limit) and labeling constraints (no antibody access or
washing in live cells), while nanoscale imaging methods either lack temporal resolution to capture fast dynamics
(e.g., super-resolution optical microscopy) or are incompatible with live-cell imaging altogether (e.g., standard or
cryo-electron microscopy; expansion microscopy). Given these limitations, time-resolved cryo-vitrification
methods are ideal for capturing cellular processes after a defined wait time post-stimulation by freezing samples
in the state of amorphous ice prior to imaging. High-pressure freezing (HPF) is often used for this purpose
because of its relaxed sample thickness constraints (<300 µm) as compared to cryo-plunging at atmospheric
pressure (<10 µm). However, an HPF device compatible with time-resolved buffer exchange does not currently
exist. To this end, we will develop HPF-X – an HPF device with a capability for time-resolved buffer exchange
preceding cryo-vitrification. Buffer exchange will allow stimulating the sample with various biological and
pharmacological agents including ions, small molecules, peptides and proteins (e.g., hormones, cytokines,
antibodies, and nanobodies), and even viruses and cells. Thus, HPF-X will allow cryo-vitrifying cells, tissue
samples, or entire small organisms at a series of time points following stimulation with ligands for subsequent
interrogation with nanoscale imaging techniques such as electron microscopy and super-resolution optical
microscopy. This approach will allow capturing ligand-triggered cellular processes with nanoscale spatial
resolution and temporal resolution of <50 ms. Biological applications of this technique include nanoscale imaging
of protein-protein interactions, post-translational modifications, and protein-membrane dynamics. Although a
fundamentally new HPF instrument design is required to allow buffer exchange, our extensive preliminary data
confirms feasibility. In Aim 1, we will develop a high-pressure chamber compatible with buffer exchange and
cryo-vitrification and characterize its performance. In Aim 2, we will develop a method for time-resolved cryo-
cooling and validate the system using gold-standard biological samples. Development of HPF-X is an emergent
technical opportunity given the advent of nanoscale bioimaging. Importantly, this work goes beyond the current
method development regime in cryo-vitrification field because all available HPF devices are commercial. Our
custom-built HPF-X instrument will allow full control, versatility, and ease of adoption and modification by other
researchers based on their project needs, which cannot be achieved with off-the-shelf HPF instruments."

Latino populations in Miami-Dade County (FL) continue to experience health disparities and health inequities.
To address these critical public health issues, a well-trained, community-engaged health disparities workforce
is needed; new cohorts of highly skilled, multidisciplinary health disparities researchers can develop new
knowledge and translate research findings into affected underserved communities. Thus, this application
proposes to expand the health disparities research and training efforts of the Center for Latino Health
Research Opportunities (CLaRO). Over the past 6 six years, the University of Miami (UM) and Florida
International University (FIU) have partnered as CLaRO to reduce and prevent health disparities across the
intersecting syndemic conditions of substance abuse, violence, and HIV/AIDS (i.e., SAVA) affecting vulnerable
Latinos (e.g., seasonal farmworkers, inner city, LGBTQ+ communities). CLaRO’s focus has been to reduce
and prevent health disparities across the intersecting conditions of substance abuse, violence, and HIV/AIDS
(i.e., the SAVA syndemic) in vulnerable Latino sub-groups. The proposed CLaRO will expand our central
theme to include: (a) mental health (i.e., SAVA+MH) disparities affecting underserved Latino communities and
(b) equitable implementation science. CLaRO will train early-stage investigators (ESI) to develop expertise in
equitable implementation science to accelerate implementation efforts of evidence-based interventions
addressing SAVA+MH. We will diversify the health disparities research workforce by training, mentoring, and
supporting ESI, particularly those from underrepresented minority (URM) groups, across the translational
pathway from preintervention and efficacy/effectiveness research to implementation science and practice. We
propose a community-engaged, multidisciplinary, research training and mentorship program that is grounded in
equitable implementation science; meaningful collaborations with community stakeholders will be integrated
into CLaRO activities. We will fund at least 3 new Pilot Projects each year for a total of $300,000 per year. Our

common genetic risk variants involves neuroimmune mechanisms of synaptic pruning. We have
found that risk variants of the complement component C4 genes are correlated with increased
C4A expression in the brain and CSF, and that overexpression of human C4A in a mouse model
results in excess synaptic pruning and social behavioral deficits. We have further shown that
additional neuroimmune molecules encoded at schizophrenia risk loci, CD47 and CSMD1,
influence synaptic pruning and complement activity. Lastly, schizophrenia is unusual among
neurodevelopmental disorders in its late-adolescent/early-adult onset, and childhood adversity is
a major non-genetic risk factor for schizophrenia; yet the biological underpinnings of adolescent
psychiatric vulnerability are wholly unknown. We have identified a critical period of circuit

The primary mission of the UAB-Childhood Cystic Kidney Disease Core Center (UAB-CCKDCC) is to work
with the PKD Consortium, under the guidance of the U24 Central Coordinating Site (U24-CCS) and
NIDDK, to eliminate obstacles in cystic kidney disease research that are slowing progress toward
the development of improved and innovative treatment strategies for cystic kidney disorders. The UAB-
CCKDCC has assembled a multidisciplinary team of researchers, each with strong research programs, who will
direct four tightly integrated resource and service-oriented Cores along with an Administrative Core. The
overarching and collective mission of these Cores is to support, accelerate, and expand basic and translational
research activities being performed by PKD Consortium members. The Center will focus on the development of
resources to analyze cilio-cystic disease protein function, localization, and interactions and to assess how
defects in these functions contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms involved in cyst initiation and progression.
The Center will complete its mission through providing ready access to clinical data and biomaterial from CCKD
patients, through the development and distribution of patient-relevant cell and animal models of CCKD, and
through the development of methodology to utilize these models to ascertain the efficacy of candidate therapies
to slow disease progression using a standardized, cost-effective, and longitudinal imaging and analysis
strategies. The services and resources being made available by the Center along with the integration of our
Cores will expand research activities beyond that capable in most individual laboratories. It will accelerate the
pace of research into causes and possible cures of cystic kidney diseases by providing for high quality, robust,
and reproducible outcomes. These are critically needed to prioritize drugs for future clinical trials to halt PKD and
other cystic kidney disorders.
Essential to fulfilling the mission of the UAB-CKDCC is the Administrative Core. The Administrative Core will
provide for the Center’s overall structure to make sure that each of the Cores is working toward the common
goal of developing better treatments options for CCKD. The Administrative Core will be responsible for financial
and scientific oversight, coordinate efforts to ensure that each Core’s activities are aligned with those of the other
U54-PKD Centers (RTCC), and that the focus of each Core reflects the priorities established by the U24-CCS
and NIDDK. The Administrative Core will establish benchmarks and ensure they are achieved, that Center

It is the goal of the UAB-Childhood Cystic Kidney Disease Core Center (CCKDCC) to work with the other U54
PKD Centers, under the direction of the U24 Coordinating Center Site (U24-CCS) to reduce obstacles in cystic
kidney disease research leading to more rapid translational studies by PKD Consortium Members and
development of novel therapeutics. The UAB-CCKDCC will help address the limitations associated with the small
CCKD patient population available at individual intuitions by providing access to clinical data and biomaterial
from human CCKD patients from across the Americas. The Center will focus on the development of resources
to analyze cilio-cystic disease protein function, localization, and interactions. The UAB-CCKDCC has assembled
a multidisciplinary team of researchers to carry out these goals and actively recruit new and established
investigators to the field. The Center will generate and provide researchers with patient relevant models of CCKD
and establish methodology to utilize these models to ascertain the efficacy of candidate therapies to slow disease
progression using a standardized, cost-effective, and longitudinal imaging strategy. The resources provided by
the CCKDCC will help address several of the most significant hurdles slowing the development of therapeutic
approaches and strategically recruit new scientists into the field.
The Clinical, Translational, and Biorepository Resource (Core A) will compile clinical data, genetic information,
and biological specimens from patients with recessive HRFD, as well as launch the US node of ADPedKD, an
international, multicenter observational study of childhood ADPKD. This centralized resource is designed to
accelerate discovery research in childhood cystic kidney diseases (partnership with Cores B and C). Integration
of these resources under a unique identifier, combined with rigorous, detailed interviews of patient/caregiver
health research experiences will inform the development of new, targeted interventional strategies (partnership
with Core D). The Core will coordinate efforts with other U54-RTCCs, under direction of the U24-CCS and
NIDDK, to develop and make the resources available to the PKD Research Consortium."
10884926,"ABSTRACT (CORE B)
Childhood Cystic Kidney Diseases (CCKDs) are debilitating disorders for which there are limited treatments
available. The Holy Grail to curing CCKD is to define signaling pathways essential for cyst initiation and
subsequent maintenance that can be successfully targeted with therapeutics. In vitro models of CCKD provide
a rapid research tool to analyze changes in pathways, to facilitate cellular and protein visualization, are ideal
starting points for discovery or validation of hypotheses and are essential for initial testing of potential treatments.
Recent advancements in organoid cultures provide an attractive pre-vivo transitional approach to understand
CCKD and for second phase testing of potential treatments. Despite the importance of in vitro models for CCKD
research there are critical barriers preventing their efficient and effective use: 1) readily available and sharable
cell based CCKD resources; 2) careful standardization of reagents that provide rigor and reproducibility across
laboratories; and 3) a resource center that facilitates generation of innovative and essential cell based resources
for the CCKD research community, without burdening individual labs with the cumbersome learning curve of
genome editing, biosensor generation, and quality control assessment. Core B will address these barriers in the
following aims: Aim 1 - To Establish In Vitro Biosensors to Study Signaling Pathways Involved in Childhood
Cystic Kidney Disorders; Aim 2 – To Genetically Engineer In Vitro Models for CCKD Research; and Aim 3- To
Establish and Distribute Critical In Vitro Resources for CCKD Research. Core B acts as an essential bridge
between the patient derived studies in the consortium (such as UAB Core A), and the in vivo models generated
by the consortium (such as UAB Core C), and therapeutic screening (such as in UAB Core D). Having a
centralized CCKD in vitro biosensor and modeling resource will facilitate and enhance research in the greater
PKD community and is an essential component of fighting this debilitating disease."

The primary mission of the UAB-Childhood Cystic Kidney Disease Core Center (UAB-CCKDCC) is to work with
the PKD Consortium, under the direction of the U24 Central Coordinating Site (U24-CCS) and NIDDK, to
eliminate obstacles in cystic kidney disease research that are slowing progress toward the development of
improved treatment strategies. The UAB-CCKDCC has assembled a multidisciplinary team of researchers that
direct four tightly integrated resource and service-oriented Cores along with an Administrative Core. The
collective mission of these Cores is to support, accelerate, and expand basic and translational research by PKD
Consortium members by providing access to clinical data and biomaterial from CCKD patients, through the
development and distribution of patient-relevant cell and animal models of CCKD to analyze pathogenic
mechanisms involved in cyst initiation and progression, and through the development of streamlined, cost-
effective pipelines for the PKD Consortium to rapidly ascertain the efficacy of new drugs to slow cyst growth.
 The In Vivo Bioassay and Model Development Resource (Core C) within the UAB-CCKDCC is tasked
with generating and distributing animal models, in vivo biosensors and reporter systems for CCKD associated
pathways, and biological reagents generated from these models. Models to be developed include biosensors
and reporters in multiple organisms needed to study signaling pathways involved in CCKD and animal models
for a wide range of CCKD syndromes with human patient mutations that will be generated based on data
obtained in Core A in the UAB-CCKDCC and from the overall PKD Consortium. Core C will also maintain a bank
of biomaterials from these models for distribution to promote pilot studies to rapidly test new hypotheses. Finally,
the wide spectrum of CCKD and reporter systems generated and maintained by Core C will be made readily
available to PKD Consortium for preclinical trails being conducted in Core D of the UAB-CCKDCC to evaluate
candidate therapies using highly standardized, cost-effective, and longitudinal imaging and innovative analysis
strategies. The services and resources being made available by Core C and it’s integration with the other Cores
in the UAB-CCKDCC will expand research activities beyond what is capable in most individual labs and will
accelerate research into possible cures by providing for high quality, robust, and reproducible outcomes that are
critically needed to prioritize drugs for future clinical trials to halt PKD and other cystic kidney disorders."

The problems of obesity and type 2 diabetes are some of the most common conditions affecting Americans.
There is a critical need to train the next generation of MD and PhD investigators who will address these public
health challenges with innovations in basic, clinical and translational sciences. We believe that the University of
Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus (UCAMC) is well positioned to provide the training needed to produce the
next generation of scientists addressing these areas. We are seeking support for 6 positions (3 post-doctoral
trainees to be supported for 2 years each) in the new Research Training Program in Metabolism, Obesity and
Type 2 Diabetes (RTPMOD) at the UCAMC. The strength of the proposed RTPMOD lies the outstanding faculty,
state of the art facilities and programs at the UCAMC and a robust pipeline of applicants. The 16 members of
the Training Faculty are productive well-funded investigators many of whom are nationally recognized leaders
in their fields of study who collectively have $12,710,098 in current research funding (direct costs current year).
A number of affiliate and junior faculty mentors have been identified to ensure a rich training environment and a
robust pipeline of future mentors for the program. The UCAMC is host to the Colorado Clinical Translational
Science Institute, the Colorado Nutrition Obesity Research Center and the Anschutz Health & Wellness Center
to name just a few of the resources that will support the proposed training. Over the last 10 years RTPMOD
faculty have trained 93 post-doctoral fellows (current and past). Of those who completed training, 62% hold
faculty positions, with 36 Assistant, 4 Associate and 2 full Professors. Over the last 5 years, we have trained 42
training grant eligible post-doctoral fellows (current and past). Of those who have completed training, 83% are
currently in a research related or research intensive positions. Of the 42 training grant eligible trainees, 41%
received K or equivalent (VA, ACS) awards and 14% are Co-Investigators on R level or equivalent awards.
Applicants for the RTPMOD will come from a range of clinical fellowship programs at UCAMC, our new clinical
Obesity Medicine Fellowship, and the Physician Scientist Training Program track within our Internal Medicine
Training Program. PhD applicants will come from local and national recruitment efforts. MD and PhD applicants
will be selected though a rigorous recruitment process to identify those with the greatest promise to pursue an
independent research career. In addition to an intensive mentored research experience, trainees will gain formal
training in metabolism, obesity and type 2 diabetes and team science. The program will be administered by an
experienced Program Director supported by an Executive Committee with input from a committee to support the
recruitment and retention of trainees from under-represented minorities and an independent Institutional
Advisory Board. In this revised application we have addressed the concerns raised in the prior review and hope
that RTPMOD will be now viewed as a program that is likely to provide outstanding training for post-doctoral
fellows seeking a long term independent research career in metabolism, obesity or type 2 diabetes research."

Substance use disorder poses a major health threat that costs billions of dollars and thousands of lives
annually, and which is especially acute right now for opioid drugs and cocaine. In susceptible individuals, drugs
of abuse hijack brain circuits that govern motivation and decision making, leading to continued seeking of
drugs despite harmful consequences of using them. Even when people decide to cease their increasingly
maladaptive drug use, in most cases they end up relapsing. In order to help those trying to quit using drugs to
stay abstinent, we must understand how underlying neural circuits of motivation and decision making work in
the brain, and for this we need translationally-relevant animal models. Here, I employ such models, coupled
with cell-type and pathway-specific chemogenetic (DREADD) manipulation approaches to understand how
they process decision making about cocaine and an opioid fentanyl analogue, as well as for natural rewards. I
focus on the role of ventral pallidum (VP) circuits in addiction-relevant behaviors. To date, I have shown that
VP neurons are Fos activated by cocaine-relapse-inducing cues, and that chemogenetic VP inhibition
diminishes relapse-like behavior following voluntary abstinence, especially in the most compulsively cocaine-
seeking individuals (Aim 1.1) I also showed that selective chemogenetic inhibition of VP GABA-expressing
neurons attenuates risky decision making behavior in pursuit of palatable food, and decreases instrumental
responding both in pursuit of valuable foods, and in avoidance of being shocked, indicating a fundamental role
for these neurons in motivation regardless of valence (Aim 1.2). The F99 phase of this award will shift my focus
to an ongoing health crisis: the opioid epidemic. I first confirm my preliminary finding of VP GABA neuron
involvement in relapse to opioid seeking, using a new punishment-induced abstinence relapse procedure that
models human relapse after voluntary abstinence (Aim 2.1). Aim 2.2 addresses the wider circuits in which VP
is embedded to regulate addiction-related motivation. Specifically, we use a pathway-specific DREADD
inhibition approach to test whether VP GABA projections to VTA in particular are involved in opioid addiction.
The proposed training will facilitate my transition to a competitive postdoctoral position focused on in vivo
circuit monitoring, which will dovetail with my expertise in addiction behavioral models, and chemogenetic
circuit manipulations. Through establishment of the Irvine Center for Addiction Neuroscience, UCI offers a
stimulating, collaborative research environment with faculty dedicated to solving the problem of addiction at the
multiple levels with a host of technical resources, mentorship training opportunities, and professional
development workshops. In sum, the F99/K00 will be invaluable for keeping me on a track to tenure and
beyond as an addiction behavioral neuroscientist."

purpose of this project is to increase surveillance for antibiotic resistance in enteric bacteria from retail
meat and seafood samples. The PHL Food Microbiology Laboratory has maintained the capacity to test
for foodborne pathogens and food quality indicator organisms for over 40 years. During this cooperative
agreement, the Food Microbiology Laboratory will maintain laboratory capacity by continuing to
implement NARMS retail meat and seafood surveillance protocols. Bacteria isolated from retail meat
and seafood samples will be characterized where appropriate by serology and by whole genome
sequencing (WGS). Results will be shared with the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and DHEC Foodborne Epidemiologists. Data will be used to drive identification of
foodborne disease outbreaks. Isolates identified will submitted to FDA-CVM for antibiotic sensitivities.
Antibiotic resistance data collected, as a result of the surveillance activities, will be analyzed and
monitored for trends. Data will be disseminated to state epidemiologist’s, and when appropriate, State
Sentinel Hospitals, and shared with the public through DHEC’s public website. These activities will
strengthen national efforts to monitor antimicrobial resistance among enteric bacteria isolated from

10874949,"The goal of the Emory Roybal Center for Dementia Caregiving Mastery is to provide support to investigators
across the nation to conduct NIH Stage I-III behavioral intervention research that will enhance the context-
specific role-mastery of informal caregivers of persons living with Alzheimer’s disease and similar illnesses. By
2050, as many as 20 million Americans will be living with these illnesses, and the number of informal
caregivers will expand to 40-50 million. Informal caregiving is the key to the quality of life and continued
community living of persons living with Alzheimer’s and similar illnesses; it is also a bulwark against rising
health care costs. Our Center rests on the premise that informal caregiving is not one homogenous entity but is
context-specific. As the U.S. continues to experience major reconfigurations in its social and demographic
composition (we will, for instance, be a “minority majority” country by 2043), we expect caregiving to occur in
an ever-increasing set of heterogeneous contexts. These contexts are framed by various illness conditions,
family, cultural, or social caregiving situations, geographical location, and care recipients’ transitions through
care settings, especially the acute setting. The two clinical trials proposed in this application exemplify such
heterogeneous contexts: one focuses on the culturally-grounded challenges faced by Latino caregivers; the
other on the situation of individuals who, newly discovering they are in the caregiving role, need immediate
orientation to the role. Our Center’s second assertion is that interventions developed to address these contexts
must be designed with the involvement of caregivers/consumers from within these contexts (as have the two
proposed trials). Our Center builds on the successes of our first cycle of nationally competed projects (13
supported projects, most from national investigators), the majority of which have or are poised to receive
support for advancement to the next stage of development and testing. The Center is anchored in a set of
existing collaborations with other AD Roybal Centers and key national networks of Alzheimer’s and caregiver
researchers (e.g., the IMPACT Collaboratory) and investigators engaged in geriatrics and gerontology
research. Through webinars and a national Caregiver Research Interest Group, our Center will continue to
engage investigators and consumers in discussions about and design of interventions. Acting as a kind of
“academic venture capital enterprise,” we will employ established structures and processes to attract
competitive trial applications, guide investigators in the development of effective trial proposals, apply rigorous
methods for selecting meritorious proposals, and, through our Behavioral Intervention Development Core,
mentor and monitor supported trials to ensure intervention trial success. Through our Consult Service, we will
work with supported investigators to produce tangible returns on our “investments:” successful proposals for
the next stage of intervention development and testing. The inter-related activities of the Center will enable it
to pursue a second overall aim, the continued advancement of the science of intervention development."
10874950,"Abstract. The goal the Emory Roybal Center for Dementia Caregiving Mastery is to identify, support, and
advance behavioral intervention programs that effectively address caregiving challenges across a broad range
of heterogeneous caregiving contexts and to strengthen informal caregiving mastery within these contexts.
The Administrative Core will play three key roles. It will play a development role in implementing and
managing structures and processes that ensure an ample flow of clinical trial intervention proposals grounded
in genuine participatory dialogue with caregiver and care recipient consumers, the effective selection support,
oversight, and stage advancement of tested interventions, and the advancement of the science of intervention
development. The Core will coordinate the activities of interest-generation structures, including a monthly
Caregiver Research Interest Group conversation among caregiver researchers, the development of context/
situation-focused webinars, and the maintenance of the Center’s website that will be pivotal in stimulating pilot
ideas and drawing interest to the Center’s theme of the heterogeneity of caregiving. The Core will be the nexus
for all of these linkages. The Center will maintain our collaborations with the Rochester and OHSU AD Roybal
Centers and seek to develop collaborations with new AD Roybal Centers. The Core will also be responsible for
continuing to build on the leadership team’s linkages with the NIA Alzheimer’s Disease Centers and IMPACT
Collaboratory and the VA Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Centers and other national centers to
stimulate ideas and attract potential clinical trial investigators to the Center. The Core will play a management
role. Supported by the pre- and post-award capabilities of Emory’s Nursing and Public Health Research
Administration Service, the Core will assume the central management role in the Center, providing
administrative and financial oversight to the Behavioral Intervention Development Core and the Center’s
behavioral intervention clinical trial projects to enable trial investigators to advance successful interventions to
their next stage of development. It will coordinate the activities of the Stakeholder, External, and Local Advisory
Boards and it will be responsible for the scheduling, conduct, and documentation of the variety of meetings,
including an Annual Meeting, meant to keep the Center and the supported trials on track. In this role, the
Administrative Core will also provide linkage and coordination with the National Institute on Aging and with the
Roybal Coordinating Center, ensuring timely reports, collaboration, and participation in Roybal Center national
meetings. The Administrative Core will play a key role in activities designed to promote the sustainability of the
Center. It will be responsible for the conduct and analysis of the Center’s evaluation plan and for taking any
steps identified by the evaluation to advance Center success. Finally, the Administrative Core will drive Center
dissemination activities, organizing pre-conference workshops at national meetings, and promoting reports of
clinical trial findings, all aimed at the advancement of the science of intervention development."
10874667,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The proposal outlines an integrated research and career development plan for Kayla Wolf, PhD, to complete
postdoctoral training under the mentorship of sponsor Jennifer Lewis, ScD, and co-sponsor Lisa Satlin, MD. The
overarching goal of the proposed project to develop a functional collecting duct network that is derived from
human pluripotent stem cells and interconnected with a single drainage outlet. This network could serve as a
model system for hypothesis testing, disease modeling, and drug screening or could interconnect directly with
nephron-rich organoids to facilitate filtrate drainage in 3D kidney tissues. Recognizing that the extracellular matrix
(ECM) plays a crucial role in development, this proposal with both investigate the role of ECM in collecting duct
differentiation and leverage biomaterials as a powerful tool for guiding tissue form and function. Development of
the collecting duct system will be accomplished by the completion of three aims. First, ureteric bud cells (UB,
collecting duct precursors) generated from emerging differentiation protocols will be validated, and the effects of
adapting the protocol to scalable culture methods on UB phenotype will be tested. Second, the role of
extracellular matrix (ECM) composition on UB morphological and functional differentiation will be determined.
Finally, the effects of fabricating a drainage outlet in a branching UB network on transport protein expression
and function will be determined. Successful completion of this proposal will elucidate the role of ECM in driving
collecting duct development, advance biofabrication methodology, and produce critically needed engineering
solutions for generating functional kidney tissue.
Dr. Wolf (PI) was supported by an NIH F31 fellowship (F31 CA228317-01) during her graduate research, where
she established expertise in biomaterials, bioengineering, and mechanobiology. Under NIH F32 support, the PI
receive extensive training in biofabrication and renal physiology at Harvard University, which cultivates a well-
established, globally-leading biomedical research environment. The career development plan is designed to
equip the PI with the necessary knowledge and skills for a successful career as an independent academic
researcher."
10874785,"2.0 PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Stress may play a significant role in the finding that Latinx students enroll in college but are less likely to
graduate than students from other racial/ethnic groups. Prior qualitative, survey, and experimental work
suggests that Latinx first-generation college (FGC) students experience cultural mismatch (CM) – a mismatch
between interdependent values learned at home and independent values of post-secondary institutions –
during their transition to four-year research-centered universities. The stress from this mismatch negatively
disrupts overall wellness including health (self-reported mental/physical distress) and academics and may be
directly linked to biological and clinical markers of health. Thus, there is a dire need to understand the
connection between CM and negative health and academic adjustment outcomes to inform meaningful,
targeted interventions, that ensure health and educational equity for all students.
 The proposed research will extend prior work by conducting a comparative longitudinal project of Latinx
FGC students experiences with CM during the transition to college. Because CM is expected to vary across
contexts, two separate cohorts of Latinx FGC student freshmen across three public Hispanic-Serving
Institutions (HSIs; community college, teaching-centered university, research-centered university) that are
similar in ethnic diversity and percentage of Latinx students will complete a survey, interview, as well as
biological and clinical assessments of health (e.g., diurnal cortisol, body-mass-index) across three time-points:
their first and second semester of college and one-year later. Academic transcripts will also be accessed. The
project will describe the trajectories of Latinx students’ experiences with CM and their pattern of associations
with mental and physical health, as well as academic adjustment outcomes (self-report and objective
measures; Aim 1). The project also examines whether this experience varies across educational contexts
where Latinx students enroll at increasingly high levels (Aim 2) and will identify resilience factors that protect
Latinx students against CM and the negative role it has on adjustment outcomes (Aim 3).
 Results will provide an in-depth understanding of CM, when it is most salient in impacting adjustment, as
well as elucidate the mechanisms that occur when students experience mismatch. Investigation of comparative
educational contexts, as well as resilience, will enable the scientific field to hone in on the role structural,
individual, family, community, and cultural factors play in experiences of CM. The results will have a significant
impact on future research and best practices (interventions, programs, policies) that focus on the improvement
of Latinx college students’ holistic health. Results can also be beneficial to society at large as CM likely
influences health in other contexts or groups. Dissemination will take form of as open-source reports and
presentations of findings to be shared with students, faculty and administrators across research sites as well
as all HSIs in the nation via partnership with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU)."

Even if you’re not a musical genius, each and every one of us is still a highly acoustic person. Speech and
music are the most obvious sounds we make. But almost every other movement we make produces sounds,
too (typing, walking, chewing, shutting a car door). In fact, navigating the world requires us to be able to
detect, recognize, and predict the sounds of our own actions. The fact that we don’t notice most of the
sounds we make speaks wonders to how well our brains can predict them in the first place. Malfunctioning of
the same brain circuitry that normally anticipates the sounds of our actions has been implicated and disorders
including tinnitus and schizophrenia. Understanding how the brain learns to anticipate the sounds of our
actions is therefore key to understanding brain function during both health and disease. This proposal
describes experiments aimed at understanding how auditory and motor systems interact during sound
generating behaviors to anticipate the sounds our movements make. The experiments outlined in this
proposal incorporate a host of innovative techniques. These include closed-loop augmented reality, large
scale physiological recordings during behavior, calcium imaging, and optogenetics. The results of these
experiments will help us understand how circuits of neurons within the brain learn to anticipate the sounds
our movements make.
The significance of the proposed research to the NIH mission is four-fold. First, this research can inform how
the nervous system mediates normal hearing during sound-generating movements, which is essential to
speech comprehension and learning, among other skilled, auditory-guided behaviors (e.g. musicianship).
Second, dysfunction of this motor to auditory interaction at the cortical level is thought to drive auditory
hallucinations in diseases including tinnitus and schizophrenia; characterizing motor-auditory interactions is a
necessary step to understand the genesis of these pathologies and to ultimately design appropriate
therapies. Third, an understanding of how motor-auditory circuits change with experience may provide
insights into how these circuits can be manipulated either through perceptual training or direct manipulation of
neural activity to facilitate auditory comprehension in the face of hearing loss."

Human ALIX (also known as PDCD6IP) functions in endo-lysosomal pathway, apoptosis, enveloped virus budding, and
other essential cell signaling and membrane scission processes. These diverse functions are regulated by its posttranslational
modifications (PTMs), specifically tyrosine phosphorylation and ubiquitination. We recently uncovered that ALIX, through
its proline-rich domain (PRD), forms liquid-like condensates and amyloid fibrils, and that both these assemblies dissolve
on phosphorylation and reform on dephosphorylation of its tyrosine residues. Projects in this ESI-MIRA proposal expand
upon these exciting discoveries and will uncover the dynamic functional interplay between phase separation, fibrillization,
and PTMs of ALIX. Specifically, we will: determine the structural characteristics of ALIX’s assemblies, their regulation by
tyrosine de/phosphorylation and membranes, and their formation in mammalian cells (direction 1), elucidate the functional
relevance of ALIX polymerization, and the mechanisms of the time-dependent transitions of ALIX condensates to fibrils
(direction 2), and characterize the interactions between ALIX and ubiquitin, and determine the cross-talk between ALIX
ubiquitination and its phosphorylation-mediated polymerization (direction 3). Structural characterization of ALIX’s higher-
order assemblies in direction 1.1 will reveal the interactions hotspots that govern its phase separation and novel atomic-
resolution details of how a PRD can form β-sheet rich fibrils. Mechanistic studies in direction 1.2 will elucidate regulation
and modulation of ALIX condensates and fibrils by lipid membranes and tyrosine de/phosphorylation, revealing how a
kinase accesses its sites within these assemblies, and the identity of tyrosine residues whose dephosphorylation triggers
ALIX polymerization. Cellular studies in direction 1.3 will examine ALIX polymerization in mammalian cells. In direction
2.1, we will determine how polymerization affects ALIX’s functions. Mechanistic studies in direction 2.2 will elucidate
time-dependent hardening of ALIX condensates into fibrils, yielding new insights into the role of phase separation in
fibrillization. Structural and kinetic studies in direction 3.1 will elucidate the interactions between ALIX and ubiquitin.
Finally, in direction 3.2, we will determine the impact of ALIX ubiquitination on its phosphorylation-mediated
polymerization. The above studies build upon our discoveries of the unique ALIX assemblies, their modulation by PTMs,
the slow maturation of ALIX condensates into rigid fibrils, residue-specific details of ALIX – late endosomal membrane
interactions, and how ALIX’s phosphorylation inhibits these interactions. Extensive preliminary results, including highly
homogenous samples of ALIX assemblies enabling their structural characterization, the discoveries of selective recruitment
of ALIX’s signaling partners in its condensates, and of ALIX – ubiquitin interactions in solution, assure high feasibility of
successfully completing our proposed studies. Our newly developed methods, including a new labeling strategy to facilitate
NMR studies of ALIX assemblies, and the production of milligram quantities of pure ubiquitinated proteins, promise
groundbreaking insights into ALIX polymerization and the role of ubiquitin in ALIX biology. Collectively, these studies
will define molecular mechanisms that underlie ALIX’s multifaceted cellular and membrane functions."

 Over 900,000 Americans are currently diagnosed with Ulcerative colitis (UC), an incurable inflammatory
bowel disease of complex etiology. UC is multifactorial, with genetics, microbiota, and uncontrolled immune
response leading to recurring colon ulcers and inflammation. With no defined cause, symptom management is
critical for patients with this chronic condition. A major endpoint for clinical treatment of UC and other
inflammatory bowel diseases is mucosal healing. Current UC therapeutics are predominated by anti-
inflammatories. To expand this arsenal, it is important to establish exactly how ulceration prevention and wound
healing occur such that these features can be enhanced in a targeted manner. Since our early published
discovery that Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) protein has both cytoplasmic and nuclear functions, our
research has focused on mechanisms by which nuclear APC maintains normal intestinal homeostasis. To enable
our analysis, we generated mice with mutations in APC which compromise nuclear import. These Apc-mNLS
mice displayed decreased numbers of mucus-secreting goblet cells (GCs) and increased inflammation,
chemokine expression, and tissue damage in response to treatment with the colon irritant DSS compared to their
DSS-treated wild-type (WT) littermates. More recently, we published that in WT mice, DSS-treatment could
induce a subset of distal colon GCs to express elevated APC levels. Similarly, colon tissue from human CD
patients also displayed elevated APC protein level in most GCs, a phenotype not observed in unaffected tissue.
 Based on these striking results, we wondered whether the elevated APC in UC colon might be a response
to ulceration in an attempt to restore normal colonic tissue homeostasis. As such, we sought to determine the
mechanistic basis for and cellular consequences of higher APC protein levels in UC tissue. RNA-seq analysis of
normal colon cells depleted for APC revealed a set of genes significantly downregulated. Cross-referencing this
list with APC ChIP-seq data as well as genes whose expression is altered in UC, we identified 7 genes with roles
in wound repair and mucus barrier production that are candidates for transcriptional regulation by nuclear APC.
We hypothesize that nuclear APC promotes wound repair and resolution of UC through driving
transcription of the major mucus barrier component MUC2 as well as specific wound repair mediators.
This hypothesis will be tested by addressing the following questions: Does nuclear APC 1) regulate transcription
of modulators of inflammation and wound repair (AIM1)? 2) promote colon wound healing (AIM2)? 3) promote
mucus layer generation and thereby impede microbial penetration, alter microbial composition and prevent
inflammation (AIM3)? Answering these questions is expected to establish nuclear APC as a key contributor to
wound repair, a finding that could ultimately be translated into new therapies for UC and other IBDs."

Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDVs) are a group of eukaryotic pathogens that includes the largest
and most complex viruses known. This group encompasses well-studied families that infect vertebrates, such
as Poxviridae, Asfarviridae, and Iridoviridae, as well as families that infect diverse unicellular eukaryotes, such
as Mimiviridae, Phycodnaviridae, and Marseilleviridae. NCLDVs are an ancient lineage that have co-evolved
with eukaryotes for many millions of years, and the genomes of both viruses and their hosts contain myriad
signatures of past and present interactions. NCLDV genomes encode an impressive complement of host-derived
genes ─ often referred to as viral mimicry genes ─ that are involved in numerous processes such as
immunoregulation, apoptosis inhibition, central carbon metabolism, cytoskeletal structure, nutrient transport, and
translation. The evolutionary history of most of these genes is unclear beyond their original acquisition from
cellular lineages, and the processes that give rise to mimicry are therefore largely unknown. Eukaryotic genomes
also bear testament to their interactions with these viruses, and recent work has shown that endogenized
NCLDVs are surprisingly common across a wide range of eukaryotic hosts, including animals and plants. These
endogenous viral elements range from large >1 Mbp loci ─ termed Giant Endogenous Viral Elements, or GEVEs
─ to smaller loci containing only a few genes that can be traced back to NCLDV. My group has identified GEVEs
across a range of green algae, and I have preliminary data demonstrating that recently-endogenized NCLDVs
are present in the genomes of several strains of the model green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These and
other recent findings demonstrate that both historical and contemporary gene exchange between NCLDVs and
eukaryotes plays a large role in the genome evolution of both groups, but we currently lack a quantitative
framework or model system for evaluating the nature and extent of these dynamics. Here I propose several
computational and wet-lab research directions aimed at evaluating the evolutionary dynamics of both host-
derived mimicry genes in NCLDVs as well as the NCLDV-derived loci in eukaryotic genomes. I also propose to
develop C. reinhardtii as a model to facilitate in-depth experimental analysis of host-virus interactions and
evaluate the consequences of NCLDV endogenization in detail. Due to the existing genetic tools that have been
developed for C. reinhardtii, establishment of this alga as a new model for NCLDV-host interactions would be a
transformative advance that would enable detailed experimental analyses that are currently not possible in other
virus-host experimental systems. Overall, these research themes form the basis of an interdisciplinary research
program focused on disentangling the evolutionary and molecular dynamics of NCLDV-host interactions. This
work will establish a quantitative framework for understanding the deeply intertwined coevolution between
NCLDVs and their hosts while also developing a new model system for detailed molecular experimentation."

to spatially organize the transcriptional machinery into multi-component clusters, yet we know little about how
these IDRs interact with specific partners to enable functional outcomes. As these interactions are highly
dynamic and cluster-dependent they have been overlooked by conventional strategies to identify protein-protein
interactions. Our preliminary data support our overarching hypothesis that in the context of higher-order clusters
weak multivalent interactions are capable of highly specific hetero-typic interactions leading to functional
organization of the nucleus. Our long-term objective is to understand how weak multivalent interactions organize
specific components of the transcriptional machinery in order to enable gene activation. The objective of this
grant is to investigate the mechanism and function of cluster-mediated interactions of the IDR of MED1, the
largest subunit of the mediator coactivator complex. Mediator is a megadalton complex that bridges DNA-binding
transcription factors with downstream steps of the activation process requiring it to engage dynamically with
many components of the regulatory machinery. While recent structural studies have revealed the architecture of
this complex, the domains responsible for multivalent interactions are dynamic IDRs and remain unresolved. In
particular the MED1 subunit contains a >600 amino acid c-terminal IDR (MED1-IDR) which previously published
studies implicate in cluster formation. Our preliminary data show that MED1-IDR clusters selectively partition
positive regulators of transcription and exclude negative regulators or functionally unrelated yet abundant nuclear
proteins. These data lead us to hypothesize that IDR-mediated selective compartmentalization is a mechanism
to regulate transcription. To test this hypothesis we will confirm and validate the specificity of these cluster-
mediated interactions (Aim 1), characterize the molecular features underlying specificity of these interactions
(Aim 2), and investigate the function of these interactions in various models of gene activation (Aim 3). Upon
completion of these proposed studies, we will understand the role of weak multivalent interactions mediated by
MED1-IDR in organization of specific components of the transcriptional machinery. This contribution is significant
as it will lead to a new appreciation for the function of the prevalent yet often overlooked IDRs in gene activation.
While we focus here on MED1-IDR, the tools and methods developed and the principles learned here can be
applied to other weak multivalent interactions involved in gene regulation or the growing list of biochemical
process regulated by dynamic clustering of regulators."
10893454,"Project Summary
Kidney stones affect an estimated 8.8% of American adults and direct medical costs exceed $10 billion
annually. Five-year recurrence rates for stones have been as high as 40% and a standard guideline for
prevention is to increase fluid intake enough to produce > 2.5 L of urine daily. Meeting these guidelines
reduces stone recurrence rates by 50-60% yet patients’ adherence to fluid intake guidelines is commonly
below 50%. Usual care for preventing a recurrence involves education about increasing fluid intake and dietary
changes; however, the low adherence rate indicates that many patients would benefit from additional support
in adhering to fluid intake guidelines. The long-term goal of this research is to reduce the recurrence of painful
and costly stones by improving patient adherence to fluid intake guidelines (secondary prevention). Digital
technology offers the promise of increasing reach and supporting treatment adherence but, to date, that
promise has not been fully realized in clinical trials of digital tools for supporting treatment adherence. In a
series of six preliminary studies, we engaged patients in developing and testing a context-sensitive digital tool
called sipIT, a just-in-time adaptive intervention to promote fluid intake and increase urine output. We learned
that patients are open to using digital tools provided those tools are integrated with their lifestyle and sensitive
to the changing contexts of their lives. The resulting intervention, sipIT, incorporates a novel semi-automated
tracking system to trigger smartphone notifications with context-sensitive reminders to drink. The reminder
system was informed by contemporary theories of habit formation to support behavior change in the eventual
absence of the technology. In this application, we propose to answer question, “Does sipIT increase 24-hour
urine output more than usual care over a 3-month period?” Urine output was selected as a proximal surrogate
endpoint based on clinical guidelines for preventing recurrence of kidney stones. The specific aims of this
project are (1) to evaluate the efficacy of sipIT vs usual care for increasing urine output in patients with a history
of kidney stones, and (2) to identify biological and behavioral moderators of intervention effects on urine output
(heterogeneity of treatment effects). We propose a two-arm randomized controlled trial to achieve these aims.
Patients will receive either usual care + sipIT (intervention group) or usual care alone (control group). We will
evaluate 24-hour urine output, urine supersaturations, and fluid intake habit strength at baseline and 1, 3, and
12 months after intervention. If successful, this research will lead to a cost-effective intervention that leverages
consumer technology so it can be scaled for dissemination and implementation in clinical practice to reduce
the burden and cost of stones. It advances NIDDK goals of preventing noncancerous urologic diseases and
may be applied to support other dehydration-related health concerns (e.g., urinary tract infections, cognitive
performance, heat stress, post-surgical hospital readmissions)."
10893460,"This application proposes to continue, refine, and disseminate a nine week summer research program in
alcohol and addiction research. The program, the “MU Alcohol Research Training Summer School” (MU-
ARTSS) at the University of Missouri, is targeted at undergraduate students with the goal of preparing trainees
for graduate training in health-related scientific disciplines focusing on alcohol and addiction research. The
program recruit seven students annually, drawn from a national pool of applicants, and with a major emphasis
on recruiting students from under-represented groups in STEM and biomedical disciplines (i.e., ethnic and
racial minority, economically disadvantaged, and first-generation college students). The MU-ARTSS program
consists of a one-week intensive set of didactic lectures on alcohol research. Didactic topics include:
introduction to and overview of addiction research, epidemiology, genetics, neuropharmacology,
neurophysiology, individual differences, assessment and treatment, responsible conduct of research, and
human subjects issues. In addition, trainees will attend laboratory demonstrations of addiction-relevant
research protocols, including mobile and ambulatory assessment, structural and functional neuroimaging, and
laboratory administration of alcohol to human subjects. Following this week of didactics, students will complete
an eight-week internship in the lab of a mentor conducting alcohol research. Through the internship period,
MU-ARTSS trainees will attend a weekly seminar series covering specific research skills and professional
development issues. A weekly “movie night” will be hosted by the program Co-Director, and will showcase
notable films about alcohol spanning more than 80 years of film history, allowing for less-formal discussion and
exploration of clinical phenomena related to alcohol and addiction, and the role and portrayal of alcohol in
society. The MU-ARTSS program will be supplemented by additional training programs and experiences
offered by the MU-Summer Research Internship Program (MU-SRIP). Partnering with MU-SRIP affords our
trainees an opportunity to interact with research faculty and students across multiple scientific disciplines and
in multiple venues including a Professional Development series, further instruction in the responsible conduct
of research, a lecture series, and a formal end-of-the-program poster session. The program draws on the large
number of active alcohol research programs in MU’s Department of Psychological Sciences. The focus of MU-
ARTSS on undergraduate education also provides an important complement to the alcohol training emphasis
at the graduate and postdoctoral levels (currently supported, in part, by a T32 to Co-Director Sher). To date, 12
MU-ARTSS interns have completed their undergraduate degrees, and of these, 7 are enrolled in Ph.D.
programs, 1 in an M.D. program, and 2 in Master's programs, all in STEM fields. Based on these initial
successes, the current proposal aims to continue refining MU-ARTSS recruitment and curriculum activities,
and importantly, begin disseminating materials and outcome data produced by the program."
10901844,"About 1 out of 6 prescription drugs produce therapeutic effects by binding to a family of transcription factors
called nuclear receptors. Such nuclear receptor drugs often provide the best treatment option for many
diseases; however, they also cause serious adverse effects. For example, agonists known as
thiazolidinediones (TZDs) activate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ)
and are arguably the best treatment for type II diabetes; however, they cause weight gain and weak bones.
 Some PPARγ partial agonists produce fewer adverse effects but the same beneficial effects in mice
compared to TZDs. While this new class of agonists is promising, they have not reached the clinic. A lack of
understanding of how they produce different effects from TZDs impedes their development into drugs to treat
type II diabetes and other diseases.
 We propose that such partial agonists are “biased agonists”. Like TZDs, a biased agonist would bind to
and activate PPARγ; however, they would produce different effects by activating the receptor differently from
TZDs. How biased agonists could activate the receptor differently is not known.
 We know that agonists produce effects by recruiting other proteins, known as coactivators, to PPARγ.
The best-supported mechanism of biased agonism in nuclear receptors is that they induce what we term
“coactivator bias”. Coactivator bias refers to the ability of an agonist to bias interaction of PPARγ toward certain
coactivators or away from others relative to TZDs. It is well-documented that some agonists induce coactivator
bias; however, such bias has never been well-quantified and the mechanism underlying bias is unknown. This
lack of mechanistic understanding limits enthusiasm for and the ability to carry out further development of
biased PPARγ agonists.
 This proposal will quantify and compare coactivator bias for a panel of agonists and measure the acute
effects of those same agonists on cells. This will help determine how coactivator bias affects PPARγ signaling
pathways. Comparison of bias with the published physiologic effects of these agonists may correlate bias with
physiologic effects, including the desired and undesired effects of type II diabetes drugs.
 This proposal will also test structural mechanisms of coactivator bias. Our preliminary data show that
there are two distinct structural classes of coactivators and suggest a clear mechanism by which biased
agonists favor binding of one class. Completion of the aims of this proposal will define, in atomic detail,
mechanisms of biased agonism in PPARγ. Such knowledge is critical to further development of drugs that
produce less adverse effects, but maintain the powerful and unique beneficial effects of TZDs. Because
PPARγ is structurally similar to other nuclear receptors, the knowledge gained in this proposal will impact
biased drug development for other nuclear receptors."

11090321,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Given the high rates of Veteran suicide each year, suicide prevention has become a VHA strategic
priority. While progress has been made in screening Veterans for suicide risk, high rates of false positives
remain a challenge, potentially diverting clinical resources away from those Veterans who need them most.
Innovative new approaches to assess suicide risk are needed, that accurately identify short-term (e.g. coming
weeks) risk of suicidal behavior, and that are based on objective markers rather than relying primarily on self-
report. Recent work has identified several cognitive domains, including impulse control and inhibition,
increased distractibility, implicit semantic content, and processing of rewards/punishments, that may all be
altered in suicidal individuals.
 The current project will use a battery of computer-based tests to assess these cognitive domains,
followed by computational modeling to extract additional meta-variables representing latent cognitive
processes, to prospectively predict short-term risk of suicidal behavior in high-risk Veterans. Veterans
will be recruited from acute in-patient psychiatric units following a suicidal event, and tested at 3-month
intervals for a year; we will also record suicidal behavior (SB), defined as an actual, interrupted, or aborted
attempt or a behavior preparatory to suicide. In Aim 1, we will use neurocognitive task scores collected shortly
before the SB, to determine which tasks (and therefore, alterations in which cognitive domains) can
prospectively predict short-term risk of SB (within the next 3 months). In Aim 2, we will conduct computational
modeling on the behavioral data, to extract additional meta-variables, describing latent cognitive processes
such as response caution (impulsivity); subjective value of rewarding, punishing, and neutral feedback;
perseveration; and tendency to explore new responses, to determine which of these meta-variables can
prospectively predict SB. In Aim 3, we will combine these neurocognitive task scores and meta-variables,
along with ""standard"" indicators of suicide risk such as demographic, self-report, and clinical assessment, in a
statistical prediction model, to determine whether inclusion of these cognitive variables and meta-variables can
significantly improve prediction of short-term risk for SB in this high-risk Veteran sample.
 The results of this study will provide much-needed information to improve identification of Veterans
likely to make a suicide attempt in the upcoming weeks, so that clinical resources can be targeted to help
them. The computer-based neurocognitive tests represent relatively objective behavioral markers that could be
deployed fairly simply in a clinical setting or even via telehealth. Additionally, our focus on underlying cognitive
processes, as modifiable factors, will improve the ability to optimize intervention by suggesting specific
therapeutic approaches based on an individual Veteran's cognitive profile."
10898975,"Abstract
Formation of toxic protein aggregates is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders. In some diseases, including
Huntington’s Disease and six subtypes of spinocerebellar ataxia, protein aggregates form due to the expansion
of a CAG repeat in the coding region of a specific gene. This CAG repeat encodes for a polyglutamine tract that
aggregates when expanded, leading to neuronal death. One potential way to treat these diseases is to suppress
polyglutamine aggregation and toxicity. Our laboratory has taken a unique approach to addressing this issue.
Instead of studying polyglutamine in organisms where it aggregates and causes toxicity, we have identified the
social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum as a proteostatic outlier that is naturally resistant to polyglutamine
aggregation. To investigate this phenomenon, I conducted a proximity labeling screen to identify proteins in
Dictyostelium with increased proximity to polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, the causative protein in
Huntington’s Disease. Strikingly, I found that many proteins with increased proximity were highly glutamine-rich
and predicted to form prion. This is interesting because prions influence polyglutamine aggregation in a poorly
defined manner. Here I propose to help clarify the role of prion-like proteins in Dictyostelium and their potential
role in suppressing polyglutamine aggregation. Using parallel investigation in Dictyostelium, human cells, and in
vitro experiments, I hope to elucidate the role of prion-like proteins in regulating polyglutamine aggregation.
Additionally, I propose to define the roles of prions in Dictyostelium biology. Together these aims begin and
define the roles of prion-like proteins in Dictyostelium and determine how they influence the solubility of
Dictyostelium’s polyglutamine-rich proteome."
10886478,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Since late 2019, SARS-CoV-2 virus, and a resulting, potentially deadly disease called COVID-19, have caused a
global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 primarily causes disease in lungs but can also cause gastrointestinal and
neurological disease. The majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections are mild, however people of older age and people
with certain pre-existing conditions are at increased risk of severe illness and death. Emerging evidence suggests
that genetic factors may also contribute to COVID-19 severity. While most infections completely resolve within
several weeks, some people continue experiencing COVID-19 symptoms for weeks or even months after
recovering from acute illness. Of major concern is an emerging evidence that even those who recover from
symptomatic COVID-19 and even those who had a mild disease, may experience serious long-term complications
affecting different body organs. Some of these complications include respiratory, cardiovascular, renal,
neurological, and psychiatric conditions. Importantly, many potential long-term effects of COVID-19, as well as
risk factors for long-term complications, remain unknown.
Men and women who worked as first responders during the tragic 9/11/2001 World Trade Center (WTC) events
constitute an aging population. Toxic exposures at the WTC sites caused a disproportionally high prevalence of
certain health conditions (designated as WTC-related conditions) in this population, many of which have either
been identified or are hypothesized to be risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease and may increase the likelihood
of developing long-term complications. New York City (NYC) area, including Long Island, suffered from a major
early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, with an estimated 19-23% of the general population being infected in NYC. Pilot
data from Long Island WTC Health Program suggest that about 10% of WTC responders in this area may have
been infected. This research project aims to: 1) Assess the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 disease,
and mandatory social distancing measures on short- and long-term physical and mental health outcomes among
WTC responders; 2) Investigate demographic, health, and occupational risk factors, as well as the impact of toxic
WTC exposures on COVID-19 disease severity and negative health outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 infection,
and 3) Investigate genetic risk factors for COVID-19 disease severity and negative post-COVID outcomes. We
hypothesize that in this population SARS-CoV-2 infection will exacerbate incidence and progression of
respiratory, cardiovascular, and mental health conditions, and that similar demographic, health, genetic,
occupational, and toxic exposure factors will be associated with increased risk of severe disease and long-term
complications. The results of this study will help to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on WTC
responders, identify sub-populations at increased risk of negative outcomes, and inform targeted interventions
to manage these risks. Some of the study findings, in particular occupational and genetic risk factors of negative
COVID-19 outcomes, will have broader implications beyond WTC responder population."
10886613,"Imaging the full lifecycle of viral proteins in vivo is essential for understanding the molecular
processes underlying viral infection. Live-cell imaging has long been performed using
fluorescent protein fusion tags such as GFP. However, these tags can alter the size and
function of targeted proteins. Furthermore, slow maturation, degradation, and photobleaching of
tags results in the loss of signal, making it difficult to track the early life and ultimate fate of
many proteins. Viral polyproteins, in particular, remain refractory to imaging in vivo due to their
hypersensitivity to tags and the extensive processing and assembly they undergo during viral
biogenesis. The use of linear epitope tags reversibly labeled by genetically encoded live-cell
probes can solve many of these issues. Unfortunately, engineering functional probes for live-cell
imaging of epitopes has been costly and time-consuming. In the proposed research, we
combine expertise in protein engineering, single-molecule microscopy, and biochemistry to
refine and accelerate the rational design of orthogonal epitope/probe pairs for highly multiplexed
imaging of full viral protein lifecycles in living cells. We demonstrate the power of our strategy in
our Preliminary Data by creating novel scFvs that bind the commonly used HA and Flag
epitopes with high affinity in a variety of demanding live-cell imaging scenarios. In Aim 1, we will
use our tested strategy to develop scFv against additional viral epitope tags and validate their
utility in imaging experiments. To identify chimeric scFv that are both soluble and active within
the cellular milieu, we will graft known epitope-specific CDR loops onto a unique panel of stable
scFv scaffolds. In Aim 2, we will use state-of-the-art machine learning protein modeling and
design methods to develop predictive binding models for scFv:viral-epitope complexes, validate
a scFv design pipeline, engineer scFv libraries encoding multiple new peptide-binding solutions,
and screen using innovative high-throughput, high-content in vivo methods. In Aim 3, we will
demonstrate the utility of our newly developed scFv in live-cell imaging experiments by probing
several critical aspects of viral biology. Specifically, we will use our engineered scFv to visualize
and quantify the translation dynamics of flavivirus transmembrane polyproteins, and to monitor
alphavirus particle assembly kinetics. Overall, this project will provide a powerful new pipeline
for generating scFv proteins that can track viral proteins in living cells. The reagents we
generate will provide the virus molecular biology community with new, versatile imaging tools to
better illuminate many important biological processes."
10887389,"The functional architecture of the nervous system is usually thought of in terms of groups of neurons
with similar functions being clustered together. However, groups of synaptic connections with similar
functions also cluster together resulting in a fine-scale (1-10 μm) functional architecture of nervous tissue.
The significance of this fine-scale microcircuitry has been difficult to asses because it can involve dozens of
neurons computing signals that are not readily detectable at the level of neuronal cell bodies. Here we
propose an approach to studying developmental and functional principles of local microcircuits in the mouse
visual thalamus.
 In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), axons from the retina (RGCs) form glia encapsulated
clusters of synapses (glomeruli) with thalamocortical relay cells and inhibitory neurons. The functional
significance of these local microcircuits is unknown. Based on the diverse patterns of glomerular connectivity
we observed in our previous studies of mouse dLGN, we believe these microcircuits are preforming visual-channel-specific computations ranging from simple relay of signals to complex feature detection. We also
hypothesize that, central to the organization of these microcircuits, is the use of developmental retinal activity
to group functionally related RGCs and inhibitory neurites together in the same glomeruli.
 Our first step in testing the above hypotheses is to create a detailed mapping of the development of
mouse dLGN glomerular microcircuits using serial section electron microscopy that will reveal which cell
types initiate glomerulus formation and which aspects of the microcircuit’s connectivity appear during activity
dependent synaptic remodeling. We will then test whether visual deprivation or transgenic silencing of
subsets of RGC inputs alters the grouping together of neurites or the specificity with which they form
synapses. The results of these developmental studies will reveal the extent to which dLGN microcircuit
structure is the result of visual experience.
 We will then probe the function of dLGN glomeruli by first recording the response properties of
thalamocortical cells and then reconstructing the glomerular microcircuitry of those same neurons with
electron microscopy. By matching receptive field properties to their microcircuit configurations, we will learn
whether different glomerular types are specific to different channels of visual processing and will gain insight
into the computations likely to be executed by different local microcircuits. We will next use optogenetic
stimulation of RGCs to determine how different glomerular configurations integrate signals from converging
inputs.
 The proposed experiments will reveal the origin, organization and function of the fine-scale
microcircuitry of an important model system for vision and circuit development."
10887391,"This is an application for an interdisciplinary project to develop a novel approach for personalized chemotherapy
of gynecologic cancers. Estimates from the National Cancer Institute indicate that more than 116,000 women in
the United States will be diagnosed with a gynecologic cancer and about 34,000 die from these types of cancer
in 2021. Despite advances in surgical and radiation treatments, chemotherapy continues to be an important
treatment option for gynecologic malignancies, especially for locally advanced and metastatic tumors. However,
the efficacy of chemotherapy is substantially limited by the intrinsic and acquired resistance of cancer cells to
cytotoxic drugs. We are proposing to develop and validate a nanotechnology-based approach of personalized
treatment of ovarian carcinoma (most lethal type of gynecological cancers) constructed on the individual genetic
profile of the patient’s tumor. Based on the results of the present translational research the following treatment
protocol will be proposed for future clinical trials after the completion of the present project. Samples of a patient’s
tumor and normal surrounding tissues will be obtained during the tumor debulking surgery and tumor profile data
(the expression of predefined genes and proteins) will be obtained and analyzed. Based on this analysis, several
molecular targets and the most effective anticancer drug(s) will be selected. Finally, a mixture of complex
nanocarrier-based targeted delivery systems (TDS) containing drug(s)/siRNA(s)/targeted peptide will be
selected from the pre-synthesized bank and the patient will be treated with the chosen cocktail of TDS designed
specifically for their individual tumor. The selected systems will include the lipid-based carrier, the tumor targeting
moiety, the most effective drug(s) and siRNA(s) selected for each individual patient based on a genetic profile of
the patient’s tumor. It is expected that such personalized therapy will effectively suppress drug resistance and
tumor growth, inhibit the development of metastases and limit adverse side effects of therapy in the particular
patient. The main goals of the proposed research are to identify profiles of gene/protein expression in tissue
samples isolated from patients with ovarian cancer that predict tumor response and resistance to anticancer
drugs with different mechanisms of action. We also will develop a set of TDSs containing anticancer drug(s) or
siRNA(s) targeted to different mRNAs overexpressed in the tumor of the patient. Finally, a genetic profile and
protein expression phenotype will be performed on samples of tumor tissues and malignant ascites from patients
with ovarian carcinoma. Cancer cells will be isolated from fresh samples obtained during surgery. Based on the
results of the genetic profiling, a mixture of TDS will be created and tested in vitro (on cell culture model) and in
vivo (on subcutaneous murine cancer model) using cancer cells isolated from each individual patient and
recommendations for the personalized treatment of ovarian cancer will be developed."
10887392,"Obesity and metabolic disease are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, and their increasing prevalence
has led to increased rates of vascular pathology in our population. Adipocytes have functional specificity based
on their molecular phenotype; white adipocytes store energy in the form of lipids (white adipose tissue), and
thermogenic adipocytes burn calories and generate heat (beige and brown adipose tissue). Within the vascular
microenvironment, blood vessels are surrounded by perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) that impacts vascular
function. In the mouse, PVAT surrounding the thoracic aorta are brown-like, with high levels of thermogenic
markers, and a clear association with vascular reactivity and vascular disease progression. In humans, aortic
PVAT appears similar to human subcutaneous white adipose tissue, with unilocular adipocytes displaying a
lipid storage phenotype. However, we identified thermogenic markers within human aortic PVAT, and
molecular differences are established between human PVAT from healthy versus diseased vasculature. The
ability to increase the proportion of thermogenic versus white adipose tissue in the body has been suggested
to be an anti-obesity therapeutic strategy, and increasing thermogenesis of PVAT is predicted to be protective
against vascular disease. Thus, it is critical to understand molecular determinants of adipocyte thermogenesis
in humans. In collaborative work, we recently defined novel lineages of thermogenic adipocytes that were
functionally tested in mice. These lineages, interestingly, included a smooth muscle cell (SMC) like adipocyte
lineage, which is relevant to PVAT, which is directly adjacent to the vessel wall. We hypothesize that the
smooth muscle cell-like adipocyte lineage in human PVAT contributes directly to the thermogenic adipocyte
lineage in humans, and that the functional activity of this lineage inversely correlates to vascular disease
progression. This is a translational study with the following specific aims: Aim 1. Define the molecular identity
of the adipocyte progenitor cells in human PVAT, and cellular PVAT composition in vascular pathology. We will
perform molecular studies to identify sub-populations of adipocyte progenitors and overall cellular composition
in human PVAT, and identify associations with clinical and physiological measures of health and disease. Aim
2. Identify the mechanisms driving functional capacity thermogenic adipocyte differentiation in human
adipocyte progenitors, and impact on vascular smooth muscle cell physiology. Differentiation capacity will be
tested in the fibroblast progenitor population and the SMC-like progenitor population, and paracrine signaling
from adipocytes will be evaluated using human vascular SMC. Novel pathways identified from molecular
studies will inform studies to determine drivers of thermogenic differentiation. Our results are expected to
identify for the first time molecular signatures of PVAT corresponding to different vascular pathologies, and
characterize critical adipocyte progenitor populations related to the differentiation of thermogenic adipocytes in
human progenitor cells."
10887398,"ABSTRACT
In developed countries, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness
in the elderly and there are no treatments for the majority of patients. Early AMD is characterized by the
formation of protein- and lipid-rich, sub-retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) deposits. These deposits contain
many constituents that are attributable to both the activation of the complement cascade and lipoprotein
metabolism. In addition, complement and lipoprotein pathway genes have been independently associated with
AMD in multiple ways including genetic risk association and epidemiological studies. Efforts to understand how
lipid metabolism/trafficking and complement dysregulation contribute to AMD have been limited in part by the
lack of age-dependent in vivo models that faithfully recapitulate these pathogenic aspects of the disease. The
aim of the proposed studies is to leverage data derived using novel animal models of AMD that we have
developed. These models invoke advanced age, complement dysregulation and lipid/cholesterol perturbation,
all known contributors to human AMD risk. Specifically, we generated mouse models based on the most
replicated genetic risk variant associated with AMD risk, the tyrosine (Y) to histidine (H) substitution at amino
acid position 402 (Y402H) of human complement factor H, the soluble regulator of the alternative complement
pathway. Only mice expressing the human H402 AMD risk variant (CFH-H/H) develop an AMD phenotype
compared to mice expressing the normal human Y402 CFH variant. Significantly, the AMD phenotype
correlates with changes in lipoprotein levels in blood, and in the RPE/Bruch’s membrane (BrM)/choroid
complex. Thus, we are the first to observe a functional consequence of the Y402H polymorphism in vivo, which
promotes an AMD-like pathology and affects lipoprotein levels in aged mice. In addition, we analyzed ApoA-1
containing lipoproteins isolated from BrM and plasma of elderly human donors and found they have very
different protein compositions. The most striking difference is the significantly higher concentration of ApoB
and ApoE in BrM, which are known to bind to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and could promote lipoprotein
deposition onto BrM GAGs; likely initiating downstream effects that contribute to RPE dysfunction/death.
Based on these observations and other studies we hypothesize that aberrant RPE-derived high-density
lipoprotein (HDL)-like lipoprotein secretion contributes to AMD development, and is modulated by CFH. Thus,
the goals of the proposed studies are to use our novel animal models of AMD and human induced pluripotent
stem cell-derived RPE to (1) elucidate the mechanism by which CFH modulates lipoprotein clearance in AMD
pathogenesis and (2) to test whether augmenting normal CFH and/or enhancing local HDL clearance are
viable strategies for treating AMD.
 Outcomes from these studies will mechanistically determine the interaction of two risk factors, CFH and
lipoproteins in AMD and establish proof of concept for these factors as therapeutic targets for AMD."

Theory, Aim 1 will determine the efficiency and acceptability of hybrid methods to promote healthcare
engagement among low income LEP Latinos. In Aim 2, the study will determine the efficiency and acceptability
of using hybrid methods for recruitment, data collection, and research engagement among Latinos by
comparing traditional convenience sampling approaches to sampling using technology-based methods. Using
the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Research Effectiveness-Adoption
Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, semi-structured interviews will be conducted with key
stakeholders to assess and inform implementation determinants and outcomes of hybrid methods to inform
future broad scale implementation (Aim 3). This proposal creates a platform for trainees to learn and apply
skills in community-based research, implementation science, mHealth, network analysis, epidemiology, and
health disparities. This work also seeks to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in research by prioritizing
community engagement and training opportunities for early-stage investigators who are under-represented in
medicine and health-related sciences"

Food intake can be triggered by not only the need for calories, but also the need for specific nutrients,
or need-independent mechanisms. Studies over the recent decades have made substantial progress in
our understanding of neural pathways controlling food intake in the context of energy homeostasis. In
contrast, mechanisms underlying calorie-independent feeding remain poorly understood. Using
Drosophila as a model system, I recently identified and characterized the first neural circuit encoding
protein-specific hunger in any model system. This circuit provides a novel entry for future investigations
into the nutrient specific food intake that is independent of caloric needs. In this proposed study, I will
characterize the molecular and cellular substrates mediating the homeostatic regulation of protein
consumption, with a particular focus on the sensing of protein abundance or scarcity. We also plan to
elucidate how environmental blue light drives feeding behavior in the absence of nutritional needs. To
achieve these goals, we will employ a multidisciplinary approach including large-scale genetic
analyses, quantitative behavioral measurements, immunohistochemistry, functional imaging, patch-
clamp electrophysiology and metabolomics analysis. Together these investigations will substantially
deepen our understanding of calorie-independent motivational drive to eat, shedding light on the
fundamental principles for the organization and modulation of feeding behaviors."

With the recent advances in high-throughput biotechnologies and associated flooding of Big Data,
there is an urgent demand and shortage of the next-generation PhD-level scientists who have strong
biostatistical and computational skills to handle Big Data while understanding biology, especially
genetics and genomics. However, traditional training in biostatistics, which emphasizes almost
exclusively on statistical theory and methods, no longer meets the need; similarly, to meet Big Data
challenge, traditional training in genetics could be expanded and strengthened with more training in
biostatistics/data science. As a response, this application continues the development and refinement
of an innovative and interdisciplinary pre-doctoral T32 “Biostatistics in Genetics and Genomics”
(BiG2) training program. The primary mission of this training grant is to prepare Biostatistics,
Genetics and other predoctoral trainees for leadership roles in biomedical research through excellent
training and mentorship in both biostatistics and genetics/genomics. To meet the overarching
objective specified by the NIGMS's RFA, our training program requires completion by each trainee of
required and elective coursework in an affiliated PhD program with extra training in Biostatistics
and/or Genetics, mentored learning through interdisciplinary research projects through lab rotations,
development of critical thinking, communication and networking skills, attendance at and participation
in journal clubs, seminars and national meetings, successful completion of a program of
interdisciplinary research through their dissertation, and future career development, all of which give
our trainees broad training in a rapidly expanding field. The most distinctive feature of the proposed
training program is its interdisciplinary nature integrating both a biostatistical (or
methodological/computational) aspect and a genetic/biomedical aspect. A key is to ensure each
trainee learns how to carry out critical, reproducible, cohesive and interdisciplinary research program,
including collaborating with various biomedical researchers. We request support for 4-5-6-6-6 slots in
years 1-5 for predoctoral trainees from Biostatistics, Genetics and other affiliated PhD programs.
Each trainee is to be funded for two years at the early stage of his/her PhD study, after which his/her
support will switch to projects funded by the faculty mentors' research grants. As measurable
outcomes, in a short term, we will examine the success rates of the trainee's timely completion of
their PhD studies and their job placements; in a long term, it will be determined by the success and
impact of their future careers in biomedical research; in between, it will be their publications, awards
and career transitions around the beginning of their careers."

Chronic lower respiratory tract disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide.
Currently there are no effective disease-modifying therapies and it remains unclear how to define and optimally
treat disease endotypes within the spectrum of asthma and COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease;
chronic bronchitis and emphysema). This mechanistic research aims to define new pathways amenable to
therapeutic intervention based on the role of diseased airway epithelial cells as an upstream driver of chronic
airway disease. As a foundation for this proposal, multiple human clinical and translational studies as well as
allergen- smoke- and virus-induced animal models have solidified the relevance of the pathogenic epithelial-
derived cytokine IL-33 in COPD and asthma. However, a major knowledge gap that remains is understanding
the mechanism by which nuclear-sequestered IL-33 can be activated and secreted from diseased airway cells
to drive inflammation. Here we present preliminary data that demonstrates human COPD airway epithelial
cells express increased levels of a truncated, spliced IL-33 isoform, which is capable of escaping nuclear
sequestration to be abundantly secreted. Our analysis further revealed novel features of this secreted IL-33
isoform including post-translational modification, interaction with exosome-associated chaperones, and
utilization of exosome trafficking pathways for secretion. Accordingly, this study aims to elucidate the impact
of these newly-discovered features of IL-33 biology on the pathogenesis of chronic airway disease. Aim 1 will
define how IL-33 interaction with exosomal chaperones enhances cytokine secretion and receptor activation
to drive airway disease, using human cellular and mouse airway disease models coupled with validation in
human airway disease specimens. Aim 2 will investigate the role of post-translational modification in
augmenting IL-33 secretion and receptor activation to propagate disease, through an analogous approach
using human cellular and mouse models with validation in human specimens. Together, these aims will
address key steps in the pathologic sequence that initiates and sustains chronic airway disease, illuminating
novel ways to target exosome-mediated cytokine secretion at the mucosal interface."

Brain electrophysiological phenotyping holds promise for parsing heterogeneity in ASD and enabling testing of
proposed treatments more reliably in biologically-based subgroups of ASD. There have been considerable
advances in the non-invasive imaging and electrophysiologic correlates of phenotypes in ASD, in children,
including 1) delayed auditory evoked response components (M50, M100 latency); 2) delayed magnetic
mismatch fields (MMF) elicited by vowel contrasts as well as atypical rightward lateralization; 3) atypical
development of gamma-band oscillatory phase synchrony, coupled to atypical levels of inhibitory
neurotransmitter, GABA; and 4) atypical motor oscillatory activity, particularly the post-movement beta rebound
(PMBR). We have suggested that such electrophysiological signatures might serve as biomarkers in stratifying
patients for inclusion in clinical trials according to biology, rather than behavior alone. However, little is known
about how these candidate biomarkers mature into adulthood. This is important because there are millions of
adults on the autism spectrum, presenting in clinic in need of treatment. Our preliminary studies suggest that
there might be persistence of childhood electrophysiological phenotypes into adulthood (in particular, auditory
M50/M100 and MMF delays), while differences in auditory gamma band phase synchrony and motor PMBR
oscillatory responses may in fact emerge during adolescence. If indeed childhood biological differences persist
into adulthood and/or some biological differences emerge in late adolescence/ early adulthood, then the
opportunity and target for remediation may also persist in adulthood. This would indicate the need for a
quantitative biomarker for both stratification (inclusion/exclusion) purposes but also for monitoring treatment
target engagement, as well as longer term evidence of brain response. We will recruit 72 autistic adolescents/
adults (14-45yrs, 48M, 24F) and 72 age-/sex-matched typically developing (TD) peers into a multimodal
imaging study with a 12-week longitudinal design to mimic a typical pharmaceutical trial and establish precision
estimates for each metric to define the resolution of interval change in subsequent trials. We will carry out the
following Aims. In Aim 1, we will evaluate, in a sample of adults, the group level ASD vs TD discrimination of
each of a battery of MEG metrics and assess intra- and inter-subject variability over three scan sessions
(baseline, 4weeks, 12weeks). This will establish the effect size required of any putative pharmaceutical. In
Aim 2, we will use multimodal imaging to address heterogeneity and probe the biological
underpinnings of M50 latency prolongation in adults. In Aim 3, we will use simultaneously-acquired MEG and
EEG, to determine the efficacy of EEG analogs of the proposed MEG measures to achieve similar group-
level discrimination of individuals with ASD vs TD. EEG is lower-cost, simpler to perform and has widespread
availability appropriate for clinical trial conduct. In culmination, the aims of this study will provide pivotal
answers to critical “clinical readiness” questions about electrophysiological biomarkers in autistic adults."
10875649,"Project Summary
Birth cohort studies have found significant associations between early-life wheezing-associated respiratory
tract infections and the development of asthma in children up to 13 years of age. These studies suggest that
early life respiratory tract infections have a direct effect on lung and/or immune cell development and the risk of
asthma. To determine possible mechanisms, we established a mouse model of early-life RV infection. Infection
of 6 day-old mice, but not mature mice, induces long-lasting mucous metaplasia, eosinophilic inflammation and
airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) which is associated with type 2 innate lymphoid cell (ILC2) expansion and
dependent on IL-13, IL-25 and IL-33. For this renewal application, we have developed preliminary data
showing that early-life RV infection increases the number of airway IL-25+ DCLK1+ brush cells, providing a
mechanism for a persistent ILC2-dependent asthma-like phenotype. In addition, we have found that, in
immature mice, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β maturation inhibits type 2 cytokine
expression and mucous metaplasia. In this proposal, we will test the general hypothesis that, following early-
life RV infection, development of ILC2-dependent type 2 airway inflammation and mucous metaplasia
represents a balance between tuft cell RV-induced IL-25 signaling (promotes the phenotype) and NLRP3-
dependent IL-1β signaling (suppresses the phenotype). To test this, we propose the following Aims:
 Specific Aim 1. Determine the contribution of airway brush (tuft) cells to viral-induced IL-25
production. We hypothesize that: 1) early-life RV infection stimulates a persistent increase in the number of
IL-25-producing airway tuft cells; 2) tuft cells are required for RV-induced ILC2 expansion, mucous metaplasia
and AHR; 3) RV-induced IL-25 and IL-13 production (by ILC2s and M2 polarized macrophages) constitute a
feed-forward mechanism for tuft cell development.
 Specific Aim 2. Determine the role of IL-1β on the development of RV-induced mucous metaplasia
and AHR. We hypothesize that: 1) in immature mice, RV-induced, NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent IL-1β
production suppresses the asthma-like phenotype; 2) IL-1β inhibits epithelial cell innate cytokine expression;
and 3) LPS and dog-associated house dust each attenuate development of the mucous metaplasia phenotype
by stimulating inflammasome priming and activation.
 Specific Aim 3. Determine the effects of early-life RV-C infection. We hypothesize that: 1) compared
to RV-A, RV-C infection of 6 day-old mice induces more type 2 inflammation, mucous metaplasia and AHR; 2)
RV-C induces greater expansion of tuft cells; 3) RV-C elicits inflammasome priming but not activation, thereby
permitting greater and more long-lasting type 2 cytokine expression and mucous metaplasia.
 Immature mice and infants with respiratory viral infections will be studied. Completion of the proposed work
will provide new insight into the pathogenesis of asthma development, and identify new targets for prevention."
10875437,"Riverside Research, the University of Bristol (Bristol, United Kingdom), and the University Paul Sabatier (Toulouse,
France) propose to develop the next generation of quantitative acoustic microscopy (QAM) systems. Specifically, data-
science and coded-excitation approaches will be applied for the first time to QAM technology to yield better image
quality, decreased scanning time, greater ease of use, as well as to pave the way for a new generation of novel, low-cost,
user-friendly QAM instruments. QAM permits formation of fine-resolution (i.e., <7 µm at 250 MHz) maps of acoustic
and mechanical properties of tissue sections that are <12 µm in thickness. These data can have great value in numerous
preclinical investigations. Such property maps are not currently obtainable by any other microscopic-imaging modality,
and the new generation of QAM technology made possible by success in this proposed project could become
widespread in research laboratories and microscopy suites in commercial as well as academic research environments.
Such new-generation QAM instruments could be used by technicians with limited knowledge of QAM and, in many
ways, their use would be no more complicated than use of a conventional bright-field microscope. These novel
approaches to QAM will be demonstrated using already available resolution targets, phantoms, and biological tissues
(ocular-tissue samples from a guinea-pig model of myopia and cancerous human lymph nodes). During the course of this
project, optimal methods will be incorporated in a prototype QAM (pQAM) instrument capable of producing ultra-fine
spatial resolution (< 2 µm) images much faster (<1 min) and for a much lower cost (<$40k) than current state-of-the-art
QAM systems. In addition, pQAM use will be ``turn-key'' (i.e., requiring no technical knowledge and less than 1 hour of
training.)"

 Strengthen Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance in Retail Food Specimens in
Kansas as a Part of the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System
 As a key activity in combating bacterial antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the
National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) since 1996 monitors
AMR in foodborne pathogens and indicator bacterial species in food-animals at the time
of their processing; in red meat, poultry, and since 2020 also in seafood products sold to
the general public in retail; and in human foodborne infections. The program monitoring
AMR in retail food is led and managed by the Food and Drug Administration – Center
for Veterinary Medicine (FDA-CVM). The food sample collection and microbiologic
analysis are performed by the program sites in individual states. The site in Kansas was
established in 2016, and the site-team has performed the NARMS Retail Food
Surveillance programmatic activities of collecting and subjecting to microbiologic
analysis samples of food retailed in Kansas. One of the major innovations in the
program in recent years has been addition of whole genome sequencing and annotation
of the bacterial isolates obtained from retail food samples. This new project will enable
the Kansas site-team to continue the prior programmatic activities in Kansas, with the
addition of a routine whole genome sequencing and annotation of bacterial isolates
obtained from food samples collected in retail stores in Kansas. The bacterial isolates,
and their epidemiologic and genomic data will be shared with the Kansas Department of
Health and Environment. The Department will use these surveillance data and materials
to advance public health in the state and inform program and policy development. The
results will be also used to educate about and raise public awareness of AMR. The
isolates, and their epidemiologic and genomic data will be delivered to the NARMS
Retail Food Surveillance program on the required schedule. The program team will use
these data and materials to enhance AMR surveillance and foodborne outbreak
analysis, and enable program and policy development at the national level. Therefore,
this project will strengthen AMR surveillance and analysis, support foodborne outbreak
investigation, inform antimicrobial drug stewardship, and promote public health in
Kansas and nation-wide."

Liver cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer and is on the rise in the western world. Minimally inva-
sive, catheter-based locoregional therapies (LRT), such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), are now the
mainstay treatments for intermediate to advanced stage HCC and are included in all management guidelines.
TACE is a palliative therapy that prolongs survival by controlling intra-hepatic tumor progression via targeted is-
chemic injury, paired with the delivery of highly concentrated chemotherapy into the tumor-feeding artery. More
recently, systemic immunotherapies (IMT), speciﬁcally immune checkpoint inhibitors, have emerged as an im-
portant treatment option for HCC to boost the body's own immune response against the tumor. While IMT is
promising for many cancers, only 15-30% of HCC patients respond to this type of therapy. TACE is increasingly
used in conjunction with IMT, both in neoadjuvant and adjuvant scenarios. Recent efforts show that TACE can
dramatically alter the tumor microenvironment (TME) to become more immune-permissive, enabling more ef-
fective immune cell recruitment against the tumor through IMT. Thus, the LRT+IMT combination is a likely path
forward for HCC treatment strategies. In this context, there is an urgent and unmet clinical need for robust, non-
invasive quantitative biomarkers to help guide therapeutic decision making and assess therapeutic outcome early
during treatment. Previously, our team developed clinical and preclinical advanced imaging, image analysis, and
imaging biomarkers to study, guide and assess HCC treatment with TACE alone using multiparameter magnetic
resonance imaging (mpMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). We developed random
forests and convolutional neural networks for liver segmentation, tissue classiﬁcation and nonrigid registration to
map these results into the clinical treatment environment. Using graph convolutional neural networks, we pre-
dicted and assessed therapeutic outcomes. In a rabbit model of liver cancer (VX2), using Biosensor Imaging of
Redundant Deviation in Shifts (BIRDS), we successfully characterized the metabolic state of the TME with respect
to extracellular acidosis, before and after TACE. We now propose to develop robust quantitative biomarkers for
combined LRT+IMT assessment and outcome prediction in humans. We will develop novel image analysis (Joint
Domain Learning with Structure-Consistent Embedding by Disentanglement) and characterize the changing TME
over the course of LRT+IMT by deriving information from longitudinal mpMRI (with liver-speciﬁc contrast) and/or
multiphase computed tomography (mpCT), learning across modalities via domain adaptation. Since LRT+IMT is
expected to reduce extracellular acidosis in treated liver tumors, we propose to develop high-resolution advanced
BIRDS in the rabbit VX2 model with novel machine learning to spatially characterize changes in extracellular
acidosis due to LRT+IMT, enabling focus on the peritumoral region where immune activation is most enhanced.
These developments will ultimately facilitate personalized HCC treatment stratiﬁcation."

Cigarette smoking is both common and undertreated among oncology patients. Although smoking is a leading
cause of cancer and results in worse cancer prognoses, only half of cancer patients who smoke are offered
help in quitting during cancer care, and it is unclear that the help they are offered is effective. This R35
proposal is designed to transform oncology practice so that smoking cessation is an integral part of treatment
for all cancer patients who smoke. Electronic health records (EHRs) have tremendous potential to accelerate
improvements in clinical care by facilitating such treatment delivery. EHR modifications can also increase
discovery by enhancing assessment of smoking treatment reach, costs, equity, and effectiveness both in terms
of helping patients quit and improving cancer outcomes. The Principal Investigator has 30 years of experience
leading research and policy efforts to promote the treatment of smoking. Over the past 7 years, he has led a
team that developed and evaluated new EHR-based tools and workflows that markedly increase the proportion
of adult patients who receive evidence-based smoking cessation treatment in primary care. The new R35
proposal will similarly identify intervention strategies that increase smoking treatment engagement and
effectiveness when implemented in oncologic care. Over the last 4 years, the Principal Investigator has served
as Senior Scientist for NCI’s Moonshot-supported Cancer Center Cessation Initiative (C3I), a nationwide effort
of 52 NCI-designated cancer centers to develop and implement programs to aid their patients who smoke. Yet,
this incredibly important initiative has not been systematically assessed in terms of which EHR-enabled
interventions enhance a smoking program’s reach, patient engagement, implementation, cessation
effectiveness, and benefits. This R35 renewal is designed to do just that by systematically assessing best
practices via EHR data extraction of intervention delivery, healthcare costs, short-term cancer treatment
outcomes overall, and by patient demographics. These EHR data will be supplemented by qualitative analysis
of C3I smoking treatment components, delivery, adaptations, and contexts in a mixed-methods approach.
Higher- and lower-performing smoking treatment programs will be identified and rigorous methods will then be
used to select best practice programs from cessation- and cost-effectiveness perspectives. Further
assessment will identify implementation strategies and contextual factors that may contribute to the
effectiveness of these programs. Best practices from these programs will be implemented in lower-performing
C3I programs, with research team support in adaptation and implementation. Pragmatic implementation guides
and strategies will be used to disseminate best practices to cancer care programs nationwide. Thus, the
proposed project seeks to extend and adapt transformative EHR-facilitated system changes that enhance
smoking treatment in primary care to the high-priority cancer care context. The project will demonstrate the
benefits of such system changes to cancer patients in terms of costs, smoking cessation, and cancer recovery."

The Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) has been working with the Minnesota
Department of Health (MDH), CDC, and FDA on the Retail Food Study since its
inception in 2002. This project was designed to determine the prevalence of
antimicrobial resistance among enteric pathogens found in retail meats (including
chicken, pork, ground beef, and ground turkey). In Minnesota, MDA and MDH are
culturing all meats for Salmonella and chicken and ground turkey for Campylobacter. All
isolates are further characterized by MDA or MDH and sent on to FDA for further
analysis (including culture confirmation, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and
molecular subtyping). From 2015-2019, a total of 80 meat samples per month were
tested (including pork and beef). Among the samples, all 80 were tested for Salmonella,
all 20 turkey samples and 20 (half) of the chicken samples were tested for
Campylobacter. Starting in 2020 the sample total dropped back to 40 per month and the
pilot seafood study was initiated. In Minnesota, in 2019, 63 of 480 (13.1%) chicken
samples, 35 of 240 (14.6%) ground turkey samples, 15 of 120 (12.5%) pork samples,
and 1 of 120 (0.8%) ground beef samples tested positive for Salmonella. Also, in
Minnesota in 2019, 45 of 480 (9.4%) chicken samples and 2 of 240 (0.8%) ground
turkey samples tested positive for Campylobacter. MDA and MDH plan to continue our
cooperative arrangement. We will continue collect samples from the seven-county
Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, which comprises over half of Minnesota’s
population. We will also collect from rural areas starting in 2021. This study has
contributed substantial data to our understanding of the species, serotypes, and
antimicrobial resistance types of Campylobacter and Salmonella found in various retail
meats. This data has been beneficial in guiding our outbreak investigations where
meats may have been the source of infection in humans. We have encountered very
few barriers or challenges in our experience with this study and feel it has been a
valuable tool, adding a critical component to the picture of antimicrobial resistance in
Minnesota."

West Virginia (WV) bears long-standing physical, psychosocial and fiscal characteristics, including the opioid
crisis, limited resources and a restricted economy, that have significantly impacted the health of its residents.
The West Virginia Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (WVPCTN), as a Clinical Site of the ECHO IDeA States PCTN
(ISPCTN), has catalyzed emerging solutions to address some of these burdens by fulfilling its mission.
Specifically, the mission of the WVPCTN has been two-fold - bringing clinical trials to our underserved population,
and building professional capacity for clinical research. Our WVU site has been well positioned to be a successful
Clinical Site due to a combination of structural and human resources that were already in place when the ISPCTN
was initiated in 2016, and the background and expertise of the three PIs – Drs. Saul, Pyles and Cottrell. The
addition of the funds and resources provided by ISPCTN led to an acceleration of WVUs capacity to actively
participate in clinical trials by allowing us to create a dedicated Pediatric Research Unit (PRU) and introduce a
group of junior, less experienced clinical trial investigators, into both ISPCTN and non-ISPCTN trials. The
effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated through an increase in faculty participation in ISPCTN
activities, a strong recruitment record, and an increase in the number of non-ISPCTN Pediatric trials at WVU.
The WVPCTN is now actively growing an experienced investigator pool and a group of mentee investigators, all
enhanced by the resources and expertise of the West Virginia Clinical Translational Science Institute (WVCTSI).
These features and resources, together with strong and sustained partnerships throughout the state, and the
multiple environmentally related conditions of our citizens, continue to uniquely position us to be successful as
an ISPCTN Clinical Site and work to propose new trials for the network. This proposal for WVPCTN-2 will further
add to a long-standing commitment to Pediatric-focused initiatives across the state. When funded, it will continue
to position us to fully leverage additional funds that support Pediatric research infrastructure and provide access
to cutting edge trials, both of which will positively impact the health of the children of WV."

The award will replace the current T32 program, which has successfully trained students for 45 years. The
Genetics Training Program (GTP) seeks to (i) help a diverse cohort of students develop the research and
professional skills to become leaders in the biomedical workforce, and (ii) to create a supportive training
environment where all students have the potential to succeed. To this end, our program of study provides
graduate training across a broad range of modern genetics subdisciplines, coupled with professional
development and career awareness. Foundational to our training goals, our program strives to maintain a
training environment that is welcoming and inclusive, and to prioritize the holistic development of both trainees
and their mentors. The 51 trainers come from 10 departments and span the breadth of genetics research.
Trainers are committed to mentoring and to providing a supportive and inclusive training environment, and the
program has mechanisms in place to support trainers as they continue to develop their own mentoring skills.
GTP students enter UGA through one of two umbrella programs that employ a holistic admissions process.
During the first semester, coursework and laboratory rotations within these programs help students develop the
skills needed for success in graduate school. Students who choose GTP trainers for thesis research then
become part of the GTP community and are eligible to apply for traineeships. We request funding for 10
traineeships per year. Traineeships are awarded during a student’s second and/or third year of graduate
school, with a duration of one year and the possibility of renewal. The GTP core curriculum is required for
trainees and is open to all students in GTP trainer laboratories. This curriculum includes training in genetic
methods and analyses, quantitative and analytical skills, and oral and written communication. Courses
emphasize cohort-building and use active learning strategies, and skills are mastered through iterative
practice. The importance of rigor and transparency, and of responsible conduct in research, are introduced in
specialized foundational classes and then reinforced through integration into subsequent coursework and
thesis research. Professional development opportunities expose students to the diverse career options
available to them and help students gain the skills and networking opportunities needed to access these
positions. Student progress is monitored through regular assessment, and students are guided toward
increasing research independence through active mentoring. Students graduate with advanced genetics
knowledge, strong analytical and communication skills, and the confidence to lead and succeed in the
biomedical workforce. We will track student outcomes and use program assessments to advance evidence-
based innovations in mentoring, training, and diversity efforts within our program. We will also share our
successes to catalyze positive changes in graduate education across the life sciences at UGA."
10877002,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tumor hypoxia predicts poor outcomes across all cancers and is a well-established source of resistance to both
chemo- and radiotherapy. We have shown that T cells fail to thrive in hypoxic zones of cancer underlying the
failure of checkpoint blockade for immune “cold” indications such as pancreatic and prostate cancer. While our
prior work relied on our serendipitous discovery that the hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, could efficiently
reduce tumor hypoxia, there have been no studies to identify the most effective means to reduce hypoxia in
cancer. Mechanistically, tumor hypoxia results from the combination of diminished oxygen supply coupled with
enhanced tumor oxygen consumption. While each of these influences helps to foster hypoxia and nucleate an
immune suppressive state, nothing is known of their relative importance in establishment of the hypoxic state
itself, nor of their differential impact on tumor-infiltrating T cells within hypoxic regions. Further, we lack an
understanding of the factors governing durability of hypoxia-reduction, and of any interventions to limit tumors’
capacity to restore the hypoxic state. At a deeper level, the precise molecular signals triggered by hypoxia, which
reprogram myeloid and myofibroblast cells in the stroma to adapt metabolically to the hypoxic state and acquire
immune suppressive function also remain unclear. We therefore hypothesize that tumor hypoxia and
associated immune suppressive programming of the myeloid and myofibroblast stroma can be reduced
through both local tissue remodeling and through limitation of tumor oxygen metabolism. Our first aim is
to determine the kinetics of hypoxia and immune infiltrate modulation by hypoxia-activated prodrugs, oxidative
phosphorylation (OxPhos) inhibitors, and anti-angiogenic agents. For each class, we will establish the kinetics
by which they reduce hypoxia, how durable that reduction is post-therapy, and whether re-treatment can
eliminate re-emergent hypoxia. This first of its kind systematic study will not only reveal optimal approaches for
reducing tumor hypoxia in an immune-potentiating context but will also provide insights into the relative
contribution of disrupted oxygen supply versus elevated tumor oxygen consumption toward establishing hypoxia.
Second, we will investigate the impact of OxPhos inhibitors on both tumor and T cell metabolism and hypoxic
fitness. We will assess how three inhibitors of OxPhos metabolism, which target distinct subunits of Complex I,
impact tumor versus T cell metabolism, function, and hypoxic adaptation. These studies will provide critical
insight into whether tumor oxygen consumption can be inhibited in a manner which compromises tumor hypoxic
fitness and immune privilege without damaging the functional capacity of anti-tumor immunity. The third aim of
this proposal utilizes mice lacking hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1α) or HIF2α in either their tumor myeloid
stroma or myofibroblasts to map the downstream signals responsible for functional and metabolic programming
of these cells in response to hypoxia. These studies will provide critical insights allowing clinical hypoxia reduction
to improve and with it our capacity for immunotherapy of “cold” cancers."

The goal of this proposal is to establish a novel artificial intelligence-based strategy of genome
wide association studies (GWAS) to identify new genetic loci associated with common human
disorders. Identification of the genetic factors underlying these diseases will provide not only
mechanistic insights into the diseases but also form the basis for developing novel preventative,
diagnostic, and targeted therapeutic methods. While GWAS has achieved great successes in
the past 1.5 decades, only a small portion of common diseases' heritability can be currently
explained by loci identified from traditional GWAS. Leveraging on the public genetics and
clinical imaging data, we propose a novel approach, termed image based GWAS (iGWAS),
where GWAS will be performed on endophenotypes derived from images using cutting edge
deep learning (DL) algorithms. By creating a more objective and quantitative output from the
images, with less information loss, many new disease-associated genetic loci are expected to
be identified. To test the efficacy of this novel approach, the human visual system will be used
as an example. A DL-phenotyper, Multi-modal multi-view Self-Supervised deep Learning
Encoder for Retinal images (MuSSLER), will be developed to extract quantitative output from
optical coherence tomography scans and fundus images from both normal eyes and patients
with diabetic retinopathy (DR). GWAS will be performed on normal eye endophenotypes to
elucidate genes relevant to retina development and physiology. Also, GWAS will be performed
on DR-specific endophenotypes to identify DR associated genetic loci and candidate genes. If
successful, our approach represents a general framework that can be readily extended to the
study of other retinal diseases and other common diseases with imaging data. Furthermore, the
phenotyping neural network architecture established in this project can be readily adopted to
develop an automated grading tool for heterogeneous clinical data and applied to many other
common diseases."

The Methods in Computational Neuroscience (MCN) course at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods
Hole, MA provides a unique training opportunity to equip students with cutting edge skills and conceptual
foundations of computational methods to understanding the biological function and neural mechanisms of brain
cells, circuits, and behavior. MCN is an intense lecture and computer laboratory course targeted to a talented
mix of students with complementary expertise in biological and mathematical sciences. MCN students interact
one-on-one with internationally renowned scientists and carry out hands-on, project-based training with a wide
variety of computational techniques and approaches. The goals of the MCN course are to train students 1)
in the concepts and methods of computational approaches to understanding brain function 2) in the
mathematical foundations and techniques for the analysis of neural data 3) to use computational tools
to solve fundamental questions in neurobiology, 4) to use computational methods to diagnose and
treat human brain disorders and 5) to foster interdisciplinary collaborations that lead to long term
interactions and mentorship. The course provides in-depth instruction on how to use computational
approaches to solve fundamental problems in neurobiology using experimental techniques applied across a
wide range of biological scales from molecules to behavior. This is accomplished through hands-on training in
the mathematical foundations and techniques for the model-based, statistical and theoretical analysis of neural
data in the context of mechanistic descriptions of neurons, networks, and brain systems. The MCN course
continually updates its computational topics that are relevant to new experimental advances, such anatomical
connectivity at microstructural and brain-wide scales, high density measurements using electrical and optical
recording, and causal perturbations of neural circuits using optogenetics. These new topics include state-space
trajectory analysis, deep networks, compressed sensing, advanced statistical inference, manifold learning,
dimensionality reduction, analysis of large data sets including brain wide imaging and large scale cell-type
specific connectivity. An additional innovation is an increased emphasis on computational approaches to
understanding and addressing brain disorders, including the emerging field of computational psychiatry.
Central to the course is an environment of intense interactions with a group of dedicated faculty, many of
whom devote weeks or even the entire month to work with students. In the last half of the course students
devote concentrated effort to novel cutting edge research projects mentored by a team of faculty and teaching
assistants. The course fosters a collegial, international environment that advances student careers by
providing students with networking opportunities that lead to long-term interactions, mentorship, and
collaborations."
10877131,"Since the National Partnership to Improve Dementia Care debuted in 2012 with the goal to reduce antipsychotic use in individuals with Alzheimer’s disease and/or Alzheimer’s-related dementias (AD/ADRD), CMS has scrutinized almost all associated long-stay psychoactive prescribing. While the long-stay use of these monitored psychoactive drugs has declined, prescriptions of mood-stabilizing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have increased. Similar to antipsychotics, mood stabilizing AEDs are used to treat the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in the AD/ADRD population. Unlike antipsychotics and other psychoactive medications, AEDs prescribed in nursing homes are not mandatorily reported to CMS. Pilot studies suggest AED increases are concentrated entirely in AD/ADRD and other dementia patients with no diagnosis of epilepsy and purposefully prescribed for BPSD as an unmonitored alternative to antipsychotics. AEDs are not approved to treat AD/ADRD or any dementia symptoms, have weak efficacy evidence, and convey serious risk. Increasingly, the Partnership’s debut seems an inflection point where the trend toward unmonitored alternative drugs for AD/ADRD symptoms sharply increased. Furthermore, initial findings hint that the COVID pandemic represents a second critical point of inflection where the existing transition toward non-superior but unreported drugs for AD/ADRD is again rapidly accelerating. All outcomes associated with this evolving pre-scribing phenomenon remain unknown, though early data warns that harms may be increasing without benefit.
We propose a retrospective analysis detailing long-stay prescribing of all psychoactives, including AEDs, for AD/ADRD and other conditions, how such prescribing is changing under the combined pressures of the pandemic and targeted reduction efforts, and the role of such prescribing in adverse health outcomes. We will accomplish this by creating a detailed dataset of quarterly cohorts of nursing home residents, including those with AD/ADRD, for the years 2009-2021 that draws on elements linked at an individual level from CMS’s Minimum Data Set (MDS), Part D, MedPAR, and Public Use files. The final linked dataset will include health, demographic, cognitive, and diagnostic variables, all psychoactive drug claims, nursing home outcomes, records of hospital and ER adverse events, and long-stay facility details, including staffing resources and COVID statistics. Finally, to help explain and validate findings, a national sampling of nursing home prescribers will be surveyed regarding their knowledge and beliefs surrounding changing approaches to the care of AD/ ADRD and associated outcomes. This study will describe current and evolving AED use in nursing homes for all indications, focusing on AD/ADRD and AD/ADRD outcomes. It will describe racial and gender disparities in the long-stay populations treated or not treated with psychoactives. It will delineate the impact of the COVID pandemic in combination with national policies on ADRD management and outcomes. Results of this study will inform policymakers, improve nursing home care and safety, and introduce new avenues for ongoing research."
10877070,"Project Summary/Abstract
We will establish an Emerging Infectious Disease Research Center in Southeast Asia and West/Central
Africa with an inter-continental one health approach designed to improve the capacity to respond rapidly
and effectively to outbreaks. Our proposal is built on an existing network of laboratories/epidemiologists in
close contact with national healthcare systems. We will identify factors influencing emergence and
transmission at the virus, vector and reservoir level, leading to epidemics in suspected spillover conditions.
We will focus on high priority RNA viruses with epidemic potential in Africa (Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV),
Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV)) and in Southeast Asia (dengue virus (DENV)) as well
as viruses (Disease X) identified from symptomatic surveillance or insect sampling. We will tackle problems
in emerging infectious diseases by the following specific aims: 1) Enhance surveillance and detect
unknown RNA viruses with potential for spillover to humans. We will implement an autonomous
solar-powered mobile suitcase laboratory for rapid pathogen identification in the field. Connection to a
cloud computing system will facilitate data analysis and sharing among healthcare centers and laboratories.
We will survey pathogens present in insects in different ecological settings. We will develop new diagnostic
tools for these viruses and conduct prevalence and behavioral studies in human populations to determine
risk factors. 2) Understand transmission dynamics of endemic RNA viruses with high risk of
outbreak. We will focus on RVFV and CCHFV in Senegal and Cameroun, and DENV in Cambodia. We will
perform surveys in animals and humans using a more specific multiplex assay. We aim at obtaining better
knowledge on prevalence, transmission dynamics, and identifying major insect vectors and animal
reservoirs. 3) Understand factors influencing adaptation of RNA viruses to new hosts. We will use
state of the art technology to generate and study key candidate viral mutations using cells from relevant
species including humans. We will study efficacy of these viruses in infection of various strains of insects to
estimate transmission risks. This aim will lead to better understanding of the adaptation of these viruses to
new hosts and will help design more detection methods. Lastly, 4) Study of host adaptive immune
responses to emerging infectious diseases in South-East Asia and Africa. We will increase our insight
into the adaptive immune response at a single cell level and the sequence-function relationship of human
antibodies generated during infectious diseases (DENV, RVFV, CCHFV) by combining sequencing at a
single cell level with antibody repertoire analysis. We will study function and characterize structure at a
single antibody level. We will provide novel understanding of the role of cellular immunity in DENV disease.
The proposed activity will allow the implementation of infrastructure and an analysis pipeline for outbreak
preparedness in areas where viruses with potential pandemic threats circulate."

A small population of long-lived CD4 T cells harbors replication competent virus (the latent HIV reservoir) during
effective antiretroviral therapy even when viremia is undetectable; this latent HIV reservoir is invariably
associated with virus rebound when treatment is stopped. The latent HIV reservoir is a major barrier to curing
HIV, but multiple technical challenges limit its investigation. We developed an ultra-high throughput droplet
microfluidic workflow called PCR activated cell sorting (PACS) that detects, sorts and sequences single cells
containing a single copy of intracellular HIV DNA. In preliminary studies we demonstrated the ability of PACS
to 1) process millions of cells at ultra-high throughput, 2) detect HIV infected cells 3) single cell sort and sequence
this rare population of latently infected CD4 T cells. Based on these findings, we believe that PACS provides a
unique opportunity to overcome existing technical challenges and define, for the first time, the genomic
mechanisms that control the HIV latent reservoir. We hypothesize that latently infected cells have unique
properties that allow them to harbor replication competent HIV genomes without producing virus. Thus,
we propose to combine PACS with methods for single cell RNA-seq, genome and integration site analysis,
ATAC-seq and proteomics to define the genomic mechanisms that control the HIV latent reservoir in single
infected cells from people with ART suppression of the virus. Our Specific Aims are as follows:
Specific Aim 1: Define the transcriptome of single cells harboring latent virus. We propose to sequence
the transcriptomes of single HIV positive CD4 T cells isolated from the blood of individuals on ART, while
determining in parallel the HIV provirus sequence and insertion site. These studies will define the transcriptional
program of latently infected cells harboring full-length replication competent virus.
Specific Aim 2: Establish the chromatin landscape of single cells harboring latent virus. We propose to
analyze the chromatin profile of single HIV positive CD4 T cells in order to define the relationship between host
DNA chromatin status and HIV latency. These studies will determine the role of chromatin status in the control
of HIV latency and identify regulators of the transcriptional program of latently infected CD4 T cells.
Specific Aim 3: Identify surface markers of latently infected CD4 T cells. We propose to isolate HIV latently
infected CD4 T cells using PACS and analyze their surface proteome using barcoded antibody sequencing to
identify surface marker combinations that best define the HIV latent reservoir. Upon completion, these studies
will define novel surface marker combinations to identify latently infected CD4 T cells.
IN SUMMARY, these studies use a multi-omics approach based on our combined expertise in the genomic
regulation of immune cells, HIV biology, and microfluidics to define the mechanisms that control HIV latency.
Hence, these studies will guide the development of novel therapeutic interventions, while providing novel tools
for the monitoring of the latent HIV reservoir in infected individuals undergoing ART."

The induction of plasma cells that secrete antibodies against donor tissue alloantigens is
a major barrier to successful transplantation. Moreover, because many plasma cells are
exceptionally long-lived, the resulting antibody titers are exceptionally durable. Hence
strategies are needed to eliminate long-lived plasma cells that generate allospecific
antibodies. A current dominant strategy for depleting plasma cells centers on
compounds that interfere with the proteasome. Plasma cells are thought to uniquely
require proteasome function to survive. However, for reasons unclear, substantial
numbers of allospecific plasma cells resist the action of available proteasome inhibitors
(PIs). This issue is compounded by the possibility that newly formed plasma cells,
induced by persisting antigens, also contribute substantial amounts of deleterious
antibodies. The chief objective of this project is to establish the impact of PIs on newly
formed versus long-lived plasma cells, and define how biochemical responses to
hypoxia affect mitochondrial apoptosis regulate responses of plasma cells to
proteasome blockade. This work will leverage our unique capacity to resolve and
characterize newly formed versus long-lived plasma cells. Specifically, we will: 1)
Contrast the impact of PIs on newly formed versus long-lived PCs. 2) Test whether
hypoxic niches and HIF1-alpha enhance PC resistance to PIs, and 3) Identify PI-induced
mitochondrial death and resistance mechanisms in long-lived PCs. These studies will
provide unique and needed insights into the mechanisms whereby proteasome inhibition
affects allospecific plasma cell survival and function."
10877180,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The therapeutic approach of CLL has evolved significantly over the past decade from chemoimmunotherapy to
targeted therapies including Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKi, ibrutinib and acalabrutinib and venetoclax
(that targets BCL2). Whereas a large subset of CLL patients will have a favorable outcome with targeted
therapies, select high-risk patients develop disease progression that can often manifest as Richter’s
transformation (RT), a rapidly growing aggressive lymphoma with morphologic similarity to diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma. As the use of targeted therapies continues to grow, emergence of resistance and progression to RT
are of increasing clinical concern. Identifying pre-treatment biomarkers associated with this transformation and
strategies to prevent and also treat RT in the era of targeted therapies is therefore of utmost importance. In the
era of chemoimmunotherapy, early mutations including NOTCH1, XPO1, TP53, and 2p amplification at time of
CLL diagnosis were found to be associated with RT development. Other studies examining RT tumors have
identified c-MYC expression/amplification or newly acquired TP53 mutations as additional common lesions.
However, since the advent of targeted therapy, there have been no reports examining founder mutations or other
features predisposing to RT. As chemoimmunotherapy and targeted therapy have different escape pathways, it
is likely that these pre-treatment risk factors will differ. Using a large series of pre-treatment samples for CLL
patients enrolled across four ibrutinib clinical trials at The Ohio State University, for which follow up data were
available, we have described the presence of near-tetraploidy and complex karyotype prior to the start of ibrutinib
treatment to be independent risk factors for discontinuing ibrutinib due to RT supporting our hypothesis of the
existence of novel biomarkers of transformation that are yet unidentified. We herein propose to: 1) examine the
CLL genomic and epigenetic features of patients who develop RT, validate the importance of select gene
alterations on development of Richter’s using mouse models of human CLL, and systematically assay
phenotypes involved in CLL to RT using in vivo CRISPR screen methods; 2) perform a three institution phase
1b/2 study of ibrutinib and PLX51107 (target BRD4) in patients with previously treated CLL with high risk of
developing RT or RT. At completion of this project we will have a much better understanding of risk factors for
RT following targeted therapy, have applied novel mouse models to better inform future trials to prevent/treat
this CLL complication. Additionally, we will have completed the very first trial with BRD4 inhibitor PLX51107
combined with ibrutinib in CLL patients at high risk for RT and also in RT. Additionally, we will be poised to
launch future trials focused on both preventing and treating RT in patients with CLL."
10876125,"Project Summary: The sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI) pathology comprises primary injury
where impacting force(es) induce physical damage, including the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
Thus the primary injury launches secondary injury comprising chronic inflammation that includes
migration of leukocytes, gliosis, and the release of numerous inflammatory mediators. Thus, secondary injury
exacerbates the damage incurred during the primary injury and is considered more devastating. Though
various drugs are tested to curtail secondary injury, these trials have failed, and the prospect of identifying a
TBI drug looks bleak. Hence, the treatment options for TBI survivors are restricted to palliative care. Recently,
there have been several publications emphasizing the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of various
diets. Additionally, since cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are one of the most important comorbid changes in
TBI survivors, studies emphasizing the role of CVD in TBI pathology are non-existent. Our proposed research
aims to compare the beneficial effects of a low-fat, high-fiber diet (LFHFD) in reducing TBI-associated BBB
breakdown, neuroinflammation, and immune response over the standard western diet (WD) that is high-fat
and cholesterol, and low in fiber in a mouse model with chronic CVD and TBI. We are employing American
Heart Association (AHA) recommended mouse model (LDL receptor-deficient mouse model (LDLr-KO)) for
this study. We hypothesize that the uptake of WD further exacerbates the combined effects of CVD and TBI
and will cause chronic BBB dysfunction, predisposing individuals to chronic inflammatory changes. To test
this hypothesis, we will maintain LDLr-KO mice either on WD or LFHFD from the second month to the sixth
month. In the first week of the seventh month, half of the LDLr-KO mice maintained on a WD or LFHFD diet
will undergo TBI (Controlled Cortical Impact, CCI) or Sham injury (Craniotomy without CCI). All animals on
their respective diets will be maintained for three to six months. Animals will be euthanized at the end of the
9th and 12th month, and brain samples will be extracted and processed for routine paraffin-embedded tissue
processing and bright field immunohistochemistry for investing BBB function (aim 1). We will also study the
impact of diets on the expression of various neuroinflammatory markers and overall immune responses (aim
2). A second set of animals will be prepared, and their brain samples will be used for protein and gene
expression studies of various neuroinflammation markers by employing Western blot and real-time
polymerase chain reaction. We will also collect pre-injury and post-injury blood samples from these mice and
run a Luminex assay to monitor serum levels of various immune mediators in blood samples. We expect WD to
exacerbate BBB dysfunction and inflammatory sequelae compared to LFHFD. Upon completing this study, we
will have preliminary data emphasizing the beneficial effects of LFHFD over WD in reducing BBB permeability,
neuroinflammation, and immune responses in long-term TBI survivors."
10876050,"Large gaps in knowledge about the causative mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders are significant
hurdles for prevention and possibly treatment. Thus, there is an unmet need to identify genetic and
environmental factors that place young individuals at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Importantly, it is
recognized that the genes that control nutrient metabolism can impact neurodevelopment through interactions
with both genetics and environment. The long-term goal of this laboratory is to identify nutrient metabolism
genes necessary for brain development and propose nutritional intervention strategies to prevent or ameliorate
cognitive deficits. Previous research from this laboratory has shown that ZIP12 is a zinc transporter that is
necessary for mouse neuronal development in vitro and Xenopus tropicalis frog embryogenesis and neural
tube closure in vivo. However, it is unknown whether ZIP12 promotes brain function and neuronal
development in mammals in vivo. The overall objective for this proposal is to establish that ZIP12 is a nutrient
metabolism protein that is necessary for mouse neuronal development and cognitive function in vivo, thereby
making it clear that ZIP12 (and the encoding gene, SLC39A12) is a candidate for inherited
neurodevelopmental disorders. ZIP12 knockout (KO) mice lacking a functional ZIP12 protein will be used to
achieve this objective. The central hypothesis is that ZIP12 KO mice have impaired brain zinc uptake, which
manifests early in life as a reduction in neuronal development and leads to reduced cognitive performance
lasting through early adulthood (and likely throughout life). This proposal will test this hypothesis through
studies designed to ask 3 specific questions. First, how does the loss of ZIP12 in mice affect brain zinc
metabolism (and other minerals)? Second, how does the loss of ZIP12 affect learning and memory? Third,
how does the loss of ZIP12 affect neurobiological development during the postnatal and early adulthood
periods? Completion of these studies will establish in a mammalian model that ZIP12 is a zinc uptake
mechanism necessary for proper brain zinc distribution to ensure optimal brain and cognitive function. This is
significant because genes that are necessary for brain function are candidate genes for inherited
neurodevelopmental disorders. The knowledge gained from these studies can lead to nutritional strategies for
promoting optimal brain development and function. Furthermore, these studies will reveal mechanisms of
genetic susceptibilities to neurodevelopmental disorders that are sensitive to nutritional deficiencies and may
be prevented through nutritional or pharmacological interventions."

 Antimicrobial resistance is rapidly on the rise due to the excessive use and over-prescription of antibiotics in
agriculture and medicine. Consequently, we are approaching a critical junction where bacterial infections may
no longer be treatable with conventional antibiotics. To tackle this challenge, it is crucial to gain a comprehensive
understanding of the mechanism of action of conventional antibiotics. This understanding will serve as a valuable
foundation for identifying strategies to rationally design novel antibiotics that emulate their mechanisms of action.
This research project focuses on the bacterial ribosome, the essential cellular machinery responsible for protein
synthesis, as an antibiotic target. Specifically, this research will investigate the process of ribosome formation,
which involves the assembly of large and small ribosomal subunits into a fully functional ribosome complex
through a process called subunit joining. This process is targeted by various antibiotics, including orthosomycins,
pactamycin, and tetracyclines. Currently, the biophysical parameters governing the molecular mechanism of
subunit joining and how antibiotics modulate these parameters to impede subunit joining remain largely
unknown. This research will characterize the kinetic, thermodynamic, and structural dynamics underlying the
molecular mechanism of subunit joining and elucidate how antibiotics impact these parameters. The project
comprises three specific aims, designed to actively engage undergraduate students and provide them with
opportunities to contribute to scientific presentations and publications. In Aim 1 the thermodynamic parameters
that govern subunit joining will be measured by conducting pre-steady state stopped-flow kinetic experiments at
various temperatures. These experiments will provide valuable quantification of the transition states and
activation energies required for subunit joining. By introducing antibiotics during these experiments, how they
increase activation barriers, transforming subunit joining into a translation bottleneck can be assessed. In Aim 2
molecular simulations will be implemented to investigate the structural dynamics of the intersubunit interface and
characterize non-covalent interactions that stabilize the fully formed ribosome. This approach will provide critical
insights into the interactions that are crucial to subunit joining. Implementing this as a characterization pipeline
we can include antibiotics in molecular simulations to assess how they destabilize intersubunit bridges at an
atomic level. Lastly, in Aim 3 cryo-electron microscopy will be performed to determine the structures of
meclocycline and methacycline bound to ribosomes, complexes for which no structural data is available. The
obtained structures can subsequently be incorporated into the characterization pipeline described in Aims 1 and
2, enhancing our understandings of how antibiotics impede subunit joining. Overall, this research project aims
to provide significant insights into the molecular mechanism of ribosomal subunit joining. By comprehending how
antibiotics alter the biophysical parameters of subunit joining, we can inform the development of novel antibiotics
that can be rationally designed to specifically target subunit joining to inhibit translation."

Biomaterials with luminescence in the visible wavelengths are the indispensable tool of biological research today.
A new class of luminescent protein material, protein-gold (Au) compounds, has attracted much attention with the
versatile applications including imaging, nanomedicine, and sensing. Proteins with vastly different sizes and
functions have been discovered to yield the nearly identical luminescence. Detailed examinations across all
these proteins, comparing the origin and the mechanism of the luminescence, should be desired to fully develop
this emerging technological opportunity. A widely-spread interpretation of the luminophore in the protein-Au
compound is the formation of a Au nanocluster, whose size determines the property of luminescence. This model
assumes proteins to have “static cage” of the same size. However, proteins are not static objects. Proteins
possess inherent dynamic characters, can unfold/fold reversibly, and undergo changes among multiple
conformations, associated with protein functions. The mechanism of the luminophore formation in the protein-
Au compounds may incorporate the dynamic characters of proteins and the conformation changes. Therefore,
an alternative to the prevailing Au nanocluster is needed for the luminophore. We consider a new concept: The
luminophore results from binding of a Au cation to a common motif of amino acid residues in a protein, forming
a coordination complex. We will elucidate this common motif by combining the spectroscopy experiments and
bioinformatics analysis. The resulting knowledge is critical in identifying new luminescent protein-metal
complexes as well as in designing new luminescent peptides with broad utility in imaging, nanomedicine, and
sensing."

Dystroglycan is a transmembrane protein that relies on its extensive glycosylation to interact with a number of
extracellular proteins. Dystroglycan hypoglycosylation causes a form of congenital muscular dystrophy
(dystroglycanopathy) that is frequently accompanied by a wide range of neurological symptoms. On the severe
end of the spectrum, patients exhibit hydrocephalus, type II lissencephaly, retinal/cerebellar hypoplasia, and
white matter abnormalities. Patients with milder forms of dystroglycanopathy frequently have seizures and
cognitive defects even in the absence of obvious brain abnormalities. Mouse models of dystroglycanopathy
have provided invaluable mechanistic insight into Dystroglycan’s many functions in the nervous system, as
they faithfully recapitulate many of the neurodevelopmental defects seen in human patients. Recently, we and
others have shown that Dystroglycan functions cell-autonomously at subsets of inhibitory synapses in the
brain, providing a possible explanation into the etiology of neurological dysfunction in dystroglycanopathy. In
this proposal, we examine how Dystroglycan regulates inhibitory synapse development and function. The
proposed experiments will: 1) Use genetic approaches to dissect the cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which Dystroglycan regulates the establishment and maintenance of inhibitory synapses; 2) Determine
whether synaptic defects can be rescued, and whether a specific therapeutic window exists; 3) Define the
molecular and functional basis of a newly identified interaction between Dystroglycan and the Cntnap proteins
at inhibitory synapses in the brain. These experiments will provide insight into Dystroglycan function in the
nervous system and lay the foundation for therapeutic interventions to correct neurological defects in
dystroglycanopathy."

Elevated levels of plasma ceramide are an independent risk factor for major adverse cardiac events (MACE)
and are associated with cardiovascular diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Endothelial microvascular dysfunction, the loss of nitric oxide (NO)-
mediated dilation to flow (flow-induced dilation; FID), precedes the development of CAD and occurs following
chronic exposure to exogenous ceramide. During disease, following acute stress (e.g. high pressure), or after
chronic ceramide treatment, FID is maintained by utilizing mitochondrial-derived hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
Although effective at eliciting dilation, unlike the anti-inflammatory effects of NO, H2O2 promotes an inflammatory
environment within the vasculature and surrounding parenchymal tissue. The mechanism(s) by which ceramide
promotes mitochondrial H2O2-mediated FID remains unknown. Interestingly, ceramide has also been implicated
as a critical signaling component in the generation of NO. The ceramide metabolite sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P) exerts opposing effects on the endothelium, promotes the formation of NO, and may explain the positive
vascular effects associated with ceramide. A large knowledge gap exists regarding the dual functionality of
ceramide within the human microvascular endothelium. We hypothesize that while ceramide formation is a
critical mechanistic component in NO-mediated FID, prolonged exposure initiates a signaling cascade that
results in the release of mitochondrial H2O2 in response to shear. Our aims are as follows; 1) determine the
necessary role of ceramide in maintaining NO-mediated FID within the human microcirculation, and 2)
investigate the mechanism(s) by which ceramide formation during stress or disease initiates the transition in FID
mediator from NO to mitochondrial-derived H2O2. Using a novel approach, these mechanistic studies will be
complemented by the first human in vivo study to examine the effect of elevated plasma ceramide on peripheral
microvascular function. The translational studies proposed in this application will enhance our understanding of
ceramide signaling during health, disease, and following acute stress. This information will provide new targets
for therapeutic intervention in individuals at risk for developing cardiovascular disease including CAD and
HFpEF."
10880251,"Cancer develops and spreads because of the nature of the tumor and the microenvironment or `soil' in which
the tumor is embedded. Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer that results from mutations that accumulate in a
plasma cell. Multiple myeloma cells grow in the rich soil of the bone marrow, first very slowly, causing no
damage or symptoms, and then more quickly and aggressively, causing degradation of the bone and
development of drug resistant clones. The risk of developing myeloma is greater in older individuals and
people with high body mass index. These patients also typically have more bone marrow adipose tissue, or fat,
than younger or leaner individuals. However, the ways in which bone marrow adipocytes (fat cells) modulate
disease progression are not well understood. Thus, we aim to identify new therapeutic avenues to halt multiple
myeloma progression by targeting the interactions between myeloma cells and bone marrow adipocytes to
lead to better therapeutics for patients. Due to the potentially inflammatory nature of bone marrow adipose
tissue, and its ability to act as a source of fatty acids and adipokines, we wanted to explore how bone marrow
adipose tissue affects myeloma tumor cells. Our cell culture studies suggest bone marrow adipocytes induce
drug resistance in myeloma cells through proteins called fatty acid-binding proteins 4 and 5 (FABP4 and
FABP5). In Specific Aim 1 of this proposal, we will analyze how bone marrow adipocytes contribute to
myeloma by using novel, three-dimensional (3D), tissue engineered cancer models. Compared to two-
dimensional (2D) cultures, 3D cultures much more realistically recapitulate what happens in the human body.
The tissue engineered models are made from silk scaffolds, bone marrow adipocytes, and cancer cells. By
growing myeloma cells in these 3D mini-bone environments, we can determine how myeloma cells change in
response to adipocytes and discover new ways to target this interaction. In Specific Aim 2 of our proposal, we
will use mouse models to study bone marrow adipocyte and myeloma crosstalk. Our mouse models
recapitulate very closely how tumors grow in patients. We will test how increasing or removing bone marrow
adipocytes in mice affects tumor growth and drug resistance, and we will test specifically the role of FABP4
and FABP5 in this process. We will use these in vitro and in vivo models, which we have already developed
and optimized in our lab, to better understand how cancer hijacks the bone marrow niche for its own purposes.
Our long-term goal is to understand molecules and mechanisms driving multiple myeloma growth in the bone
marrow. This proposal feeds into that by interrogating a novel part of the cellular “soil” (the bone marrow
adipocyte), in which tumor cells, or “seeds” land and grow. In sum, our research will identify feedback loops
between host and cancer cells, indicate mediators of this interaction, and propose paradigm-shifting concepts
to guide the development of new anti-myeloma therapies."
10880253,"Our long-term goal is to uncover molecular mechanisms that contribute to the increased incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the US. In order to understand potential molecular mechanisms that may
drive HCC development and progression, we performed whole genome RNA sequencing using total RNA
samples from paired adjacent non-tumor liver and HCC tumor tissues of local HCC patients. Analysis of the
differentially expressed genes between the paired tissues revealed significant alterations of Biological
Processes and Molecular Pathways associated with oxidation reduction, which involves a gene coding for Six
Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of Prostate 2 (STEAP2) protein. We found that STEAP2 was also
significantly upregulated in the tumors in comparison to adjacent non-tumor liver tissues of the patients in The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset as well as in two recently published RNA-seq datasets. STEAP2
belongs to a family of proteins involved in the reduction and transport of iron and copper ions across
membranes of a cell and various cellular organelles. The reduced forms of iron and copper ions are not only
essential elements needed for uncontrolled tumor cell growth, but also known to mediate the production of
hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide, which cause DNA and protein damage and lipid peroxidation.
Consistent with these functions of STEAP2, we found total levels of copper were significantly higher in the
HCC tissues than in the adjacent non-tumor tissues. Knockdown of STEAP2 expression in human HCC cell
lines significantly inhibited their viability, motility, clonogenicity in soft agar, and xenograft growth in vivo along
with decreased stress-activated MAP kinase activity and intracellular iron and copper levels, whereas STEAP2
overexpression showed opposite effects. Furthermore, a high iron diet significantly increased HCC incidence in
a mouse model. Although hepatic copper or iron overload associated with Wilson's disease and
hemochromatosis respectively is a known risk factor for HCC, whether dysregulation of copper and iron
homeostasis due to STEAP2 overexpression may contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis has not been explored.
On the basis of our novel preliminary findings, we hypothesize that STEAP2 upregulation can drive HCC
development and progression via increased supply of ferrous and cuprous ions, oxidative stress, and lipid
peroxidation resulting in the activation of stress-activated pathways. In specific aim 1, we will use newly
established patient-derived HCC organoid cultures and a spontaneous mouse model of HCC to determine
whether altered expression of STEAP2 will affect their malignant properties in vitro and in vivo. In specific aim
2, we will first determine whether STEAP2 possesses metalloreductase catalytic activity and whether its N-
terminal domain has a well-defined NADPH binding site and its C-terminal domain binds heme in HCC cells.
We will then engineer site-directed mutations of STEAP2 to determine whether its catalytic activity is
necessary for its tumor-promoting activity including cell growth and migration, and tumorigenic property in HCC
cells. In specific aim 3, we will determine whether altered expression of STEAP2 results in increased labile iron
and copper, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and protein adduct formation in HCC cells. We will investigate
whether STEAP2-stimulated oncogenic pathways is dependent on iron and copper accumulation. We will also
determine whether stress-activated MAP kinases mediate the HCC-promoting activities of STEAP2. We are
the first to show the upregulation and tumor-promoting functions of STEAP2 in HCC. Given its role in
promoting cancer cell growth and intracellular iron/copper accumulation leading to oxidative stress and
activation of oncogenic pathways, our proposed research promises to uncover a novel molecular mechanism
contributing to hepatocarcinogenesis and to reveal actionable targets for the development of novel preventive
and therapeutic strategies."

Therapeutic advances in vascular calcification may have far-reaching public benefits. Vascular calcification is a
frequent complication of diabetes mellitus and associated with the increase of morbidity and mortality. Although
the precise mechanism has not been determined, vascular calcification is known to be an active process
involving ectopic bone formation, in which osteogenic differentiation occurs in the cells transdifferentiated from
other lineages. Previous studies have shown that vascular endothelial cells (ECs) switch cell fate to differentiate
into osteoblastic-like cells to contribute to vascular calcification. However, it is unknown if shifting the
transcriptional landscape of EC-derived osteoblast-like cells back to endothelial differentiation ameliorates
vascular calcification. In present proposal, we take advantage of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and
connectivity Map (CMap) to identify a novel approach, aiming to shift the transcriptional landscape of EC-derived
osteoblast-like cells to endothelial differentiation and investigate its effect on vascular calcification in diabetes
mellitus. In preliminary study, we use lineage tracing, scRNA-seq and CMap query to identify cyclin-dependent
kinase 1 (CDK1) inhibition to redirect EC-derived osteoblast-like cells to endothelial differentiation and
significantly improve vascular calcification. We find a specific induction of CDK1 in EC-derived osteoblast-like
cells. We show that CDK1 deletion or its inhibitor AT7519 increases E-twenty-six specific sequence variant 2
(ETV2), which is responsible for shifting the transcriptional landscape of EC-derived osteoblast-like cells to
endothelial differentiation. Furthermore, CDK1 deletion in ECs or AT7519 reduces EC-derived osteogenesis and
decreases aortic calcification in diabetic Ins2Akita/+ mice without affecting other tissues. Therefore, we hypothesize
that CDK1 inhibition induces ETV2 to redirect EC-derived osteoblast-like cells back to endothelial differentiation
in turn to ameliorate vascular calcification in diabetes mellitus. In specific Aim 1, we will elucidate the mechanism
underlying CDK1 inhibition that shifts EC-derived osteoblast-like cells toward endothelial differentiation. In
specific Aim 2, we will determine if CDK1 inhibition ameliorates vascular calcification in a diabetic mouse model.
If successful, it will build the redirection of ill-fated cells back to normalization as a new concept, and the CDK1
inhibition may emerge as a new therapeutic approach to treat calcification in acquired vascular diseases."

tobacco smokers (dual users). Electronic cigarette aerosols contain substantially fewer chemicals than tobacco
smoke. Thus, they are perceived as a safer alternative to tobacco smoking. However, electronic cigarette
aerosols contain known carcinogens and reactive oxygen species, as well as unique constituents that might
have unforeseen health consequences. We and others have reported that, in vitro and in animal models,
electronic cigarette aerosols induce DNA damage and can alter gene expression reducing cellular antioxidant
capacity and DNA repair. These data raise the concern that electronic cigarette use, in addition to causing
DNA damage, reduces DNA repair capacity potentially increasing cancer risk associated with other genotoxics.
There is a clear and urgent need to assess the genotoxic effects of electronic cigarette aerosols in the context
of exclusive and dual electronic cigarette users, to protect users and bystanders, and to guide evidence-based
public health policies and regulations. There have been no genotoxic studies in electronic cigarette users.
Here, we propose to assess the genotoxic and non-genotoxic effects of electronic cigarette use in exclusive
and dual users. Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that: (a) vaping causes an increase in
genotoxicity, which is smaller than combustible tobacco but is amplified in dual users; (b) vaping and smoking
alter the oral transcriptome towards distinct oncogenic phenotypes; and (c) specific aerosol constituents
determine the unique genotoxic and non-genotoxic properties of electronic cigarette mixtures. To test our
hypotheses and attain our overall aims, we will pursue the following three specific aims: (1) assess the
genotoxic and mutagenic effects of electronic cigarettes in exclusive and dual electronic cigarette and
combustible tobacco users; (2) characterize the impact of electronic cigarette use on oral mucosa
transcriptome; and (3) dissect the effect of EC aerosol constituents on cellular genotoxicity and DNA repair
capacity. DNA damage, mutagenicity, and transcriptomes will be characterized in exclusive and dual electronic
and combustible cigarette users. Genotoxicity will be evaluated through the targeted analysis of specific DNA
adducts, but also through the use of a novel assay developed in our lab (q-PADDA) which detects with high
sensitivity a broad spectrum of DNA damage lesions. The electronic cigarette aerosols particle size distribution
and chemical profile will also be characterized. Functional studies will probe drivers and pathways altered by
electronic cigarette use. The effects of complex EC aerosol mixtures and individual constituents on
mutagenicity will be evaluated, and the mechanisms contributing to overall genotoxicity investigated. Our team
is uniquely suited to use a multidisciplinary approach to dissect the oncogenic potential of electronic cigarette
use. Our study will deliver critical knowledge urgently needed by clinicians to better guide their patients and by
regulatory agencies to effectively regulate electronic cigarettes in a way that best serves public health."
10880270,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Malignant transformation (MT) of IDH-mutant low grade glioma (LGG) to aggressive high grade tumors is an
event of major clinical significance, eventually leading to death in the majority of LGG patients. We discovered
that mutations in IDH promote an immunosuppressed microenvironment characterized by decreased
production of STAT1-regulated chemokines and low CD8+ T cell infiltration in LGG. In malignantly transformed
tumors, we identified the unexpected deletion of the IDH1 mutant allele that may drive counteracting changes
to the immunosuppressed microenvironment specifically during MT. LGG that undergo treatment-induced
hypermutation (HM), another route to MT, produce more high quality neoantigens. Overall in malignantly
transformed tumors relative to patient-matched LGG, we found increasing numbers of T cell clones and
increasing expression of genes involved in cytotoxic T cell attraction and effector function. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that immunosuppression in IDH mutant LGG is reduced upon MT, driven by genetic
alterations that are acquired primarily during malignant transformation. To address this hypothesis, we will
quantify spatial and temporal changes in mutant IDH1-driven immunosuppression during MT (Aim 1). We have
devised a novel 3-dimensional (3-D), tumor-wide approach in which we will acquire 10 spatially mapped
samples per tumor representing maximal anatomy of the tumor. The full cohort will include 30 malignantly
tranformed and 30 non-malignantly transformed recurrences from patients for which we have banked samples
of the matching initial IDH1-mutant LGG. We will use a high-sensitivity T cell repertoire assay, cytometry by
Time of Flight (CyTOF), RNAseq based deconvolution, and multiplex immunohistochemistry to map the
immunologic landscape in 3-D, and determine the extent to which mutant IDH1-mediated immunosuppression
is reduced during MT. In Aim 2, we will determine how genetic alterations acquired during MT affect mutant
IDH1-mediated immunosuppression. We will perform deep whole exome sequencing on samples collected in
Aim 1 to map the intratumoral genomic landscape in 3-D during MT. We will test for the local influence of MT-
associated genetic alterations, including high quality neoantigens in hypermutated tumors, deletion of the
mutant IDH1 allele, or other genetic events on immunosuppression. Understanding which genetic events
contribute to changes in immunosuppression is critical for selecting targeted therapies that could synergize
with immunotherapies to prevent or delay MT. To begin to develop T cell based therapies, we will capture
neoepitope-specific T cells, prioritizing those that are present tumor-wide, and determine the
neoepitopes/HLAs they target and the amino acid sequences for corresponding T Cell Receptor (TCR) α- and
β-chains. We will then test the cloned TCR for relative target specificity and activity against neoantigen-
positive patient-specific tumor cells. The 3-D immuno-genomic landscapes across wide swaths of the tumor
will be essential to the design of personalized therapies that have activity against the whole tumor."
10880355,"Although preventing infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is paramount for controlling the
tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, transmission in endemic settings is poorly understood. Across communities in high
burden settings, there is variability in TB prevalence in the form of spatial clusters or “environmental hotspots”.
Heterogeneity is also present in the infectiousness of patients with TB, leading to the concept of “individual
superspreaders,” who are responsible for the majority of Mtb transmission events. The overall objective of this
project is to develop novel interventions to interrupt Mtb transmission by discovering the primary drivers at the
individual and community levels through evaluations of hotspots and superspreaders. We previously
developed a novel Mtb cough aerosol sampling system (CASS) and a digital cough signature assessment
platform and discovered immunogenetic factors associated with resistance and susceptibility to Mtb infection
and TB disease. In 2015, the Kenya National TB Program, conducted a nationwide population-based TB
survey, that found a high burden of TB with wide variation between surveyed communities. We now propose
to investigate TB prevalence within 10 previously surveyed Nairobi neighborhoods (with varying TB burdens),
develop novel tools for identifying superspreaders including aerobiology and immunogenetic profiling, and
investigate biomarkers of recent transmission among household contacts (HHCs). We hypothesize that highly
infectious individuals have unique digital cough and immunologic signatures, and that their HHCs have a
higher frequency of persistently positive interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs), specific transcriptional
profiles, and higher rate of progression to TB disease. We hypothesize that neighborhoods with stably high TB
prevalence rates are associated with demographics skewed to young men, high in-migration, decreased
healthcare access, and poorly ventilated community spaces. By using innovative methods, we will gain insights
into temporal trends of TB prevalence in small areas, identify factors associated with high prevalence, and
develop tools to identify individuals responsible for a disproportionate amount of TB transmission. Knowledge
from this study will enable targeting of resources to improve TB control."
10880358,"Project Summary
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies are transforming clinical care of hematological malignancies;
however, they have shown limited clinical success in treating solid tumors. Numerous efforts are underway to
expand the use of CAR T cells for different cancer types, but their effectiveness in treating solid tumors have
been limited by the fact that solid tumors are heterogenous; targeting a single antigen using CAR T cells typically
results in tumor antigen escape, leading to relapse of the disease. Although systemic delivery of
immunomodulators can potentiate anti-tumor responses, it can also lead to debilitating adverse events from on-
target, off-tumor toxicity, cytokine release syndrome, and in some cases, life-threatening autoimmunity. By
contrast, intratumoral administration of immunomodulators has been shown to reduce systemic exposure while
improving efficacy of systemic therapies. Immunity against tumor antigens, resultant of epitope spreading after
tumor cell killing, leads to a diversification of epitope specificity from the initial epitope – priming the endogenous
immune system against larger pool of targets. This proposal seeks to use thermal sensitive CAR T cells, which
traffic and infiltrate deep within tumors, to intratumorally produce bispecific T cell engagers (BTEs) and induce
epitope spread by DC priming of endogenous anti-tumor T cells to develop robust immunity. Focused ultrasound
(FUS) will be used to spatially deposit heat within heterogenous tumors and activate CAR T cells engineered
with a thermal gene switch (TS) which allows for heat-triggered control of transgene expression in murine T cells.
TS constructs are transcriptionally silent at body temperature (37°C) but after exposure to a short duration of
heat (10 min. at 40–42°C), express transgenes to levels greater than 200-fold above basal levels. These studies
will focus on BTEs targeting natural killer group 2, member D ligands (NKG2DL), which are stress-induced
antigens highly expressed on tumor cells as well as on immunosuppressive cells. Preclinical evaluation will be
performed in murine models of breast cancer in fully immunocompetent mice. This approach is expected to
significantly enhance local CAR T cell activity against heterogenous tumors, while potentiating endogenous
antitumor immunity. To assess this, epitope spread by DC mediated priming of the endogenous T cells will be
investigated. Successful completion of the aims of this study is expected to elucidate mechanisms by which local
BTE secretion by CAR T cells can prime endogenous T cell immunity."
10885682,"People with severe mental illness (SMI) are ~3x more likely to contract and ~7x more likely to die from vaccine-
preventable disease. And yet, vaccine uptake is significantly lower among people with SMI, likely due to
greater vaccine delay/refusal despite availability (“hesitancy”). Critical knowledge gaps – including extremely
limited knowledge of whether and how unique features of SMI modulate hesitancy – impede selection of
interventions on vaccination for people with SMI. This K01’s purpose is to determine unique reasons for
hesitancy among people with SMI (Aim 1), reveal causal pathways to hesitancy in people with SMI and
forecast which variables in these pathways are likely the best intervention targets (Aim 2), and examine the
impact of education about herd immunity – which improves vaccine intentions in the general population – on
vaccine intentions and uptake in people with SMI (Aim 3).
In Study 1, we will recruit people with SMI and two comparison groups: people with depression/anxiety and
healthy people. Participants will complete measures of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza vaccine intentions/uptake,
of factors that may be uniquely relevant to hesitancy in people with SMI, and of variables implicated in general
population models of vaccine hesitancy. We will compare groups’ willingness to vaccinate, their level of
concern about vaccines’ dangerousness, and their endorsement of anti-vaccine information (Aim 1). We will
use active-learning causal discovery algorithms and intervention calculus to reveal causal pathways to
hesitancy in people with SMI, quantify the lower-bound total causal effect of variables in these pathways on
hesitancy, and prescribe future experiments to resolve any uncertainties in these causal pathways (Aim 2). In
Study 2, we will use established natural language processing tools to analyze rates of and attitudes to anti-
vaccine misinformation in Tweets from Study 1 participants. This analysis will complement our laboratory
assessments of anti-vaccine misinformation endorsement for Aim 1. In Study 3, we will recruit a subset of
participants from Study 1’s healthy and SMI groups. We will compare the effects of education about herd
immunity across these groups, with the goal of identifying differential efficacy and examining the need to tailor
existing interventions to people with SMI (Aim 3).
Our rigorous characterization of unique aspects of vaccine hesitancy among people with SMI, along with
causal pathways we reveal, our corresponding predictions about the impact of manipulating variables in these
pathways, and our quantification of herd immunity education’s effect on vaccine decisions, will provide critical
road-maps for empirically-informed interventions on hesitancy in people with mental illness. These road-maps
will move us closer to a world where effective, evidence-based interventions on hesitancy are deployed to
protect people with SMI from vaccine-preventable disease."
10887508,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The first combination immunotherapy of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) approved for
melanoma in 2015 has achieved longer progression-free survival compared to nivolumab alone (11.5 vs. 6.9
months), with 53% of patients still alive at 4 years, of whom 71% remain treatment free. Yet, safety is the
biggest barrier to broader implementation of this successful combination, due to much greater occurrence of
serious immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compared to nivolumab alone. In particular, immune-related
colitis (irColitis) is the most common occurrence, with 10-15% of patients developing it upon receiving anti-
CTLA-4 alone or in combinations. Such irColitis is life-threatening and requires immediate treatment with high-
dose steroids or biologics such as anti-TNF, as well as ipilimumab or immunotherapy discontinuation. These
safety concerns have hampered the development of CTLA-4 targeting agents and may have reduced their
efficacy due to lower recommended dosing in combination therapy and limited treatment course. There is
therefore an urgent need to comprehensively study the nature of irColitis and find whether potential risk factors
could be identified and mitigated for greater safety and efficacy of combination treatments.
 We have assembled a unique team of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) scientists and clinicians, tumor
immunologists, microbiome specialists, and medical oncologists specializing in immunotherapy of melanoma to
analyze colorectal tissue lesions, the gut microbiome, and peripheral blood biomarkers that could predict or
contribute to development of irColitis. By comparing what we already learned from studying biospecimens of
IBD patients, i.e., their genetic subsets at the single cell level, gut microbiome, and predictive immune
signatures, we aim to characterize the transcriptomic, immunopathologic, serologic, and gut microbiome
landscape of irColitis and leverage this knowledge for better therapeutic options.
 We will address irColitis by characterizing gut biopsies of melanoma patients during treatment using single-
cell RNA sequencing and multiplex immunohistochemistry mapping, and we will relate immune subsets and
markers discovered to those found in IBD lesions. We will also measure peripheral blood serologic markers
(anti-microbial and anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies by ELISA, soluble cytokine and protein analytes with Olink
proximity extension assay) that we recently found to be risk factors detectable prior to development of IBD, and
analyze them for their capacity to predict irColitis. From stool collected before and throughout treatment, we
will analyze by 16S and metagenomic sequencing the gut microbiome of melanoma patients with or without
irColitis to compare it to known colitogenic structure in IBD, and functionally assess bacterial communities in
gnotobiotic models. Finally, we will integrate our findings to establish a mechanistic model of irColitis compared
to IBD, to propose novel stratifications of cancer immunotherapy patients by risk factors, and to offer future
therapeutic opportunities, such as actionable tissue genomic and protein targets or fecal transplants."

Individuals suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders show excessive fear
and persistent avoidance of activities, places, or people associated with their emotional trauma. Not only does
emotional trauma impair one’s ability to appropriately assess dangerous situations, but may also lead to
deficits in social interactions. The goal of this project is to understand the neural mechanisms of avoidance
under social conditions. To study the effect of social conditions on avoidance circuits, rats undergo platform-
mediated avoidance (PMA), in which rats avoid a tone-signaled shock by stepping onto a nearby platform, in
the presence of another rat. This social partner will have one of three trauma-related experiences: PMA-
conditioned, fear-conditioned, or naïve (no previous conditioning). Single-unit electrophysiological recordings
combined with optogenetic approaches will be used to identify prefrontal regions whose activity correlates with
behaviors during PMA under the different social conditions. We will first characterize behavioral differences in
the acquisition and expression of PMA under social conditions versus alone (Aim 1), then measure single unit
activity in the anterior cingulate (ACC) or prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex during the same conditions of the task
(Aim 2), and finally determine whether ACC activity is necessary for the social partner PMA task using
optogenetics (Aim 3). These findings will further our understanding of the differences between the neural
circuits of active avoidance under social versus solo conditions and their relevance to PTSD and other anxiety
disorders."

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is one of the most devastating diseases of our time; with nearly 6 million diagnosed
it ranks as the third leading cause of death among older adults. In the race for a cure one thing is certain—diet
and exercise reduce risks. However, the mechanisms responsible for the reduced risks are unknown. Several
studies have linked dietary restriction and exercise to improved memory, reduced amyloid beta plaques, and
tau protein tangles in AD. This project will evaluate if intermittent fasting (IF), a popular method of dietary
restriction, administered independently and in combination with exercise, is neuroprotective in a novel model of
AD, the TgF344-AD transgenic rat. The aims of this project are three-fold. 1) To characterize IF protective
effects on behavioral outcomes (memory, coordination, and strength) in the TgF344-AD rat. 2) To determine if
exercise provides additional protection when combined with IF. 3) To assess the effects of IF independent and
in combination with exercise on AD pathology and protective pathways of interest. This project will result in an
unveiling of the effect of IF in the brain and skeletal muscles tissue in the TgF344-AD animal and project could
establish a pathway of protection for future research into pharmacological treatment of this devastating
disease."

 Chromosomal translocations producing oncogenic fusion proteins are common drivers of many types of
cancer, including leukemia. Translocations involving the Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) gene produce NUP98-fusion
proteins and are associated with a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). NUP98-fusion proteins
interact with the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL1) chromatin modifying enzyme, and MLL1 is a molecular dependency
in NUP98-rearranged (NUP98-r) AML. I recently showed that targeting the interaction between MLL1 and its binding
partner Menin is therapeutically effective in NUP98-r AML. Menin-MLL1 inhibition using a small molecule VTP50469
simultaneously represses pro-leukemogenic genes and upregulates markers of myeloid differentiation.
 The overarching goal of this proposal is to define the mechanism by which the NUP98-fusion-Menin-MLL1
chromatin complex maintains a transcriptionally active chromatin state at pro-leukemogenic loci. I will investigate
the hypothesis that NUP98-fusion proteins directly exert transcriptional control of a stem cell-associated gene
expression program via their association with dynamic chromatin regulatory complexes. I have established a
novel NUP98-r murine leukemia model in which NUP98-fusion proteins can be specifically and rapidly degraded by
small molecules such as dTAG-13. I will use this model to define the immediate changes in gene expression and
chromatin state that occur upon NUP98-fusion degradation. Next, I will define the impact of NUP98-fusion protein
degradation on AML cellular hierarchies at single cell resolution in vivo. (Aim 1). I will determine the mechanism
by which pro-leukemogenic genes are epigenetically silenced upon degradation or displacement of NUP98-
fusion proteins. Based on preliminary CRISPR screen results, I hypothesize that silencing of pro-leukemogenic
genes by the non-canonical polycomb repressive complex 1.1 (PRC1.1) is necessary for halting self-renewal of
NUP98-r leukemia. I will define the role of PRC1.1 in NUP98-r leukemia by genetically inactivating each
component of the complex using CRISPR. Next, I will determine how chromatin localization and enzymatic
activity of PRC1.1 change upon degradation of NUP98-fusion proteins and upon Menin-MLL1 inhibition. Finally,
I will determine whether loss of PRC1.1 function mediates resistance to Menin-MLL1 inhibition in vivo (Aim 2).
 As a physician-scientist dedicated to improving outcomes of patients with high-risk genetic subtypes of
AML, my overall goal is to become an independent investigator and leader of my own laboratory studying
oncogenic fusion proteins in leukemia. Since my previous research experience was mostly outside of this field,
I require further training to gain deeper expertise in oncogenic fusion protein biology and epigenetics, as well as
new skills in nascent transcriptomics, computational biology, and single cell methods. With the excellent
mentorship of Dr. Scott Armstrong and my new co-mentor Dr. Brad Bernstein, the dynamic scientific environment
of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the financial support and protected time provided by the K08 award, I will
be poised to develop into the leader of my own laboratory studying oncogenic fusion proteins in AML."

Millions of people in the United States have cardiopulmonary diseases marked by chronic hypoxia, a persistent
reduction in oxygen availability and delivery to cells and tissues. In patients with diseases such as severe chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease or advanced heart failure, chronic hypoxia is associated with increased morbidity
and mortality. Little is known about how cells and tissues sense and adapt to chronic hypoxia. This proposal
outlines a five-year K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award that will address this
question and prepare me to become an independent physician-scientist with a focus on oxygen metabolism, lipid
homeostasis, and cardiovascular disease. My goal in seeking this career development award is to acquire the
robust knowledge and technical expertise I need to uncover the mechanisms of oxygen sensing and adaptation
in mammals, which will open new therapeutic avenues to alleviate the impact of chronic hypoxia.
I hypothesize that sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), which is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine
zipper transcription factor, is an evolutionarily conserved oxygen sensor that mediates organismal adaptation to
chronic hypoxia by monitoring oxygen-dependent changes in lipid saturation as an indirect measure of low
oxygen availability. My preliminary data show that remnants of the yeast SREBP1-dependent oxygen sensing
pathway are present in mammals and that SREBP1 is activated in chronic hypoxia. I hypothesize that SREBP1
promotes the transcription of genes that allow for cellular adaptation to chronic hypoxia by binding to various
promoter regions, including hypoxia response elements and E-box domains (Aim 1). I also hypothesize that the
oxygen sensing mechanism of SREBP1 is mediated through changes in fatty acid desaturation in chronic
hypoxia (Aim 2). Finally, I hypothesize that SREBP-1c is a critical mediator of fatty acid uptake and utilization in
the liver as mechanism to restore lipid homeostasis in chronic hypoxia (Aim 3).
This research training will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Isha Jain, an oxygen metabolism expert
who demonstrated the therapeutic potential of hypoxia for mitochondrial disease, with co-mentorship from Dr.
Robert Mahley, an expert in lipid biology and cardiovascular and neurological diseases with a long track record
of mentorship. I have assembled a team of highly accomplished advisors with expertise in hypoxia signaling in
C. elegans, SREBP biology, lipid metabolism, and functional genomics. My training plan has been carefully
structured to provide me with mentorship and robust research training in advanced techniques in molecular
biology, bioinformatics, systems biology, and animal models of disease. My development plan will help me gain
important skills in laboratory management, leadership, and scientific communication. Completing the research
training program and obtaining the skill sets outlined in this K08 career development award will lay the foundation
for my career as an independent, R01-funded physician-scientist."
10888190,"Project Summary and Abstract
Obtaining selective small molecule inhibitors is a common bottleneck in drug discovery. The challenge of
selectivity is exemplified by kinase inhibitors (KIs), as high active site conservation across the kinome has
hindered the development of highly selective KIs. While there are 50+ FDA approved KIs, the majority inhibit
many kinases, leading to adverse events in patients and limiting their use as tool compounds. Recently, chemists
have implemented ‘selectivity filters’ that engage non-conserved features of a target to obtain selectivity,
however, the generality of these approaches is limited, as they rely on rare occurrences. Over the past 5 years
our group has been evaluating atropisomerism as a potentially general ‘selectivity filter’. Atropisomerism is a
form of chirality that arises from hindered rotation about a bond where the rotational conformers are enantiomers.
Depending on the degree of hindrance to bond rotation, atropisomers can exist as stable or unstable
enantiomers. Many drugs exist as unstable atropisomers yet bind their biological targets in an atropisomer-
specific manner. We have shown that analogs of promiscuous compounds that are ‘locked’ into a single
atropisomeric conformation possess improved target selectivity and have leveraged this to obtain highly selective
inhibitors of several kinases. To understand the origin of this selectivity, we analyzed over 100 kinase/small
molecule co-crystal structures and observed that the bulk of dihedral conformational space about the axis was
sampled by different kinases, and that a major driver of selectivity in our previous work was the preorganization
of the axis into a narrow ‘target-preferred’ conformational range. This led us to hypothesize that target selectivity
can be rapidly programmed into promiscuous scaffolds via preorganization of a prospective atropisomeric axis
into a specific target’s preferred dihedral conformations. We are evaluating this in the context of diverse
pharmaceutically privileged scaffolds, both dependent and independent of stable atropisomerism. A second long-
term goal of our research program is the development of new broadly applicable atroposelective methodologies
that allow for direct access to diverse classes of pharmaceutically relevant atropisomers. Over the past 5 years
our group has developed atroposelective variants of nucleophilic aromatic substitution, electrophilic aromatic
substitution and vicarious nucleophilic substitution, allowing for enantioselective access to diverse atropisomeric
scaffolds including biaryls, heterobiaryls, diarylethers, and diarylamines. Moving forward we plan to continue this
work and extend these reactivities directly to pharmaceutical scaffolds such as those seen in AMG-510 and
Bosutinib. We will also extend our atroposelective toolbox to include new reactivities such as atroposelective
cyclization and radical additions."

 Biofilms are cohesive, multicellular microbial communities that are able to adhere to biotic or abiotic surfaces.
The human microbiome contains numerous biofilm-forming bacterial species that help maintain normal human
physiology. On the other hand, more than half of the 1.7 million hospital-acquired infections in the US are caused
by biofilm-forming bacterial pathogens. The biofilm lifestyle is advantageous, because phenotypic diversity and
coordination of cellular behaviors within biofilms provide bacterial populations with emergent capabilities beyond
those of individual cells. For example, biofilms are orders of magnitude more tolerant towards physical, chemical,
and biological stressors, most notably long-term treatments with antibiotic drugs or clearance attempts by the
immune system. However, it remains largely unknown how such remarkable capabilities emerge from the
behaviors of individual cells and the interactions between them. A critical barrier to rapid progress is the inability
of conventional microscopes to resolve micrometer-sized bacterial cells in thick (>10 micrometers) biofilms in a
non-invasive manner. The proposed research addresses this challenge by developing integrated experimental
and computational technologies that enable non-invasive, 3D fluorescence imaging of pathogenic biofilms by
lattice-light sheet microscopy, accurate single-cell segmentation and 3D shape measurements based on the
acquired images, and simultaneous 3D tracking of thousands of cells inside biofilms. The ability to make single-
cell measurements in dense microbial populations will enable researchers to correlate the spatial trajectory of
each cell with that cells’ gene expression and behavioral phenotype. Such information will provide an integrated
understanding of how bacteria coordinate gene expression and social behaviors in 3D space and time. A
fundamental understanding of biofilm biology will help inform new strategies for harnessing the emergent
functional capabilities of microbial populations and for removing pathogenic biofilms from undesired
environments."

By completing this project, WVDA READ plans to maintain and improve an effective and
consistent animal feed regulatory program.
The maintenance and improvement of the feed safety program will be achieved by
focusing on maintaining full implementation of the Animal Feed Regulatory Program
Standards (AFRPS). AFRPS implementation will be sustained by continuing program
audits and assessments as required in each standard, training staff, conducting
community outreach, maintaining an improvement plan, and making program changes
based on that plan. Other specific aims of this project include:
 • Developing and sustaining innovative approaches to AFRPS implementation that
 can be replicated by other regulatory agencies by using common software and
 simple, streamlined standard operating procedures that can be easily shared;
 • Supporting activities that promote the continuous improvement of AFRPS by
 attending face-to-face meetings and contributing information to committees;
 • Continuing to build relationships and communication with state and federal
 regulatory agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by
 maintaining a feed safety inspection contract, participating in meetings and audits,
 and sharing information.

10889202,"This work is based on the hypothesis that to fully exploit the benefit of cell line-based drug
screening, a representative cell line panel recapitulating the varied types of prostate cancer (PCa)
and the contribution of differences in ancestry is necessary. PCa is the leading cause of cancer
mortality in men worldwide. Current advances in patient diagnoses and therapy have led to a
decline in PCa incidence and mortality rates. However, this is not the case for men of African
ancestry (MAA) from Africa and the Caribbean where both PCa incidence and mortality rates are
on the rise. PCa cell lines are used to understand the biology of PCa and to advance the
development of PCa theranostics. However, more than 97% of the PCa cell lines that are readily
available to researchers are from men of European ancestry (MEA). There continues to be limited
representation of PCa materials from MAA when compared to MEA, and there are almost no cell
models available derived from MAA. This makes it difficult to assess the efficacy of potential
treatments in MAA versus MEA, contributing to a problem in health disparities. To address this
problem, this project will first develop and characterize cell lines that recapitulate the most
prevalent molecular abnormalities associated with PCa in MAA (Aim 1). Second, it will
comparatively screen chemotherapy drugs and Jamaican natural lead molecules on the novel
MAA PCa cell lines to standardly employed PCa cell lines derived from MEA (Aim 2)."

The United States is facing an unprecedented opioid epidemic caused by the misuse and abuse of both
prescription pain relievers and illegal opioids. This issue has devastating consequences for public health,
including a significant increase in overdoses related fatalities, in neonatal withdrawal syndrome and spread of
infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis. Numerous studies indicate that opioid use disorder (OUD) has a
strong genetic component. However, the genes networks implicated in opioid addiction remain poorly
understood. The primary goal of this proposal is to study the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that
underlie the development of distinct stages of oxycodone abuse disorder. We will leverage the power of
quantitative epigenomic methods that will provide a comprehensive map of regulatory elements, transcription
factors and downstream target genes that are dysregulated in specific stages along the OUD trajectories. Our
major innovation is the use of capped small (cs)RNA-seq, a method that we developed to quantify newly
initiated transcripts with high sensitivity and high spatial resolution directly from total RNA. This approach
enables the unbiased annotation of Transcriptional Start Sites (TSS) of both activated genes and transcribed
regulatory elements at single nucleotide resolution. Compared with other epigenomic profiling, csRNA-seq is
highly sensitive to changes in transcription, and it can capture the dynamic regulation of both stable genes and
unstable transcripts, such as enhancer RNA. To study regulatory changes in distinct stages of OUD, we will
use a rat model of oxycodone self-administration under extended access conditions. This model recapitulates
several aspects of the human addiction-like behaviors, including tolerance, dependence, and motivation. Thus,
it enhances the translational relevance of our results. This proposal will use two inbred strains that exhibit large
differences in their motivation to seek oxycodone during abstinence while having similar pharmacokinetic for
oxycodone and similar exposure to oxycodone. Using transcriptional initiation profiling, in combination with
other sensitive profiling techniques, we will investigate the transcriptional regulatory networks underlying
different stages of the OUD, including initial exposure, escalation of use, acute and sustained abstinence.
Together, our proposed studies will have a broad impact in the field by defining regulatory networks that
underlie phenotypes associated with vulnerability to distinct stages along the OUD trajectory in rats, and it may
lead to novel therapeutic targets to treat OUD."

Syphilis rates in the U.S. have been increasing steadily since 2001, with more than 130,000 new cases reported
in 2019. Left untreated, syphilis can lead to neurologic, psychiatric, cardiovascular, and other severe medical
consequences, in addition to stillbirth or devastating congenital defects in infants of infected mothers. Syphilis
disproportionately affects minority populations, in particular Black and Hispanic communities. Rates of congenital
syphilis are also rising rapidly, paralleling an increase in rates among young women. Detection of syphilis among
women of childbearing potential will be key to eliminating congenital syphilis. Current screening strategies rely
on identification of symptoms or risk factors in patients attending ambulatory care, but this may result in many
missed diagnoses, as syphilis can remain asymptomatic for years, patients may not perceive themselves as at
risk or report relevant risk factors, and the patients most vulnerable to syphilis may also be the least likely to
attend routine outpatient care. To address this issue, I created and pilot-tested an approach for universal syphilis
screening in the emergency department (ED), where many vulnerable patients preferentially seek medical care.
My long-term goal is to scale up this program and create a robust model that can eventually be scaled-out to
other urban EDs in Chicago and across the country, and to accomplish this I will need additional data and training
in implementation science. In this career development proposal, I will evaluate and improve my screening model
and prepare for expansion to additional sites using implementation science strategies, informed by the
Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) model, a robust determinants framework in
implementation science. The Exploration phase will consist of an assessment of the readiness of key
stakeholders outside our institution to adopt a similar screening model. The Preparation phase will be developed
concurrently to include an evaluation of the contextual factors that have contributed to successes and failures of
the existing screening program, including specifically the costs associated with such programs. The
Implementation and Sustainment phases represent future directions as the model is improved and sustained
over time at our hospital and ultimately implemented at other institutions as part of future R01-level studies. The
knowledge developed as a result of this proposal will fill important gaps in how to implement successful, context-
specific ED screening programs with effective linkage to care plans, which may serve not only to increase syphilis
diagnosis and treatment, but also could be applied to screening for other diseases affecting the most vulnerable
populations. This K23 award will provide advanced training in implementation science, mixed methods research,
and healthcare economics that will build on my background in public health and epidemiology. I will bring my
research and clinical experience together with that of an experienced mentorship team to develop the skills
necessary to become an independent investigator and eventually a leader in ED screening methodology and
implementation science."

Humans are under increasing threat from viruses that spill over from animal reservoirs. Most of
these viral diseases lack targeted treatments. We speculate that this unmet medical need might
be addressable by first understanding the evolutionary principles underlying antiviral immune
responses. A major component of innate immunity in mammals is the interferon response.
Interferon induces hundreds of genes, many of which encode effector proteins that suppress
viral infection. In mammals, these antiviral effectors are rapidly evolving, most likely in
response to the genetic ""arms race"" continually occurring between virus and host. Further,
certain mammalian orders, such as primates, rodents, bats, and carnivores, are particularly rich
in viruses that have the potential to spill over into humans. We hypothesize that the genomes of
these viral zoonotic reservoirs encode unique antiviral effectors that may be harnessed to
combat human viral pathogens. The goals of this project are to identify, characterize, and
validate the efficacy of novel antiviral proteins from diverse non-model mammalian species.
State-of-the-art genetic screening platforms will be used to discover antiviral genes in primary
cell cultures obtained from multiples species in the following mammalian orders: Primate,
Rodentia, Chiroptera, and Carnivora. Validated effectors will be characterized mechanistically
with a suite of virological, biochemical, molecular, and cell biological approaches. The potential
for these effectors to suppress human viruses will be tested in murine models of human viral
disease. Outcomes will include the creation of the first comprehensive Mammalian Antiviral
Protein Atlas, the discovery of new genetically-encoded antiviral mechanisms, and proof-of-
concept that human viral disease can be thwarted by naturally occurring proteins from other
species. The impact of this proposal will be the development of a new area of biomedical
research at the intersection of virology, immunology, and evolutionary biology. Long term
prospects include harnessing the results of these studies to inspire alternative approaches to
antiviral drug development."
10891502,"Anxiety and its disorders are a risk factor for several major diseases of aging including cardiovascular and auto-
immune diseases, Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (ADRD). As anxiety disorders have the highest
lifetime prevalence of any psychiatric illness, anxiety and its phenotypes potentially represent a highly preva-
lent and modifiable risk factor for diseases of aging. However, little is known about the mechanisms underly-
ing the association between anxiety and ADRD risk. Moreover, the term ""anxiety"" is often used as an umbrella
covering multiple different categorical disorders or heterogenous symptom clusters. Overall, there is a severe
paucity of data regarding 1) the pathways through which specific anxiety phenotypes impact brain and body
aging; 2) the neurobiological markers contributing to increased ADRD risk among individuals with specific
anxiety phenotypes. A better understanding of specific neurobiological underpinning is critical to identify tar-
gets for interventions designed to prevent or limit the pernicious effect of anxiety on brain and body. Rumina-
tion, global anxiety, and worry (RAW) are three distinct and highly prevalent anxiety phenotypes, that have a
cummulative effect on chronic stress. We reported that worry and rumination (but not global anxiety) are as-
sociated with accelerated brain aging in late-life. Additional preliminary analyses indicate that worry and rumi-
nation severity are associated with other markers of brain aging such as hippocampal atrophy in subfields most
vulnerable to early AD while global anxiety is associated with regional accumulation of b amyloid in critical re-
gions such as precuneus and posterior cingulate, an association moderated by inflammatory markers. In this
proposal, we will identify the pathways through which the RAW phenotypes contribute to accelerated aging
and increased ADRD risk. We will operationalize RAW severity and examine the overall effect of RAW as well
as the individual effect of each phenotype. We will test the effect of RAW by using measures of 1) hippocampal
atrophy and glutamate excitotoxicity; 2) cerebrovascular burden; 3) plasma amyloid; 4) peripheral markers of
chronic stress [cortisol level, proinflammatory markers, carotid intima-media thickness] and 5) markers of ac-
celerated aging [senescence-associated secretory phenotype proteomic panel, telomere length and free-cell mi-
tochondrial DNA]. While continuing to follow our current cohort (N=150), we will add 150 new participants,
similarly recruited on dimensional measures of rumination, anxiety and worry. We will repeat the assessments
at two-year followup, giving us three time points for the original cohort and two time-points for the new cohort.
This study will render the largest cohort of older adults extensively characterized using clinical, neuropsycho-
logical, multimodal imaging measures as well as comprehensive measures of peripheral markers of stress and
aging. The blend of well-established and novel approaches (including computational methods and state of the
art imaging aquisitions) will allow us to frame and answer the questions imbedded in the above aims, with the
overall goal of identifying the most effective interventional and preventative targets anxious older adults."

Millions of people worldwide have been diagnosed with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS).
The hallmark of MS is progressive demyelination driven by an inappropriate immune response that attacks
cells within the central nervous system. The dominant risk factor for MS, and experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal models, in addition to many other autoimmune diseases (type I diabetes,
rheumatoid arthritis, etc) is specific MHC class II molecules. Since MHC class II presents peptide antigen to
both CD4+ T conventional (Tconv) and regulatory T cells (Tregs), the interaction between the T cell receptor
(TCR) and self peptide:MHC (pMHC) plays a pivotal role in autoimmune disease progression. The vital
purpose of Tregs is to suppress immune responses against self in an antigen specific manner. Tregs recognize
antigen such as myelin via their TCR, yet the fundamental measures and the underlying mechanism of TCR
interaction with pMHC is unknown. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the antigen-specific reactivity of
Tregs and whether this activity could be exploited has significant therapeutic potential. Here, we will dissect the
interaction between TCR and myelin antigen using sensitive technologies to measure biophysical properties of
TCR binding such as affinity and bond lifetimes. Of note, Tregs apply force to the bond between TCR and
pMHC, which is ultimately reflected by changes in how long the proteins interact. While Treg TCRs are said to
have enhanced strength of signal, mechanistically this concept is poorly defined. We discovered that
suppressive Tregs apply more force to the pMHC bond than do Tconv cells. In addition, myelin-specific Tregs
that fail to suppress apply lower levels of force. We therefore hypothesize that during antigen recognition, the
increased magnitude of force determines the Treg suppressive phenotype. We have designed three aims to
test this hypothesis that will: 1) compare antigenic binding parameters of functional versus defective Tregs; 2)
determine Treg functional parameters dependent on the magnitude of force; and 3) engineer TCR sequences
to decouple affinity, bond lifetime, and the level of force in response to self antigen. Thus, our project will
provide novel insight into the mechanisms governing Treg function and dysfunction during demyelinating
autoimmune disease. Our work will be the first to investigate various levels of force as a potent biomarker for
Treg that dictates their suppressive efficacy, potency, and phenotypic stability."

Myc Transcription Factor Inhibitor Design: Integrating Atomic and Mesoscale with Semi-Supervised Gen-
erative Deep Learning Models
Inhibition of master regulators such as Myc have considerable interest due to the reversal of the oncogenic state
evoked by their removal. Adding to the mystique is the technical challenge in targeting a protein which possesses
large regions of disorder. Though widely considered “undruggable”, the library of hits that disrupt Myc function
continuously grows. The chemical features of a hit are difﬁcult to deduce besides high molecular weight, aro-
maticity, rigidity, and hydrophobicity. Understanding the more speciﬁc features of a protein-protein interaction
(PPI) inhibitor is considerably difﬁcult. In order to circumvent answering this question, machine learning methods
have been applied to expand the library of experimentally determined hits in hopes of ﬁnding an improved inhibitor
nearby in chemical space. Recently, the natural application of generative deep learning techniques to this prob-
lem have been reported. This proposal explains a protocol for a semi-supervised expansion of small molecules
which inhibit various reactions in the Myc transactivation pathway. The PPI inhibitors from three publicly available
databases make up the training set (n=9516) while the known Myc inhibitors are the test set (n=100). In order to
surpass the effectiveness of the test set, all known Myc inhibitors are removed from the training set. A number of
latent variables which sufﬁce to recreate the training set are solved. These variables represent the general struc-
tural properties of PPI inhibitors, which may be associated with activities at various binding sites. The efﬁcient
calculation of activities is crucial to obtaining good performance. Therefore, a well-tempered ensemble of target
conﬁgurations is pre-calculated at the all-atom resolution. Additionally, in order to incorporate the population
level behavior of multiple Myc molecules into inhibitor design, mesoscale coarse-grain simulations in various sol-
vents which drive liquid-liquid phase separation are performed. To identify interactions which correlate with phase
response, various points in coarse-grain phase space are converted to all-atom resolution, further reﬁned, and
converted into contact maps. When evaluating a new lead, ensemble-based docking calculations are used, which
calculate an average of averages of a ligand in different poses binding to different conformations randomly drawn
from the ensembles. Reinforcement learning is applied to signiﬁcantly reduce the time spent docking batches of
leads while maintaining conﬁdence in the result. Once new molecules are generated, these new leads are also
optimized using absolute and relative free energy of binding methods. Ultimately, this study will test the limits of
generative models to integrate data across multiple scales and develop inhibitors which evoke potent inhibition of
intrinsically disordered proteins."

Overall, this project aims to develop methods to efficiently determine, at atomic-resolution, three-dimensional
(3D) structures of large, native, symmetry-mismatched, locally dis-ordered or polymorphic biological complexes
through cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM). The past funding cycle of this project (2014-2019) has witnessed a
drastic transformation of the field of structural biology, popularly referred as “the cryoEM revolution”. Today,
single-particle cryoEM has arguably become the default choice for structural biology. The funding from this
project has enabled the PI’s group to contribute to this transformation in multiple fronts: we have developed
novel imaging and processing methods and validated these methods by determining in situ structures of
important—and sometimes fundamental—biological processes in large icosahedral and helical complexes, as
well as atomic models of purified protein-nucleic acid complexes and membrane proteins that have been
resistant to previous x-ray crystallography and NMR efforts. We hypothesize that combining electron counting
(i.e., quantum) capabilities with cryoEM can advance the field by determining atomic models of native cellular
complexes, viral genome packaging and transcription in situ and transiently stable catalytic intermediates.
 In the last funding period we aimed to, and succeeded in, derive atomic models using our cryoEM
method alone for larger complexes, particularly those in icosahedral and helical viruses. Now, this renewal
application aims to develop an integrative proteome cryoEM method for atomic structures of cellular
complexes in their native, unpurified, and functional states. We will also use viruses as tools to address
fundamental questions concerning genome packaging, compaction, supercoiling, replication and transcription.
We will continue developing novel computational methods for sub-particle refinement and nucleic acid
modeling, specifically cryoID, an integrative software package that allows near-atomic resolution cryoEM
structures from many complexes in enriched cellular milieu to be determined, identified, and atomically
modeled (Aim #1); sub-particle reconstructions and refinement for in situ atomic structures in large deformable
or intrinsically structurally heterogeneous complexes such as those in large enveloped viruses and native
cellular complexes (e.g., helical assemblies) (Aim #2); modeling genome structures in both RNA and DNA
viruses, as well as cellular transcriptional/replicative complexes (Aim #3); and validate these new methods for
atomic structure determination by application to red blood cell proteome, translocon bacteriocin nano-machines
and membrane protein complexes, helical filamentous cellular (e.g., actin and axoneme) and viral assemblies
and genome structures inside a number of ssRNA, dsRNA and dsDNA viruses (Aim #4).
 A successful outcome of this renewal project will further advance cryoEM in structural studies of large
complexes and will have great impact on many areas of biomedical research. This achievement will push the
current limits of cryoEM and complement other structural methods, particularlythe X-ray crystallography of

10897541,"Summary: Tick feeding affects skin inflammation and allows the transmission of microbes that cause human
diseases. Although host immunity functions to impair tick feeding, salivary glands secrete immunosuppressive
molecules that compromise skin defenses. Among the characterized tick salivary gland components is
sialostatin L2, a multifunctional, versatile, and immunomodulatory molecule involved in cathepsin inhibition and
suppression of a non-canonical NLRC4 inflammasome scaffold. In this R21 application, we show a novel
function of sialostatin L2 whereby this molecule binds to the mammalian high mobility group 1 (HMGB1)
protein, an alarmin highly expressed in keratinocytes. Keratinocytes are the most predominant cells in the skin
epidermis and express HMGB1. Notably, HMGB1 serves as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)
triggering inflammation via cell-surface pattern recognition receptors. Thus, we postulate that a tick bite leads
to the release of HMGB1 from damaged keratinocytes, and the interaction between HMGB1 and sialostatin L2
blocks downstream immune signaling events, preventing skin inflammation, and enabling tick feeding. Our
central hypothesis is that the sialostatin L2-HMGB1 axis in keratinocytes countermeasures skin immunity. Our
preliminary data show that sialostatin L2 mitigates the HMGB1-triggered proinflammatory response, suggesting
a pivotal role of sialostatin L2 in suppressing mammalian inflammation during ectoparasite feeding. How
HMGB1 signal transduction in keratinocytes is affected by sialostatin L2 remains elusive. Accordingly, Aim#1
of this R21 grant proposal will investigate the immunosuppressive function of sialostatin L2 through inhibition of
HMGB1 signaling in keratinocytes. Aim#2 of this proposal will examine tick feeding in the context of HMGB1
released by keratinocytes. Collectively, we will: (1) uncover a previously unidentified mechanism of epidermal
immunosuppression by a tick salivary molecule; and (2) shed light on the immunological role of alarmins during
ectoparasite feeding."
10898261,"Pathogenic spirochetal bacteria cause serious illnesses—Syphilis, Leptospirosis, Periodontal disease, and
Lyme disease—throughout the world. Despite these debilitating diseases, spirochetes remain poorly studied.
Spirochete-specific research is crucial and urgently needed for the development of new treatment modalities.
Spirochetes are well recognizable due to their distinctive spiral or wave-like morphology and cork-screw type
motility. The organelles essential for the unique morphology and motility of the Lyme disease spirochete
Borrelia burgdorferi are the periplasmic flagella, which are enclosed in the periplasmic space and are distinct in
assembly, structure, and function from external flagella in the model organisms Escherichia coli and
Salmonella enterica. Our goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the assembly and
function of the unique periplasmic flagellar proteins and their specific roles in spirochetal motility. Since motility
is crucial for pathogenic spirochetes to cause diseases in hosts, the objectives of the proposal are to,
demonstrate novel mechanistic insights into how spirochete-specific collar proteins help recruit and stabilize
sixteen stator complexes to generate high torque; discover and characterize novel flagellar proteins to gain a
mechanistic understanding of the unique collar architecture and its impacts on the assembly of periplasmic
flagella and motility of spirochetes; and to elucidate molecular mechanisms of how the collar proteins provide
solid bearing support to the rotary periplasmic flagella, and how they impact the assembly and orientation of
the flagella. These unique aspects of the periplasmic flagella are poorly studied. Three Aims are proposed to
better understand those objectives in Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi. Aim 1 is to elucidate how the
flagellar collar proteins help recruit and stabilize the stator required for spirochetal motility. Aim 2 is to discover
and characterize novel flagellar proteins in spirochetes and their impacts on the motility of spirochetes and Aim
3 is to elucidate molecular mechanisms of periplasmic flagellar orientation in Borrelia burgdorferi. State-of-the-
art technologies including bioinformatics, genetic manipulations, microbiological, biochemical, and high
resolution cryo-electron tomography will be utilized to accomplish the proposed aims. The project is expected
to better understand the mechanisms of flagellar assembly and how they impact the very critical motility
function of the spirochetes. Knowledge obtained from this project can directly be applied to other pathogenic
spirochetes and diverse flagellated bacteria. Structure-based drug design targeting flagellar subunits present
an effective prevention strategy because motility is critical for pathogenic spirochetes to produce disease."
10899582,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Toxoplasma gondii is a pervasive intracellular protozoan parasite that can infect any nucleated cell in virtually all
warm-blooded vertebrates including humans. The fast-growing, acute stage of the parasite causes limited illness
in otherwise healthy hosts, however T. gondii efficiently converts to the slow-growing form called bradyzoites that
reside long-term as intracellular tissue cysts. It is estimated that one third of the global human population is
chronically infected with T. gondii, rendering such individuals at risk for reactivated disease in the brain, heart, eyes,
and other tissues. The cellular processes mediating parasite persistence are largely unknown. The absence of
such knowledge impedes strategic development of measures to preclude reactivated disease. Since chronic stage
bradyzoites grow very slowly, we propose that they shift to relying on cellular homeostatic mechanisms for long
term survival. Autophagy (“self-eating”) is an important pathway in eukaryotic cells to recycle materials and maintain
cellular homeostasis. While it has recently been shown that bradyzoites deficient in an autophagy protein, TgATG9,
show reduced autophagy, have lower viability, and produce markedly fewer cysts in chronically infected mice, the
exact molecular mechanisms or dynamics of this pathway remain elusive. The long-term goal of this proposal is to
understand and characterize the molecular mechanisms of proteins involved in the autophagy pathway in T. gondii.
The objectives of this project are to define the contribution of TgATG9 to parasite autophagy along with identifying
unique features of TgATG9 and the pathway as a whole. The specific aims of my proposal are: 1) to determine the
localization and recruitment dynamics of TgATG9 in T. gondii autophagy, 2) to define the mechanism and role of
TgATG9 in autophagosome biogenesis, and 3) to identify interacting partners of TgATG9 and the membrane
elongation complex in T. gondii. Under the first aim, I will explore the consequences of conditional knockdown of
TgATG9 on autophagosome dynamics and delivery of autophagic cargo to the parasite’s digestive organelle. To
do this, I will tag proteins of interest with a fluorescent marker and use high resolution lattice light-sheet microscopy
to capture the dynamics of the autophagy pathway. Under the second aim, I will explore the mechanism of TgATG9
as a potential lipid scramblase. Due to homology to yeast ATG9, which functions as a scramblase, I will evaluate
the ability of TgATG9 to rescue autophagy function in a knockout strain via yeast complementation assays. Under
the third aim, I will utilize targeted immunoprecipitation to identify the interacting partners of TgATG9 and thereby
better characterize the membrane elongation complex in T. gondii autophagy. This proposal, when completed, will
provide novel and fundamental insights into the autophagy pathway of early branching eukaryotic organisms such
as T. gondii. It will increase our understanding of a pathway involved in parasite homeostasis that could potentially
be selectively targeted during chronic infection. It will also serve as a platform to achieve my training goals in
experimental molecular and cellular biology along with providing me with requisite training for my long-term goals
as a physician-scientist."

 Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which lack of a well-defined folded structure alone, play
important roles in a variety of intracellular activities. This is usually made possible via a disorder-to-order
transition when interacting with other biomolecules. However, there has been growing evidence towards the
indispensable roles of conformational flexibility and dynamics on regulating biological activities. Zheng's lab
focuses on investigating IDP interactions through developing multiscale computational modeling methods.
Dr. Zheng has a track record of developing all-atom, coarse-grained and polymer models for IDPs with
publications directly relevant to the research focuses. The lab has already contributed to modeling methods
for interpreting experimental data of IDPs through collaborating with multiple experimental groups. The
research program will be a good addition to the biophysics community within Arizona State University and
provide research opportunities to students on this timely topic. The long-term goal of the group is to gain a
comprehensive understanding of the driving force of disordered protein assemblies. Two interrelated
research topics are proposed including (1) deciphering the role of flexible regions when an IDP interacts with
its folded partner; and (2) investigating the mechanism of IDP-driven liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS).
The project combines computational methods in multiple resolutions with a variety of experimental techniques
through three collaborations. Such unique combination of computational and experimental methods will
provide an unprecedented level of insights on the molecular mechanism of IDP interactions. The designing of

Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) affects over 350,000 Americans annually and survival rates are very
low. For every 1-minute delay in achieving return of effective heart function after collapse, the chance of
survival drops by 10%. Bystanders can aid in the emergency treatment of OHCA victims by performing chest
compressions and by using automated external defibrillators (AEDs). However, current bystander use of static
AEDs is very low and defibrillation is primarily administered by first responders and emergency medical
services (EMS) whose median arrival time (8 minutes) is too late to save most OHCA patients. Using a drone
to deliver AEDs to OHCA victims within 3 to 5 minutes of the 911 call is an exciting new concept that is based
on current technical capabilities of drones. Early work with simulation models has demonstrated the potential of
a strategically designed drone network to deliver an AED to an OHCA substantially more rapidly than EMS can
achieve. However, these early simulations assumed complete effectiveness of AED use when delivered to an
OHCA scene without considering the bystander variables. It is well-known that bystanders may hesitate to
perform CPR and to apply an AED, and that select demographic and neighborhood factors (age, sex,
race/gender, education) may be predictive of such treatment variability. The time it takes a bystander to extract
an AED and apply it successfully in OHCA may critically impact overall survival gains from timely drone AED
delivery. An accurate understanding of potential treatment effectiveness should account for expected
bystander performance. The overarching aim of this application is to utilize data science and simulation
research to estimate end-user performance and treatment-effectiveness of a drone network accounting for
community, first responder, and EMS performance. Aim 1 will determine the optimal placement of drone
stations to ensure timely AED arrival in high-OHCA risk geographic areas (within 3 to 5 minutes) across North
Carolina. Aim 2 will define and determine the association of community phenotypic clusters on OHCA
treatment patterns in high-incidence NC communities. Aim 3 will use simulated drone AED OHCA scenarios to
define drone-AED-bystander treatment intervals among community phenotypic clusters (e.g., minority, rural,
low education, elderly) in high-OHCA risk NC neighborhoods. Results from Aims 2 and 3 will be used to refine
our optimization model (Aim 1) to estimate treatment effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed work will be
carried out under the direct supervision of Dr. Starks mentorship team: mentor (Dr. Daniel Mark), co-mentor
(Dr. Christopher Granger), and her advisory team (Drs. Billy Williams and Graham Nichol). This K23
application with the support and guidance of her mentorship team and advisory committee will position Dr.
Starks to eventually lead independent NIH funded studies focused on community treatment of OHCA, including
developing/testing interventions to improve AED use in OHCA and pragmatic clinical trials to determine if our
model-based EMS drone AED delivery system measurably improves empirical outcomes in OHCA victims."

The marine pathogen Vibrio vulnificus is a highly lethal Gram-negative bacteria inhabiting coastal waters. It
causes intestinal infections via consumption of raw seafood and wound infections via open wounds. The infection
progresses rapidly to septicemia with high fatality rates. This bacterium exerts the highest economic cost of any

surfaces that are necessary for intoxication. Addressing this question could provide critical information toward
design of antibodies that would function to block MARTX from binding to its targeted cells. This goal is particularly
pertinent to the NIAID given the institute's mission to support research to better understand, treat, and prevent
infectious diseases. Specifically, the first aim will determine host receptors for the V. vulnificus MARTXVv toxin.
Our preliminary data using an unbiased Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 Screening approach identified a host cell
membrane protein kinase as the most promising receptor candidate. In this aim, we will use a combination of
genetic manipulation, in vitro cellular assays and FRET based flow cytometry to validate the role of this kinase
as a MARTXVv receptor. The second aim will determine which regions of MARTXVv can bind to the cellular surface
based on previous studies on MARTXVv fragments, using techniques including protein purification, cell-based
binding assays and fluorescence microscopy. Collective, these data will define the host receptor and receptor
binding domain of the toxin revealing critical interactions between the toxin and host at cellular surface, the first
step of MARTXVv intoxication. Completion of the proposed work will provide training opportunities required to
support the long-term career goal of becoming a principal investigator studying bacterial toxins. Specifically, the
training will include 1) developing expertise in studying toxin functions in the host cell system, 2) developing
experimental techniques in genetic screens, immunofluorescence, and protein biochemistry and 3) developing
general skills required for academic independent researchers such as grant writing and scientific communication.
Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine provides an outstanding training environment for
accomplishing these goals. The sponsor Dr. Karla Satchell is an expert in bacterial toxins and protein structure.
The trainee will gain a depth of knowledge in studying toxin biology by having weekly meetings with her. The
department provides plenty of opportunities for scientific communication including weekly journal club and
research presentations. Further, the program is equipped with excellent core facilities with skillful consultants to
help develop techniques using advanced instruments in imagining, flow cytometry, and protein purification."

Large-scale population genomic studies have failed to provide a full picture of the genetic variation harbored in
human populations, largely overlooking entire regions of the world. Indeed, of the human genomes currently
available, only ~3% are from Oceania, a region that harbors unique population-specific genetic variation,
including the largest amounts of DNA inherited from archaic hominin such as Neanderthals and the enigmatic
Denisovans. Thus, a fundamental knowledge gap exists regarding human genetic variation and archaic hominin
introgression in Oceania. A better understanding of the full spectrum of human genomic variation in Oceania is
critical for reconstructing our evolutionary past and disentangling the genetic basis of phenotypic variation and
disease susceptibility. In this context, my lab aims to discover and characterize human genetic variation in
Oceania at unprecedented resolution. Upon establishing my lab in July 2020, we have spearheaded two large-
scale genome sequencing projects which aim to characterize the full spectrum of human genetic variation in
Oceania, from single nucleotide polymorphisms to large, complex structural variants. Using an integrative
approach that combines insights from population genomics, molecular biology, genome sequencing,
computational biology and anthropology, my lab seeks to understand how migrations, admixture, genetic drift,
cultural barriers, and natural selection influence patterns in population genetic structure. One fundamental
question we seek to address is how archaic hominin introgression contributes to phenotypic variation. While
several lines of evidence exist for both adaptive and deleterious effects of Neandertal introgressed variants, our
understanding of the impact of Denisovan introgression on fitness in modern humans is limited by the few
available Oceanic genomes available. Our proposal offers an unprecedented opportunity to map Denisovan
introgressed variants that remain undiscovered at present and make inference about their fitness and functional
consequences. Importantly, motivated by the recent discovery of Oceanic-specific adaptive introgressed
structural variants (SVs), my lab will explore the role that SVs played in human evolution and adaptation by
generating the first panel of fully phased de novo assemblies of Oceanic genomes, and will comprehensively
characterize SVs by integrating them into the latest human pangenome graph. Overall, my research program
will empower the discovery of previously unknown human genetic variation, including novel candidates for
adaptive introgression, and address fundamental questions about our evolutionary history."

Dr. Rachel G. Sinkey is a maternal-fetal medicine subspecialist who seeks to become an independently funded
clinician-scientist focused on hypertension and cardiovascular (CVD) disease in pregnancy and the postpartum
period. She seeks a K23 Mentored Research Award to realize this goal and has assembled a team of world-
renowned experts to provide mentorship as she completes a tailored, five-year career development and
mentored research plan. In the comprehensive career development plan the candidate will: 1) obtain skills to
independently design and conduct clinical trials; 2) complete a Master of Science in Public Health degree; 3)
attain contemporary hypertension knowledge, and 4) obtain career skills in strategic grant planning and writing.
The customized career development plan will be accompanied by a mentored randomized clinical trial focused
on preeclampsia. Preeclampsia (PE) is a hypertensive disorder that occurs in the second half of pregnancy,
complicating up to one in twelve pregnancies. Delivery immediately following PE diagnosis carries the least
maternal risk; however, when possible, delivery is delayed if the gestation is preterm (<37 weeks) to decrease
major effects of prematurity. Despite this, maternal or fetal health factors may lead to delivery of a preterm patient
with PE including: 1) maternal end-organ damage or uncontrolled severe hypertension (known as severe PE),
and 2) fetal abnormalities (involving amniotic fluid, fetal testing and/or uterine artery Dopplers). The American
College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Hypertension Guideline defers pregnancy hypertension
management to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). ACOG recommends
antihypertensive treatment for severe hypertension (BP ≥160/110 mmHg), to avoid acute cardiovascular
complications. On the other hand, treatment of non-severe hypertension in women with PE is controversial, due
to concerns that lowering arterial perfusion to the fetus may lead to impaired fetal growth. There is also concern
that anti-hypertensive therapy may mask severe PE, leading to maternal harm. Evidence supporting these
concerns is limited, and it is unknown whether antihypertensive treatment safely prolongs pregnancy, a
prerequisite for neonatal benefit. Given these critical gaps in knowledge, we propose “The ACHIEVE Trial”,
a phase II, open-label RCT (N=132) of antihypertensive treatment in preterm patients with non-severe PE.
Participants will be randomized 1:1 to: 1) intervention – anti-hypertensive therapy for BP goal <140/90 mmHg,
or 2) usual care – antihypertensive therapy only if BP ≥160/110 mmHg. In Aim 1 we will determine if treatment
to achieve a BP goal <140/90 mmHg prolongs mean time to delivery. In Aim 2 we will examine whether the
intervention reduces perinatal and maternal morbidity. We will also collect and store blood for future studies
investigating CVD biomarkers and endothelial dysfunction. This research study, accompanied by a
comprehensive career development plan, will provide a strong foundation for a productive independent career
in clinical research focused on hypertension and cardiovascular disease in pregnancy and the postpartum period."

Recent mental health studies have led to an expanded depth of multimodal brain imaging data, clinical
assessments and physiological data. In addition, longitudinal studies have become increasingly important to
capture the trajectory of disease progression, treatment response and relapse. This wealth of datasets
provides an unprecedented opportunity for crosscutting investigations. However, much-needed statistical
methods for exploring discoveries are lacking. In particular, there has been very limited development of
advanced statistical methods for several important objectives: decompose observed brain connectivity
measures to reveal underlying neural circuits which are key biomarkers for mental disorders, effectively extract
low dimensional neural features from imaging to reliably predict clinical outcomes such as treatment response,
and analyze longitudinal multidimensional data including neuroimaging, clinical and behavioral assessments to
study the dynamic interplay between brain and behavior changes due to treatments.
In this competing renewal proposal, we will build upon the theoretical and computational framework
established in our previous award to develop rigorous and computationally efficient statistical methods to
address the aforementioned objectives. Specifically, we plan to develop 1) a sparse and low rank ICA (SLR-
ICA) framework for reliable and parsimonious decomposition of brain connectivity measures to reveal
underlying neural circuits associated with specific clinical symptoms in mental disorders; 2) an ICA-Neural
Network (ICA-NN) predictive model that effectively extracts relevant low dimensional linear and non-linear
neural features to predict clinical outcomes; and (3) longitudinal multidimensional data analysis tools for
investigating heterogeneous changes in neural circuits due to different treatments and disease subtypes, and
disentangle the relationship between changes in neuroimaging phenotypes and clinical symptoms. The
statistical methods will be applied to a major NIH funded longitudinal study of major depressive disorder (MDD)
to help discover neural circuits underlying specific depressive symptoms (e.g. suicidal thoughts) and differential
treatment response, and ultimately help lead to more effective treatment for individual MDD patients based on
his/her own neural circuitry fingerprints and behavior. We plan to replicate the findings using an independent
validation cohort from an R01 study of MDD. User-friendly software will be made available to general research
communities. Our proposed method developments will directly benefit mental health research by providing
innovative statistical tools to effectively extract reliable and highly relevant low dimensional features from
neuroimaging to deepen mechanistic understanding and improve treatment of MDD and other mental
disorders."

Over 50 million Americans experience tinnitus. Persistent tinnitus can cause considerable suffering and
disability, impairing sleep, cognition, mental health and daily function, and the economic burden due to
disability, lost productivity and healthcare costs is substantial. However, little is known about the precipitants
and pathways that lead to persistent tinnitus and treatment options are limited. Our long-term goal is to identify
treatment targets and preventative strategies to reduce tinnitus burden and improve quality of life. Our overall
objectives are to (i) identify novel metabolomic and multi-omic risk factors for the development of tinnitus
among two large longitudinal cohorts of women (N>26,000); and (ii) collect tinnitus-related individual level data
in two additional ongoing cohorts of younger and more diverse men and women (N>70,000). Our central
hypotheses are that specific plasma metabolites are associated with risk of developing tinnitus and that genetic
variants influence how environmental exposures contribute to the development of tinnitus. The rationale is that
identifying risk factors for tinnitus will provide a strong scientific framework for improving tinnitus management,
and expanding data collection to include younger individuals will create a comprehensive resource that will
enable studies of genetic and environmental factors and will be invaluable in advancing future tinnitus
research. The study objectives will be addressed in three specific aims: 1) Identify plasma metabolomic risk
factors for developing persistent tinnitus; 2) Evaluate genomics and gene-environment interactions as risk
factors for developing persistent tinnitus; and 3) Collect tinnitus information in two ongoing cohorts of younger
individuals. We will leverage rich assets from four longitudinal cohort studies and findings from two large
tinnitus genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In Aim 1, we will use logistic regression to identify novel
metabolomic risk factors for developing tinnitus. In Aim 2a, we will conduct a GWAS and perform a meta-
analysis with published tinnitus GWAS results from the UK Biobank. In Aim 2b, we will assess how genetic
variations in enzymes responsible for caffeine and analgesic metabolism modulate associations between
caffeine intake or analgesic use and tinnitus risk. In Aim 3, we will leverage regularly administered
questionnaires in 2 well-characterized younger cohorts to collect detailed tinnitus information. This innovative
proposal integrates omics with epidemiological data to identify new risk factors for tinnitus, improve
understanding of tinnitus etiology and reveal metabolic pathways and candidate genes for future functional
follow-up. The proposed research is significant because identifying risk factors and omics precursors may
enable earlier neuroprotective interventions when treatments are more likely to be effective. As an early-stage
investigator, this project will provide me with necessary preliminary data for a future R01 proposal to extend
these large-scale multi-omics investigations of tinnitus, identify additional novel risk factors, and uncover new
treatment targets in women and men across the lifespan, and advance my career to the next stage."
10902047,"This proposal for a Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC) for the Early Detection Research
Network (EDRN) seeks to improve the management of lung cancer through detection of cancer-
specific DNA methylation. This effort includes a Biomarker Development Laboratory (BDL) which
will optimize the methylation detection methods, implementation of these methods for clinical use
through a Biomarker Reference Laboratory (BRL) with a longstanding record of molecular testing
in a clinical setting, and an Administrative Core facilitating the interactions between the BDL and
BRL, and with other EDRN investigators and the NCI. Previous work by the applicants has
demonstrated the potential of DNA methylation detection for cancer diagnostics, and they have
developed extremely sensitive assays for the detection of hypermethylated DNA sequences and
optimized the isolation and processing of circulating cell-free DNA from tumors for these novel
assays. The approach has been used to detect circulating cancer-specific DNA methylation
changes for the early diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with screen-detected pulmonary
nodules. Although sensitivity and specificity of the assay are promising, additional improvements
in the performance are required for implementation of this approach in the setting of cancer
screening. In this BCC, detection of cancer-specific DNA methylation changes in the plasma will
be further improved, and new approaches developed and implemented to address the challenges
of ultrasensitive detection of DNA methylation in the blood. In addition, we will assess the potential
of these methods to detect other common and lethal malignancies. Our bioinformatic analysis of
DNA methylation from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has identified novel highly frequent
cancer-specific methylation events common to all cancers, including lung cancer, that will be
developed into universal cancer detection assays. The use of TCGA data has also resulted in the
identification of other methylation alterations that allow determination of the origin (organ site) of
this cancer-specific signal. The combination of optimal sample processing, ultrasensitive
methylation detection, developed with universal cancer and histology specific loci detection, will
allow improved lung cancer early detection in the setting of CT screening and management of
detection of other cancer-specific DNA methylation from blood."

 The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need for robust mental health services in the United
States (US). In contrast, the mental health workforce is shrinking. Lack of resources has led to patients
“boarding” for days in the Emergency Department (ED) while they await inpatient hospital beds. In attempt to
address these issues, federal and state policymakers have recently enacted policies to improve the Nation’s
mental health crisis care infrastructure. One such law changed the phone number for the National Suicide
Prevention Lifeline (NSPL) to “988.” This simple number created an unprecedented demand for psychiatric
crisis professionals who can respond to callers deemed to be at imminent risk of harm to themselves or others.
The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has put forth Mobile Crisis Units
(MCUs) as a solution to this problem. MCUs are a psychiatric service that meets individuals in crisis wherever
they are in the community to de-escalate, triage, and refer them to additional services. They represent a way to
ensure NSPL callers can receive care in the least restrictive setting, thus preventing unnecessary
hospitalization. According to the SAMSHA model, MCUs are two person teams composed of a mental health
professional and a certified peer provider (i.e. a Certified Recovery Support Specialist [CRSS]).
 Many states must now significantly expand their mental health crisis workforce to effectively meet the
needs of their citizens and follow SAMHSA’s recommendations. Illinois (IL) is an example of a state that has
enacted policies designed to fill this gap. Two programs, the CRSS Success Program (CRSS-SP) and Program
590, were designed to increase the workforce of CRSSs able to work on MCUs and increase the number of
MCUs in the state, respectively. These relatively new programs have yet to be evaluated on how effectively they
are able to grow the state’s MCU workforce.
 Systems thinking is a framework that seeks to solve complex problems by understanding how parts of a
system function to produce outcomes. Methods grounded in systems thinking, such as Group Model Building
(GMB) and Simulation Modeling (SM), have a proven track record for effectively generating policies that solve
healthcare workforce issues, but they have yet to be used in the context of the MCU workforce pipeline. The
objectives of this study are therefore to 1) use GMB to create a map of Illinois’s MCU workforce pipeline system
and evaluate if this method is effective in this context, 2) evaluate data from the CRSS-SP and Program 590 to
determine which factors increase the likelihood that CRSSs and MHPs obtain and retain employment at MCUs,
and 3) use SM to test policies that will help the state meet its MCU workforce needs. The recommendations
generated by this study will be given to state government officials so they can be used to improve the lives of
individuals in IL experiencing mental health crises."

The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has been a leader in the effort to facilitate the bidirectional
exchange of cutting-edge scientific information between scientists and investigators in rheumatic diseases
through its annual Basic and Clinical Research Conferences. The ACR has successfully hosted the conference
as separate programs and as a combined basic science and clinical research program, as well as both in-
person and virtually. Each program has been held in conjunction with ACR’s annual meeting, Convergence.
The ACR annual meeting, ACR Convergence, attracts between 10,000 and 15,000 attendees each year and is
the principal mechanism for providing a forum for the exchange of ideas about research, education, patient
care, practice management and advocacy issues. Because the Basic and Clinical Research Conferences have
been held in conjunction with ACR Convergence, typically as a pre-meeting event, ACR has been able to
attract renown scientists and investigators who may otherwise not have attended.
For 2022, the Basic and Clinical Research Conference will be held jointly to attract scientists and investigators
from both the basic, clinical and translational research communities. The tentative title of the conference is
Disrupting the Genetics of Rheumatology: The Role of Somatic Mutations in Health and Disease . This
combined approach will focus on the role of somatic mutations in the development rheumatologic diseases.
Clinical research sessions will focus on genetic epidemiology approaches for associating somatic mutations
with disease. Basic research sessions will explore topics such as identification of the presence and functional
role of somatic mutations.
The conference organizers include Dr. Jill Norris, Professor and Chair of the Department of Epidemiology at
the Colorado School of Public Health; Dr. Peter Grayson, Earl Stadtman Investigator at the NIAMS; Dr. Linda

Sarcopenia, the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and force, is characterized by muscle wasting and
diminished contractile strength leading to physical frailty, decreased mobility, increased disability, and a loss of
independence. The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the synapse responsible for transmitting action potentials
from motor neurons to the motor endplate of muscle fibers. NMJs exhibit structural and functional disruptions
including a complete loss of innervation during aging, but the mechanisms for this detrimental phenotype remain
unknown. This study aims to investigate the role in NMJ degeneration of changes in subsynaptic myonuclei
(SSM). Skeletal muscle fibers are large multinucleated cells, with different individual nuclei responsible for
supporting localized domains. SSM are a population of nuclei positioned near the NMJ that play a crucial role in
NMJ development and maintenance. Previous studies have produced conflicting results regarding associations
between aging, SSM number, and NMJ degeneration emphasizing the need for further investigations to clarify
the role of changes in SSM as potential cause or consequence of a loss of innervation. Our own data indicates
no change in SSM number with age, despite high numbers of disrupted and denervated endplates in muscles of
old animals. We also found no changes in SSM number following acute denervation, but denervated muscles
showed a significant increase in LMNA gene expression as well as in the levels of the protein product Lamin
A/C. Lamin A/C is the primary intermediate filament protein of the nuclear lamina and a key component in
maintaining myonuclear structural integrity. The nuclear lamina plays a critical role in regulating gene expression
by interacting with chromatin and nuclear membrane proteins. The expression of Lamin A/C has been reported
to decrease with age, and its muscle-specific deletion accelerates NMJ degradation, resembling age-related
NMJ decline. Our overall hypothesis is that Lamin A/C is required for mediating the process of reinnervation
following a denervation event. We will address this hypothesis using a combination of powerful mouse models,
surgical interventions, assessments of neuromuscular functional properties, and an array of molecular
techniques combined with high-resolution confocal imaging. Specifically, we will [1] define the impact of
denervation on the integrity of subsynaptic myonuclei in young and aged mice, and [2] determine the impact of
skeletal muscle-specific LMNA deletion on reinnervation following nerve injury. We expect to see a denervation-
induced upregulation of Lamin A/C that contributes to the maintenance SSM shape and SSM number leading to
improved reinnervation of endplates. Therefore, we also predict that lack of Lamin A/C will result in impaired
reinnervation after nerve injury leading to poor neuromuscular function. By elucidating key regulators of
reinnervation, we aim to identify therapeutic targets for physiological manipulation to boost compensatory
mechanisms that drive reinnervation, extend healthspan, and enhance quality of life for the elderly."

Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) is a promising approach for treating patients with advanced malignancies.
Advances in molecular biology and genetic engineering have led to the design and use of modified T cells that
can recognize tumors to achieve significant tumor control upon ACT to patients. These T cells are either
transduced with tumor antigen reactive T cell receptors (TCR), or chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). Yet,
elimination of established tumors has not been effectively achieved, typically due to loss of T-cell effector function
or failure of long-term survival. Most ACT trials use rapidly expanded T cells that are terminally differentiated and
exhibit an effector memory (Tem) phenotype. These Tem phenotypes bearing cells are more susceptible to the
adverse effects of the tumor microenvironment (TME). Therefore, the development of novel mechanism based
therapeutic strategies that can reprogram anti-tumor T cells to maintain their metabolic fitness and effector
function in a tumor microenvironment is urgently needed to enhance the therapeutic value of ACT. Our Phase I
clinical trial in this proposal builds on strong in vivo pre-clinical tumor control data obtained using novel ex vivo
programming conditions that merge robust phenotypes of both Th1 and Th17 cells to generate a hybrid Th1/17
cell. We have recently established that programming conditions that bring together ‘anti-tumor effector function’
of Th1 cells and ‘stemness’ of Th17 cells lead to a superior hybrid Th1/17 (and Tc/17) cell exhibiting long-term
tumor control. CD19 CAR T-cell therapy (CD19-CTCT) represents an enormous scientific and clinical
breakthrough for patients with CD19-positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), however, major issues still remain
regarding toxicity and with the majority of patients succumbing to disease relapse. Thus, we hypothesize that ex
vivo expansion and programming of CD19-CAR-Ts to metabolically enhanced hybrid T1/17 (Th1/17 and Tc1/17)
phenotype will lead to robust anti-tumor control even with fewer adoptively transferred cells. Additionally, we
have used cytoplasmically truncated CD34 tag (CD34t) into the CAR T cell construct to enable a more purified
CAR T-cell product via CD34 selection, which aims to improve CAR T-cell antigen reactivity, persistence, and
reduces off-target toxicities. Following specific aims are proposed to establish and develop our approach for
commercialization: Specific Aim 1: Define a safe dose of meCD19- CD34t-CAR-T cells while evaluating efficacy
for R/R B-cell NHL and CLL/SLL. Specific Aim 2: Establish pre- and post-infusion molecular signature and its
correlation to anti-tumor response. We believe that this proposal will help adopt the novel ex vivo programming
conditions for generating robust anti-tumor CAR-Ts that could be used in future in clinical trials to target other
malignancies."

National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) Retail Food Surveillance in
southern California started in 2018. This project will continue the surveillance in the most
populated city of Los Angeles and expand the surveillance to rural areas in California. The
project’s goal of improving food safety and protecting public health will be achieved by
undertaking the following specific aims and activities. First, we will continue the NARMS retail
food surveillance in the city of Los Angeles and expand the surveillance to two rural areas
(Amador and Calaveras) in California. Second, we will monitor trends of AMR in different
pathogens in retail meat and seafood specimens. We will collect retail meat (chicken, turkey,
pork, beef) and seafood (shrimp, salmon, tilapia) specimens monthly from randomly selected
grocery stores. We will test meat samples for Salmonella, Campylobacter (poultry only), E. coli
and Enterococcus and seafood samples for Enterococcus, Aeromonas, Vibrio and other lactose
positive bacteria according to NARMS’ Retail Food Protocols. Bacterial isolates will be sent to
FDA monthly for antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) and whole genome sequencing (WGS)
(WGS of meat isolates will be done by UC Davis). Third, we will conduct epidemiological
studies on prevalence of AMR in retail food. We will collect store information and metadata for
each retail meat and seafood specimen and determine key links between the prevalence of
bacteria and their AMR (e.g. single or multiple drug resistance) and species, origins, types, and
forms of retail food, claims of antibiotics use, and seasons etc. Fourth, based on results of this
project, we will develop lay publications, outreach materials, abstracts and posters, and peer-
reviewed publications. We will disseminate findings to agriculture and aquaculture communities,
veterinarians, and the public via newsletters, extension workshops, presentations in meetings and
conferences, and peer-reviewed journals. Fifth, we will participate in NARMS conference calls
and working groups.
 By accomplishing these specific aims and activities, the project will characterize the trends of
AMR in retail foods in the state of California. The project will enhance NARMS Retail Food
Surveillance and increase public awareness of AMR in retail foods. The project will also
strengthen collaborations among federal and state agencies and academia on research, detection,
surveillance, and investigation of foodborne outbreaks associated with AMR in retail food.

 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is the causative agent of salmonellosis, leading to ~150 million
cases of gastroenteritis annually around the world, making it one of the most common foodborne diseases.
Salmonella enterica serovars are especially reliant on secreted protein effectors for virulence. These effectors
can mimic and reprogram host cellular functions to create a beneficial environment for the invading bacteria,
such as formation of the intracellular salmonella containing vacuole (SCV) and antagonization of the immune
response. My lab previously found that increased intracellular replication of S. Typhimurium and production of
anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) by host cells is associated with the secreted protein effector
SarA. SarA acts through host STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) signaling by mimicking
the function of host cytokine receptor gp130. However, despite homology between SarA and gp130, I have
shown that SarA leads to greater STAT3 phosphorylation over a longer period of time than gp130. Previous
research in the field of STAT3 signaling suggests that the kinetics of STAT3 activation have a dramatic effect on
whether the downstream transcriptional targets are pro- or anti-inflammatory. I hypothesize that S. Typhimurium
effector SarA evolved molecular characteristics to hijack and prolong host STAT3 signaling to promote important
anti-inflammatory responses during acute infection in the gut. I propose mutagenizing SarA and measuring how
these manipulations alter 1) SarA binding to STAT3 and negative regulators, 2) SarA-directed phosphorylation
of STAT3, 3) expression of downstream transcriptional targets and 4) SarA-associated burden and IL-10
phenotypes in cells and mice. My lab has previously shown that SarA leads to increased STAT3 phosphorylation
and fitness in systemic sites (spleen, liver) during intraperitoneal (I.P.) and chronic murine infection models.
However, neither of these models represent the natural oral infection route of S. Typhimurium in humans. I have
shown that wild-type and complemented Salmonella Typhimurium have ~100x greater burden in the small
intestine compared to ∆sarA during infection in an oral murine model. I will further elucidate the mechanism by
which SarA signaling acts on the mucosal immune responses to benefit S. Typhimurium during oral infection.
This proposal aims to understand the molecular basis for robust STAT3 activation by SarA, and how S.
Typhimurium hijacking of the host STAT3 signaling pathway impacts infection outcome during intestinal infection
in vivo."
10901903,"Non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are emerging pathogens with high intrinsic drug resistance. Mycobacterium abscessus is the most pathogenic refractory NTM member, and infections with this pathogen are associated with especially poor clinical outcomes. The standard of care therapy of amikacin and clarithromycin fails in a high proportion of cases, and thus there is a clear need for new therapeutic options. To approach this challenge, we investigated the synthetic modification of spectinomycin, an aminocyclitol antibiotic that exhibits potent bacterial protein synthesis inhibition but has limited efficacy in mycobacteria due to intrinsic resistance mechanisms. A library of semi-synthetic spectinomycin analogs was profiled for activity against M. abscessus, from which a distinct structural subclass of ethylene linked aminomethyl spectinomycins (eAmSPC) was identified. Initial leads of this subclass display potent anti-M. abscessus activity, while maintaining the desired pharmacological properties of minimal cytotoxicity and hepatic metabolism, low protein binding, and absence of mitochondrial protein synthesis inhibition. These leads have favorable activity against multi-drug resistant M. abscessus clinical isolates, are active against other NTM pathogens, minimally induce the WhiB7 ribosomal stress response pathway, are not substrates for mycobacterial aminoglycoside modifying enzymes and demonstrate robust efficacy in M. abscessus mouse infection models. The results of these preliminary studies suggest that eAmSPCs have the potential to be developed into treatments for M. abscessus and other NTM infections. The key goals of this proposal are to increase the potency and tolerability of the eAmSPCs. This will be achieved through an iterative drug cycle to include: (i) A structure-guided optimization strategy will be applied to the ethyl side chain to reduce its lipophilicity and generate extra binding interactions in the RpsE / 30S helix-34 binding side pocket. (ii) Further rounds of optimization will be guided by mycobacterial ribosomal inhibition, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) activity against a panel of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), and in vitro pharmacokinetic studies. Recently developed Cryo-EM methods in mycobacterial ribosomes will confirm the binding mode and assist in these structure-based drug design efforts. Accumulation studies to investigate permeability and efflux will help define which structural modifications are successful in overcoming intrinsic resistance mechanisms. Whole- genome sequencing and RNAseq studies will ensure compounds remain on target and explore drug resistance and virulence mechanisms. (iii) In vivo pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy studies on emerging leads will be determined, in comparison to the standard of care antibiotics, using acute and chronic mouse models of NTM infection that recapitulate the pathology of NTM infected human lung. Late leads will be profiled for in vitro pharmacology safety. Compounds developed in this proposal against M. abscessus will be prioritized to include those with activity against M. avium and other NTMs in order to generate therapeutics with a wider spectrum against this important group of pathogens."

stress and damage play in aging that has led to his recently funded VA Merit grant, which studies the role of
inflammation in aging. Chronic, low-grade inflammation is a hallmark of aging and is a major risk factor for most
age-related diseases, e.g., cancer, health disease, Alzheimer’s disease, etc. Necroptosis is a recently identified

damage-associated molecular patterns, which are potent inducers of inflammation. Using genetical
manipulations that reduce necroptosis in mice, Dr. Richardson will determine if reducing necroptosis attenuates
the age-related increase in chronic inflammation and leads to increased lifespan, improved healthspan, and
reduced age-related pathology in the mice.
 Dr. Richardson also is PI on three NIH grants. His first NIH grant studies dietary Restriction (DR), which has
been shown to increase the lifespan of a wide variety of organisms ranging from invertebrates to rodents.
Therefore, DR has been viewed as a universal aging intervention. However, a study in 2010 reported that the
genotype of an animal was a major determinant in the ability of the animal to respond to DR, e.g., two-thirds of
the 41 recombinant inbred (RI) lines of mice studied either did not respond or showed reduced lifespan when
fed DR. The overall goal of his NIH grant is to explore the interaction between genotype and the level of DR
using four of the RI lines of mice reported to show a decrease in lifespan when fed a DR diet. The lifespan and
pathology associated with aging is being measured in male and female mice fed either ad libitum or 60% ad
libitum (DR). The current data indicate that in contrast to the previous report, DR increases the lifespan of the
RI lines of mice, supporting the view that DR is a universal aging intervention.
 Dr. Richardson’s second NIH grant is in response to an RFA to develop measures of resilience in mice that
can be surrogates for increased longevity and healthspan. He is developing four measures of resilience that are
relatively simple, inexpensive, non-invasive, and can be performed in mice in vivo. Currently, his laboratory is
studying the response of age, DR, and rapamycin on resilience to the following: treadmill exercise, recovery from
anesthesia, carrageenan-induced inflammation, and recovery from oxidative stress.
 In a recently funded third NIH grant, Dr. Richardson is studying the potential role epigenetics plays in the
anti-aging mechanism of DR. Recently, he showed that short-term DR induces changes in DNA methylation in
intestinal mucosa in the promoter of the Nts 1 gene. The changes in DNA methylation were closely associated
with increased expression of Nts 1, which persisted when the DR mice were then fed ad libitum for several
months. Because the epithelial cells in the intestinal mucosa are continuously renewed every 4 to 5 days, the
changes in DNA methylation in intestinal mucosa most likely arise in intestinal stem cells. In this grant, Dr.
Richardson is measuring changes in DNA methylation induced by DR in intestinal stem cells using a novel
assay, which allows him to measure accurately at single base resolution changes DNA methylation at ~30
million sites in the genome.
 In addition to his research grants, Dr. Richardson is also the PI/Director of a P30 NIA Center grant: the
Oklahoma Nathan Shock Aging Center. The Oklahoma Shock Center involves faculty from the three major
research institutions in Oklahoma City: University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma Medical
Research Foundation, and OKC VA Medical Center. The Center plays provides faculty, post-doctoral fellows,
and graduate students at the three institutions with unique assays to study aging and pilot grants."
10881676,"Dr. Olszewski is an immunologist with over 25 years of experience in studies of
inflammatory/infectious diseases in the lungs, CNS and at the systemic level with over 20 years
of research at the Ann Arbor VAHS. Overall career goal is to expand the understanding of host
pathogen interactions, specifically the effect of microbe- and host-derived signals on the fate of
the immune response. Understanding of these interactions will create a foundation for the
development of safe and effective immunomodulatory therapies that will greatly enhance the
effectiveness of antimicrobial therapeutics in persistent infections. Nominee’s lab has
specialized in animal modeling and translational studies, applying these principles to a broader
range of diseases as shown by more recent clinical data.
His studies have mostly focused on host pathogen interactions between invasive fungus C.
neoformans and the mammalian immune system. The studies of invasive fungal infections are
of specific interest to the VA, because of the higher than average rate of immunocompromised
patients among veterans and increased risk of exposure to various endemic and environmental
fungi due to locations and conditions of military service that favor fungal exposures.
Unfortunately, the invasive fungal infections have unacceptably high mortality rates, due to
limited effectiveness of antifungal drugs, toxicity, and the high potential of fungal organisms to
develop resistance to these drugs. Thus, it is crucial to understand the effects of
immunomodulation on fungal disease from the perspective of the natural mechanisms of host
defenses, mechanisms of immune evasion exhibited by fungi, and to explore pre-clinical
approaches of immunomodulatory therapies. The long-standing support of VA BLR&D was one
of the crucial factors that allowed our group to establish itself among leaders in cryptococcal and
fungal immunology. Additional areas of work involve clinical studies looking into pathogenesis
od ARDS in COVID19 patients and infections of GI track. The VA RCS Award will allow the
nominee to continue his productive research career, successful mentoring of new scientists and
to provide service to the research community at the VA and beyond."
10881741,"Summary: Chlorine and bromine (Cl2 and Br2) are highly reactive and extremely toxic halogen gases that cause
debilitating cardiopulmonary injury and death. Research from our previously funded ‘Identification of Therapeutic
Lead Compounds U01’ provided published and preliminary data that identified calpain inhibitor (CI) as highly
efficacious and safe antidote for Br2 inhalation-induced cardiopulmonary injury and mortality. These studies were
carried out in our unique halogen exposure facility and the discovery of the mitigating agent was made possible
by the development of the Cl2/Br2 exposure-induced rat model of acute cardiopulmonary damage and mortality.
Using the whole body Br2 exposure rat model we demonstrated that the therapeutic action of CIs is caused by
reduction in Br2 induced calpain activity, reduction of proteolysis of the myocardium and preservation of cardiac
function leading to decreased mortality. Calpains (calcium dependent proteases) are activated by Br2/Br2
reactant-induced loss of cardiac sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, SERCA activity and subsequent
catastrophic cytosolic Ca2+ overload. Intraperitoneal administration of a CI (that was selected from several
commercially available CIs based on an ex-vivo high-throuput evaluation of cardiac calpain inhibition) 1h after
Br2 exposure significantly mitigated acute increase in cardiac calpain activity, decreased Br2-induced mortality.
Administration of CI significantly improved the clinical scores, heart rate and oxygen saturation. Br2-induced
pulmonary edema and cardiac hypertrophy was also reduced. Several cardiovascular parameters such as blood
pressure, ventricular pressure, cardiac output and other diastolic and systolic heart functions were improved in
Br2-exposed animals after CI treatment. We have also initiated the studies on its various structural analogs.
These structures were characterized for their improved solubility, bioavailability and stability. Preliminary data
for their activity and cellular toxicity was also evaluated. Thus, as mentioned in the CounterACT FOA we provided
validation of molecular targets for therapeutic development, proof of in vitro activity of the lead compound,
preliminary in vivo proof-of-concept efficacy data, and preliminary adsorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion,
and toxicity (ADME/Tox) evaluations. Therefore, this lead compound ‘calpain inhibitor’ is now ready for
optimization and we will also evaluate ADME/safety profile of the CI and its most effective analog. Optimization
of CI/analog dose and delivery in a large animal model of halogen-induced cardiopulmonary injury will also be
performed. These studies will allow the lead compound to move forward and help design the pivotal studies
needed for regulatory FDA approval of CI under the animal rule."
10878580,"Project Summary
 Taste buds are the end organs of the gustatory system and allow for the detection of sweet, bitter, umami,
salty, and sour stimuli. In mammals, taste buds inhabit several areas of the oral cavity, including the fungiform
papillae of the anterior tongue and the circumvallate papillae of the posterior tongue. Two separate taste
nerves innervate the anterior and posterior tongue; the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve innervates
the fungiform taste buds, while the glossopharyngeal nerve innervates the circumvallate taste buds. While
buds from both fungiform and circumvallate tissues can detect the five established taste qualities, several lines
of evidence suggest differences between anterior and posterior taste buds in both form and function (Travers
et al., 1987; Ninomiya & Funakoshi, 1989; Frank 1991; Ninomiya et al., 1991; Spector & Grill 1992; Hellekant
et al., 1997; St. John & Spector, 1998; Tomchik et al., 2007; Yoshida et al., 2009; Lewandowski et al., 2016).
Most of the anatomical taste bud data in the literature feature only the circumvallate taste buds—this is likely
due to the relative ease of isolating taste buds from the closely packed buds of the circumvallate tissue rather
than the sparse buds of the fungiform tissue. The cellular composition of taste buds, detailed taste cell
morphology, and patterns of connectivity between taste cells and innervating nerve fibers have been reported
in circumvallate tissue (Romanov et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2022). The current proposal
aims to close the anatomical knowledge gap across taste fields by examining fungiform taste buds via Serial
Block Face Scanning Electron Microscopy (sbfSEM). This high-resolution imaging technique can produce
serial electron micrographs through entire mouse fungiform taste buds. When aligned and imported into
specialized imaging software, objects in the mass of the taste bud can be manually traced and reconstructed in
digital 3D space. To augment the manual segmentation process, this project will also employ machine learning
techniques to identify and segment a portion of the objects of interest in the dataset. Using micrographs and
the 3-D reconstructions of objects therein, this project will unveil morphological details of fungiform taste cells.
It will reveal whether or not morphological subsets of the three established mature taste cells exist in fungiform
taste buds, and whether or not their morphologies differ from those described in the circumvallate. By
reconstructing the nerve fibers that receive synapses from fungiform taste cells, the proposed project will also
reveal the “connectome” of the fungiform taste buds. Anatomical patterns of connectivity between taste cells
and innervating nerve fibers underlie the taste information coding from taste bud to the central nervous system.
Understanding the connectome will thus provide new insight into how fungiform taste buds communicate taste
quality information to the brain, and whether their patterns of connectivity differ from those of circumvallate
taste buds. By elucidating and describing the morphological details and connectome of fungiform taste buds,
this project will expand our understanding of both form and function in the anterior tongue."
10899313,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Lipid-induced podocyte injury is an emerging molecular pathway contributing to the progression of
glomerular diseases (GDs) of metabolic and non-metabolic origin. Research by others and us has highlighted
a role for impaired reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and altered sphingolipid metabolism in lipid-induced
podocyte injury in GDs, yet, a common druggable pathway regulating both RCT and sphingolipid metabolism
in podocytes remains to be identified.
 Among several lipoproteins, Apolipoprotein M (APOM) is mainly located in high density lipoprotein (HDL)
particles where it facilitates RCT to HDL but also acts as a chaperone to transport sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P) through the circulation. S1P signaling occurs through binding of APOM/S1P complexes to S1P receptors
(S1PR1-5), which regulate many physiological processes, including migration, proliferation, and cell survival.
 We recently demonstrated significantly decreased glomerular APOM (gAPOM) mRNA expression in
patients with GD enrolled in the NEPTUNE cohort. Our new preliminary data show that decreased gAPOM
correlates with decreased plasma APOM (pAPOM), with increased glomerular sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1),
the enzyme that converts sphingosine to S1P, and S1PR4 expression and with eGFR decline. We observed a
similar gene expression pattern in Col4a3 KO mice, a mouse model of GD, and in Col4a3 KO podocytes, which
was associated with glomerular/podocyte cholesterol and S1P accumulation due to impaired RCT and
activation of S1P/S1PR4 signaling leading to increased apoptosis which was prevented by recombinant human
APOM (rhAPOM) treatment. Importantly, the therapeutic effect of rhAPOM in preventing podocyte apoptosis in
Col4a3 KO podocytes was superior to SPHK1 or S1PR4 antagonism. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment
of human podocytes with exogenous S1P increases podocyte apoptosis and causes albumin leakage in a
microfluid device as well as in ApoM deficient Col4a3 KO mice.
 Based on these observations, we hypothesize that GDs represent a state of gAPOM deficiency causing
impaired RCT and activation S1P/S1PR signaling in podocytes, thereby causing lipotoxic podocyte injury. We
propose a highly translational approach with three specific aims to 1) investigate if gAPOM deficiency correlates
with the activation of glomerular S1P/S1PR signaling, is associated with decreased pAPOM levels and predicts
outcomes in patients with GD, 2) to investigate the role of podocyte APOM deficiency on RCT and S1P/S1PR4
signaling, and 3) to investigate the therapeutic potential of recombinant human APOM in an experimental model
of GD.
 If successful, this translational study may lead to the clinical development of APOM as a biomarker in
GDs and to the use of recombinant APOM as a novel therapy for GDs."
10899314,"7. Project Summary Abstract
 Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals have elevated rates of risky alcohol use and alcohol
use disorders compared to their cisgender peers. Despite these disparities, the literature on alcohol use and
interventions in these populations remains limited. Recent research indicates that TGD people encounter
general and transphobia-related barriers to accessing care and systems and providers ill-equipped to help
them. However, little is known about alcohol intervention efficacy and engagement in TGD communities as few
studies have evaluated or adapted evidence-based interventions with these populations, or examined factors
that might influence help-seeking. Research is needed to explore potential adaptations and strategies to
increase the appeal and efficacy of interventions and promote help-seeking among TGD populations.
The proposed project aims to 1) explore factors that may increase intervention appeal and participation among
TGD adults reporting risky alcohol use, as defined by NIAAA thresholds, 2) elicit specific suggestions about
potentially meaningful areas of intervention adaptation (e.g., location, format, length, content, provider) and
intervention promotion strategies, and 3) explore the acceptability and feasibility of proposed adaptations. The
applicant proposes to address these aims via a mixed methods study with a sequential explanatory design.
The first phase of the study will be a quantitative survey (N = 200) of TGD adults reporting current or lifetime
risky alcohol use to elicit preferences around intervention adaptation and intervention promotion strategies.
The next phase will entail four focus groups of various stakeholders including TGD individuals, community
leaders, and service providers to review, discuss, and refine the preferences and suggestions elicited in phase
one with a focus on maximizing acceptability and feasibility.
 During the funding period, the applicant will receive advanced training in mixed methods research
methodologies, conducting trauma-informed and intersectional alcohol research with TGD populations,
evidence-based alcohol interventions, and culturally sensitive intervention adaptation research. The applicant
will leverage the skills and expertise gained through this fellowship to address important gaps in the literature
and further NIAAA’s goals to 1) address health disparities, 2) enhance diversity and inclusion in the alcohol
research enterprise, and 3) improve AUD intervention uptake and efficacy in order to reduce the enormous
health and social consequences of alcohol misuse in the U.S. The proposed project will solicit the
perspectives, preferences, and expertise of stakeholders (e.g., TGD people with risky alcohol use, LGBTQ+
organization leaders, alcohol intervention and TGD healthcare providers) to gather data about meaningful
areas of adaptation for alcohol interventions and intervention promotion strategies as well as the acceptability
and feasibility of potential adaptations. The knowledge gained from the proposed study will help direct future
research to sensitively adapt and evaluate specific evidence-based alcohol interventions for TGD populations."
10899337,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Relationships between words organize children’s early vocabularies into interconnected semantic networks. The
structure of these semantic networks, specifically how densely connected they are, predict cognitive skills that
are central to later academic success, including vocabulary size and word recognition speed. That is, children
whose vocabularies include more words that are semantically related to one another have stronger language
skills later in life. Thus, to support successful language development outcomes, it is essential to understand (a)
how toddlers begin to form semantic associations between individual words and (b) how they use these
associations to organize their networks into interconnected clusters of related words. Previous work has explored
the possibility that toddlers form semantic associations based on perceptual similarities between the objects that
words refer to, as well as similarities in the linguistic structures in which words are used. However, these cues
may not always be available and accessible to young word learners. An additional, unexplored possibility is that
toddlers take advantage of a different type of cue—the environmental context in which they encounter words
and objects, like the kitchen or the bathroom—to form semantic associations between words for objects that
appear in the same contexts and to group objects that appear in the same context into semantic categories.
Previous research suggests that caregivers systematically talk about semantically-related words in particular
contexts (i.e., food-related words in the kitchen and hygiene-related words in the bathroom) and that toddlers
remember the contexts in which they encounter words and objects. Despite the reliability and accessibility of
environmental context as a cue to lexical associations, its role in semantic network development has not yet
been examined. Specific Aim 1 of the proposed project will investigate whether young toddlers form semantic
associations between novel words for objects that are encountered in the same environmental context. Specific
Aim 2 will examine whether older toddlers can use environmental context to aggregate perceptually dissimilar
objects together into broad categories of semantically-related objects. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will examine how
individual differences in toddlers’ associations between words and particular environmental contexts are related
to differences in the structure of their extant vocabularies. By examining the role of environmental context in
semantic network development, the proposed project will incorporate environmental context into word learning
theory. Additionally, the proposed work will examine a mechanistic account of semantic network development
across toddlerhood, which will inform theories that encompass individual differences in vocabulary acquisition
and could serve as a potential target for future language learning interventions. Training Plan. The training plan
focuses on acquiring new methodological expertise in diverse experimental paradigms and individual differences
measures, gaining theoretical knowledge in semantic development, mentoring junior researchers, completing
advanced training in ethical and responsible conduct of research, and honing science communication skills."
10874952,"Abstract. The overall goal of the Behavioral Intervention Development (BID) Core of the Emory Roybal
Center for Dementia Caregiving Mastery is to move intervention ideas aligned with the Center’s guiding
principles (consumer-based and context-specific) successfully through development stages I-III toward real
world implementation (Stages VI-V). Anchored in the Center’s Behavioral Intervention Advancement Process,
the BID Core will manage four activities designed to promote the “success” of behavioral interventions: the
filtering, selection, support, and advancement of compelling ideas. These processes are meant to support the
attainment of the Core’s three aims: Aim 1. Facilitate the submission of competitive behavioral intervention
trial applications and nominate, for NIA support, those with the greatest promise of enhancing context-specific
caregiving mastery through NIH Stage-appropriate, mechanism-driven intervention trial designs that are
deemed to be of high impact and significance. Aim 2. Provide oversight, mentoring, and consultation to
ensure the successful outcome and dissemination of Center-supported intervention trial projects. Aim 3.
Advance successfully completed clinical trials to secure support for further stages of intervention development
either through the Center or through other sources (e.g., NIH research mechanisms). The filtering process
encourages the floating of intervention ideas from researchers drawn from the Center’s networks and guides
the most promising through the Center’s Consult Service for the sharpening of ideas and the development of
trial proposals. The selection process involves Center leaders and Advisors (Expert, Local, and Consumer) in
an NIH-type review of submitted proposals to identify 2-4 trials (likely, but not exclusively, Stage I or II projects)
that can be advanced for support, pending NIA review and approval. The support of trial activities will involve
individual mentoring teams of Center leaders and Advisors meeting regularly (by phone or videoconference)
with each investigator and semi-annual meetings between the investigator and the Center leadership team and
some Advisors to monitor progress and provide guidance in addressing challenges that might occur in the
course of implementation. The fourth process, intervention advancement, speaks to the key goal of the Center:
ensuring that the intervention ideas in which the Center has invested move through stages of development and
become evidence-based interventions that can be widely disseminated. The advancement process begins at
the point of trial implementation with the development of an individualized plan for moving forward to the next
stage of development. Within this plan, each investigator and her/his mentoring team periodically engage with
Consult Service resources to conceptualize and re-conceptualize the strategy for a next-stage proposal. In its
first year, the BID Core will support the activities of two Stage Ib trials, one involving a Spanish language
cultural adaptation of the evidence-based Tele-Savvy program for Latino Caregivers, the other an online
psychoeducation “bootcamp” program for individuals new to the caregiving role."

The human microbiome has a major role in the uptake and handling of nutrients, medications, and toxins; and is of great
immune system relevance. Evidence is mounting that it can affect aspects of neurologic function, brain activity, and
behavior via the ‘gut-brain-axis’. New propositions are that environmental exposures such as pesticides, metals, and
air pollution influence the microbiome and the human immune system and that the microbiome plays a role in
Parkinson’s disease (PD). Here we propose the novel hypothesis that a) the microbiome is affected by chronic
environmental exposures, specifically pesticides; and b) an altered gut microbiome composition or function contributes
to the progression of neurodegeneration in PD. PD - a progressive neurodegenerative disease – has various non-motor

The outcomes of elderly patients and relapsed/refractory patients with either acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remain poor. Venetoclax is a selective BCL-2 inhibitor that recently
demonstrated impressive activity when combined with hypomethylating agents decitabine or 5-azacitidine;
however, outcomes remained more modest among patients with unfavorable risk cytogenetics or with TP53
mutations. Building on recent findings that increasing the schedule of decitabine from days 1-5 to days 1-10 of
28 day cycles was associated with improved overall responses and survival among patients with unfavorable-
risk cytogenetics and TP53 mutations, we hypothesize that concomitant use of venetoclax and 10-day
decitabine will improve the response and survival rates, especially in patients with high-risk karyotypes or TP53
mutations. We designed a Phase II trial that will enroll four parallel, open-label cohorts, each with 40 patients
consisting of high-risk AML or MDS patients, either with advanced age or with relapsed/refractory disease. The
primary objective is to determine the composite overall response rate; secondary objectives include determining
disease-free and overall survival, and the impact of high-risk karyotypes on response and survival. In addition,
two molecular hypotheses will be tested. First, that clearance of exome-defined founding clone mutations from
the peripheral blood provides a consistent and quantified response end-point that circumvents many sources of
inter-patient response variability, and that combination venetoclax and decitabine will be associated with
increased rate and depth of mutation clearance vs. single-agent decitabine. Determining whether a
hypomethylating doublet has improved outcomes vs. single-agent has been challenging for all but large
randomized studies, partially due to clinical confounders such as hemodilute aspirates and poor count recovery
in older and heavily pre-treated patients. This novel approach to response determination isolates anti-leukemic
activity from other factors, thus improving statistical power of the study. Second, we will determine whether
responses to combination venetoclax and decitabine correlate with leukemic dependence on BCL-2 activity or
on other anti-apoptotic proteins. We will apply dynamic BH3 profiling to determine the dependence of AML blasts
on BCL-2, BCL-XL or MCL-1 and correlate these results with response, survival, and mutation patterns. Further,
we will apply CyTOF analysis to serial bone marrow samples obtained during therapy and at relapse. We will
quantify leukemia stem cell subpopulations and the expression of BCL-2 family proteins within bulk AML cells
vs. leukemia stem cells. These data will determine whether combination venetoclax and decitabine leads to
elimination of both bulk and leukemia stem cell populations, and whether sensitivity within subpopulations
corresponds with intracellular levels of BCL-2 family proteins. Collectively, these studies will evaluate clinical
responses and molecular outcomes of a novel combination therapy and will identify prognostic biomarkers and
resistance mechanisms."

neighborhoods, and communities that are impacted by external factors that influence initiation and
maintenance of behavior change. Our work is guided by the PRISM Framework to identify behavioral
interventions that have the greatest potential for broad public health impact. Our Center will support the design
and testing of principle-driven and mechanism-focused, potent and sustainable health promotion interventions
that have a strong promise of progressing through the NIH Stage Model. Our renewal Center retains its
current focus on designing interventions for older racial/ethnic minority adults and expands our focus to target
older adults at risk of AD/ADRD with a focus on behavioral interventions that address cognitive health. This
renewal application targets four thematic areas of focus: Develop and test principle driven interventions to
increase physical activity (PA) among older adults at risk of ADRD, Design interventions to maintain and/or
enhance cognitive function and mobility; harness technology to improve intervention scalability and fidelity;
and target mechanisms of behavior change to promote and sustain behavioral and lifestyle change. These
foci simultaneously will advance science in these areas and reflects areas of substantial expertise within
our Roybal Center.
Faculty serving on the Administrative and Behavioral Intervention Development (BID) Cores will constitute the
Center’s Executive Committee. These faculty have extensive expertise related to the thematic foci of the
center and are committed to assisting to fulfill the mission of the Center. These faculty have experience
conducting research across all stages of the Stage Model and will work to transition promising interventions
across the Stage Model as quickly as possible. The MPI’s will serve as the Administrative Core co-leads and
provide oversight to and work collaboratively with the BID Core co-leads. The BID Core will provide grant
funding for up to two trials per year, one solicited from all departments across UIC and other University of
Illinois campuses and one solicited externally via a National competition. The overall performance of the
Center will be guided by a distinguished External Advisory Committee that includes representatives from
diverse academic, provider, funder, consumer, and media stakeholder groups; including health care systems
and plans. Collectively our work is expected to substantially advance science in these critically important
areas of focus and provide currently unavailable information about the impact of behavioral change

Pelvic radiotherapy is the standard of care for numerous gynecological and anorectal cancers affecting
women. Post-operative intravaginal brachytherapy (IVRT) is used to prevent cancer recurrence at the vaginal
cuff for high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer patients. IVRT delivers conformal radiation dose to the
vagina cuff and canal. This results in high rates of acute and late vaginal toxicities, such as vaginal stenosis,
which is defined as the abnormal tightening and shortening of the vagina due to fibrosis. These effects can
lead to debilitating pain, sexual dysfunction, and poor quality of life. Current clinical assessments of vaginal
toxicity are subjective and based on clinician and patient reported grading scales that leads to variability. There
is a clinical need for objective measurements of vaginal tissue health, and we propose a multiparametric
ultrasound imaging approach for vaginal tissue characterization before and after IVRT. In this study, we will
develop a system and methodology for three-dimensional (3D) multiparametric imaging of the vaginal wall
using B-mode, ultrasensitive microvessel imaging (UMI), shear-wave elastography (SWE), and tissue
microstructure characterization with quantitative ultrasound (QUS). As a secondary objective, we will test the
system in a clinical study with fifteen endometrial cancer patients receiving IVRT to identify associations
between multiparametric ultrasound metrics and current clinical assessments of vaginal toxicity. This will be
the first study using a multimodal ultrasound approach for characterization of vaginal tissue. We hypothesize
that multiparametric ultrasound will be produce metrics that are sensitive to anatomical changes (B-mode),
microvascular damage (UMI), fibrosis stage (SWE), and tissue microstructure and cellular death (QUS). There
is increasing awareness of radiation-induced toxicities and considerable effort has gone into strategies to
reduce toxicities and improve overall quality of life and sexual functioning. Multiparametric ultrasound imaging
offers a non-subjective, quantitative approach for detecting and characterizing vaginal health, which is typically
overlooked with current medical imaging. Ultimately, this approach will lead to predictive imaging biomarkers
that clinicians can use as outcome metrics of novel treatment strategies and interventions aimed at preventing
and treating radiotherapy-induced vaginal toxicities. If successful, the research will introduce a safe, cost-
effective imaging platform to improve the health of women suffering from this chronic gynecological condition."
10874389,"This Veterans Affairs Career Development Award (CDA)-2 will provide support for academic career development
through mentored research and professional skills development in preparation for transition to an academic
research faculty position. Proposed activities will occur under the mentorship of Drs. Nicholas Gilpin, James
Zadina, Scott Edwards, and Tiffany Wills and will foster hypothesis-driven research and independent
investigation. Chronic pain affects >100 million American adults, costing the nation ~$635 billion every year in
medical treatment costs and lost productivity. Due to the high prevalence of chronic pain among Veterans,
treatment of chronic pain is a top priority of the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), with prescription opioids a
critical first-line treatment for chronic pain patients. However, Veterans treated chronically with opioids for their
chronic pain may be vulnerable to developing opioid addiction and/or using illicit opioids to self-medicate pain
symptoms. Chronic pain and opioid addiction each produce functional abnormalities in the nucleus accumbens
(NAc), including dopamine (DA) deficits, which may be attributable to reduced cell firing of ventral tegmental
area (VTA) DA neurons projecting to the NAc. The NAc mediates the acute rewarding effects of drugs of abuse
via the mesoaccumbens pathway (VTA to NAc) and represents a functional terminus for ascending nociceptive
pathways. However, there remains a gap in our knowledge regarding how chronic pain and limited/escalated
opioid use interact to alter NAc neuronal excitability, drug intake, and pain sensitivity. The purpose of this project
is to examine overlapping brain biochemical mechanisms of chronic pain and opioid dependence that may
contribute to the worsening and potential interdependence of these two disorders. Our central hypothesis is that
chronic pain induces mesolimbic dopaminergic signaling deficits that drive the development of prescription opioid
(i.e., fentanyl) abuse, and fentanyl intake exaggerates pain-like outcomes in rats with chronic inflammatory pain.
Here we propose that I) chronic inflammatory pain increases fentanyl intake, and that fentanyl intake exaggerates
hyperalgesia in rats with chronic inflammatory pain, II) chronic inflammatory pain and fentanyl intake each
increase the intrinsic excitability of NAc neurons and excitatory transmission onto NAc neurons, and III) VTA-
NAc DA circuit activation and/or D2-like receptor agonist treatment each reduce hyperalgesia and escalated
fentanyl intake in rats with chronic inflammatory pain. These hypotheses reflect the order of the aims in this CDA
proposal. To investigate these hypotheses, we propose an innovative experimental strategy that compares the
effects of chronic inflammatory pain states on the electrophysiological properties of NAc neurons and behavioral
deficits (fentanyl intake/motivation, nociception) in animals given long access (LgA; 12 hrs) to fentanyl and short
access (ShA; 1 hr) to fentanyl. Finally, we will use chemogenetics and targeted pharmacotherapies to test the
effects of VTA-NAc DA circuit activation and D2-like receptor agonism on fentanyl intake/motivation and
nociceptive measures in rats with chronic inflammatory pain. Conclusions resulting from these studies will have
an important impact within both the pain management and addiction fields, as well as provide potential
pharmacotherapeutic strategies for VA populations suffering from chronic pain and opioid addiction. In addition,
an important feature of this CDA proposal is its provision of training in critical skills necessary for the applicant
to attain her long-term goal of becoming an independent biomedical researcher and leader in the field of pain
and opioid addiction research. Career development milestones and trajectories will guide her progression to an
independent VA research career and include a transition to independence in terms of behavioral, surgical,
electrophysiological, pharmacological, and chemogenetic techniques as well as a critical focus on professional
skills development. In summary, this CDA award will greatly facilitate the applicant’s transition to an independent
VA research position to continue future investigations into the biobehavioral mechanisms of chronic pain and
opioid addiction."
10874496,"To understand the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli
(UPEC), it is critical to both follow up on our determination of the transcriptional program enacted by UPEC
during uncomplicated UTI in young women and to understand similarities and differences in host-pathogen
interactions in young versus postmenopausal patients. This allows insights from prior studies in young women
to be directly applied to the older population. We will model infection from initial colonization to development of
acute infection in the bladder to identify mechanisms that induce rapid growth of UPEC. In addition, there are no
studies defining the transcriptional program of UPEC strains that infect postmenopausal women, a critical high
impact cohort that commonly suffers from recurrent UTI (rUTI). Indeed, UTIs are responsible for 15.5% of
hospitalizations and 6.2% of deaths in women over 65 years old. It is vital to compare patterns of UPEC gene
expression between these two groups of patients who present with dramatically different bladder milieus. Our
long-term research goal is to understand how UPEC colonizes the human urinary tract, eludes the immune
response, and damages the host. The objective during this funding period is to follow up on our transcriptome
studies in uncomplicated UTIs, understanding how gene expression is deployed over time and assess the UPEC
transcriptome in postmenopausal women to monitor bacterial factors important for development of infection, Our
central hypothesis is that the end point of urinary tract infection is a consequence of sequential host-pathogen
interactions, wherein UPEC enacts a highly conserved regulatory program in response to its encounter with the
host. The rationale for the proposed work is that once we identify the transcriptional program of UPEC during
early stages of colonization, we can focus efforts on intervention and prevention directed toward these specific
targets. We will test our central hypothesis and complete our objectives by carrying out two specific aims:
 1) Determine the temporal gene expression program of UPEC in the urinary tract from initiation to
development of acute infection of the bladder using the mouse model of ascending UTI and elucidate the
molecular mechanism that induces rapid growth of UPEC in the urinary tract.
 2) Determine the transcriptomes and growth rates of UPEC during UTI in postmenopausal women.
Expected outcomes will be a temporal assessment of global UPEC gene expression during UTI and a measure
of UPEC gene expression in postmenopausal women. Expression of all UPEC genes will be followed over time
using UPEC strains isolated from young patients in the validated mouse UTI model. Metabolites that trigger rapid
growth rates will be identified in patients and mice. The positive impact of these studies will be to pave the way
to disease prevention by understanding the progression of gene expression over time during UTI and identifying
metabolites that accentuate infection in UTI. Understanding specific virulence factors and core genes expressed
by UPEC will allow development of specific therapeutics against novel targets."
10896380,"Abstract
Recently, NCI called for research to effectively study small or rare populations relevant to cancer research.
Sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are small populations at disproportionate risk for cancer but who have
been under-researched in cancer studies. The principal challenge common across lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender populations is to develop effective methods to identify and recruit patients and survivors who are
SGM into NCI cancer studies. Two technical advances have transformative potential to advance research on
health disparities in SGM cancer patients. First, online recruitment has yielded large SGM samples in other
areas of research (e.g., HIV primary prevention), but using online methods to recruit SGM cancer patients has
not been rigorously studied. Second, cancer clinics have begun to include sexual orientation and gender
identity (SOGI) data in the electronic medical record, but we need to test protocols on how to recruit SGM
cancer patients using this data source. This application is based upon our recent success in overcoming
challenges to recruit over 400 gay and bisexual prostate cancer patients into an R01 intervention trial of
tailored rehabilitation for this population. We will replicate and expand upon these clinic-based and online
methods to study how to recruit three small SGM populations – (1) sexual minority cisgender men, (2) sexual
minority cisgender women, and (3) transgender and gender non-binary cancer patients - into cancer research
studies. We have three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will document, in depth, SGM’s attitudes towards
participating in NIH cancer research, identifying the facilitators and barriers that each group reports influences
their willingness to participate. We will also investigate any impact poor cancer care and discrimination has on
research participation. We will investigate these in cisgender SM men, cisgender SM women and gender
minority cancer patients (n=15 per group) and compare experiences within these small populations and
between SGM and a cisgender, heterosexual patient comparison group. In Aim 2, we will test the
effectiveness, efficiency, cost, and workload in using two clinic SOGI-based strategies and three online
strategies to recruit SGM small populations (150 each) compared to recruiting a sample of cisgender,
heterosexual cancer patients. We predict size of the small population will negatively correlate with work, cost,
and time involved, but positively correlate with yield. In Aim 3, we will conduct an online quantitative survey of
willingness to participate in cancer research with 450 SGM cancer patients (150 per group) versus a cisgender
heterosexual group (150 men and 150 women). Key measures assess facilitators and barriers to participation
in NIH cancer research. To advance measures, we will assess performance of each group on five validated
cancer scales to compare cancer care experience, discrimination in treatment, and outcomes. Finally, we will
integrate and triangulate findings and assess intersectionality with race/ethnicity. This study will establish what
recruitment strategies are effective across SGM populations, and which may be specific to each subgroup."

educating students from diverse and underserved backgrounds. UIC is a national leader in providing education
to under-represented minorities as demonstrated by its status as a Minority Serving, Hispanic Serving, and Asian
American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving institution. We propose the Chicago ARea Excellence
in Education & Research (CAREER) program, designed to provide rigorous and balanced team-based training
in both teaching and research to a diverse group of postdoctoral fellows, with the goal of producing scholars who
are well-equipped to be leaders in academia at research- and teaching-intensive institutions alike. CAREER is
a partnership between UIC and Governors State University (GSU), the only public university in Chicago's south
suburban area and a school that boasts not only a diverse student body, but also a highly diverse faculty. With
the UIC CAREER program we will 1) recruit and retain a diverse cohort of IRACDA scholars and tailor training
for individual career goals/trajectories; 2) structure a research-intensive training experience that supports a
successful transition of scholars to faculty positions; and 3) design a collaborative curriculum with GSU to train
scholars in the core competencies required for excellence in teaching. By drawing upon strong institutional
support from the UI Cancer Center, CCTS, Teaching and Learning Center, and the Office of Diversity, our
program fills a natural void. Not only are there no IRACDA programs in Chicago or any other urban Midwestern
city, but UIC currently has no training programs that support and prepare postdoctoral fellows to be educators
and researchers within our diverse community. The CAREER program will bring together faculty from the UIC
Colleges of Pharmacy and Medicine into a collaborative partnership to support the research and career
development of fellows, while Governors State University will provide the support for developing teaching skills
at an undergraduate institution. The structure of the program will not only train postdoctoral fellows, but also help
to solidify a pipeline for GSU students to join graduate or professional programs at UIC. The relationship will also
foster collaboration between GSU and UIC faculty to encourage new research programs and to develop a culture
of educating a diverse community of scientists. The program will encourage postdoctoral fellows to participate
in state-of-the-art research programs in well-funded mentor labs from Pharmacy and Medicine focused on a wide
variety of research related to NIGMS goals. Fellows will engage in teaching and career development workshops
at both UIC and GSU. They will also develop professionally under the guidance of a mentoring team with
continued use of the IDP to ensure adequate progress in obtaining funding, publications, and networking.
Scholars will have the opportunity to teach in lab based courses, introductory lecture courses, and introduce new
pre-health course content missing from the GSU curriculum. Overall, the proposed CAREER program helps to
fulfill the mission of UIC by training educators for diverse populations as researchers, mentors, and teachers."
10896384,"Despite significant advances in the treatment of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFrEF), substantial residual morbidity and mortality continues to plague the contemporary treatment era. The
cardinal clinical feature of patients with HF is reduced exercise capacity, which is associated with substantially
reduced quality of life. Even with insights into diverse mechanisms of myocardial dysfunction, most current
medical treatment focuses on modulating the ""neurohormonal axis"", and orthogonal approaches are direly
needed. Recent preclinical and clinical data from our team and others demonstrate that exogenous delivery of
ketone therapy improves HF hemodynamics, suggesting potential ergogenic benefits. Our research has also
highlighted the contribution of skeletal muscle abnormalities to impaired exercise tolerance in HF, and limited
data suggest beneficial effects of ketones in reducing peripheral anaerobic carbohydrate metabolism in healthy
volunteers. We therefore seek to understand the potential benefits of therapeutic ketosis in patients with HFrEF
by performing deep phenotyping of myocardial, peripheral musculature, and metabolic contributions. Aim 1 will
determine the acute effects of exogenous ketone ester administration on functional capacity and investigate
potential myocardial and vascular mechanisms of benefit in a crossover, placebo-controlled trial. Aim 2 will
compare whether ketone ester therapy alters systemic carbohydrate metabolism through targeted
metabolomics, stable isotope infusions, and exercise measures of gas exchange. Aim 3 will investigate the
effects of ketone therapy on peripheral intramuscular lactate production and perfusion using state-of-the-art
magnetic resonance imaging protocols. Such studies will leverage the rich translational research environment
at the University of Pennsylvania, including the Center for Human Phenomic Sciences, a Clinical and
Translational Research Award (CTSA) initiative, and the Center for Magnetic Resonance and Optical Imaging.
If beneficial, our results would add to the burgeoning literature, demonstrating the importance of targeting the
""ketone metabolic axis"" as a treatment strategy to help improve exercise capacity and quality of life, and would
inspire larger, randomized trials of ketone therapy. Dr. Selvaraj, an early career investigator and a fellow in
advanced heart failure, has a long-term goal of becoming an independently funded cardiovascular researcher
with a focus on cardiovascular metabolic interventions in HF and using deep phenotyping techniques to define
pathways of benefit. Thsese research aims are part of a comprehensive training plan and will be supervised by
a mentorship team spanning the basic science, translational, and clinic spectrum with rich experience in
cardiovascular metabolism in HF, metabolomic profiling, deep phenotyping during early stage studies of HF
therapeutics, and molecular metabolic imaging. This diverse and collaborative team will guide Dr. Selvaraj's
transition to an independently funded research career with extension of findings to low output HF syndromes."

Overall
The Center for AIDS Research (CFAR) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) catalyzes new and
nurtures ongoing HIV research – across domains of basic, behavioral, clinical, implementation, and community
science – in partnership with the communities we serve. As a nexus for HIV research since inception in 1988,
the CFAR now provides support in the form of 18 research services, pilot funding, investigator development, and
foundational relationships with community partners. Under new leadership since July 2022, we have carried out
a robust, forward-looking strategic planning process yielding a structure with 5 Cores (4 continuing/refreshed:
Administrative, Developmental, Clinical, Advanced Technology; 1 new: Implementation & Community Sciences)
and 2 new Scientific Working Groups (Substance Use and Global Health Reciprocal Innovation). Changes align
with current priorities for HIV research and will facilitate advances in implementation and community sciences
while sustaining excellence in basic and clinical research.
Our CFAR shared values are to center and grow diversity, equity, inclusion, and access and to be in authentic
partnership with communities most impacted by HIV. The center includes >165 active HIV investigators,
partnerships with 13 community based organizations and 4 academic institutions, and leadership that
purposefully incorporates diverse mid- and senior-level investigators. In 2022, the center’s HIV federal research
base (FRB) was $23 million, and the university received $66 million in total HIV funding. The FRB includes 79
grants (up 30 from the last renewal application). Our return on investment from pilot grants is now $17:1 (up $4)
and the center participated in recruiting 41 HIV investigators (21 new to UAB, 20 from UAB new to HIV research,
27 women, 7 underrepresented minorities) in the current funding cycle.
Over the next 5 years, we will leverage our Cores and SWGs to: 1) provide robust services to the HIV research
community that add value to cutting edge science, including through technologies, data science, and
methodologic expertise; 2) catalyze innovation and develop integrated networks of researchers and funded
research focused on HIV and a) substance use and b) global health reciprocal innovation; 3) develop and
nurture a diverse next generation of HIV researchers, including those across a wide spectrum of lived
experience and career paths; and 4) sustain and strengthen authentic bi-directional relationships between
CFAR investigators and communities most impacted by HIV.
Through our structure, relationships with community, public health, and academic partners, and institutional
support, the UAB CFAR is positioned to support high-impact discoveries towards the achievement of HIV
research priorities and curbing the epidemic in Alabama, the Deep South, and globally."

Developmental Core (Core B)
The mission of the Developmental Core (Dev Core) of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) CFAR is
to develop early-stage investigators (ESI) in HIV research and support mid- and senior career investigators who
are new to HIV (NHI). Over the past 35 years of the CFAR, we have successfully carried out this mission in
alignment with the changing landscape of HIV research. Early in CFAR history, the Dev Core focused on
supporting ESI/NHI developing a career in basic science at a time when little was understood about HIV
pathogenesis. With the discovery of successful antiretroviral therapies, we have been expanding our support of
ESI/NHI to include ESI/NHI whose research focused on treatment optimization. Most recently our core has
adapted again in response to new NIH priority research areas by supporting a cohort of investigators who
conduct implementation science and community engaged research. Thus, at the moment, we fully support all
investigators across the breadth of research from bench to bedside to community. Our success during the past
10 years is exemplified by our investment of $555K in pilot awards for 23 ESI, with 11 of them having obtained
extramural funding totaling $9.5M, yielding a 17-fold increase in returns. With a concerted effort on increasing
investigator diversity, the number of women and underrepresented minorities supported by NIH training grants
has increased 38% over the past 10 years.
In the next funding cycle, we will thrive while carrying out our mission through 3 specific aims:
1) We will provide supported research funding opportunities through pilot awards to a diverse cadre of ESI and
 NHI conducting research spanning the bench to bedside to community, and position investigators to
 successfully apply for extramural funding and formulate their independent research portfolios.
2) We will provide individualized mentorship to ESI and NHI to optimize their acquisition of research skills,
 professional development, and foster their transition to independent HIV scientists.
3) We will support professional development and networking activities, leveraging the CFAR Cores and SWGs
 and the larger UAB research and training community, to support ESI and NHI to build collaborative teams
 and innovate with a diverse assembly of investigators, community partners, and research networks.
Overall, the Dev Core has been extremely successful in supporting HIV-focused ESI and fostering a nurturing
research environment since its inception, especially in the current funding cycle. Combined with continued
successful recruitment of established investigators and ESI, the Dev Core is poised to continue its legacy of
providing foundational support to HIV researchers as they launch their careers and establish themselves as

Advanced Technology Core (Core H)
The technological advancements of the last two decades in the area of biomedical research for HIV have been
nothing short of breathtaking and are propelling the next generation of new insights into cellular and systemwide
functionalities at an ever-increasing speed. Access to these technologies is key for cutting-edge research
programs, however, no single laboratory can cover the breadth of the high-end research tools that are now
available and provide complete expertise. The mission of the University of Alabama (UAB) Center for AIDS
Research (CFAR) Advanced Technology Core (ATC) is to maximize the benefits of novel key technologies for
HIV researchers by providing the necessary instrumentation and services within a centralized facility that is
capable of handling potentially infectious material.
We have used the last two CFAR funding periods to expand the high-tech service portfolio of the core from a
flow cytometry centered operation to one that also offers access to transcriptomic and phospho-proteomic
services. The ATC now offers access to and institution-wide services for a total of 6 high-end cell sorters and 5
analytical flow cytometers as well as an ImageStream. The ATC further offers scRNA-seq analysis and spatial
transcriptomic services. To facilitate comprehensive services for users, the ATC also provides sample
preparation services, phospho-proteomic analysis, and task-specific bioinformatics pipelines. The continuing
critical impact of the core is demonstrated by its productivity. In the current funding cycle, the ATC services
supported HIV researchers to publish >54 papers and be awarded 22 HIV-related grants, a strong achievement
for a Tier 1 CFAR Core. As a result of the ATC being consolidated with the UAB Comprehensive Flow Cytometry
and Single Cell Analysis Core, the consolidated core provided services to a total of 266 NIH grants and 341
Principal Investigators. The synergies arising from this large institutional userbase demonstrate the ability of the
ATC to provide a research and service infrastructure exceeding that of a core that exclusively serves HIV
researchers. In the next funding cycle, the aims of the ATC are:
 1. To provide access to state-of-the-art flow cytometric analysis capabilities and services
 2. To provide access to high-data content generating transcriptomic and proteomic methods
 3. To conduct training, mentoring, and outreach
 4. To provide an internal and external data sharing infrastructure
Through these aims, the ATC will continue to fulfill its mission to provide access to high-end technologies and
quality services in support of innovative research and to be a research incubator facilitating collaborations
between non-HIV and HIV researchers and contributing to the development of a pipeline of new HIV researchers."
10899023,"Project Summary/Abstract. Deracemization reactions are a rare but powerful means of obtaining enantioenriched material
from racemic or scalemic mixtures. The limited number of known deracemization methods are primarily due to challenges
that arise from thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. The conversion of a racemic mixture to an enantiopure one causes
a loss in entropy and is endergonic. Moreover, because enantiomers have identical potential energies, the barriers for
enantiomer interconversion in a thermal reaction are equal for both the forward and reverse steps, which is a consequence
of microscopic reversibility. Thus, the formation of enantioenriched material from a racemate is both thermodynamically
unfavorable and kinetically difficult. However, a light-driven deracemization protocol can surmount these challenges. The
input of light overcomes the endergonic penalty of this transformation, and as photochemical reactions traverse multiple
potential energy surfaces, the forward and reverse reactions of a light-driven deracemization can be judiciously engineered
to have unequal kinetic barriers to circumvent microscopic reversibility.
 Herein, we describe a photocatalytic strategy to deracemize organic compounds containing benzylic moieties
commonly found in pharmaceuticals and studies on its mechanism. This reaction deracemizes α-aryl carbonyl compounds
and involves a photocatalytic stereoablation process to generate an achiral intermediate that undergoes asymmetric
protonation by a proton transfer catalyst. This proposed pathway involves oxidation of the aromatic substrate to the aryl
radical cation by the excited state of the photocatalyst. The benzylic C–H bonds of the aryl radical cation are significantly
acidified and engage in proton transfer with a chiral base co-catalyst to furnish an α-carbonyl, benzylic radical. This open-
shell species undergoes reduction to the corresponding enolate by the reduced state of the photocatalyst, and the enolate
reacts with the conjugate acid of the chiral base co-catalyst to preferentially generate one enantiomer of product. Continued
iterations of these steps through catalysis leads to enantioenrichment, and we demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal
by describing a preliminary substrate scope. The degree of enantioenrichment (up to 97:3 er) and mass balance (≥90%) is
high. We also provide preliminary mechanistic data on this system, and this investigation is ongoing. We have found that
the rate of deprotonation of the radical cation intermediate and the rate of back electron transfer (BET) from the oxidized
substrate to the reduced photocatalyst affect the overall degree of enantioenrichment obtained, and we provide a rationale
for this behavior. Should ongoing studies support our hypotheses, this study will demonstrate how the ground state reduction
potential of a catalyst, which governs the rate of BET, and the concentration of a chiral proton transfer catalyst modulate
the degree of enantioenrichment in a deracemization reaction. Furthermore, this mechanistic study has the potential to act
as a framework for improving deracemization reactions that proceed with low enantioenrichment by straightforward
modification of reaction conditions. We anticipate that these studies will be valuable to the development and understanding
of light-enabled deracemization reactions, which are exceedingly limited, and will elevate deracemization reactions as
promising alternatives to traditional asymmetric methods."

Sleep has often been considered a behavior in which a subset of neurons dictates to peripheral tissues in a
top-down fashion. Recent work has demonstrated that this is a gross oversimplification in that bottom-up
signals from fat cells, muscle, and glia can affect sleep-promoting neuron function as well. Communication
between sleep-promoting circuitry and metabolic tissues is especially important in that it gives sleep-promoting
circuits information about the organism’s global energy state. Lapses in this communication, underly sleep
disturbances and increase an organism’s likelihood of developing metabolic disorders such as obesity and
insulin resistance. Our findings in the C. elegans model organism that meets all the behavioral hallmarks of
sleep and utilizes similar genetic pathways to regulate sleep and fat metabolism, suggest that salt-inducible
kinases (SIKs) connect sleep and metabolic regulation. Loss of the SIK3 homolog in C. elegans called KIN-29
in 12 pairs of glutamatergic neurons result in sleepless and adipose animals. Inducing fat breakdown in kin-29
mutants restored the sleep and fat store changes in these mutant animals. Moreover, inhibition of
mitochondrial beta-oxidation of fatty acids, which reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, reduced
sleep. The goal of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that kin-29/SIK3 signaling utilizes ROS accumulation
from fat breakdown as a sleep pressure signal in the metabolic regulation of sleep. Consistent with this
hypothesis, kin-29 mutant animals have low baseline levels of ROS. Moreover, preliminary global proteomic
analyses show that several antioxidant proteins such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) proteins are upregulated
in kin-29 mutants, while mutants that remove mitochondrial SOD-2/3 function that are unable to detoxify ROS
enhance sleep. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that ROS from fat breakdown restores the low ROS levels of kin-
29 and hence its sleep phenotype. I will test the dynamics of ROS during sleep and wake in kin-29 mutants as
well as in sleep-deprived wild-type worms, and test whether genetically inducing fat breakdown in the adipose
and sleepless kin-29 mutant will restore the reduced ROS phenotype of kin-29 mutants. Aim 2 will test the
hypothesis that mitochondrial ROS production restores sleep in kin-29 mutants and requires the sleep-
promoting neurons in C. elegans. To do so, I will use in vivo optogenetic ROS-generation tools combined with
genetic sleep-defective mutants. Collectively, the proposed work will elucidate the mechanisms by which global
energy state is communicated to sleep circuits. Findings from this work will also guide future therapeutic
approaches in disorders of sleep regulation that frequently occur in individuals with disorders of metabolism."
10899098,"Following injury, tendon heals via a fibrotic scar-mediated process. This fibrotic response impairs restoration of
tendon structure and function, and there are currently no pharmacological approaches in standard use to
enhance the healing process. While the overall cell environment during healing is dynamic and complex,
myofibroblasts are key regulators of the healing process. During tendon healing, tenocytes undergo
progressive activation and differentiation in to myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts synthesize, contract and remodel
the new extracellular matrix that is required for restoring tissue integrity. However, resolution of physiological
healing requires clearance of myofibroblasts, either via apoptosis or reversion to a basal fibroblast/tenocyte
state. Tissue fibrosis, including fibrotic tendon healing results from myofibroblast persistence. Indeed, we have
previously shown that tendon scar tissue from both mouse and humans is enriched for myofibroblasts that take
on an anti-apoptotic profile. As such, understanding the mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic approaches
to modulate myofibroblast dynamics during healing would fill critical knowledge gaps. We and others have
recently demonstrated that expression of the proton-sensing G-protein coupled receptor Gpr68/Ogr1 is
decreased during tissue fibrosis. Moreover, small molecule activation of Gpr68 can modulate both
myofibroblast differentiation and reversion of lung fibroblasts. Thus, in this high-risk high-reward proposal we
will define the efficacy of pharmacological activation of Gpr68 to modulate tenocyte-myofibroblast dynamics
during fibrotic tendon healing. In addition, our preliminary data suggest that changes in macrophage-specific
Gpr68 expression during healing underpin several aspects of myofibroblast function. The on-going interaction
between macrophages and myofibroblast is an important regulator of both physiological and fibrotic wound
healing. Therefore, we will dissect the cell-type specifics functions of Gpr68 in modulating tendon healing, and
in responding to small molecule activation of Gpr68. Successful completion of these studies will provide
important fundamental information related to regulation of the cell environment during tendon healing, and will
establish a novel pharmacological approach to enhance the tendon healing process."
10884794,"Neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD, autism, and learning disabilities are rising globally. In the US, 1
in 6 children suffer from some form of developmental disability. One potentially important factor in their increase
is exposure to chemicals of unknown toxicity in the environment. While there are over 350,000 chemicals in
commercial use and around 13,000 produced in large amounts, only a small percentage have known
toxicological data. Current testing methods for developmental neurotoxicology (DNT) are mostly based on
observing behavioral, physiological, and anatomical defects in small mammals. These studies are prohibitively
time-consuming and expensive for testing the huge backlog of commercial chemicals, and may produce hard-
to-interpret results due to the complexity of observed endpoints and differences between multiple laboratories.
Additionally, many jurisdictions are limiting the numbers of animals that can be used for testing. New approach
methodologies (NAMs) are a new paradigm in toxicology testing that bring together alternative approaches such
as in silico predictions, cell culture, and microphysiological systems-based assays, plus alternative model
animals such as zebrafish, drosophila, and C. elegans. While in silico and in vitro methods can provide high
throughput testing at much lower costs than mammalian studies with easier to interpret and predictive results, in
vitro methods still have substantial costs and complex culturing conditions and neither approach can recapitulate
the effects of a substance on a complete developing organism. C. elegans is an ideal alternative animal model
for DNT testing. It has a complete nervous system with a fully characterized connectome and neuronal lineages,
most of the same important neurotransmitter systems as humans, is fast and easy to grow to maturity in large
numbers, and is amenable to targeted genetic manipulation. We propose to use C. elegans in a comprehensive
DNT test battery where we will track neuronal, synaptic, and behavioral changes as the organism develops from
late larval to adult stage after early exposure to DNT toxicants. In Aim 1, we will develop novel reporter strains
with fluorescent markers for GABAergic and dopaminergic neurons and synapses, expose them to reference
chemicals, and monitor the behavior of growing animals in culture before imaging them on our high-content
microfluidic imaging platform at L4 and D1 stages. Specific behavioral endpoints will be analyzed by ML-based
approaches from the behavioral videos. The high-resolution whole-body 3D images from on-chip imaging will be
analyzed by semi-automated methods for key DNT indicators such as neuronal loss and mislocalization,
membrane blebbing, and defective or missing synapses. All these endpoints will be combined to find the dose
of a chemical at which the point of departure from the control occurs. In Aim 2, we plan to investigate potential
modes of action using expression analysis of developmental and stress genes. We will test a representative
subset of chemicals from the DNT-DIVERS library to establish confidence in our model and lay the foundations
for a fully automated low-cost, high-throughput DNT testing method to assess the risks of common chemicals."
10886493,"Project Summary/Abstract
Aphasia is one of the most common and debilitating consequences of stroke. Aphasia is caused by damage to
language regions of the brain, which are usually localized to the left hemisphere. Fortunately, most individuals
with aphasia after a stroke experience some degree of recovery of language function over time. The pace of
recovery is greatest in the first weeks and months, but clinically meaningful gains in language function are
possible even years after stroke. Recovery from aphasia is thought to depend on neural plasticity, that is,
functional reorganization of surviving brain regions such that they take on new or expanded roles in language
processing. However, despite much research, the mechanisms that underlie this process of functional
reorganization remain poorly understood. The overall goals of this project are to better characterize the neural
correlates of recovery from aphasia after stroke, and to determine which patterns of functional reorganization
are associated with more or less favorable language outcomes. To address major limitations of prior studies,
we will use a range of innovative approaches. Adaptive language mapping paradigms will be used to identify
language regions in a reliable and valid manner, while minimizing performance confounds. We will recruit large
numbers of patients at two established sites, enabling rigorous statistical approaches such as linear mixed
models and permutation testing. Advanced machine learning algorithms will allow us to disentangle complex
relationships between structural damage, neurofunctional changes, and language outcomes. We will study two
complementary cohorts of patients—acute and chronic—longitudinally using the same multimodal functional
and structural MRI protocol, and the same language evaluations. In the acute cohort, we will investigate the
dynamics of early recovery and functional reorganization, while in the chronic cohort, we will identify
relationships between patterns of reorganization and language outcomes in a larger sample, and track the
neural correlates of recovery in the chronic phase. Our first specific aim is to build predictive models of the
trajectory of evolving aphasia profiles based on structural neuroimaging, including lesion location and extent,
as well as multiple measures of the integrity of surviving tissue, and other clinical variables. Our second
specific aim is to characterize the brain regions recruited for language processing in people with aphasia, and
to identify patterns that are associated with more or less favorable outcomes. Critically, the key analyses will
use the predictive models from Aim 1 to determine which patterns of functional reorganization result in better or
worse outcomes relative to what would be expected on the basis of structural and clinical factors alone. Our
third aim is to identify changes in functional activity associated with gains in language function over time, again
in the context of the predictive models developed in Aim 1. A better understanding of the biological
mechanisms that underlie recovery from aphasia will contribute to the development of neuromodulatory and
therapeutic interventions, and will improve the clinical management of individuals with aphasia."
10885519,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of this career development award is to support Dr. Whitney Barnett in developing an independent
research program focused on public health interventions to prevent child maltreatment (CM). Given the
significant impact of CM on both short and long-term health, it is critical to intervene to prevent and reduce CM.
 Parent-focused educational interventions have been shown to be effective at preventing and reducing CM.
However, there are limitations to existing parenting programs. Specifically, 1) they often rely on trained
professionals for delivery, requiring significant cost to implement; 2) few are rigorously tested for implementation
success, though this is critical to achieve training goals; and 3) few directly address CM by providing parents
with strategies to reduce their child’s risk of abuse from other adults or with skills to reduce risk of perpetrating
abuse (e.g., managing difficult child behavior). This project aims to adapt an online intervention for use with
parents to equip them with knowledge of what constitutes CM, strategies to mitigate their child’s risk of
maltreatment by other adults, and skills to manage difficult child behavior, to ultimately prevent CM. The current
project will: 1) use a mixed methods approach to determine needs and preferences of parents of children enrolled
in Head Start (n=30) to inform intervention content and design; 2) adapt existing content and utilize novel
approaches from an evidence-based training for early childcare professionals (iLookOut) and pilot (n=15) the
adapted intervention to test functionality and user satisfaction; and 3) implement this intervention (n=100) to test
the preliminary efficacy and implementation (acceptability and appropriateness) of the intervention.
 This research plan forms the basis of a 5-year career development plan for Dr. Barnett under the mentorship
of Dr. Benjamin Levi (web-based interventions addressing CM), Dr. Kathryn Humphreys (CM, parenting behavior
interventions), Dr. Mary Louise Hemmeter (interventions addressing difficult child behavior), Dr. Carolyn Audet
(implementation science), and Dr. Van Scoy (mixed methods research). This interdisciplinary team has
developed a career development program for Dr. Barnett that includes: 1) advanced training in mixed methods
research design and analysis to inform intervention adaptation and refinement; 2) cultivating expertise in
modifiable determinants of parenting behavior and evidence-based parenting interventions; 3) acquiring
theoretical and methodological skills to design acceptable and effective interventions; 3) user-centered design
approaches to engage end-users in intervention development to ensure it meets their needs; 4) applying robust
implementation science frameworks (i.e., RE-AIM QuEST) to evaluate interventions to optimize success; and 5)
professional development activities e.g., presenting results at scientific meetings, publishing in peer-reviewed
journals, and submitting an R01. Completion of this career development plan would allow Dr. Barnett to
successfully compete for future funding to develop public health interventions to prevent and reduce CM."
10885520,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Dr. Christine Call, PI of the proposed K23, is a clinical psychologist with a long-term career goal of leading a
program of research focused on promoting health equity during high-risk times for problematic eating, excess
weight gain, and obesity, such as pregnancy and postpartum (i.e., the perinatal period). To facilitate this goal,
Dr. Call’s training aims are to: (1) Develop expertise in the conceptualization and longitudinal assessment of
psychosocial and behavioral factors influencing perinatal weight, including perinatal eating, appetite, mood,
and social determinants of health (SDoH); (2) Gain hands-on experience conducting community-partnered
health equity research; and (3) Attain skills to conduct and analyze ecological momentary assessment (EMA)
studies and model longitudinal data. Training will be guided by expert mentors, including primary mentor Dr.
Michele Levine, an expert in perinatal obesity, and co-mentor Dr. Sarah Pedersen, an expert in community-
engaged health equity research and EMA. The proposed training will enable Dr. Call to conduct an innovative
study to identify psychosocial and behavioral pathways through which food insecurity predicts higher
gestational weight gain (GWG) and postpartum weight retention (PPWR). Food insecurity is a multidimensional
construct encompassing disruptions in access to food quantity and quality, psychological wellbeing, and social
acceptability related to food acquisition. Although food insecurity predicts excess GWG/PPWR, pathways
underlying the relation of food insecurity to GWG/PPWR are poorly understood. Appetitive drives, psychosocial
distress, and disinhibited eating are associated with food insecurity in non-pregnant populations. Accordingly,
using community-engaged methods, Dr. Call will enroll pregnant people at risk for food insecurity (N=100;
>50% with racial or ethnic minoritized identities) in early pregnancy and assess relationships among food
insecurity, appetitive drives, psychosocial distress, disinhibited eating, and weight in each trimester of
pregnancy and at 3-months postpartum. A subset of participants (N=50) will complete a 10-day EMA at each
timepoint to identify momentary relationships. SDoH that co-occur with food insecurity, such as discrimination,
will be assessed. In Aim 1, prospective relationships among food insecurity, appetitive drives, psychosocial
distress, disinhibited eating, and weight will be examined across pregnancy and 3-months postpartum. In Aim
2, these relationships will be tested at a daily level using EMA. Exploratory Aim 3 will examine (a) if the
dimensions of food insecurity (quantity, quality, psychological acceptability, social acceptability) differentially
predict outcomes, and (b) if relationships between food insecurity and outcomes differ by other SDoH related
to perinatal weight. Findings will provide critical data on the relationship of food insecurity to GWG/PPWR and
inform future structural and individual level interventions to improve weight outcomes among pregnant
individuals with food insecurity. These aims align with NIDDK’s mission and scientific priorities and will support
a sustainable line of research designed to promote perinatal health equity and decrease obesity risk."
10887539,"Project Summary
T cell mediated graft rejection remains a critical barrier to long-term graft health and survival. Post-transplant
complement-induced priming of T cells and the transfer of donor major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) to
recipient dendritic cells (DCs) by graft-released exosomes (commonly referred to as “cross dressing”) are both
mechanistically involved in the generation of anti-donor cellular immunity. Our preliminary data newly implicate
mannose binding lectin (MBL) pathway-dependent complement activation as necessary mediator for
complement opsonization of exosomes and exosome-mediated donor MHC delivery to recipient DCs.
Together with our prior observation that recipient MBL pathway complement activation is required for
generation of robust anti-donor T cell responses and costimulatory-blockade resistant graft rejection, these
data lead to our central hypothesis that post transplant MBL pathway-initiated complement activation deposits
complement opsonins on exosomes, which bind to recipient DCs via complement receptors, and that this
process optimizes DC “cross dressing” to permit semi-direct pathway anti-donor T cell immunity and ultimately
allograft rejection. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims. In aim 1 we will study the mechanisms
required for complement activation on exosomes, characterize the effect of complement opsonins on exosome
binding to recipient DCs, and test the role of DC-expressed complement receptors in our model. In aim 2 we
will test for links between complement-mediated DC “cross dressing” and post-transplant anti-donor T cell
immunity and transplant outcomes. The findings will be significant because a) they will provide fundamental
insights into the biology of exosome function, b) provide mechanistic links between exosomes, complement,
and adaptive T cell immunity, and c) potentially identify novel treatment strategies and therapeutic targets to
improve transplant outcomes. Our proposal is conceptually innovative and tests a novel paradigm linking
exosome function and complement activation that may have broad implications beyond the field of
transplantation."
10887541,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Angiogenesis is the process of blood vessel formation in which proliferating endothelial cells (ECs) sprout from
preexisting vessels to extend a vascular network. Either impaired or excessive angiogenesis is associated with
the pathogenesis of human retina diseases such as retinal hypovascular familial exudative vitreoretinopathy and
hypervascular diabetic retinopathy. EC primarily uses the glycolysis pathway which is further enhanced during
angiogenesis. Recent studies suggest that mitochondrial activity is critical for angiogenesis, but its mechanism
is not entirely clear. We have investigated the angiogenic functions of three mitochondrial proteins with distinct
activities - mitochondrial transcriptional factor (TFAM), respiratory complex IV component (COX10) and a
mitochondrial redox protein thioredoxin 2 (TRX2). Our data show that: 1) silencing of Tfam, Cox10, or Trx2 in an
in vitro 3D sprouting assay attenuates EC sprouting, which correlated with reduced EC proliferation, but not with
ROS generation or EC apoptosis; 2) mice with an inducible deletion of Tfam, Cox10, or Trx2 exhibit retarded
retinal vessel growth without penetration into the deep plexi at early ages (P5–P12), and this attenuated retinal
sprouting was not correlated with mtROS production; 3) the three mutant mice develop arteriovenous
malformations (AVM) with enhanced arterialization and microaneurysm formation in the microvessels at
advanced ages (P12–P30). The hypovasculature and microaneurysm phenotypes resemble that of aged human
retinas and human retinal vascular abnormalities such as Coats' disease, Leber's military aneurysms and familial
exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR); 4) Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq analyses of retinal ECs suggest that
the three mutant mice have common EC clusters with reduced gene expression in angiogenic and metabolic
pathways but increased TGFR signaling. Based on these data, we hypothesize that mitochondrial activity
regulates common angiogenic and metabolic pathways (rather than ROS/apoptosis) in vascular growth and
maturation. We propose the following specific aims: 1) To identify critical angiogenic and metabolic pathways
in mitochondrial dysfunction-induced defects in retinal sprouting angiogenesis, AVM and microaneurysm
formation as well as in retinal function; 2) To define how mitochondrial dysfunction regulates TGFR-Smad2/3
signaling; 3) To determine the role of the TGFR-Smad2/3 signaling in mitochondrial dysfunction-induced
vascular retardation and malformation by pharmacological blockade and genetic deficiency. Our proposed study
will define the mechanism by which mitochondrial activities regulate normal retinal vascular growth and
maturation, and will provide a novel model and therapeutic intervention for human retinal vascular diseases
associated with many pathological complications such as diabetes, hypertension and aging that can result in
vision loss.

HBV and HCV infections are among the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. In the United States,
it is estimated that over 850 thousand people are currently infected with HBV and more than 2.4 million for HCV.
Despite the availability of highly effective HBV vaccine and HCV treatment, the mortality and the burden
associated with HBV and HCV are nevertheless increasing as individuals with existing infections advance into
more advanced stages including fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC. Moreover, HCV-infected patients, even though
cured of viremia, remain at a significantly elevated risk for advanced liver diseases. Due to their shared modes
of transmission and epidemiological features, HBV and HCV frequently coexist in patients in endemic areas or
among subjects at high risk of infection. Coinfection is usually more complex than monoinfection, leading to an
accelerated disease progression and complicated viral interaction for their treatment.
 Despite the severity of HBV and HCV infections, the mechanisms by which they lead to liver disease, of
how coinfection causes an increased severity and risk for complications, and of how HBV and HCV interact in
the liver of coinfected patients that may lead to reactivation of HBV upon the cure of HCV remains largely unclear.
This stems, in part, from the lack of relevant human models that recapitulate key disease phenotypes and permit
detailed mechanistic studies that could answer these questions.
 The primary research goal of this proposal is to establish a novel, high fidelity multicellular in vitro liver
model to address the aforementioned gaps. In this system, we plan to coculture human pluripotent stem cells
(hPSCs)-derived hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Unlike existing
traditional cell culture models, we propose to create an innovative three dimensional platform that mimics the
liver’s multicellularity and microenvironment, by culturing these four cell types in a configuration that resembles
the liver’s in vivo spatial organization, its hemodynamics, and its cell-cell interaction. To distinguish cell type-
specific responses, we will develop methods to purify individual cell types for downstream analysis.
 With this multicellular culture platform, we will pursue our long-range objectives, across which we capitalize
on the unique features of this novel platform to address questions that cannot be adequately answered with any
existing in vitro human-relevant system. These include the mechanisms of continued disease progression
following the cure of HCV infection, an accelerated disease progression with HBV/HCV coinfection, and the
interaction between HBV/HCV that leads to HBV reactivation following the cure of HCV infection (Aim 1). In Aim
2, we will combine hPSCs with gene editing to understand how genetic variants affect the course of disease and
treatment following HBV and HCV infection. These studies will not only provide new insights that could inform
development of effective diagnostics and treatments for HBV/HCV infection, but also lead to technology advance
that open up new avenues for future studies focusing on other liver diseases."
10887578,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Early conductive hearing loss (eCHL) in children, arising from chronic ear infections, can induce long-lasting
problems in auditory perception and language processing. When raised with environmental challenges, such
as disrupted attachment and low socio-economic status, these children are at greater risk for long-term
language deficits. One explanation is that early-life stress (ELS) and eCHL in conjunction could interact in the
nervous system to produce compounded deficits in auditory perception. While ELS has well-known effects on
higher neural regions involved in attention and learning, our evidence suggests a novel auditory effect for ELS:
altering sound-evoked responses in the auditory cortex (ACx). This would degrade the fidelity of sensory
representations available to higher regions affected by ELS, and could contribute to known cognitive problems
with ELS. Such sensory degradation would compound the auditory perceptual issues arising from eCHL.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that ELS causes deficits in auditory perception, and worsens eCHL-
induced deficits, by altering sensory representations in the central auditory system. We will measure effects of
ELS on auditory perception and ACx sensitivity, and will determine whether altered inhibition in the auditory
system contributes to measured deficits. Amplitude modulations (AM) in sounds will be used to determine
perceptual and neural auditory sensitivity, because AMs are intrinsic to speech and animal vocalizations, and
their accurate perception involves ACx. In Aim 1, we test whether ELS impairs auditory perception and
compounds impairments from eCHL. Animals will be trained to detect AM sounds with varying parameters
(modulation rate and depth). This will characterize the nature of the deficits by identifying AM parameters that
are challenging for animals to detect when raised with ELS, eCHL, or both. In Aim 2, we test whether
perceptual deficits arising from ELS and ELS+eCHL involve impaired sensory encoding in ACx. Neural
responses while animals listen passively to AM sounds will indicate altered sensory representations. Task
performance is known to increase ACx sensitivity by engaging additional non-sensory areas, including
cognitive regions known to be altered by ELS. We will determine whether ELS impairs non-sensory
contributions to auditory processing, by comparing ACx responses while animals are learning and performing
the task versus listening passively to the same sounds. In Aim 3, we will determine if ELS and ELS+eCHL alter
inhibition in ACx and other subcortical auditory regions, and whether inhibitory rescue improves ACx function
and perception. This will identify mechanistic changes underlying ELS-eCHL effects. Together, these
experiments will reveal the extent to which early-life stress impairs auditory processing via changing sensory
and non-sensory regions. This will broaden our understanding of experiences that interact with hearing loss,
and provide a focus for future experiments to determine in greater detail the mechanisms by which ELS may
alter auditory function."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Plastic pollution and the breakdown of plastic materials primarily into micron-sized microplastic particles (MP)
have contaminated our food and water sources, raising public health concerns. MP ingestion by humans is
now an inevitable consequence of global plastic pollution and there is a critical gap in knowledge as to how MP
impact human health (WHO). There is also an important gap in knowledge regarding how MP affect the major
direct organ of contact, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The studies proposed in this grant application seek to
bridge this gap in environmental health knowledge and provide insight into how MP pose a significant health
risk to the general population as well as susceptible (i.e. Inflammatory Bowel Disease; IBD) individuals. Our
preliminary data provides evidence chronic MP exposure affects the GI tract specifically causing gut dysbiosis,
low-level intestinal inflammation, and alterations in cellular metabolism. Based on our preliminary studies, we
advance a novel hypothesis that MP ingestion indeed pose a human health hazard by disrupting oxidative
metabolism in epithelial cells subsequently causing intestinal permeability, dysbiosis, and an immunometabolic
active state which could lead to intestinal inflammation. Additionally, we hypothesize MP ingestion pose a
significant health risk to individuals that have an underlying condition such as intestinal inflammation as seen in
IBD patients. The goals of this application are to investigate how MP induce cellular changes in intestinal
epithelial cells and to determine how these MP-induced changes in cellular pathways can lead to intestinal
permeability, dysbiosis and an inflammatory state. In aim 1, we will investigate the effects of varying doses and
types of MP on intestinal permeability in a zebrafish model. In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism behind
MP induced dysbiosis and intestinal permeability. Aim 3 will delineate how an intact human intestinal tract
responds to microplastics through the use of human colonoids derived from health patients as well as IBD
patients. The information generated from this project would be a ground-breaking step with important long-term
implications in understanding how MP can affect intestinal homeostasis through modulation of epithelial barrier
function and overall human health."

Future health advances depend on researchers who can work at the interface of behavioral and biomedical
science. The predoctoral Behavioral Brain (B2) Research Training Program addresses this need by training
next-generation researchers - drawn primarily from psychological sciences - who can skillfully incorporate
neuroscience perspectives and methods to make transformative discoveries in health and disease
mechanisms. In 2007, in response to now-expired PAR-06-503 with an integrative behavioral science focus,
we developed a NIGMS-supported program that has served 50 trainees, exceeding benchmarks on time-to-
degree, scholarly output, early career outcomes, progression into research faculty positions at R1 institutions,
and attainment of NIH neurobehaviorally-targeted funding. In meeting its primary mission to prepare trainees
for independent neurobehavioral research careers, the B2 Program also has met its secondary aims:
equipping trainees with skills in the broader scientific workforce and increasing the diversity of the scientific
pipeline. Institutionally, the B2 Program has fostered training environments favoring collaboration and co-
mentorship, research rotations, and attention to diversity. This new PAR-17-341 application builds on this
foundation by providing trainees with: (1) individualized co-mentorship committees that guide trainees through
the program and support their development as interdisciplinary researchers; (2) deep training in behavioral
science through psychological coursework and a mentored independent research program; (3) neuroscience
cross-training, through coursework and experiential research, focusing on systems-level neuroscience
involving humans, non-human primates, and rodents; (4) development of flexible and rigorous skills needed for
success in the biomedical workforce, through didactic and experiential training in scientific rigor, responsible
research conduct, and broad professional skills; (5) training in team science and cultural awareness, through
exposure to holistic mentorship and engagement in diversity, equity, and inclusion learning. Annually, 5
predoctoral trainees will be recruited from 2 psychology and 2 neuroscience PhD programs across the
University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University (adjacently located) using proactive and personalized
strategies, in conjunction with holistic recruitment of matriculants into the affiliated PhD programs. Trainees
receive 2 years of support to pursue enriched training through the B2 Program. B2 Program faculty mentors
(N=46) have appointments in one or more of the affiliated PhD programs, with diversity in personal identity
(39% from underrepresented groups), academic rank, and research topic/methodology. An annual program
evaluation process includes trainee self-reports of progress, evidence-based assessment of mentor
competency and the training climate, program evaluation focus groups, and alumni outcome tracking.
Fostering diversity in behavioral/biomedical research has been, and will continue to be, a program cornerstone;
in the last 14 years, 55% of B2 Program trainees have been from groups under-represented in science."

human-derived models require substantial validation work to “credential” that they are reflective of the biology
of the disease or process under study. Since patient-derived tissues used to generate the models have
considerable associated clinical and “omic” information, computational infrastructure is also required to
abstract, store, organize, retrieve, and display such information so that investigators can make rational choices

Oxalate is an anion with no known biological function in humans. Oxalate is ingested through diet and also
generated by liver as a metabolic waste product. The majority of oxalate (~90%) is excreted by the kidney with
some excretion in stool. In the kidney, oxalate forms poorly soluble calcium oxalate crystals which can lead to
nephrolithiasis, nephrocalcinosis and even chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor
for calcium oxalate kidney stones (the most common type constituting 2/3 of all stones), and recently
recognized as a risk factor for CKD progression. Importantly, certain gastrointestinal diseases (bariatric
surgery, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatic insufficiency) are associated with hyperabsorption of dietary
oxalate in colon, significant hyperoxaluria and urinary stone burden (i.e. enteric hyperoxaluria). Here, we
propose a novel strategy for treatment of hyperoxaluria by blocking oxalate uptake in colon and promoting
stool excretion, which is predicted to reduce urinary oxalate burden and protect kidneys from the detrimental
effects of hyperoxaluria. The target is SLC26A3, an anion (oxalate, Cl-, HCO3-) exchanger highly expressed in
colon facilitating oxalate uptake. SLC26A3 inhibition is a compelling approach for treatment of hyperoxaluria as
suggested by 50-70% lower urine oxalate excretion in knock-out mice and humans with rare SLC26A3
mutations. We recently discovered first-in-class SLC26A3 inhibitors with nanomolar potency and demonstrated
proof-of-concept efficacy of a candidate in mouse models of hyperoxaluria and oxalate nephropathy. SLC26A3
inhibitors will be advanced as first-in-class drugs for hyperoxaluria and calcium oxalate kidney stones.
Recognizing the importance of having back-up candidates, in Aim 1 additional high-throughput screening and
medicinal chemistry will be done to identify novel scaffolds with nanomolar potency and good solubility with
distinct sites of action (intracellular vs. extracellular), metabolic stability and good pharmacokinetics. The
compounds identified and optimized in Aim 1 will be tested in established models of hyperoxaluria and oxalate
nephropathy in mice, as well as in other clinically relevant models of hyperoxaluria including obesity, cystic
fibrosis and bariatric surgery-associated hyperoxaluria, and primary hyperoxaluria. Candidates with good
efficacy in these models will be tested in Aim 3 for in vitro and in vivo toxicity. The goal of these proposed
experiments is to select one or two lead candidate SLC26A3 inhibitors with good animal efficacy and excellent
safety profile for further pre-clinical development."

Advanced practice registered nurses and medical students, particularly those from groups underrepresented in
the biomedical and behavioral sciences, need (1) robust education and research training in substance use
disorders (SUDs) and (2) targeted encouragement and advanced training to promote careers in addiction
research. Therefore, this R25 science education program, Increasing Minority Physician and APRN Clinician-
scientist Research Training To Equalize Addiction Medicine (IMPACT TEAM), builds upon prior NIH initiatives
to promote clinician-scientist research career development. We propose that to increase the pipeline of the
available workforce of underrepresented nursing and medical practitioners who have research-based training
in SUDs to contribute to the size and diversity of the research workforce to ultimately advance the science on
the causes and consequences of substance use, we need to target outreach and engagement from these
student populations early in their careers to reduce attrition from research careers. The following specific aims
will enable us to attain this goal: (1) Develop and implement a rigorous outreach program recruiting members
of underrepresented groups using multiple strategies and existing Michigan State University initiatives to
engage these students; (2) Refine and deliver and interprofessional addiction curriculum for students; (3)
actively recruit a subset of students engaged in training under Aim 2 to participate in interprofessional research
collaborations geared toward launching a research career. To accomplish this, we will promote engagement
through outreach programming aimed at underrepresented and disadvantaged students. We will provide the
students with interprofessional curricular exposure to principles of addiction medicine practice and research.
Lastly, we will leverage existing university resources and collaboratives to create a robust mentor group
consisting of accomplished NIH-funded researchers from many backgrounds to support students through
early-preprofessional research. Our mentors will assist students in exploring SUD research through a
publication/presentation disseminating SUD research. Through this program, we will assist students'
exploration of research through mentored research projects to engage them early in their education. This effort
will promote a pipeline of advanced practice registered nurses and physician clinician-scientists from
underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds poised to be future leaders in providing SUD healthcare
and conducting research to implement and disseminate evidence-based SUD care."
10877719,"Neuroblastoma (NB), the most common extracranial solid tumor in children, typically presents at diagnosis with
evidence of widespread metastasis, especially in patients with amplification of the MYCN oncogene. This
subgroup has a very high risk of treatment failure and death despite receiving greatly intensified chemotherapy.
Attempts to improve the treatment of disseminated NB have been impeded by the lack of a detailed
understanding of the multistep cellular and molecular pathogenesis of this complex form of the tumor. Thus,
new mechanistic insights leading to safer and more effective treatments for metastatic NB are urgently needed.
This proposal grew from whole-genome sequencing analyses of primary NB samples from 135 patients, in
which we identified a novel deletion of a growth arrest-specific gene 7 (GAS7, located on chromosome
17p13.1), in a subset of patients with high-risk NB defined by MYCN amplification. Further analysis showed
that low levels of GAS7 expression are associated with advanced-stage, MYCN amplification and a poor
clinical outcome, while knockout of gas7 in a zebrafish model of NB with MYCN overexpression promotes
hematogenous metastasis of tumor cells to sites commonly seen in patients with this disease. We also found
that MYCN can bind indirectly to the GAS7 promoter region, leading to its transcriptional repression, while
reduced expression of GAS7 can increase MYCN protein levels. Hence, the central hypothesis of this
application is that, in addition to cases with the heterozygous deletion of 17p, over- or amplified expression of
MYCN can downregulate GAS7 expression and maintain at deficient levels of this adaptor protein. This, in turn,
appears to maintain MYCN protein expression at high levels, facilitating dissociation of tumor cells from the
primary tumor and their subsequent dissemination. This hypothesis will be tested in three specific aims: 1) To
probe the interplay between MYCN overexpression and low levels of GAS7 expression in metastatic NB, 2) To
dissect the MYCN-induced cascade of downstream transcriptional and signaling changes in the context of
GAS7 deficiency that lead to metastasis in high-risk NB, and 3) To assess the contribution of GAS7 deficiency
to the timing of NB dissemination and the ability of GAS7 overexpression to block or attenuate MYCN-driven
tumor metastasis, and to evaluate in vivo the effect of MYCN overexpression-GAS7 deficiency on NB
metastasis using different murine models. The major innovation of this proposal is the use of emerging
technology with a forward-looking integration of host and tumor genomics in a high-throughput animal model to
dissect the interplay between low levels of GAS7 expression and MYCN overexpression in NB metastasis. The
significance of this study is threefold: it will (i) shed new light on the contributions of MYCN to early NB
metastasis via its effects on adhesion, motility, and invasion, (ii) clarify the mechanism(s) that underlie
MYCN’s cooperation with low levels of GAS7 expression in NB metastasis, and (iii) identify promising
molecular targets within metastatic signaling cascades that could be exploited therapeutically."
10880257,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Congenital heart disease is the most common congenital anomaly and affects approximately 1% of infants.
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), a severe form of congenital heart disease in which the left ventricle is
underdeveloped, has a 10-year mortality of 40%. Only 6% of HLHS patients have a genetic cause identified on
exome sequencing, limiting the ability of patients to receive a diagnosis and potentially benefit from targeted
treatments. There are two theoretical mechanisms for HLHS: a cardiomyocyte origin, where there a defect in
cardiac muscle cells causes underdevelopment of the ventricle, or an endothelial origin, where value
abnormalities attenuate flow through the left ventricle. Two known HLHS genes, RBFOX2 and NOTCH1, are
primarily expressed in cardiomyocytes and cardiac endothelial cells, respectively and provide an opportunity to
study these mechanisms. Discovery of additional pathogenic HLHS variants could increase the proportion of
diagnosed patients and improve our molecular understanding of cardiac development. Currently, most
pathogenic variants in exome sequencing are loss-of-function variants that reduce gene expression. To test my
hypothesis that missense and noncoding variants also contribute to HLHS by altering gene expression or
activity, I propose to use machine learning on HLHS patient genome sequencing, three-dimensional protein
structure, and enhancer assay data to identify new genetic contributors to HLHS. By completing these aims, I
will advance my training in functional assays and machine learning to be best prepared for a career as an
independent physician scientist.
My scientific goal is to identify new variants and loci that contribute to HLHS. First, in Aim 1 I will use machine
learning to predict the pathogenicity of missense variants in RBFOX2 from HLHS patients. Accuracy of these
predictions will be determined by genome editing of induced pluripotent stem cells to introduce the RBFOX2
missense variants, followed by assessment of RBFOX2 expression and function during cardiomyocyte
differentiation. In Aim 2, NOTCH1 missense variants will be similarly assessed for pathogenicity during cardiac
endothelial cell differentiation. Finally, in Aim 3 I will use massively parallel reporter assays to identify active
cis-regulatory regions near RBFOX2- and NOTCH1-pathway genes, and then determine if rare variants in
HLHS patients within these regions cause gene dysregulation. I will use linear models and machine learning to
determine which cardiac genomic annotations that best predict enhancer activity, and use those annotations to
identify additional candidate HLHS loci. Together this proposal will employ machine learning on biological data
in a way that uses my background in developmental biology and develops new skills in computational and
functional genomics. These results will contribute towards the long-term objective of understanding the
molecular basis of heart development and human disease to improve diagnosis, better define risks, and inspire
novel treatments for patients."
10880388,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 North America has the highest incidence of renal cancer in the world with the most common subtype
being clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Alarmingly, the incidence of ccRCC is on the rise in the U.S. and
globally. The overall five-year survival rate for ccRCC is only 10-12% once it becomes metastatic,
demonstrating the need for new therapies. Metabolic dysfunction is common in ccRCC based on histologic and
molecular analysis. New therapies to treat ccRCC could target its dysregulated metabolic pathways. The
etiology of ccRCC is complex but a major risk factor is obesity. High levels of branched-chain amino acids
(BCAAs) are present in the serum of patients with ccRCC and obesity, suggesting a potential mechanistic link.
BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) are essential amino acids, whose concentrations are regulated by
dietary intake and catabolism. BCAA metabolism promotes tumor growth in many different types of cancer, but
the role of BCAAs in ccRCC is unknown. BCAA catabolism occurs primarily via the first two enzymes, BCAA
transaminase (BCAT) and branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH), respectively. BCKDH is an
enzyme complex that catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction. The products of BCAA catabolism are then oxidized
within the mitochondria to produce succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, which can be used by the TCA cycle for
anaplerosis and mitochondrial respiration.
 My preliminary data demonstrate that BCAA catabolic enzyme BCAT2 and BCKDH subunits are
frequently reduced in human ccRCC tumors compared to normal adjacent kidney tissue (NAT). This decreased
expression occurs as early as stage 1 and is associated with reduced overall survival. Additionally, BCAAs and
their catabolic metabolites are decreased in ccRCC. These results suggest that BCAA catabolism is reduced
early in ccRCC and contributes to ccRCC aggressiveness. ccRCC may reduce BCAA metabolism to decrease
mitochondrial respiration and ROS because ccRCC is susceptible to ROS due to the large amount of
intracellular lipids that can undergo peroxidation. ccRCC decreases mitochondrial respiration and ROS by
downregulating genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation. I hypothesize that
reduced BCAA metabolism promotes ccRCC cell growth and tumorigenesis, and does so by
decreasing mitochondrial respiration and the production of ROS. Aim 1 will determine how reduced
BCAA catabolism promotes ccRCC cell growth in vitro. I will use genetic and pharmacologic approaches to
assess how gain or loss of BCAA metabolism affects proliferation of ccRCC and immortalized renal epithelial
cell lines. Aim 2 will identify how reduced BCAA catabolism contributes to ccRCC tumorigenesis in vivo. I will
use novel genetic mouse models to determine the role of BCAA catabolic flux on renal epithelial cell function
and ccRCC tumorigenesis. Together, these approaches will identify the mechanisms by which BCAA
catabolism regulates ccRCC tumorigenesis and identify novel therapeutic targets to combat this disease."
10880362,"Abstract. The goal of cancer immunotherapy is to harness the immune system to destroy tumors in cancer
patients. Two approaches have been successful in the clinic. (i) “Checkpoint blockade” therapies utilize blocking
antibodies to inhibitory cell surface receptors or their ligands (CTLA4, PD-1/PD-L1) to deplete intratumoral
regulatory T cells (Tregs) or to overcome a hyporesponsive state, termed “exhaustion” or “dysfunction”, that
develops in CD8+ T cells that infiltrate solid tumors. However, only a subset of patients achieve complete
remission, a problem that can potentially be countered by using combinations of antibodies to multiple inhibitory
receptors. (ii) T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) that recognize tumor antigens are
remarkably effective against hematopoietic cancers such as B-CLL (B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia), but
are not as effective against solid tumors, apparently because they become “exhausted” much like normal CD8
T cells responsive to standard peptide/MHC ligands.
Here we propose a new strategy for increasing the effectiveness of CAR T cells attacking solid tumors. Some
years ago, we discovered that TET (Ten-Eleven Translocation) enzymes are dioxygenases that use molecular
oxygen, α-ketoglutarate (αKG) and reduced iron (Fe2+) to oxidize the methyl group of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in
DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and additional oxidized methylcytosines that are all intermediates in
DNA demethylation. We have shown in mouse models that TET deficiency results in skewed cell lineage
specification and enhanced signal-dependent cell proliferation in many cell types; impairs the function of T
regulatory (Treg) cells by decreasing the stability of Foxp3 expression; and improves the ability of splenic CD4+
and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells (TILs) to promote tumor regression. Moreover, Tet2-deficient mouse CD8+ T
cells displayed cell-intrinsic expansion and skewing towards a central memory phenotype, both homeostatically
and in response to viral infection; Tet2 deficiency in myeloid cells resulted in decreased immunosuppression by
tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressive cells, resulting in more effective tumor
regression by tumor-infiltrating T cells; and TET2-deficient CAR T cells promoted complete remission when
administered to a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Here we will test the hypothesis that TET loss-of-function in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells (CD8 TILs) improves
tumor rejection. In Aim 1, we will examine the role of TET proteins in the expansion and function of CD8+ TILs.
The metabolite L-2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG) is a potent inhibitor of TET enzymes and other αKG- and Fe2+-
dependent dioxygenases. L-2HG levels are normally maintained at very low levels in cells by the enzyme L-
2HG dehydrogenase (L2HGDH). In Aim 2, we will assess the effects of L2HGDH depletion or L-2HG pretreat-
ment on CAR TILs. In Aim 3, we will delineate the transcriptional networks involving TET enzymes in CD8+ TILs."

10880363,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mutation of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene is the most common genetic alteration in cancer, and over 100
distinct and recurrent missense mutations in TP53 have been identified. Virtually all p53 mutants studied to date
have lost the ability to bind to DNA, thereby impairing its function as a transcription factor, and it seems likely
that this molecular function largely explains its role in tumor formation. Additionally, many studies have
uncovered gain-of-function or oncogenic properties of individual mutants that extend beyond loss of wild type
function, most notably the ability to promote invasion and metastasis. Nevertheless, which specific TP53
mutations drive differential tumor development and the molecular mechanisms responsible for these phenotypes
remain poorly understood. Given that p53 is a transcription factor and that a significant fraction of cancer-
associated mutations, including C132Y, occur in the DNA binding domain, I hypothesize that p53 mutants
promote differential tumor formation and progression by profoundly altering the cellular transcriptome in a
mutant-specific manner.
Aim 1: Characterize the metastatic potential of p53 C132Y mutant. In preliminary studies, I identified the
cancer associated mutation, C132Y, as an allele that has greater metastatic potential than other mutants. In this
aim, I propose in vitro and in vivo functional characterization of this mutant with the goal of determining: 1)
whether the mutant is necessary for metastasis and 2) the molecular mechanisms by which the mutant promotes
metastasis.
Aim 2: Systematic characterization of p53 missense mutants. Many studies, including some from our own
lab, have produced data to suggest that there may be differences in the function of unique missense mutant p53
proteins. What these functions are and to what extent they are conserved between mutants is still poorly
understood. To address this question, I propose: 1) a systematic characterization of the transcriptome of cells
harboring different mutant p53 proteins and 2) a detailed characterization of the top two mutants from each
transcriptional cluster to probe the mechanisms by which the mutants are functioning.
Training Plan: The applicant will work with an interdisciplinary team of mentors and collaborators to gain
expertise in cell and molecular biology, precision mouse models of disease, and generation and analysis of

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death among American men, with men of African
ancestry have the highest PCa incidence and mortality rates. While the causes of this notable health disparity
are unknown, there is evidence of genetic contributions and it is likely that environmental factors contribute as
well. However, most PCa research has focused on men of European descent, particularly genome-wide
association studies (GWAS), which has resulted in polygenic models having poorer predictive value in non-
Europeans. The overarching goal of this research is to identify genomic and metabolomic factors that contribute
to PCa risk in multiethnic men. To facilitate the construction of a genome-wide multiethnic polygenic risk score
(PRS), in the K99 phase of this research, Dr. Darst will develop a novel variant selection algorithm to identify
informative variants among genome-wide data (Aim 1). She will then construct a multiethnic genome-wide PRS
using a large multiethnic PCa sample (PRACTICAL, N=237,380) (Aim 2). This PRS will be developed on overall
PCa (Aim 1A), aggressive PCa (Aim 2B), and age of PCa onset (Aim 2C) and is expected to lead to improved
predictive value compared to a PRS of ~150 known variants and to a PRS developed using Europeans only. Dr.
Darst's expertise in genetic epidemiology will be complemented with additional training in cancer epidemiology,
advanced statistical genomics, and cancer health disparities received through coursework, seminars,
conferences, and guidance provided by her expert mentoring team. In the R00 phase, Dr. Darst will initiate a
new line of research the applies integrative techniques to investigate combined genomic and metabolomic
factors influencing PCa risk. This will build directly upon the research and training received in the K99 period.
She will identify genetically-regulated metabolites that could be causally associated with PCa in multiethnic
populations (Aim 3). This will require developing a large multiethnic metabolomics imputation panel and using
subsequent meta-analysis summary statistics to develop genome-wide multiethnic PRS for each investigated
metabolite. These PRS will be used to impute metabolomics into the PRACTICAL consortium. A metabolome-
wide association study will then be performed to identify imputed, or genetically-regulated, metabolite levels that
are predictive of overall PCa or aggressive PCa. Using a subset of 1,186 African American men from the
Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, Dr.
Darst will investigate metabolites that could mediate the effects of genetic factors, including the PRS from Aim
2, on overall and aggressive PCa (Aim 4a). She will also use integrative techniques to identify genomic and
metabolomic factors that distinguish subgroups of individuals with high PCa risk (Aim 4b). Results are expected
to substantially improve our ability to detect high risk individuals who would benefit from earlier or more intensive
PCa screening across multiethnic populations and provide novel biological mechanisms to target for preventative
measures, likely reducing PCa mortality and the number of indolent PCa cases treated unnecessarily."

The KIDney Single cell and Spatial Molecular Atlas Project (KIDSSMAP) aims to generate an extensive
spatially resolved 3D atlas of human kidney. This involves generation of high-resolution data capturing different
classes of molecular moieties: from RNA and chromatin accessibility, to proteins, lipids and metabolites. These
molecular facets will be assessed by a suite of different experimental techniques, applied to 3D tissue blocks,
2D sections, or dissociated cell suspensions. The central goal of the KIDney Data Analysis Core (KIDDAC) will
be to integrate these data across different scales, molecular modalities, and a diverse set of individual
characteristics (sex, age, race). This will be done on both the level of cellular and microanatomical structure
annotation. KIDDAC will also coordinate uniform pre-processing and quality control (QC) of the individual
modalities. Finally, production of a comprehensive tissue atlas will also require effective computational
infrastructure for tracking of individual samples, execution of primary analysis pipelines, as well as automated
submission and sharing of data with the HIVE/HuBMAP consortium and wider scientific community. The
resulting atlas will illuminate principles underlying the complex microanatomical organization of the kidney and
will provide a much-needed integrated baseline for characterizing aberrant states of the cells or tissue that

10887068,"Project Abstract/Summary
Outmigration profoundly impacts the health and well-being of older adults who remain in communities of origin – the so-
called “left behind”. Evidence suggests that left-behind older adults are predisposed to increased levels of depression4,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and poor physical health due to familial separation, changes in social network structures,
increased social isolation, and absence of instrumental support. As in many migrant-sending societies, Puerto Rico faces
substantial challenges owing to rapid population aging and pressures on its family networks because of outmigration. Most
outmigrants from Puerto Rico are young adults, which means that ever-larger cohorts of people will enter older adulthood
without the dense family networks that have traditionally been a mainstay of social support in this and many other contexts.
At the onset of the current migration wave, approximately 33% of Puerto Rican older adults report living alone, and 48%
of older adults have at least one adult-child residing in another country. Likewise, even as other Caribbean and Central
American societies face similar issues stemming from high rates of out-migration, Puerto Rico presents a particular case,
given its relationship with the United States and the possibility that its migrants can more easily return for short visits,
resettle, or engage in circular migration patterns. Though an increasing number of studies have demonstrated important
links between smaller local social networks and well-being in various global contexts, no prior study has assessed the
prevalence, predictors, or consequences of this phenomenon in Puerto Rico, nor how it compares against other contexts.
This research project will examine social network typologies, their association with health, and how Puerto Rico compares
to other relevant contexts. We will use data from a NIA-funded studies in Puerto Rico, Mexico, Costa Rica, and the United
States. We will 1) Characterize and compare contemporary social network structures of older adults in Puerto Rico and
comparator contexts, 2) Examine within-person changes of social network composition and its association with health
among older adults in Puerto Rico and comparator contexts. 3) Estimate and project the kinship networks of older adults in
Puerto Rico, and Mexico.
This research project will provide a better understanding on social networks in late life in the Caribbean, Latin America and
the United States and potentially provide evidence for strategic interventions aimed at buffering the effect of migration and
transnational family ties. We will examine social network trajectories, its association with health, and project kinship
networks; this has the potential to inform more specialized interventions geared towards higher risk older adults, with the
goal of reducing health disparities and promoting healthy aging."

The increased life expectancy of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) and the associated burden of non-
communicable diseases (NCDs) in PLWH has prompted an urgent need for effective community engaged
strategies that engage care PLWH with comorbid NCDs in clinical treatment. Current integrated models of care
lack a focus on community engagement as a strategy to refer impacted individuals to clinical treatment – an
integral aspect of translating evidence-based practices (EBPs) in LMICs. More specifically, despite the use of
community clinical linkages as an effective strategy to link impacted individuals to clinical treatment for complex
health conditions (such as opioid use disorder and emerging infections like the COVID-19 pandemic), its use for
NCD prevention among PLWH and comorbid hypertension in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is
suboptimal. In order to sustain the public health gains made in the treatment of HIV, community clinical linkages
must be prioritized as a key component of HIV/NCD integrated care models in LMICs. Guided by the Community-
Based System Dynamics (CBSD) and Human-Centered Design (participatory approaches that involve
participants in developing solutions to complex system challenges), this K01, “LeveRaging Community
Engagement to SusTAIN NCD InTegrated Care Models (RETAIN-IT)”, leverages the infrastructure of a
community-based organization (Network of People Living with HIV in Nigeria (NEPWHAN)) to co-develop a
community-clinical linkage (CCL) model that will facilitate the referral of PLWH to primary healthcare centers for
hypertension treatment. The research aims of this proposal are to: 1) identify and map the multi-level barriers
and facilitators of developing a community-clinical linkage model for care of PLWH and comorbid hypertension
in Akwa Ibom, Nigeria; 2) co-develop with NEPWHAN, a culturally tailored, community led strategy for linking
PLWH with comorbid hypertension to primary health centers for management of hypertension; and 3) assess
the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the community-led strategy using a pre-post pilot study
design. To accomplish these research aims and prepare for a larger study, the applicant will receive training in:
1) systems science theory and methods, including community-based system dynamics; 2) partnership building
with community partners; and 3) in using community clinical linkage models as an implementation strategy for
advancing evidence-based practices for integrated models of care in PLWH and comorbid NCDs under the
direction of Drs. Gbenga Ogedegbe, Antoinette Schoenthaler, Nadia Islam, Brita Roy, and Dike Ojji. Findings
from the proposed research will advance research on the role of community clinical linkages in sustaining
integrated NCD models of care in LMICs and directly aligns with NHLBI’s strategic goal to advance translational
research by facilitating innovation and accelerating research translation."

This application proposes continuation of a highly successful interdisciplinary training program
in infectious diseases research that is based on the tenet that both MD and PhD postdoctoral
research trainees benefit enormously from exposure to faculty and trainees from both
backgrounds. The program, whose research emphasis is on the interface between human host
and microbial (bacterial and viral) pathogens and their epidemiological spread and prevention,
provides an intense mentored research experience for MD and PhD postdoctoral trainees in
infectious diseases. This occurs in conjunction with an individualized curriculum of didactic
courses, seminars and journal clubs designed to encourage substantive interactions between
MDs and PhDs. A short- term 3-month research experience for medical students is also offered.
Most faculty are drawn from 1 basic science and 2 clinical departments, as well as 2
interdisciplinary PhD programs. Collaboration among program faculty is high. Research facilities
are superb. The scientific program centers around three major areas: 1) Host Defense,
emphasizing innate immunity; 2) Microbial Pathogenesis; and 3) Epidemiology and Healthcare
Infections. Faculty are divided into: 1) full members; and 2) associate members on the basis of
their extramural research support and their experience both as an independent investigator and
research mentor. Primary research mentors come from faculty meeting the criteria for full
membership. An important aspect of the 3-year research experience for MD postdoctoral
trainees with minimal prior research experience is an intensive exposure to a broad spectrum of
graduate level basic science courses. All postdoctoral trainees establish a Research Advisory
Committee. All trainees attend a research conference, as well as a seminar/ journal club
designed to encourage cross-fertilization of ideas and scientific approaches between clinical
medicine and basic science. They will interact with outstanding visiting scientists, attend
scientific meetings, learn scientific writing and grant preparation skills, and complete a course in
research and biomedical ethics. Recruitment of trainees in underrepresented minority groups
has been strong, and plans to expand efforts are in place. In summary, this proposal requests
continuation of an ongoing training program with an excellent training record which will provide a
coordinated and integrated training experience for postdoctoral MD and PhD trainees in
infectious diseases research related to the microbial pathogenesis of bacterial and viral
infections of humans."

serially sectioned, with a subset then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for pathological study.
 In Aim 1, we continue to accrue and process human TBs, document the histopathology and
medical/otologic history, and upload the de-identified data to a searchable database, along with digitized
images of all the H&E-stained slide sets, to jumpstart more widespread collaborations in the study of human
otopathology. We will also continue to distribute unstained sections from our TB archives to researchers for
additional morphological, molecular biological or genetic studies of particular disorders.
 In Aim 2, we enhance techniques for human TB study in three key ways: first (Aim 2a), by perfecting a
novel approach to embedding (methyl methacrylate) and sectioning (laser microtomy) that is cheaper and
faster than celloidin, allows morphological and chemical analysis of undecalcified bone and otoconia, and is
less destructive to protein and RNA/DNA; second (Aim 2b), by pursuing the ex vivo imaging of intact
cochleas via high-resolution x-ray tomography, enhanced by coupling celltype-specific immunomarkers to
heavy metals and by developing software to automate extraction of quantitative histopathological data from
these 3D image stacks; and third (Aim 2c), by developing and applying techniques for DNA extraction and
whole-exome sequencing from donor tissue samples and/or celloidin TBs, to identify the pathogenic variants
responsible for the numerous hereditary hearing loss cases in our archives that were not genotyped during life.
 In Aim 3, we strive to accelerate the pace of discovery in human otopathology by sponsoring fellowships,
organizing national symposia and by creating and disseminating training materials, via hands-on courses,
online tutorials, technical manuals on the classic and novel techniques needed for the procurement, processing
and histopathological analysis of human temporal bones."

This research education program offers short-term support to underrepresented or disadvantaged
undergraduate and medical school students to provide them with career opportunities in cardiovascular,
pulmonary, hematologic or sleep research. The research activity will expose trainees to the excitement,
challenges and rewards of a career in biomedical research that are not otherwise available in their regular course
of study. The CWRU short term HLB program will provide mentored research training with outstanding
investigators in these four areas to 12 undergraduates and 8 medical students each year. The overall goal of
this training program is to increase diversity among students who pursue academic careers in medicine and
science, particularly in cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and sleep research. This goal will be pursued by
(1) helping trainees develop research skills, identity with the scientific profession and confidence in a research
environment through well structured, mentored short term experiences that lay the foundation for biomedical
research in clinical and bench settings, (2) providing exposure to diverse areas of research relevant to NHLBI
(in particular, health disparities) and leaders in research with guest lectures and student presentations.
Undergraduates from around the nation will be selected from more than 100 or more online applications each
year after competitive review, and matched with researchers for 2 months on a full-time basis as summer
research trainees. Medical students largely from this institution will be selected on the basis of the quality of the
research proposal, the strength of the advisor as a research mentor and role model and the potential for a
positive research experience and spend 2 full time months during the summer. Both groups of trainees will attend
common weekly sessions and interact to build a community of peers. Our faculty lead outstanding programs that
encompass basic, translational, clinical, population-based research programs in cardiovascular, pulmonary,
hematologic and sleep research, and each has an outstanding training record and strong interest in working with
students. Our evaluation system allows us to continuously improve our training program, and our database and
tracking plan highlights the achievements and career outcomes of our trainees."
10891504,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Therapeutic modulation of dysregulated metabolism has emerged as a successful therapeutic strategy for acute
myeloid leukemia (AML) harboring oncogenic isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations. Inhibition of IDH results
in terminal myeloid differentiation of leukemic blasts and led to FDA-approval of IDH1 and IDH2 inhibitors in
AML. However, there are currently no metabolism-directed therapies for IDH wild-type AML, which represents
the majority of AML patients. Preliminary data presented in this proposal describe the identification of 2-
oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), a tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme which catalyzes the conversion
of alpha-ketoglutarate (aKG) to succinyl CoA, as a previously unknown metabolic vulnerability in AML. Inhibition
of this enzyme is sufficient to upregulate cellular aKG and drive myeloid differentiation in AML cells lacking IDH
mutations. Currently however, the molecular mechanisms facilitating the change in cell fate with OGDH inhibition
remain unknown, as do the genotypic contexts where exploiting aKG-dependent metabolism is most efficacious.
The studies proposed seek to rigorously test the hypotheses that, 1) the treatment-refractory TP53-
mutant/complex karyotype (CK) AML subset may be particularly sensitive to aKG perturbation, and 2) that the
TET family of aKG-dependent dioxygenases which convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
(5hmC) and impact gene expression, among other chromatin modifying enzymes, serve as effectors of aKG-
dependent differentiation. The research plan will utilize in vitro systems to characterize the aKG-dependent
epigenetic program, in vivo mouse models to examine OGDH as a putative target in TP53-mutant/CK AML, and
patient samples/patient-derived xenografts to determine if aberrant aKG-dependent metabolism sustains human
leukemia. The proposed investigations will expand our biological understanding of metabolite use in leukemia
and advance a differentiation-based strategy to treat chemotherapy-refractory leukemias that lack conventionally
targetable oncogenes. The applicant, Dr. Scott Millman, an Instructor on the Leukemia Service at the Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), has devised a 5-year career development plan that builds upon his
background in molecular biology and biochemistry, and his clinical training in medical oncology. Dr. Millman will
conduct the proposed research under the mentorship of Dr. Scott Lowe, an internationally renowned expert in
cancer genetics with a proven track record of training successful independent investigators, to develop new skills
in functional genomics and leukemia modeling that are essential for his career goal of developing new therapeutic
approaches for hematologic malignancies. This mentorship, combined with the ideal training environment
provided at MSKCC, will allow Dr. Millman to carry out the proposed research program and transition to an R01-
funded independent, physician-scientist position in an academic setting."
10891506,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our proposal exemplifies the NIH vision that the multidisciplinary approach to clinical care and research is the
most fruitful paradigm for the development of significant advancements within a specific field. While it is
unfortunate that the heavy focus of skeletal muscle research on the appendicular muscles in male animal models
led to scarcity of preclinical investigations in the area of female pelvic skeletal muscles and provided little
progress toward preventative or therapeutic approaches that target female-specific conditions, such as pelvic
floor disorders; the current project builds on the discoveries of the landmark studies conducted in the limb
muscles. Here, we focus on building the foundational knowledge pertaining to female pelvic floor muscle -specific
muscle stem cells and the impact of such critical time-periods as pregnancy and childbirth on these cells. The
above is necessary for future development of pragmatic preventative approaches to reduce the impact of morbid
pelvic floor disorders on public health. This project represents a novel approach focused on elucidating the role
of muscle stem cells in pregnancy-induced antepartum adaptations of the pelvic floor muscles as well as muscle
regenerative potential following vaginal delivery. To achieve this objective, we will use our validated experimental
model to examine the phenotypic, functional, transcriptional, and epigenomic signatures of pelvic muscle stem
cells at multiple time points across gestation, parturition, and postpartum period to identify candidate signaling
pathways regulating their functional state. We will then test whether exposure to different aspects of the ante-
and peripartum environment modulates the regenerative potential of pelvic muscle stem cells and impacts
muscle recovery following injury. Overall, this innovative study will provide fundamental insights into the
biological processes involved in the regulation of female pelvic muscle satellite cells and factors that impact their
regenerative capacity following mechanical injury. The resulting knowledge will enable the development of novel
strategies to prevent or treat female pelvic muscle dysfunction."
10891569,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The hysterectomy-corrected incidence of cervical cancer (CC) is more than 40% higher among African
American women than white women. Black women are also twice as likely to die from CC. It does not have to
be this way. Widespread screening and proper follow-up would eliminate most new cases of CC because the
natural progression of precancerous cervical lesions is slow, allowing for treatment and cure. The best evidence
indicates that this is not happening. Adherence to screening guidelines is too low among Black women.
 One promising solution to this problem is patient navigation (PN). PN was originally developed to help
socioeconomically disadvantaged Black women overcome the systemic, provider, and personal barriers to
timely cancer prevention and care using community members as lay navigators. Recently, however, there has
been a general shift away from navigating poor and uninsured patients, towards higher SES patients in better
funded, more comprehensive cancer care centers. While nearly all can benefit from PN, if not targeted to those
most in need, delivering these services to more privileged patients can exacerbate disparities.
 In previous pilot work, we developed and tested a prototype, mobile PN intervention for both African
American women (mNav) and lay navigators (mNav-D) to reduce CC health disparities. These products are
front-ends to the same server-based program, and thus fully integrated. For patients, mNav includes an
integrated web-based risk assessment that allows our SMS software app to select and deliver videos and text
messages specific to each woman’s particular cervical screening challenges. Pilot work with 42 African
American women ages 21 to 65 informed the development of this product. For lay navigators, mNav-D
provides an “at a glance” overview of key performance metrics while also supporting easy entry of encounter-
level patient data. Development of this product was informed by formative research with 16 PNs working in a
range of settings. We also interviewed 12 participants who either had upstream or downstream touch points
with electronic health record (EHR) workflows. The data across these pilot studies strongly supports the
feasibility and potential effectiveness of these products, far exceeding the proposed benchmarks.
 During Phase II we will complete development of mNav and mNav-D in consultation with our three
content experts. We will then examine the effectiveness of mNav and mNav-D to increase adherence to cervical
screening guidelines via medical review among nonadherent African American women. Participants will be
randomly assigned to either the intervention condition (PN + mNav/mNav-D) or to usual care (PN only).
Secondary measures will assess cancer screening knowledge, benefits and barriers of cancer screening, and
intentions."
10891573,"Summary
This proposal aims to understand the effects of HIV on the humoral immune response to hepatitis B by
focusing on HBV-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAb), B cell repertoire, and monoclonal antibodies that
develop after an acute hepatitis B infection. This proposal will study 185 men (74 HIV+) in the MACS-WIHS
Combined Cohort Study who had acute hepatitis B while in follow-up and whose outcome of either natural
recovery (n=163) or viral persistence (n=22) was previously determined. The first Aim focuses on comparing
the prevalence and magnitude of the anti-HBs NAb responses over 30 months after natural control of an acute
HBV infection in people living with and without HIV. We hypothesize that in persons living with HIV (PLWH),
the NAb responses will be weaker and less durable than in persons without HIV infection. Decreased durability
of NAb responses could contribute to the increased risk of HBV reactivation with HIV infection. In the second
Aim, we will tag HBV specific B cells isolated from participants’ specimens obtained during their acute infection
period. We will then determine and compare the molecular features of HBV-specific B cell receptors during the
acute infection period between those with natural recovery and those who develop chronic hepatitis B. We will
also determine the effects of HIV on these molecular features and on frequency of B cells specific for HBV. In
the third Aim, we will clone monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from these HBV-specific B cells and determine the
mAbs’ functional characteristics and binding affinities. We expect that the mAbs from persons with natural
recovery will bind with higher affinity and neutralize more potently than those who develop chronic infection.
We also expect that HIV will decrease the affinity and potency of the mAbs.
Innovative aspects of this project include: 1) The unique cohort of a large number of incident HBV infections
where both natural recovery and viral persistence occur in prospectively-followed people living with and without
HIV infection, 2) The ability to detect NAb responses in plasma from human subjects using the HepG2-NTCP
infection model system, and 3) The ability to isolate HBV-specific B cells for ex vivo study. To date, such
studies have not been possible explaining why there is little information on NAb responses to HBV obtained
directly from infected humans. The results from this proposal will contribute to our understanding of the effects
of HIV on the immune response to hepatitis B and could facilitate future research to develop a functional cure
for hepatitis B, which is the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide."

10892667,"Abstract: Career Enhancement and Related Activities
A major strategic initiative for UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) is to develop a well-trained, diverse
biomedical workforce through research education, training, and career-development activities that promote the
understanding of the biology and treatment of cancer. To this end, the HCC Committee for Excellence in
Cancer Education and Training (CECET) meets 4 times a year to review the breadth, depth, accessibility, and
effectiveness of available education and training opportunities and to develop new programs as needed.
CECET overseas an HCC investment of ~$1.4M/year in education and training. Our work is organized through
three main specific aims designed to provide career enhancement opportunities across the biomedical training
pipeline. The first aim is to educate and inspire high school and undergraduate students about careers in
cancer research with a focus on serving underrepresented populations. The Hillman Academy has provided an
8-week summer internship introducing careers in cancer research to 433 high school students, including 175
(40%) underrepresented minority and disadvantaged (URM/DA) in our catchment area (CA). The Academy is
supported by the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation, CURE and the Jack Kent Foundation, and the award of a
new R25CA236620 allows an immediate 70% increase in the number of URM/DA students. This new
R25CA236620 also provides support to improve the science literacy of our surrounding community by
developing 1-day workshops that include hands-on activities, tours of facilities, and career seminars on cancer
research. Our second aim is to encourage medical and doctoral students as well as clinical and postdoctoral
fellows to pursue careers in cancer research. We have used HCC philanthropy to recruit the first class of
Hillman Medical Student and Postdoctoral Fellows for Innovative Cancer Research. We have increased the
number of NCI T32 training grants from 4 to 6 to support the cancer research focus of all CCSG programs. Our
commitment to graduate student researcher (GSR) education is evidenced by our support of more GSRs than
any other Pitt SOM Institute or Department. At the request of the newly formed HCC postdoctoral association,
we have established a new grant writing class that tailors K99 R00 applications to the NCI. This initiative builds
on previous F30, F31, F99 K00 and K00 R01 successes. We will extend our Hillman Fellows for Innovative
Cancer Research program into a new “Bridge to Faculty” positions that will guarantee faculty positions when
key metrics are attained. Our third aim is to enhance the professional growth of faculty through an extensive,
multi-faceted faculty mentorship program that eliminates barriers to innovative cancer research and
strengthens R01 applications to the NCI. We will also increase efforts across our network to ensure equal
access of our health care providers to exceptional cancer education and training programs, such as
Accountability for Cancer Care through Undoing Racism and Equity and AP-POWER (R25CA148050)."

Basic and translational cancer investigations at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) are broadly focused
on molecular understanding of cancer progression and development of novel preventatives and therapeutics
(pharmacological agents, cell-based, and gene therapies) using in vitro and in vivo models of various cancers.
Understanding biological processes from single molecule to whole animal is critical, and the Animal Facility
(AF) is an essential shared resource charged with educating investigators and providing resources, expertise,
and services when these scientific investigations require animal modeling. When new chemotherapeutic
agents, diagnostic modalities, or preventive measures show promise using in vitro or theoretical
methodologies, a key basic to translational step is use of animal models. This is often required prior to clinical
evaluations. For development and testing of cancer prevention or treatment approaches, animal studies may
be required to characterize the tumor responsiveness, survival curves, histopathologic changes, and discovery
and validation of mechanistic biomarkers. Animal studies allow research teams to study the effectiveness of an
intervention by measuring decreases in tumor burden or recruitment of immune effector cells to the tumor
microenvironment in vivo. The AF provides investigators across all research programs access to healthy
animals (mice, rats and musk shrews), transgenic strains, appropriate husbandry, veterinary support,
veterinary pathologist expertise and novel dedicated equipment under barrier conditions (e.g., gamma
irradiators, imaging devices) that allow multi-parametric and quantitative analyses of events in vivo in a highly
reproducible manner and with efficiency."
10893311,"There is a need for new anticancer drug leads, particularly for treating drug- resistant cancers. Fungi have been
the source of many drug leads, with penicillin and the statins as two of the most prominent examples. We
hypothesized by Project 3 that fungi harbor anticancer drug leads, and we are addressing this via a team with
expertise in mycology (Mycosynthetix, Inc./Pearce), natural products chemistry (UNCG/Oberlies), and chemical
biology (Columbia/Stockwell).
In the examination of thousands of fungal cultures from the Mycosythetix Inc.library, Project 3 has implemented
biological and chemical protocols to prioritize our efforts. In doing so, we have identified hundreds of fungal
metabolites with anticancer activity, approximately a third of which are new to the literature. Currently, we have
prioritized three of these leads for further preclinical development, and our team is optimizing the biosynthesis
of materials (targeting gram scale production) for pharmacology studies, PK/metabolism, and semi-synthetic
optimization. Of the three leads, the verticillins are the most advanced, with additional funding procured to further
examine a nanoparticle formulation in models of mesothelioma.
Project 3 has also developed methods to map fungal metabolites in situ, so that we can visualize the interaction
of fungi in co-culture, with the aim of stimulating cryptic biosynthesis. An additional goal for generating new
chemical diversity is the biosynthesis and/or semi-synthesis of non-natural natural products, via the incorporation
of fluorine atoms into the privileged fungal-derived scaffolds."

Obesity leads to an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, heart attack, many types of cancer, hypertension,
stroke, and is estimated to soon be the leading cause of death in the US. Through twin and family studies,
obesity has been found to have a 40-70% heritability rate, pointing to a strong genetic etiology.
The general objective of our research is to understand the cellular and molecular basis of long-term regulation
of energy homeostasis in order to identify genes in which mutations cause obesity in humans and to discover
new targets for the treatment of obesity.
This research proposal focuses on the G-protein coupled Melanocortin-4 Receptor (MC4R), a gene expressed
in the central nervous system and implicated in the regulation of food intake. Different mutations in the coding
sequence of MC4R cause severe obesity in humans.
In this proposal, we will extend our recent novel findings related to the genetic and cellular biology of MC4R.
Specifically, we will study the disease consequences of the observation that only one copy of the Mc4r gene is
active in each neuron expressing this receptor. We will also study the importance of the observation that MC4R
localizes to the primary cilia, a cellular organelle that serves as a signaling hub for eukaryotic cells in general
and neurons in particular."

10892914,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: PROJECT 2 (Multi-Ethnic Analysis for Alzheimer Disease)
Alzheimer's disease (AD)’s etiology is still relatively unexplained but substantial evidence supports a strong
genetic component. Most AD genetic studies have focused on European (EU) descent individuals, despite
Hispanic/Latinx (HL, genetically admixed of EU, African (AF) and Native American (NA) ancestry) and African
Americans (AA, genetically admixed of EU and AF ancestry) having higher prevalence and incidence of AD.
Thus, it is important to understand how ancestry affects AD risk among diverse populations to provide better
models of risk. Overall, we hypothesize that diverse populations harbor novel AD risk/protective alleles
that are rare or absent in other populations or that they have modifiers that alter the effects of common
risk alleles, and specifically that AF and NA ancestries enhances AD risk. ʺRecruitment and Retention for
Alzheimer’s Disease Diversity Genetic Cohorts in the ADSP (READD-ADSP) will add new, diverse cohorts that
augment the existing pool of genomic data. To test our hypothesis, we will perform admixture mapping in AA
and HL, assuming causal variants/genes are more frequently on chromosomal segments inherited from the
ancestral population with higher AD prevalence. We will also investigate universal genetic loci (i.e. those that
confer risk in most or all populations) by performing a large trans-ethnic study that includes AA, HL, as well as
EU and AF ancestral populations. This approach will boost statistical power, detection of rare variant and
dissection of AD genetic architecture within populations. We will also test whether associating and/or modifying
loci differ from the genomic background in terms of past selective events that may have shifted AD risk. To study
the diversity of AD genetic risk, we will: 1) Determine the AF and NA origins of genetic variation in AD, using
admixed populations and investigate ethnic-specific modifiers. We will estimate global and local ancestry
in each HL and AA cohort separately, in order to investigate their association with AD and prioritize the genomic
segments where higher AF or NA ancestry confers higher AD risk. These segments will be fine-mapped
employing resources developed in Project 1 and with ancestry-aware association tests. We will also examine
whether the effects of known or newly-identified AD-associated loci are altered by ancestry background. 2) We
will perform trans-ethnic meta-analysis across AF, AA, HL, NHW cohorts using single-marker and gene-
based outputs from Project 1 but also we will meta-analyze local ancestries that are shared across admixed
cohorts (e.g. AF component across AA, Puerto Ricans, Cubans etc.). Finally, 3) we will perform explicit tests
of selection on AD-associated loci and their modifying loci prioritized by Project 1 and 2 and determine whether
patterns of evolutionary history are consistent across diverse populations with patterns of association."
10912078,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Cellular plasticity, the ability of cells to bi-directionally transition between states over time, provides a non-
genetic mechanism for cells to sample different phenotypes, spontaneously, or in response to cues from the
microenvironment. In the context of cancer drug response, plasticity is problematic because it allows cancer cells
to transition between drug resistant and sensitive states over time. While this phenomenon is well documented
in primary tumors it appears to be a substantial problem in the metastatic microenvironment where cancer cells
often exhibit profound drug resistance leading to patient mortality. In the proposed work, we aim to address this
problem to determine how signals arising from the metastatic microenvironment of the lung regulate drug
response plasticity and how we can inhibit phenotypic transitions from drug sensitive to resistant states in single
cells. Additionally, completion of the aims proposed in this K01 submission will facilitate development of a
research program that is distinct from my post-doctoral mentors, sharpen my research skills, and set the stage
for a successful independent career using live-cell imaging techniques to study metastatic tumor biology and
drug resistance."

producer of quality health professionals and future generation of talented biomedical research scientists
focused on addressing health disparity concerns of the large underrepresented minority (URM) and
underserved community within our geographical location in the historic Third Ward area in city of Houston.
Faculty expertise in biomedical research at TSU has a long history dating back to the 1986 when the University
was awarded its first NIH-supported Research Centers for Minority Institutions (RCMI), 5-year infrastructure
grant , where pharmacokinetics studies were utilized to evaluate drug-drug interactions of anti-AIDS drugs
which led to a successful Phase 1 clinical trial funded by NIAID. The Administrative Core (ADC) of the
proposed Center for Biomedical and Minority Health Research (CBMHR) will build upon the existing structure
of the current RCMI Program (9/26/2014 – 5/31/2020), which resulted in: 93 publications, 12 awarded grants,
15 patents/submissions and several presentations at international and national meetings. Moreover, the
currently-funded ADC successfully launched a structured faculty mentoring program that significantly
contributed to the productivity and development of junior faculty, resulting in several grant awards (including
NIH and NSF) and publications. Upon renewal, the ADC will build upon current capability and expand its
function to provide administrative leadership, oversight, accountability, integrative coordination,

10902068,"IMAGING MASS SPECTROMETRY-BASED METABOLOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE ALZHEIMER'S BRAIN
PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder. Although multiple genes and their
mutations linked to AD pathogenesis have been reported, the pathogenic mechanisms of AD still remain
elusive. The focus of the majority of AD research has been targeted towards the selective loss of specific
neuronal populations. Still, less effort has been spent in understanding reactive astrocytes, a feature common
to injury and disease in the aged brain. Recently, we described a subtype of reactive astrocytes that are
observed in various human neurodegenerative diseases, including AD and Parkinson's disease (PD).
Activation of microglia leads to the conversion of astrocytes into neurotoxic reactive astrocytes via secretion of
IL-1, TNF, and C1q. Blocking microglia activation with the drug, NLY01 prevented astrocyte conversion to
reactive astrocytes providing neuroprotection. The conversion of resting microglia and astrocytes to reactive
ones is deeply related to changes in energy metabolism and lipid composition in the cell. Resting microglia
mainly rely on oxidative phosphorylation for energy production. When microglia metabolism converts from
oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, microglia are activated. This change subsequently converts resting
astrocytes to reactive ones ramping up their glucose consumption. Long-chain saturated lipids in APOE and
APOJ secreted by astrocytes also have been reported to show neurotoxicity. Therefore, understanding
metabolomic changes in microglia, astrocytes, and neurons during the course of neurodegeneration is likely to
provide a deeper understanding of AD pathogenesis. Imaging mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis
will provide a view of cell-type and region-specific metabolomic changes in the brain. To study metabolomic
changes in a cell-type-specific manner, we propose three specific aims. (Aim 1) We will examine region- and
cell-type-specific metabolomic changes in the microglia-astrocyte-neuron axis in the brain of mice
overexpressing amyloid β and in response to pathologic tau. (AIM 2) We will examine region- and cell-type-
specific metabolomic changes in control and AD human post-mortem brains. (Aim 3) We will compare region-
and cell-type-specific brain metabolomic changes of mice overexpressing amyloid β and in response to
pathologic tau with the ones lacking microglial activation by the treatment with PLX3397 or NLY01. The
completion of these aims will provide a better understanding of cell-type metabolome dynamics during aging
and neurodegeneration mediated by overexpressed amyloid β and pathologic-tau injection. The novel
information acquired in this study will provide indispensable insights into cell-type-specific AD pathogenic
mechanisms and offer new opportunities to develop new AD treatments targeting microglia and astrocytes.
Furthermore, this strategy can be expanded to study the pathogenesis of other brain diseases.

10902074,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Although the management of ambulatory heart failure (HF) has been revolutionized by evidence-based drug
and device therapies, there has been no such parallel progress in the care of patients admitted for worsening
HF (WHF). To incentivize health systems to reduce 30-day readmissions, the Affordable Care Act (ACA)
launched the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) in 2012, which penalizes hospitals financially
if they have higher than expected risk-adjusted 30-day readmission rates for conditions including HF. Although
the HRRP has modestly reduced readmissions, this program has had the unintended consequence of shifting
a significant fraction of HF-related care to the outpatient setting. Thus, there is a growing interest in the field to
disentangle WHF from location of care and move away from using hospitalization as a surrogate for acute
decompensated HF. However, little is known about the epidemiology, clinical profile, treatment patterns, and/or
outcomes of outpatient WHF. In addition, while the overall survival of ambulatory HF patients has improved
dramatically, guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) has had minimal impact on impairments in health-
related quality of life (HRQOL). Despite this reality, there are few real-world data sources available to describe
the trajectory of HRQOL in the ambulatory setting. To address these critical knowledge gaps, we propose (1)
to systematically describe the contemporary epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, and
outcomes associated with outpatient WHF and (2) to evaluate the impact of an episode of outpatient WHF on
generic and disease-specific HRQOL in the context of a fully integrated health care delivery system. The first
objective will leverage observational data from a large, state-of-the-art, and validated electronic health record
(EHR) system and machine learning algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) to systematically
ascertain and comprehensively characterize episodes of outpatient WHF. The second objective will
prospectively apply this software-based solution to evaluate generic and disease-specific HRQOL among
patients with a recent clinical encounter for outpatient WHF. The overarching goal of this career development
award is to provide me with the requisite training in research methodology and project experience to build upon
my past successes as a traditional clinical trialist in order to also becoming a leader in health services,
implementation science, and pragmatic clinical trials within a learning health system. Strengths of my
proposal include my prior relevant training and track record in research, the experience and commitment of my
mentors, collaborators, and consultants, and the vast institutional resources and support. In summary, this
research proposal will employ innovative analytic approaches to elucidate the epidemiology, clinical features,
and outcomes of this previously underappreciated and novel clinical entity. Given the current trend towards
managing acute cardiac conditions primarily in the ambulatory setting, these findings have immediate
implications for formulating public health policy as well as the design and conduct of future clinical trials."

Mechanisms of Mechanotransduction by LIM Domain Proteins
Mechanical forces are essential to controlling the shape, movement and even many
aspects of cell physiology. Changes in the environment mechanics or defects in cellular
mechanoresponse are implicated in a plethora of diseases including atherosclerosis,
heart failure and cancer. A major challenge is to understand mechanotransduction - the
mechanisms by which mechanical information is detected and communicated to
pathways that control cell behavior. The LIM super family of proteins, which contain one
or more LIM domains, represents a large number of putative mechanosensitive cellular
proteins that are involved in physiological mechanotransduction pathways.
Understanding how the LIM domains function to detect and transmit information about
mechanical stress will result in a deeper understanding of mechanotransduction-based
signaling, which is important for developing strategies of disease treatment and organ
regeneration.
This proposal leverages an innovative combination of cell biophysics, biochemistry
molecular cell biology, live cell imaging and mathematical modeling to investigate the
mechanism by which LIM domains sense mechanical stimuli in the actin cytoskeleton
and, in turn, initiate YAP/TAZ mechanotransduction signaling. We recently discovered
that a large number of LIM domains exhibit force-sensitive binding to actin filaments. Here
we propose to: (1) identify the mechanism by which LIM proteins are recruited to
mechanically stressed actin filaments, (2) determine how the LIM sequence enables
specificity in force-dependent recruitment within the actin cytoskeleton and (3) elucidate
how the mechanosensing by LIM protein LIMD1 initiates the YAP/TAZ
mechanotransduction pathway. These studies have the potential to demonstrate a highly
conserved mechanism of cell mechanosensing, and the methodologies will establish a
novel strategy for tackling cell mechanotransduction."
10878642,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer, is a difficult disease to
treat and a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with increased incident rate in the US. HCC has well
characterized risk factors: chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) or Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection, liver
cirrhosis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which account for over 85% of all HCC cases. Such
well-defined population makes HCC an ideal type of malignancy for chemoprevention. However, currently
there is no prevention-interception drugs available for HCC. Hence, there is an imminent need to develop
effective agents to prevent and intercept liver cancer. Hippo pathway and its transcriptional regulators TEA
domain transcription factors (TEAD) and YAP/TAZ complexes have been shown to play important roles in
tumorigenesis. Studies from our and other labs have demonstrated the key roles of Hippo pathway in HCC
pathogenesis. Therefore, targeting TEAD-YAP/TAZ complex could be an effective strategy for HCC
prevention. Our long-term goal is to identify novel HCC-preventive natural products (NPs) from under-
explored Hawaiian microorganisms and other natural sources. The objective of this proposed research is
to discover NPs that inhibit TEAD palmitoylation for the prevention and interception of HCC. The central
hypothesis is that the under-explored Hawaiian microorganisms and NCI-NPs are excellent sources for
new cancer preventive NP discovery including TEAD-p inhibitors. The rationale of the proposed research
is that once novel potent TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors are identified, lead compounds will be studied for
their mechanisms of action and tested in vivo in the follow-up studies. The objectives of this project will be
accomplished by two specific aims: (1) Identify HCC relevant TEAD isoform(s), implement bioassay
development, and perform a pilot NP screening; (ii) Perform HTS, BGS, and structure determination of
active compounds In vitro and in vivo. The proposed project is significant and highly translational because
this multi-PI grant aims at identifying novel NPs which inhibit TEAD palmitoylation for HCC prevention and
interception. The results will likely lead to new chemoprevention trials to investigate these new NPs in
high-risk HCC population. This would have a profound effect to reduce the burden of HCC all over the
world."

Mice and humans share approximately 20,000 genes. To date, little data exists for more than a quarter of these
genes and nearly one third have no functional annotation. Because of the high degree of similarity between the
mouse and human gene set, genetic data generated in mice can often be extrapolated to human gene function.
Mouse models of genes with common functionality between mice and humans can lead to new models of
disease, which are useful for drug screening, preclinical studies, and deeper understanding of biological and
disease mechanism. The goal of the Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) is to generate lines of
mice that carry knockouts (KOs) for a genome-wide collection of mouse genes and subject the mice to broad
based phenotyping.
JAX KOMP2 phase 3 proposes to use cutting-edge and cost-effective Cas9 RNA-guided nuclease (Cas9 RGN,
also called CRISPR/Cas9) technology to generate, breed, cryopreserve and phenotype 600 lines of mice during
the project period. Continued effort will be made to improve the Cas9 RGN technology so as to reduce costs,
increase targeting efficiency, and create more complex mutant alleles. Genes will be selected in coordination
with our KOMP2 and IMPC partners and will focus on those that; have human orthologs, have not been
previously knocked out, have no or poor annotation, have significant community demand and integrate with other
NIH-support programs, or are predicted to function in select pathways. To guarantee ready access to the
community, we will ship mice to outside investigators while they are alive on the shelf and deposit the lines into
the Mouse Mutant Regional Resource Center (MMRRC) repositories for future use.
Broad based phenotyping on young adult mice up to 17 weeks of age will be performed on all 600 lines of mice
using International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC)-required and JAX-specific protocols. We will assess
body weight and composition, and behavior, cardiovascular, metabolic, ocular and physiological parameters.
Based on data generated from the current phase of KOMP2, we expect about 30% of lines to be non-viable. We
will characterize the non-viable mutants using high-throughput imaging modalities at three embryonic time points.
Based on previous data we also expect approximately 7% of the lines to be infertile. Direct fertility testing to
assess the fertility of each sex will be performed on all lines that fail to generate offspring from homozygous by
homozygous matings. All data generated from embryonic and adult mice will be rapidly deposited into the Data
Coordination Center (DCC) that supports KOMP2 and the IMPC.
Lastly, JAX will work collaboratively with the KOMP2 Regional Network and with member organizations of the
IMPC to share protocols, innovation, and new technology and to broadly and openly disseminate our findings to
the international community through publication, presentations at meetings, web activities, and social media."
10874497,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders (SZ) exhibit a markedly elevated risk
of premature mortality, with a 10–20-year shorter lifespan relative to the general population. Increased mortality
rates in SZ are largely attributable to the early manifestation of medical conditions that normally occur later in
life, a process known as ‘accelerated aging’. While unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking and unhealthy
diet, account, in part, for accelerated aging in SZ, the excess of physical comorbidities cannot be solely attributed
to these factors. Remarkably, the direct adverse health effects of key clinical characteristics of SZ have rarely
been considered. In the general population, the absence of social contact is known to pose enormous challenges
for physical health, especially at older ages. Given that social isolation is a persistent and disabling feature of
SZ, it is possible that this behavior may contribute to the premature manifestation of health conditions in SZ.
Building on rich pilot data pointing to significant associations between social isolation and long-term perceived
health in SZ, our overarching goal is to test whether and how social isolation contributes to the health
challenges of individuals with SZ as they age. With participants from Europe (EU-GEI) and the US (Olin
Neuropsychiatry Research Center), we will create a longitudinal database of 650 participants, including 500
individuals with SZ, and 150 of their unaffected siblings. We will apply an accelerated longitudinal design by re-
assessing and by examining medical records of research participants who were first evaluated between the
ages of 30-50 and are now 50-65 years of age, a period when many medical conditions and health problems
tend to manifest. We will determine the age-related association between social isolation and adverse health
outcomes in SZ, test for familiality, directionality, and factors moderating this association, and determine the
extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting imposed lockdowns impacted health in SZ. We will
consider generalizability across countries, sexes, and race/ethnicities. The rationale for the proposed research
is that in order to facilitate much-needed targeted therapies to prevent early mortality in SZ, we need to better
understand factors that contribute to the excess of medical comorbidities in SZ. Our central hypothesis is that
social isolation, a common and persistent characteristic of SZ, contributes to the excess of physical
comorbidities in SZ. To meet our overall goal, we will pursue the following aims: (1) Determine the association
between social isolation and adverse health outcomes in SZ; (2) Test for the directionality, and moderating
factors, of the association between social isolation and health outcomes in SZ, and; (3) Examine whether the
COVID-19 pandemic modified associations between social isolation and health outcome in SZ. This study will
be the first to comprehensively examine the health impact of social isolation in SZ. The project may show that
in SZ socialization in midlife can reduce the risk for poor health outcomes and ultimately facilitate much-needed
preventive targeted therapies to reduce early-age mortality in SZ."
10874499,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 35 million Americans, and veterans have a higher
prevalence of CKD compared to the general population. Progressive CKD leads to end-stage
renal disease (ESRD), a state of complete kidney failure requiring dialysis or renal
transplantation for survival. Glomerular diseases are the leading cause of CKD and are caused
by diseases such as diabetic nephropathy, Alport syndrome, and focal segmental
glomerulosclerosis. All of these diseases are characterized by abnormal urinary protein
excretion (proteinuria). This is caused by the dysfunction of the glomerular filtration barrier
which is comprised of endothelial cells, podocytes, and their shared basement membrane.
Treatments for proteinuric CKD are extremely limited, with most slowing progression of disease
rather than curing it. Thus, the unmet need for proteinuric CKD is to improve therapeutics
through a better understanding of glomerular biology. Nuclear factor erythroid 2 related 2 (Nrf2)
is a transcription factor that upregulates cytoprotective antioxidant and detoxification genes.
Although primed to activate quickly during cellular stress, it is restrained by its inhibitor Kelch-
like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) under normal conditions. Nrf2 can be pharmacologically
activated with compounds such as bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me) and its analog CDDO-Im.
Recently completed and ongoing human clinical trials utilize bardoxolone methyl to treat
proteinuric CKD. These trials have consistently demonstrated an increase in glomerular
filtration rates (eGFR), but whether this effect leads to an overall benefit in patients is
controversial. Furthermore, bardoxolone methyl caused a worsening of proteinuria in diabetic
kidney disease, but not in Alport syndrome. In our preliminary work, we find that genetic and
pharmacologic Nrf2 enhancement worsened podocyte injury and proteinuria in several
experimental models of CKD in mice. Our proposal will focus on the pros and cons of Nrf2 in
proteinuric CKD to better understand its role in disease. In Specific Aim 1, we will examine
whether Nrf2 plays differential roles in diabetic kidney disease and Alport syndrome. In Specific
Aim 2, we will test the effects of Nrf2 in different kidney cells using conditional knockout mice.
In Specific Aim 3, we will evaluate how dose or timing of Nrf2 affects the overall course of
disease. Surprisingly, there are few preclinical studies to support the use of Nrf2 enhancers in
CKD. A systematic and comprehensive assessment of Nrf2 in animal models is required to
guide the rational use of Nrf2 enhancers in the clinic. Our proposal will provide this critical data
with the goal of improving the lives of our veterans and of all patients with CKD."

Our laboratory focuses on lipoprotein lipase (LPL)–mediated processing of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs)
in capillaries. This process, intravascular lipolysis, is essential for delivering lipid nutrients to vital tissues (e.g.,
the heart) and is highly relevant to plasma lipid levels and coronary artery disease risk. We discovered a
protein expressed exclusively in capillary endothelial cells, GPIHBP1, that is required for intravascular lipolysis.
GPIHBP1 binds LPL within the interstitial spaces and shuttles it across endothelial cells to its site of action in
the capillary lumen. GPIHBP1 is also required for the margination of TRLs in capillaries and for preserving the
catalytic activity of LPL. These discoveries have already transformed textbook descriptions of lipolysis, but
many challenges remain. One is to define the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the fatty acid (FA)
products of TRL processing traverse endothelial cells and move into parenchymal cells. No one understands
this process, in part because there were no methods for visualizing FA movement into and across capillary
endothelial cells. To formulate hypotheses about the mechanisms for FA movement within tissues and to test
the roles of specific genes and metabolites in this process, we are now imaging tissues with NanoSIMS.
NanoSIMS uses a Cs+ beam to bombard a tissue section, releasing secondary ions that can be collected,
quantified, and used to create high-resolution images of cells and tissues based solely on their isotopic content.
We routinely prepare fresh TRLs enriched in 13C- or 2H-labeled triglycerides, inject them intravenously into
mice, and then use NanoSIMS to create high-resolution images of 13C- and 2H-FAs as they move into and
across capillary endothelial cells. We obtain backscattered electron (BSE) images on the same section. Our
correlative imaging approach, which is unique in the fields of lipid metabolism and vascular biology, allows us
to match the chemical information from NanoSIMS to the ultrastructural morphology provided by the BSE
images. We are now positioned to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms for the movement of lipids to
vital tissues. A second challenge has been to identify additional proteins in capillary endothelial cells that are
relevant to lipid metabolism; a related issue is to determine if active TRL processing alters gene expression in
capillary endothelial cells. Fortunately, our GPIHBP1-specific monoclonal antibodies have made it possible to
purify capillary endothelial cells from complex mixtures of cells, facilitating analyses of gene expression in
capillary endothelial cells. A third challenge—and one that is particularly relevant to clinical medicine—is to
explore the importance of GPIHBP1 and capillary endothelial cells to human hypertriglyceridemia. We
discovered autoantibodies against GPIHBP1 in the plasma of multiple patients with hypertriglyceridemia; these
autoantibodies cause disease by blocking the binding of LPL to GPIHBP1. The GPIHBP1 autoantibodies now
need characterization, and the frequency of this new autoimmune/metabolic disease syndrome needs to be
defined. With our reagents and assays, we are uniquely positioned to address these issues.  "
10874640,"Project Summary
 RNA modifications (the epitranscriptome) represent a mechanism of post-transcriptional gene expression
regulation and an emergent and exciting area of biology. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant post-
transcriptional modification in mRNA, detected across the eukaryotic kingdom, from yeast to humans. m6A has been
implicated in multiple molecular processes such as RNA splicing, RNA stability and miRNA processing and cellular
functions such as meiosis, cell proliferation and embryonic stem cell differentiation, as well as disease states. The
methyltransferases responsible for the m6A form a heterodimer in which METTL3 provides the catalytic activity. We
and others have found that METTL3 has a positive impact in proliferation, differentiation and cell survival. Thus, we
postulate that METTL3 represents a regulatory hub controlled by extra- and intracellular signals that allows
the cells to respond to developmental cues and specific metabolic contexts by modulating RNA metabolism.
Despite the rapid increase in our knowledge about the functions of m6A, there are many fundamental aspects of this
process that remain unknown. For example, it is yet to be determined if the activity of the methyltransferases is
regulated by upstream signaling pathways, and if this is the case, what are the mechanisms involved, and what are
the molecular and cellular consequences of this regulation in homeostasis and development? Another key issue is to
understand how the specificity of the methylation reaction is determined. We know that the recognition sequence for
m6A methylation consists of a very short sequence motif – but despite the abundance of this sequence in the
transcriptome only a small fraction of such motifs gets methylated. Additional RNA structural motifs or sequence
requirements have not been identified. To answer these broad questions, our lab is undertaking a multidisciplinary
approach that includes complementary projects in the areas of molecular and cell biology, biochemistry as well as
structural studies complemented with novel engineered mouse models. The program described here will allow us to
solve the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the m6A methylation pathway upon extracellular stimulation,
metabolic stress and development. Using state-of-the-art proteomic techniques, we will identify context-specific post-
translational modifications acquired by METTL3, and their impact on the activity and specificity of the enzyme. We will
complement these studies with structural techniques including X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to
define the molecular consequences of regulatory events on protein complex formation and substrate recognition. In
parallel, we will use our recently developed mouse model that allows the inducible and tissue specific inactivation of
METTL3 to distinguish between catalytic and non-catalytic functions of METTL3 and to understand the role of the m6A
mark in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation."

Clinical Core (Core C)
Situated in the Deep South, with prominent footing in rural communities in Alabama and adjacent states, the
UAB CFAR Clinical Core is uniquely positioned to support scientific inquiries at the interface of prevention and
treatment, in clinic and community settings. The Clinical Core mission is to provide ready access to integrated,
comprehensive clinical research services to advance HIV prevention and treatment science to promote health
equity and hasten an end to HIV. In the next funding cycle, the Core aims to achieve the following:
1. Increase productivity through computerized database and informatics services
2. Afford access to a comprehensive specimen repository
3. Provide study coordination services for successful implementation of prospective observational and
 interventional studies
4. Ensure research rigor through comprehensive biostatistics and epidemiology
The Clinical Core has been a cornerstone of the CFAR since its inception in 1988, with the UAB 1917 HIV Clinic
(1917 Clinic) as one focal point with ~3,500 PWH and clients receiving PrEP services. Additionally, in the current
funding cycle, Core services have meaningfully expanded to cultivate unique research platforms via the Alabama
Quality Management Group (AQMG) that includes nine Ryan White clinics statewide providing care for over
6,800 PWH and 1,000 PrEP clients. The pursuit of improving clinical outcomes for populations impacted by the
HIV epidemic has been the impetus for identifying clinically relevant questions, scientific discovery and
scholarship that has fed back to the 1917 Clinic and others to enhance service delivery and treatment outcomes
for PWH, with broad impact regionally. In the current funding period, the Clinical Core generated 680 analysis
ready datasets, processed 124,000 specimen vials, and captured 8,000 patient reported outcomes (PROs) via
assessments at the point of care, while supporting 70 extramural grant applications and >300 peer-reviewed
manuscripts. A noteworthy milestone, the Clinical Core supported 7 early-stage investigators (ESI) from UAB
and 4 ESI from other CFARs during the last funding period, who were collectively awarded 18 grants (including
14 K and 4 first-time R01s). Clinical Core innovations include expansion of collection of PROs to AQMG sites,
roll out of ready-access “data bundles” with clinical data and linkage to biorepository specimens, and a new
registry of HIV-negative people approached during HIV testing and consented to engage in research.
In summary, the Clinical Core plays a pivotal role enhancing intra- and inter-CFAR collaborations, providing vital
research support, and leveraging synergies with other research Centers across the university – roles that will
continue into the next funding cycle as the Core achieves its aims."

in 2023, builds on the success and synergies of the UAB CFAR Ending HIV in Alabama Scientific Working Group
(EHE SWG), the prior Behavioral and Community Sciences Core, and the Implementation Science (IS)
Consultation Hub (one of 8 hubs within the CFAR Implementation Science Coordination Initiative). The ICS Core
innovatively integrates implementation, community, and big data science to support and accelerate research
consistent with NIH priorities and the goals of the national Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative.
The aims of the ICS Core are to advance science by: 1) developing and enhancing the implementation science
expertise and research capacity of the UAB CFAR investigative community; 2) enhancing the skills of community
and academic investigators in both established and innovative community-based engagement and research
methods; and 3) advancing methodological skills of researchers in big data science to innovatively utilize data
collected through diverse platforms to better understand HIV transmission and clinical outcomes in community-
engaged IS-informed projects to end the HIV epidemic.
Impressive growth was achieved through synergies with the EHE SWG, retired Behavioral Sciences Core, and
IS Hub that facilitated integration of HIV implementation, community-based, and big data science research at
UAB – including CFAR Ending the HIV Epidemic supplements, K and R level grants, peer-reviewed publications
– and strengthened capacity and relationships between HIV researchers and local community-based
organizations. In addition to continuing successful programs and training opportunities in the next award period
the ICS Core will add new programs: workshops featuring community-as-expert events, seminars on integrating
implementation science, community engagement, and big data science, and interactive symposiums on the use
of HIV surveillance data, commercial datasets, and geospatial methodologies to inform interventions along the
status neutral HIV care continuum. The Core faculty will support HIV researchers to network and collaborate with
community partners, develop and use culturally appropriate strategies to access hard-to-reach populations, and
maintain meaningful partnerships with community members while conducting HIV research. Through these
activities, the ICS Core is well-positioned to harness the expertise of its methodologically diverse leadership
team to design and implement new and innovative ways to end the HIV epidemic, while simultaneously training
and mentoring the next generation of academic and community researchers."

Global Health Reciprocal Innovation Scientific Working Group (GHRI SWG)
Global health reciprocal innovation (GHRI) is a recently coined term to describe a new framework for
bidirectional, iterative exchange of technology, methodology, and/or processes between low and middle-income
countries (LMICs) and higher-income countries to address shared health challenges. The UAB CFAR has an
energized and growing number of researchers who are poised to become leaders in the use of GHRI to tackle
challenges in the field of HIV because of (a) UAB’s longstanding partnerships in LMICs, (b) the stark and
persistent disparities in HIV in the U.S. Deep South, and (c) shared characteristics of the HIV epidemics in LMICs
and the U.S. Deep South. The GHRI Scientific Working Group (SWG), led by two NIH-funded UAB faculty who
have experience translating HIV innovations between LMICs and the U.S. Deep South, will catalyze new HIV
research at UAB that uses GHRI, by implementing three specific aims. The SWG will create a new scientific
platform (Aim 1) for scientific exchange and training in GHRI. Networking opportunities (Aim 2) will be created to
link researchers working on similar challenges in HIV in different geographical areas and increase engagement
in GHRI. Finally, the SWG will catalyze and support novel HIV-related projects (Aim 3), working in conjunction
with other global health-oriented cores and centers at UAB to support bidirectional teams to obtain pilot funding
and provide tailored consultation and training around extramural grant opportunities that can support HIV-related
projects that feature GHRI. SWG members will include both UAB researchers, as well as HIV
researchers/implementers at a range of local (U.S. Deep South) and global partner institutions, whose

10896212,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The American population is aging at an accelerated pace as the baby boomer generation enters into 
late adulthood. By the end of 2030, individuals aged 65+ will account for 20.6% of U.S. population, up from 
16.9% in 2020 and 12.4% in 2000. In contrast to the growing aging population is a limited amount of public 
recreational resources dedicated to older adults. Given that older adults usually have abundant free time and 
quality leisure engagement contributes to healthy aging, there is an urgent need to provide effective leisure 
services and programs for healthy aging based on rigorous research. Senior centers represent an important 
public and affordable leisure option for older adults. Through a diverse offering of recreational and healthrelated programs, senior centers have the potential to enhance the health and well-being of older adults. 
However, there remains a scarcity of research on the impact of senior center on older adults’ health in the 
United States. Additionally, there are limited scientific guidelines on how to design the physical (e.g., 
amenities) and social (e.g., programs, staffing) environments at senior centers to effectively promote healthy 
aging. Therefore, we propose to examine the impact of senior center use on older adults’ health and how 
senior center’s physical and social environmental attributes affect older adults’ health outcomes over time. The 
specific aims are: 1) To describe the variation in senior centers’ physical and social environmental attributes in 
relation to community-level socioeconomic status over time; 2) To assess the association between senior 
center perception, use, and older adults’ physical and mental health over time for different age groups (≤74 vs. 
≥75) and genders; 3) To identify the specific physical and social environmental attributes that optimize health 
outcomes for different age groups (≤74 vs. ≥75) and genders. The study aims will be addressed by 2 waves of
panel data collected using surveys and field observation at approximately 20 diverse senior centers in 
Southern California. Approximately 75 users will be sampled at each center (i.e., a total of 1,500 users). The 
study finding will provide important empirical evidence regarding the impact of senior centers on healthy aging 
and potential disparities in aging-related resources to assist in policy and decision making related to aging. 
Furthermore, this study will offer direct implications to parks and recreation and public health agencies on how 
to design and optimize the amenities and programs/services at senior centers to achieve optimal health 
outcomes for older adults."

Clinical genetic testing has become standard-of-care for many diseases including the congenital long-QT
syndrome (LQTS). However, interpreting genetic test results is often confounded by the discovery of ‘variants
of uncertain significance’ (VUS) for which there are insufficient data to determine whether a particular variant is
pathogenic or benign. The goal of this project is to use a novel paradigm for distinguishing pathogenic from
benign variants in LQTS with a focus on KCNQ1, the most common cause of LQTS. During the prior periods of
support, we implemented high throughput strategies to determine the functional consequences of ~180
KCNQ1 variants, the functional consequences of all known disease-associated KCNE1 variants, and assessed
the stability, structure, and cell surface expression of several dozen KCNQ1 variants. We then integrated data
on KCNQ1 structure, function and sequence conservation with machine learning tools to build a gene-specific
algorithm in a web-based format to predict the likelihood that specific KCNQ1 variants are deleterious. In the
next funding period, we propose to continue this powerful and productive multidisciplinary paradigm to extend
our research. We used our machine learning approach incorporating an artificial neural network model to
predict the functional consequences of 136 KCNQ1 VUS from ClinVar. In Aim 1, we will experimentally
evaluate these predictions by determining functional consequences of the variants using automated patch
clamp recording. In separate experiments, we will perform deep mutational scanning (DMS) of major regions of
KCNQ1 (pore and voltage-sensing domains, C-terminus) to identify all possible single nucleotide variants that
cause impaired trafficking of the channel to the plasma membrane. In Aim 2, we will use our quantitative flow
cytometry-based method to evaluate cell surface expression of disease-associated KCNQ1 variants in regions
of the channel (pore domain, C-terminus) that not been fully investigated for trafficking, and to determine if
dysfunctional KCNE1 variants interfere with KCNQ1 trafficking. We will also employ biophysical methods
(nano-differential scanning fluorimetry, cellular thermal shift assay) to evaluate the stability of trafficking-
impaired KCNQ1 variants in the context of purified channel protein consisting of the voltage-sensor and pore
domains. In Aim 3, we will evolve our machine learning algorithm as a deep neural network and enhance
algorithm performance by using structural channel models built with a custom version of AlphaFold2.0,
computed free energy, and outputs from molecular dynamics simulations of KCNQ1-KCNE1 channels. Our
study will yield a large and unprecedented database of functional, structural, and biochemical properties of
hundreds of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 variants, along with an advanced, data-trained computational prediction
algorithm capable of accurately discriminating deleterious from benign variants. These results will contribute to
improving genetic test interpretation and medical decision-making for LQTS."

The application of electric stimulation (ES) to the brain has been widely used to perturb the physiological and
pathological dynamics of neuronal circuits, with established applications including therapeutic interventions for
neurological disorders such as epilepsy, dementia, and Parkinson’s disease. However, the biophysical
mechanisms underlying ES in the brain remain unclear. There is still a lack of understanding about where, when,
and how to apply ES to brain circuits in vivo. Moreover, ES protocols applied to the brain do so without
consideration for the remarkable diversity of cell types comprising neural circuits. These factors have led to
conflicting outcomes regarding the efficacy of ES interventions for neurological disease and for modulating high-
level brain processing. Our primary goal is to offer mechanistic understanding of ES at the single-neuron and
cell-type specific level to enhance the selectivity, specificity and efficacy of ES application. To do so, we will
explore the selective and controlled entrainment of different cell types in isolation and in intact circuits by
combining in vitro (multipatch) electrophysiology in rodent and human brain slices (Aim 1), with large-scale, high-
density Neuropixels in vivo recordings in rodents (Aim 2). Notably, at the Institute we have established mature
workflows measuring in vitro activity in rodent and human brain slices (i.e. we receive live human brain tissue
from approximately 50 cases per year from nearby hospitals) as well as large-scale brain observatories using
multiple Neuropixels simultaneously in various cortical areas. Using these tools we propose to conduct a detailed
examination into the subthreshold and spike-timing entrainment of neurons to ES in a spectrum of rigorously-
identified neuronal cell classes, defined by their electrophysiological, morphological, and transcriptional profiles,
in both rodent and human cortical slices. We will investigate how the modulation of different extracellular stimulus
parameters such as amplitude, frequency and phase alter cellular subthreshold responses and spike-phase
locking activity. Our extensive preliminary data clearly indicates that defined excitatory and inhibitory classes
exhibit strong entrainment preferences to particular ES parameter regimes potentially offering a way for cell type-
specific ES protocols. We will utilize these results to guide the design and delivery of new, optimized ES protocols
tailored to modulate specific neuronal circuits with increase precision and fidelity (Aim 3). Our study will generate
an unprecedented multi-modal data set providing a detailed view of the effect of ES at multiple spatiotemporal
scales with high cell-type specificity. The different modes support each other and are geared toward generating
more selective and robust ES protocols."

Perturbation of the p53 pathway is a common theme in most if not all human cancers. While attenuation of the
pathway occurs most often through mutation or deletion of the p53 gene itself, amplification or over production
of two important p53 inhibitors, MDM2 and MDM4 also occurs in a number of cancers. The research program
funded by R01 CA47296 investigates the pathways of tumor suppression with emphasis on the role of Mdm2
and Mdm4 in p53 regulation and is currently in its 31st year of funding. This R50 application requests salary
support for Vinod Pant, Ph.D. to continue providing research support to the program. Dr. Pant works as a non-
tenure Assistant Professor in the laboratory of Dr. Guillermina Lozano, Unit Director on this application. Dr. Pant
has more than 15 years of experience in cancer research and has a broad background in molecular biology,
developmental biology, bio-chemistry and mouse genetics. Dr. Pant has made significant contributions to the
program and has published multiple research articles in well-regarded journals. Relevant to this application, Dr.
Pant is proficient in murine studies and in conducting CRISPR/Cas9 functional screens. Dr. Pant has carried out
preliminary screens to identify the factors that allow cells to tolerate high levels of MDM2 which are otherwise
toxic for normal cell growth. Dr. Pant is proceeding with secondary screens to further refine the results. In
addition, Dr. Pant will perform genetic screens in MDM2 overexpressing liposarcoma cells to identify the
vulnerabilities in these cancer cells. Identified factors will be validated by in vitro and in vivo studies and
subsequently tested as therapeutic targets for potential treatment strategy. Dr. Pant's contribution is essential
for successful completion of the aims of R01 CA47296 research program."
10886614,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this research project is to determine if indicators of adipose tissue development and
metabolism are candidate biomarkers to identify preterm infants at risk of childhood obesity and
cardiometabolic abnormalities. Infants born moderately preterm, between 32- and 36-weeks of gestational age,
have 20% higher odds of obesity and cardiometabolic disease in adulthood compared with those born at term.
Moderate preterm birth accounts for 8% of all births, or approximately 300,000 children born in the United
States each year. Factors that may contribute to obesity risk among preterm infants include developmental re-
programming due to perinatal exposure to maternal obesity and diabetes. Preliminary data shows that
moderate preterm infants of mothers with diabetes have greater in-hospital growth over an average of 9 days
compared with infants of non-diabetic mothers, after adjustment for gestational age, sex, and race. Accelerated
growth in these infants may be due to alterations in the development, metabolism, and localization of adipose
tissue. In a prospective cohort of moderately preterm infants, the aims of this project are: To determine the
effect of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes on the development of adiposity at term corrected age and
its association with adipose tissue metabolism biomarkers at birth (Aim 1) and to identify the role of early body
composition assessments by magnetic resonance imaging and adipose tissue metabolism biomarkers at birth
in predicting early childhood growth and development of adiposity and cardiometabolic abnormalities at age 2
years (Aim 2). Identification of these perinatal biomarkers is critical in the ability to risk-stratify infants at
heightened risk of obesity and cardiometabolic abnormalities, and for the future development of interventions
to optimize healthy growth and reduce obesity among preterm infants.
Dr. Buck is a neonatologist whose long-term goal is to lead independent research examining perinatal risks
that influence growth and development among preterm infants. The career development plan for this proposal
builds upon Dr. Buck's prior training in epidemiology and clinical research methods through graduate-level
coursework and mentored training in longitudinal study design, advanced biostatistical methods, biomarker and
body composition assessment, and clinical trial study conduction. Dr. Buck has assembled a strong, committed
team of mentors and advisors with expertise in infant nutrition, pediatric endocrinology, perinatal epidemiology,
and biostatistics to help guide her successful transition to becoming an independent investigator, optimizing
healthy growth and development of preterm infants and minimizing the development of obesity and
cardiometabolic abnormalities in this vulnerable population."

Candidate: Dr. van der Zalm is highly motivated to find innovative feasible solutions to improve the long-term
lung health outcomes in vulnerable children in settings with high burden of tuberculosis (TB) and other
respiratory infectious diseases. Her overall career development goal is to become an independent clinician
scientist with expertise in the design, implementation and analysis of translational clinical research, in order to
effectively address high-priority lung health issues in children living in low- and middle- income countries
(LMICs). Her overall goal is supported by three specific training aims: 1) designing and implementing research
focused on a unique and as yet unaddressed aspect of clinical TB research in children. This includes an in-
depth understanding of longitudinal data analysis and advanced biostatistics required to analyse this rich and
unique cohort with long-term outcomes, 2) to develop into a contents expert and thought leader in pediatric TB
and lung health assessment, and 3) to develop the skills to translate key research findings into relevant clinical
guidelines to impact on policies and practice. This combination of analytical, clinical and translational skills is
required to maximize the impact of translational clinical research in children, especially those in LMICs, where
infectious disease contribute to significant morbidity including long-term lung health outcomes. Dr. van der
Zalm has strong institutional support and has assembled a strong US and international mentoring team highly
experienced in all critical aspects of pediatric TB and lung health research.
Research project: Despite increasing awareness of post-TB respiratory morbidity in adults, there is no data in
children. An estimated 5-10 million children had survived TB between 2000 and 2017 and are at potential risk
of post-TB lung sequelae. The pre- and early postnatal years are the most critical period of lung development.
Therefore, PTB events early in life due to this chronic disease, could have devastating long-term
consequences on lung health of young children.
I propose to investigate the impact of TB on lung health using an established cohort study, “Umoya,” which
provides a unique opportunity to characterize the long-term effect of PTB and other common respiratory
pathogens on lung health in children investigated for PTB, with well-characterized control groups. Specific aim
1 will investigate the long-term respiratory morbidity and evaluate risk factors for poor respiratory outcomes in
children investigated for PTB. Specific aim 2 will describe lung function trajectories in South African children
investigated for PTB. My proposed research aims to define and characterize the spectrum of respiratory
morbidity in children who have survived PTB. An improved understanding of the impact of PTB and other
modifying factors, e.g. viral co-infections, on lung development in children will inform future strategies to
prevent respiratory illness later in life. Through this research I will obtain relevant research skills, establishing
myself as an independent researcher and will use this unique dataset to apply for future R01 grant funding."
10886495,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Children from low-income Latino backgrounds are at elevated risk for developmental delays that contribute to
persistent disparities in school readiness. Early shared reading improves language and social-emotional skill
acquisition, which are critical for school readiness, but families from low-income, Latino backgrounds are less
likely to engage in this activity. Over the past 30 years, literacy promotion in primary care by encouraging
shared reading has evolved into a pediatric standard of care. However, current primary care literacy promotion
efforts rely on traditional office-based models with limited outreach and linkage to community-based resources
that can help address persistent disparities in early childhood development. In our preliminary work, we
identified an intention to behavior gap as a key barrier; low-income Latino parents considered shared reading
to be important and intended to read but did not engage in this activity regularly. In response we developed
outreach text messages to encourage shared reading beyond the clinic visit in collaboration with key
stakeholders including parents. An initial pilot demonstrated feasibility and a positive but partial effect of
outreach text messages on the home literacy environment beyond standard literacy promotion. We found that
poverty-related life stressors were an important barrier that text messages could not address. Our preliminary
work and theory suggest the need for outreach and integrating primary care literacy promotion with poverty-
reducing efforts that can promote healthy child development. We propose a 3 arm randomized clinical trial to
test strategies designed to enhance literacy promotion for low-income Latino families. We will recruit 630
parent-child dyads from community health centers that serve low-income, Latino families. Parents will be
randomly assigned to one of 3 arms (1) Reach Out and Read (ROR) an evidence-based literacy promotion
intervention that is widely disseminated in primary care; (2) ROR plus tailored outreach text messages; (3)
ROR plus tailored outreach text messages and enhanced access to poverty-reducing resources using a widely
disseminated model that simplifies access and provides care coordination. In Aim 1, we will test our
hypotheses that (1) children in the ROR plus text message arm will have higher scores on validated
assessments of language and social-emotional development compared to standard ROR alone and (2)
children who receive both text messages and enhanced access to poverty-reducing resources will have higher
scores compared to the other two arms. In Aim 2, we will examine mechanisms that underlie the effects of the
interventions. In Aim 3, we will use mixed methods to conduct a process evaluation to understand how the
interventions are implemented, identify barriers, facilitators, and adaptations, and explore parents’ experiences
with the interventions. This information will help facilitate dissemination of lessons learned across national
networks. We expect successful completion of these aims will result in knowledge that can change how
primary care interventions are delivered to promote equity in developmental health and school readiness."

Pulmonary physicians and respiratory researchers define respiratory health as the absence of lung disease.
This simplistic definition has limited the development of a robust approach to the prevention of lung disease.
Because of the absence of adult life-course studies focused primarily on lung health, the intermediate
phenotypes of impaired lung health (which exist on a continuum between ideal lung health and lung disease)
have not been well-defined. There is a critical need to identify modifiable risk factors and biomarkers for
impaired lung health that will allow clinicians to recognize impaired lung health and intervene before chronic
lung disease develops. We will leverage the national infrastructure of the American Lung Association’s (ALA)
Airways Clinical Research Centers (ACRC) to form the first national cohort of adults focused on respiratory
health. We will recruit 4000 community-dwelling adults aged 25-35 from 17 metropolitan regions across the
U.S. for the purpose of defining lung health and developing targets to intercept chronic lung disease at its
earliest stages. Our long-term goal is to determine early adulthood factors that influence risk for future lung
disease through detailed assessments of exposures (environmental, socio-behavioral, and occupational) and
responses (physiologic, imaging-based, and biological including the nasal epithelial transcriptome). In this
initial baseline evaluation, informed by our preliminary data indicating impaired lung health (lower lung function,
self-report of respiratory symptoms, lung injury on chest CT scan) precedes the development of chronic lung
disease, we will test several hypotheses regarding the risk factors and manifestations of impaired lung health
in young adults through the following specific aims: (1) Determine whether modifiable exposures and risk
factors (lifetime air pollution, potentially noxious inhalational exposures such as marijuana and e-cigarettes,
reduced physical activity) are associated with lower lung function and greater burden of respiratory symptoms
in young adults; (2) Determine whether CT-measurements of small airway and parenchymal lung injury are
associated with lower lung function and greater burden of respiratory symptoms in young adults; (3) Determine
the association between the nasal respiratory epithelial transcriptome and selected blood biomarkers, CT-
measured small airway abnormality and parenchymal lung injury in young adults. We will test the hypotheses
that (1) lifetime exposure to air pollution and other inhalational exposures (e.g. e-cigarettes and marijuana) are
associated with impaired lung health; (2) novel imaging measurements are associated with impaired lung
health; and (3) respiratory compartment-specific (nasal epithelial transciptome) and blood based biomarkers
provide insight into the biologic underpinnings of impaired lung health. These studies will describe the
divergence between respiratory health and disease and provide a platform for health promotion and the
primary prevention of lung disease."

10875415,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Engineered commensal microbes represent a promising platform for controlling microbial metabolism in
the gut microbiota for therapeutic outcomes. While strains have been successfully engineered to either reduce
the concentration of a toxic metabolite or produce a therapeutic one, strains capable of controlling the level of a
metabolite within a narrow window have not been developed. Such ‘smart probiotics’, able to dynamically
respond to the environment and either produce or consume a compound based on the local concentration, would
be particularly useful for stabilizing metabolites which play a concentration-dependent role in host health and
disease. For example, ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease have been linked to microbially produced hydrogen
sulfide (H2S), with a growing consensus that low levels of this molecule have anti-inflammatory properties and
support a healthy epithelium, whereas high concentrations of H2S are genotoxic, inhibit mitochondrial function
and butyrate oxidation, and potentially weaken the mucosal barrier. Given that H2S concentration varies spatially
and temporally throughout the mucosa, controlling H2S within a tight range is not possible with current small-
molecule sulfide donors, which release sulfide regardless of local concentration. We propose a new synthetic
biology-based approach to controlling microbial metabolites in situ, in which the engineered microbe uses a
transcription factor responsive to the metabolite of interest to dynamically balance the expression of metabolic
pathways for production and consumption of the metabolite. This will produce a stable, titratable concentration
in a manner analogous to a thermostat. In this proposal, we will demonstrate this technology by developing
engineered strains of E. coli Nissle to dynamically control the level of H2S in situ, incorporating mathematical
modeling and a human organ-chip platform into the design-built-test cycle to achieve robust and stable operation
in the complex gut environment. If successful, the proposed research will establish the design rules for a novel
synthetic biology control strategy applicable to many gut metabolites with concentration-dependent roles in
disease, identify and mitigate host factors that impact engineered strain performance, and facilitate greater
translatability of synthetic probiotics."

Despite significant advances in the care of pediatric heart transplant (PHTx) patients, acute rejection (AR)
remains one of the leading causes of death. Cardiac catheterization with endomyocardial biopsy (biopsy) is the
standard of care for diagnosing AR and is performed when there is a clinical suspicion for AR or during routine
surveillance. Unfortunately, biopsy is invasive and associated with potential risks, including: complications from
anesthesia or sedation, valve damage, injury to the conduction system, vascular damage or occlusion, and
cardiac perforation. These potential complications are magnified in the pediatric population. Non-invasive
methods of detecting AR, such as blood biomarkers and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), could
decrease the frequency of biopsy. Blood biomarkers, such has donor fraction cell-free DNA and microRNA,
have shown potential for diagnosis of AR but have not yet gained widespread adoption in PHTx. Advanced
CMR parametric mapping sequences quantify myocardial fibrosis and edema, and our preliminary data
suggest a potential for these sequences to diagnose AR. While CMR parametric mapping has significant
promise, focusing simply on the average properties across an entire left ventricular plane or region ignores the
spatial patterns of disease, resulting in a loss of information and an impaired ability to use the imaging data to
direct care. Here we propose advanced image analysis methods that are more granular than plane analysis,
including texture analysis, as a means for objectively analyzing different patterns of myocardial disease and
developing predictive models that would allow improved clinical decision making. The central hypothesis of this
grant is that non-invasive cardiac magnetic resonance and blood biomarkers can detect myocardial
abnormalities consistent with acute rejection in pediatric heart transplant recipients and can predict the need
for endomyocardial biopsy. To address this hypothesis, Aim 1 will develop and validate a comprehensive
predictive model for identifying PHTx recipients having suspected AR and requiring cardiac catheterization.
Aim 2 will evaluate whether blood biomarkers improve the CMR model developed in Aim 1. SubAims will
include assessment of cost to determine the most cost-efficient screening protocol. Aim 3 will expand modeling
to determine severity of AR as defined histologically. This multi-PI proposal is a prospective, multicenter study
to perform CMR in PHTx with and without AR who are also undergoing clinical biopsy. The innovation of this
study is the use of advanced CMR, texture analysis, and blood biomarkers for the non-invasive detection of
AR. This proposal leverages the support of the Congenital/Pediatric Research Committee within the Society of
Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR). Application of these data to clinical practice could improve
quality of life and decrease associated morbidity by ensuring that only patients with a high probability of
rejection undergo biopsy."
10875417,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Stigma is increasingly recognized as a modifiable factor impacting antiretroviral therapy adherence and viral
suppression among adolescents and young adults living with HIV (AYALHIV), however few interventions have
effectively reduced stigma or address intersectional stigma among this population. In this study we will address
internalized HIV stigma among AYALHIV, as well as internalized stigmas related to the prevalent youth
experiences of violence and depression. Further, we will also focus on intersectional stigma, capturing
anticipated stigma associated with the complex reality of AYALHIV’s multiple social identities. We will create an
intervention to reduce these multiple stigmas by building upon the evidence-based intervention Project YES!
Youth Engaging for Success. Project YES! is a peer mentoring program that effectively reduced HIV-internalized
stigma among 15-to 24-year old AYALHIV in Zambia, and among a subset of pediatric clinic participants,
increased their viral suppression. Project YES! data also highlighted critical intervention gaps, including high
levels of physical, sexual and/or emotional violence victimization among AYALHIV, and how participants who
screened positive for depression had lower levels of viral suppression. This data aligns with a growing body of
evidence linking violence victimization and depression with internalized stigma and viral failure. Project YES!
peer mentors would refer participants with violence experiences or depression and anxiety to the clinic health
staff in a system that provides minimal mental health training or services for AYALHIV. This research seeks to
address this gap by integrating the stigma reducing EBI youth peer mentoring program (Project YES!) with the
World Health Organization endorsed and proven mental health approaches that reduce symptoms of depression
and anxiety (Problem Management Plus (PM+) and Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions (EASE)) that are
delivered by lay health workers. By adapting and integrating PM+/EASE to create Project YES+, we will
specifically provide AYALHIV with problem-management skills that we hypothesize will interrupt the bi-directional
pathways among violence victimization, depression and internalized and intersectional stigmas. We will also
refine our measures of internalized stigmas related to violence and depression, and intersectional stigma.
Specific study aims include:
AIM 1: Adapt and integrate the WHO problem management-based PM+/EASE approaches for AYA (15-24
years) to create Project YES+ for implementation by lay youth mentors to improve viral status by reducing the
internalized and intersectional stigmas related to HIV, violence, and depression.
Aim 2: Use cognitive interviewing to adapt scales of violence- and depression-related internalized stigma and
intersectional stigma to improve stigma measurement among AYAHLIHV.
Aim 3: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of a Project YES+ intersectional stigma reduction intervention
among 100 AYALHIV through a pilot randomized controlled trial."

This R24 application for an NIGMS National and Regional Resource is to enable researchers in the under-
served area of glycosciences and whose research needs glycoscience expertise, to have continued and
improved access to state-of-the-art technologies to advance biomedical research and human health involving
protein-glycan interactions and glycan recognition. Glycosylation is the most common and varied post-
translational modification (PTM) in all living things, and each cell and organism generates unique PTMs and
also glycolipids. Such resources proposed here are neither available to individual laboratories, nor are these
specific technologies available commercially. With a base of ~7,000 users (83.6% new users) and hundreds of
laboratories utilizing NCFG databases and resources, respectively, related to functional glycomics, our
resource is obviously well used and represents a unique resource democratically accessible to all biomedical
researchers. The increasing demand is evidenced by the nearly 10,000 individual, different glycan microarrays
used at the NCFG resource center in just the last 4 years. Our emphasis on protein-glycan interactions is
timely because research continues to uncover clues that these interactions are key to understanding the
expression and functions of glycans in biological systems and their recognition by antibodies, glycan-binding
proteins (GBPs) and lectins, in human and animal systems, and by microbial pathogens and gut microbiome.
Our resource makes available an incredible variety of glycan microarray technologies, glycan libraries, and
multiple databases not available elsewhere. The success of our resource has resulted in over a hundred
publications by users in the past 5 years. Because of its success and rapidly increasing number of requests,
and because we are the only resource of this kind available in the glycosciences, we propose three Specific
Aims to continue making these invaluable resources accessible. Aim 1- We will continue to generate and
improve defined glycan, glycopeptide, glycoprotein, and glycolipid microarrays, along with Luminex-based
glycan-bead technologies, all unique to the resource. Aim 2- We will make available and further improve
natural bifunctional fluorescent-tags (BFTs) originally pioneered by the NCFG, and will be utilized in glycan
microarray and bead conjugations. Such novel BFTs, pioneered by the NCFG, give us advanced capabilities
to label glycans in complex mixtures, purify them, and then quantify and quantitatively print microarrays at
varying densities. Aim 3- We will continue to use BFT technology to produce and improve natural glycan
microarrays from many sources of cells, tissues, and glycoconjugates, comprising a unique and valuable tool
for the resource center. Thus, our Protein-Glycan Interaction Resource provides unique capabilities in glycan-
binding expertise and technologies, teaching opportunities, and a wide range of services and outreach to an
emerging field rapidly becoming recognized as a key factor in health and disease."

Mind and body approaches, specifically diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided
imagery, and biofeedback, improve outcomes for children and adolescents with chronic pain. One prevalent
cause of chronic pain is migraine. Worldwide, it is the 2nd most disabling neurological disease. When youth learn
and practice mind and body skills, the number of headache days and associated disability are reduced. Typically,
trials have tested non-pharmacological intervention packages taught by psychologists, in face-to-face sessions,
occurring over 4 to 8 weekly meetings. While efficacious, this model is not accessible to most families because
of lack of trained providers, distance and travel barriers, and time commitment to sessions. Our recent pilot
studies (both stakeholder engagement and health care provider skills training projects) show that youth who
receive outpatient psychological care report that learning breathing, muscle relaxation, guided imagery, and
biofeedback are the most useful and impactful components of the larger treatment package. Also, nurses in
headache centers report that they would feel comfortable with and are interested in learning how to introduce
these skills to patients; and pediatric headache specialists and primary care providers are searching for efficient
and effective ways to introduce mind and body skills to their patients. Thus, we need to conduct pragmatic trials
to test the delivery of these integrated approaches within the context of typical medical care to confirm if they
can provide benefit or not. But, despite evidence of safety, efficacy, and successful prior trial execution, it is
necessary to optimize a treatment package by evaluating which components and doses of a complex intervention
are critical for changes in outcomes prior to implementing a multi-site effectiveness trial. In this NCCIH U01, we
will optimize a migraine prevention treatment package focused on 4 mind and body skills that will be delivered
by health care providers (for this project, nurses) in two outpatient headache centers (Cincinnati & Denver). An
innovative intervention refinement approach, The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST)
(https://methodology.psu.edu/ra/most) will be employed to determine necessary components and doses of an
efficient, effective treatment that can then be tested against standard care (patient education without any skills
 ≥
training) via a pragmatic trial. For this factorial experiment, we will enroll 200 youth ages 10 to 17 years with a
diagnosis of migraine who are experiencing 4 headache days per month (N = 25 per each of 8 conditions).
Three components will be tested: session time with nurses for introduction to the skills (dose of 20 or 40 minutes);
daily home practice of skills for 8 weeks (dose of a simple handout approach or use of an active, guided eHealth
application); and adherence prompt phone call at 1-month (dose of a call or no call). The endpoints are headache
days and migraine-related disability (plus treatment fidelity, feasibility, drop-out rates, acceptance, & credibility;
sleep; depression; anxiety; and functional disability). The most efficient combination of doses of the 3 components
will be determined using the MOST approach, guided by the resource management and the optimization principles."

ATRX is an epigenetic factor that is mutated in ATRX syndrome. ATRX is required for the maintenance of
multipotent neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs), particularly as these cells initiate differentiation programs in the brain.
Mutations that cause ATRX syndrome cluster within two domains: the ATRX PHD finger domain, and the
helicase domain. These mediate interactions with histones, and remodel chromatin, respectively. Interestingly,
mutations in the PHD finger are associated with severe intellectual disability and psychomotor impairment, while
mutations in the helicase domain often manifest with milder neurodevelopmental delays but more severe genital
abnormalities13. The basis for this genotype-phenotype correlation has never been investigated. ATRX has well-
established roles in molecular processes that are crucial for normal brain development including histone variant
H3.3 deposition and Polycomb repressive complex 2 targeting for epigenetic silencing. It also has a poorly
understood role in regulating CTCF, a critical genome architectural protein that is essential for development. Our
preliminary data indicate PHD finger and helicase mutations of ATRX differentially regulate CTCF localization
and may underlie genotype-phenotype correlations. Our preliminary data has uncovered a genome-wide role for
ATRX in CTCF localization. We found that ATRX knock down (KD) in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)
results in CTCF accumulation at many genomic sites, including both imprinted and non-imprinted loci. We also
discovered that ATRX interacts with ADNP and DNMT3L, both of which can prevent CTCF binding. Using
CRISPR/Cas9, we have generated isogenic ESCs where the endogenous Atrx allele has been replaced by point
mutants found in ATRX syndrome patients. We show that mutations in the PHD finger cause significant
impairment of NPC differentiation, while mutations in the helicase domain cause more subtle differentiation
delays. Our preliminary findings and novel reagents uniquely position us to interrogate the consequence of ATRX
mutations, both for genome organization through CTCF, and for the ability of ESCs to differentiate into NPCs.
Based on our preliminary data, we propose to test the hypothesis that distinct ATRX domains regulate specific
chromatin processes that impinge to different extents on the function of CTCF. In Aim 1, we will investigate the
consequence of ATRX syndrome mutations to gene expression and genome organization during neuronal
differentiation. In Aim 2, we will decipher the mechanisms by which ATRX regulates CTCF localization."

The complexity of mammalian embryogenesis makes it challenging to determine the effect of genetic perturbations on
development. The long-term goal is to better understand how genetic and environmental factors alter mammalian devel-
opment to affect adult phenotypes or cause diseases. Toward achieving this long-term goal, the overall objective of this
application is to develop a platform for high-throughput retrospective lineage reconstruction to quantitatively map devel-
opmental alterations in a mouse model of autism. This platform will be based on developmental barcoding where random
mutations accumulate in synthetic loci during embryogenesis. Each mutation is inherited by the descendants of the cell in
which it occurs; each descendant can add new mutations to the ones it inherited. This process marks each cell with a set
of mutations—a barcode—that can be used to resolve its lineage. The central hypothesis is that high-resolution lineage
barcodes that are sequenced spatially in single cells can be used to retrospectively map proliferation and differentiation
dynamics of neural progenitors to identify the differences between wildtype and mutant mouse models. The rationale for
this research is that many genetic risk factors that are associated with birth defects remain mechanistically inexplicable
based on cellular and molecular analyses of terminally differentiated tissues; this platform would enable retrospective
mapping of these genetic effects after development to determine which progenitors they affect, when they affect those
progenitors, and how they affect the behavior of those progenitors during development. The central hypothesis will be
tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Establish high-resolution lineage recording in combinatorial and cumulative bar-
codes embedded in each cell’s genome. This Aim will combine mutagenesis from double-strand breaks, which predomi-
nantly lead to indels, with orthogonally induced point mutations to establish ultrahigh resolution lineage recording
throughout mouse gestation. 2) Establish in situ single-cell barcode and identity readout directly from mouse tissues. This
Aim will engineer barcoding loci to facilitate their amplification and sequencing in tissue sections together with molecular
markers of cell state. Combining cell state and lineage barcodes will reveal proliferation and differentiation dynamics of
their progenitors. 3) Determine the effects of Chd8 haploinsufficiency on the development of mouse brain using retro-
spective lineage reconstruction. Chd8 haploinsufficiency causes autism but how it alters neurogenesis remains unclear.
This aim will quantify the effects of Chd8 haploinsufficiency on proliferation and differentiation parameters of brain pro-
genitors during mouse neurogenesis. The research proposed here is innovative because it establishes new strategies for
high-resolution genomic barcoding of lineages and high-throughput spatial sequencing of these barcodes in tissue sec-
tions. It further uses new theoretical concepts to convert terminal cells’ lineage barcodes and molecular identity infor-
mation to quantitative insights about their progenitors. Additionally, it carries out in utero analysis of how Chd8 haploin-
sufficiency alters progenitor fields that create the brain. This research is significant because it will enable determining how
genetic perturbations alter mammalian embryogenesis to cause developmental anomalies such as autism."

During eating animals modulate the size of meals by associating sensory cues with rewarding qualities of
food. This process is central to the control of food intake and is impaired in humans and animals exposed to
high fat and sugar diets. The neural mechanisms through which food associations 1) regulate meal size and 2)
are perturbed by this dietary environment, however, remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge has
hindered progress in uncovering the underlying causes of obesity and, thus, in curbing the spread of metabolic
disease. Here we propose to use the D. melanogaster model to address the need for mechanistic studies on
the neural regulation and deregulation of meal size. A diet high in sugar promotes higher intake and obesity in
flies, but unlike vertebrate models, the neural circuits involved in food associations converge onto a single
brain region; further, transgenic tools to manipulate and visualize these circuits are publicly available, thanks to
decades of research and the connectome. Our long term goal is to use the unique advantages of the fly model
to uncover how food environments high in sugar and fat promote obesity and metabolic disease. Our central
hypothesis is that diet-driven changes in dopamine transmission underlie the increase in meal size observed in
animals fed high-calorie diets. This hypothesis is based on our published and unpublished data showing a
causal link between the dopaminergic processing of taste and nutrient qualities, the formation of food
associations, and intake. To test this idea we will use in vivo imaging of calcium and dopamine signals,
behavioral assays, metabolic measurements, and optogenetic manipulations of dopaminergic, associative
learning, and premotor circuits to define both the causes of impaired food associations (Aim 1) and their
consequences on meal size (Aim 2). The successful completion of the proposed studies will define how food
associations control intake and the extent through which diet-dependent alterations in DA signaling impact this
process; this will illuminate the neural mechanisms that regulate meal size and uncover how they are
deregulated by the food environment. Together, this will help advance our understanding of the causes of
obesity, which is key to the NIDDK mission of decreasing the burden and spread of metabolic disease."

Natural genomic variants that influence cryptococcal pathogenicity
Cryptococcus neoformans is a global pathogen responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths yearly in HIV+
individuals and increasing morbidity in non-AIDS patient populations. C. neoformans strains collected from pa-
tients with cryptococcal meningitis have been used to elucidate C. neoformans evolution and in efforts to corre-
late disease outcome with in vitro measures such as virulence factor production or fungal growth. We know that
distinct genome sequences are associated with varied clinical outcomes. However, we do not know which natural
genomic variants are responsible for the differential virulence of clinical isolates.
Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which natural variation in the cryptococcal
genome determines pathogenicity. A first step toward this goal is to identify naturally occurring variants that can
be experimentally proven to influence virulence, at single-gene resolution. The next step is to characterize the
impact of variants in these genes on cryptococcal biology and disease progression. We hypothesize that we can
combine genetic and genomic methods with experimental follow-up to identify, validate, and characterize natu-
rally occurring variants that significantly influence cryptococcal virulence. This hypothesis is supported by our
compelling preliminary data, in which two distinct genetic methods implicate variants in the same genomic region
as influencing infectivity.
We propose to achieve our goals by pursuing three Aims: Aim 1 is to use two distinct, complementary statistical
genetics methods to discover genomic regions containing naturally occurring variants that influence fungal viru-
lence. Aim 2 is to further apply genetics, supported by expression analysis and mutant studies, to refine these
regions and identify specific high-priority genes within them. Aim 3 is to use genome engineering to validate the
influence of selected variant genes on virulence and to assess their effects on fungal gene expression, physiol-
ogy, and pathogenicity in a mouse model.
Applying an unbiased strategy to identify genes harboring natural variants that influence virulence will highlight
new potential targets for antifungal therapy. Characterizing these variants will also pave the way for future inves-
tigations of the mechanistic basis of their effects, which will elucidate key features of cryptococcal biology and
pathogenesis. Our methods are applicable to other fundamental questions in cryptococcal biology, and poten-
tially to other microbial pathogens. Finally, our studies will produce valuable reagents and data sets that will
enhance investigations by other C. neoformans researchers."

Low bone mineral density (BMD) during adolescence is associated with fractures in adolescence and
adulthood as well as increased risk of osteoporosis, a chronic bone disease affecting more than 10 million
older adults in the U.S. The majority of Americans are exposed to perfluoroalkyl substances, phthalates, and
organophosphate esters, synthetic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that have adverse skeletal effects in
laboratory studies. In humans, these EDCs are associated with lower BMD in limited cross-sectional studies
and prospectively associated with lower BMD at age 12 years in our preliminary data. However, few studies
have assessed relationships of EDCs with bone health in adolescence, a period of rapid bone mineralization
that may be highly sensitive to environmental exposures and is strongly predictive of adult BMD. Therefore, the
overarching objective of our proposal is to determine whether exposure to individual EDCs or their mixtures
causes reduced bone accrual and strength in adolescence. We will address our aims within the Health
Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study, a prospective birth cohort study of mothers and
their children enrolled in Cincinnati, Ohio. The HOME Study has amassed detailed longitudinal exposure
biomarker measures and covariate data on participants from gestation through 12 years of age. We will
conduct a new follow-up visit of 225 participants at approximately 17 years of age to measure EDC
biomarkers; perform detailed skeletal assessments; and collect information on diet, physical activity,
anthropometry, and pubertal status. Using these data, we will determine whether EDC exposures are
associated with peripheral quantitative computed tomography measures of volumetric BMD, bone geometry,
and strength strain index at age 17 years (Aim 1); dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry measures of areal BMD at
age 17 years and rate of aBMD accrual from age 12 to 17 years (Aim 2); and fracture history at age 17 years
(Aim 3). We will elucidate the impact of lifetime cumulative EDC exposures and identify periods of heightened
susceptibility by applying sophisticated statistical approaches including Bayesian and lagged kernel machine
regression and latent profile analysis. This work will inform the development of targeted interventions for
optimizing bone health in adolescence with the long-term goal of reducing risk of fractures and osteoporosis
throughout life."

coordinated general and targeted biospecimen acquisition along with relevant expertise and technical
resources to enhance basic, translational and clinical cancer biospecimen-based research activities at the Dan
L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center. Access to such resources is critical for biospecimen-based cancer

This is a natural outgrowth of the close working relationship of the HTAP and PSB SRs over many years.
Merger of HTAP and PSB SRs will allow us to further integrate our operations within a common management

The Cell Processing and Vector Production (CPVP) Shared Resource provides manufacturing of therapeutic 
grade cellular therapy products and viral vector for use in early phase clinical trials. These must be prepared

This Shared Resource provides the infrastructure and environment to prepare, test, and release these 
products for use. It consists of a state-of-the-art facility with 22 manufacturing clean rooms and support 
facilities (quality control and flow cytometry laboratories, material management facilities etc.), and highly 
experienced manufacturing and quality control and assurance staff. This DLDCCC Resource will work with 
investigators to develop clinical scale manufacturing procedures, and release test specifications, testing 
procedures, quality assurance oversight, and regulatory assistance to assist in IND submissions. The resource 
has, therefore, facilitated the transition of cellular and gene therapy products from the basic science 
laboratories in the DLDCCC into early-phase clinical trials. The CPVP currently supports more than 50 clinical 
trials (21 actively accruing, 18 in follow-up, and 11 in stages of translation to investigational new drug 
applications [INDs]) held by DLDCCC investigators and does so at a much-reduced cost compared to

10877138,"Inflammatory activity plays a major role in the development and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD),
the major cause of mortality in the US and around the world. Until now, there has been no way to visualize and
quantify coronary inflammation with the precision required to impact patient management. There is an
opportunity for this capability gap to change, as a new clinical near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging agent
called LUM015 has recently been introduced for cancer applications. LUM015 fluoresces following active
cathepsin cleavage and thus appears promising as a highly specific targeted agent for inflammatory activity in
atherosclerosis, as cathepsins are key mediators of plaque progression and coronary thrombosis risk.
In this grant, we propose to investigate a first-in-human use of LUM015 NIRF for intracoronary CAD assessment.
We will accomplish this objective by developing and clinically validating a multimodality imaging system and
catheter that simultaneously obtains co-localized, intracoronary optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of
lesional microanatomy and LUM015 NIRF to evaluate cathepsin-mediated plaque inflammatory activity. This
technology will be clinically translated by investigating the targeting profile and dosing parameters for LUM015
in animal models of atherosclerosis and in humans undergoing carotid endarterectomy (Aim 1). Technology will
be developed to spectrally unmix LUM015 NIRF from NIR autofluorescence (NIRAF) that is prevalent in
advanced CAD (Aim 2.1). We also will advance NIRF-OCT technology by creating an innovative two-fiber
catheter/rotary junction that removes fiber autofluorescence background. The resultant increase in LUM015
NIRF sensitivity will allow the time between injection and imaging to be minimized, which is important to capture
many patients undergoing cardiac catheterization (Aim 2.2). The new catheter will also improve OCT image
quality, which is inferior in current multimodality systems. After completion of Aims 1 and 2, the intravascular
LUM015 NIRF-OCT technology will be tested in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization to show that NIRF-
OCT can predict CAD severity (Aim 3). By establishing a new clinical imaging methodology for evaluating
coronary microstructure and inflammatory activity in vivo, this work will have a major impact on CAD research,
drug development, and personalized CAD management aimed at improving clinical outcomes."

Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is a multi-functional enzyme that expresses glutathione peroxidase, phospholipase A2
(PLA2), and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) activities in separate catalytic sites. Prdx6 can
reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides and hydrolyze and re-acylate phospholipid fatty acyl bonds. Prdx6 is,
therefore, a complete enzyme for the repair of peroxidized cell membranes. Prdx6 has been implicated in
several pathophysiological conditions, including acute lung injury, inflammation, carcinogenesis, various
chronic central nervous system diseases, retinal disease, type 2 diabetes, muscle atrophy, and male infertility,
but basic questions about the biology of this unique enzyme remain unanswered. Our preliminary data strongly
suggest that Prdx6 suppresses ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by the
accumulation of phospholipid hydroperoxides. Emerging evidence implicates ferroptosis in several
degenerative diseases, carcinogenesis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and ischemia/reperfusion injury, among
others. Hence, establishing the mechanisms and physiological relevance of ferroptosis regulation by Prdx6 is
crucial. My lab is interested in studying the role of the glutathione peroxidase, PLA2, and LPCAT activities of
Prdx6 on the regulation of ferroptosis induced by inhibition of cystine uptake, hypoxia/reoxygenation, and
oxygen toxicity. We will use mice and cells with single point mutations that inactivate each of the activities of
Prdx6 without affecting the others, along with state-of-the-art analytical tools to dissect the role of this enzyme
on the regulation of ferroptosis. In a second project, I propose to study the role of Prdx6 in the maintenance of
mitochondrial function. Our preliminary data show that Prdx6 deficiency alters transcriptional signatures of
mitochondrial metabolism and reduces mitochondrial respiration. We will study the effects of the catalytic
activities of Prdx6 on mitochondrial morphology, dynamics, and function using extracellular flux assays and
three-dimensional imaging techniques. The results of this proposal will contribute to our understanding of one
of the critical mediators of cellular redox balance. These results will also provide essential information for future
translational strategies for the prevention and treatment of diseases associated with dysregulated redox

Diffuse gliomas are incurable brain tumors despite aggressive therapies 1–4. Understanding the mechanisms that
initiate gliomas is a critical step towards improving therapies. The majority of diffuse gliomas are driven by
missense mutations in Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) which cause genome-wide DNA hypermethylation, a
characteristic of IDH1mut gliomas 4–7. DNA hypermethylation may promote gliomagenesis by silencing tumor
suppressor genes 8. Alternatively, DNA hypermethylation may also promote gliomagenesis by activating proto-
oncogenes through disruption of CTCF insulator sites 9–13. CTCF insulator sites define the three-dimensional
shape of the genome by dictating the boundaries of topologically associated domains (TADs) 14,15. Enhancers
and promoters can interact when located in the same TAD but not across different TADs 14. IDH1mut gliomas are
characterized with CpG hypermethylation around CTCF sites, effectively leading to insulator disruption and TAD
reorganization, allowing for the activation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) proto-
oncogene 16. Importantly, the effects of TAD disruption critically depend on the enhancers in the affected loci,
which are strongly cell-type specific 12,14,17–19. I present preliminary evidence that an insulator downstream
PDGFRA is disrupted in IDH1mut gliomas, allowing for aberrant interactions with a strong enhancer in a
neighboring TAD, driving PDGFRA expression. This glioma enhancer is also active in oligodendrocyte-progenitor
cells (OPCs), candidate cells-of-origin for glioma 20–23. I also present evidence that robust hypermethylation of
the CDKN2A promoter silenced this tumor suppressor in IDH1mut gliomas. These strongly methylated elements
can be maintained throughout cell division by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), which maintains methylation
patterns through cell replication 24–26. The objectives of this proposal are to (1) Model glioma-relevant epigenetic
lesions at the PDGFRA and CDKN2A loci in OPCs, (2) Test whether disruption of the PDGFRA insulator and
CDKN2A is sufficient to initiate gliomagenesis from OPCs in vivo, and (3) Test whether the epigenetic lesions at
the PDGFRA insulator and CDKN2A promoter are mitotically propagated as tumor drivers in glioma. These
studies will uncover whether mitotically heritable epigenetic lesions are sufficient to initiate diffuse gliomas.

 The enzymatic modification of proteins through tyrosine phosphorylation is a common mechanism
for relaying information in animal cells. Tyrosine kinases act in a signal-responsive manner to
phosphorylate specific proteins at tyrosine residues, and the opposing tyrosine phosphatases
dephosphorylate proteins to dynamically regulate signals. Tyrosine phosphorylation is essential to many
biological processes in healthy cells, and the dysregulation of tyrosine phosphorylation is a common
feature of many diseases, most notably cancers. Over the past few decades, we have developed an
extensive understanding of tyrosine kinase function and regulation, but our knowledge of tyrosine
phosphatases lags behind. This disparity is partly due to the fact that it is easier to develop drugs that
target tyrosine kinases than tyrosine phosphatases, and the therapeutic potential of tyrosine kinases has
motivated the development of robust tools to study their structure, biochemistry, and biology.
 The overarching goals of my lab are to understand, at the molecular level, how tyrosine
phosphatases select substrate proteins to dephosphorylate, how they are regulated through dynamic
changes in their structure, and how they contribute to healthy and disease-associated signaling. Over
the next five years, my group will devise new techniques to study tyrosine phosphatases. We are currently
developing a high-throughput biochemical platform to rapidly identify and compare the substrate
sequence preferences of tyrosine phosphatases. These analyses will be conducted in parallel with
proximity-labeling experiments in live cells to tag the interaction partners of tyrosine phosphatases for
identification by mass spectrometry. Together, these approaches will allow us to map the substrates of
tyrosine phosphatases and help define the signaling roles of these enzymes. We are also developing
methods to rapidly characterize the functional effects of all possible point mutations in a tyrosine
phosphatase. These mutational screens will allow us to identify new modes of regulation, pinpoint the
functional consequences of disease-associated mutations, and map likely drug-resistance mutations that
may arise to phosphatase-targeted cancer therapies.
 We are broadly interested in two areas of signaling biology: diseases where tyrosine
phosphatases are mutated and/or dysregulated, and the activation of immune T cells. As we develop
new biochemical tools, we will initially apply these tools to the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, which plays
a causal role in several congenital diseases and cancers, and is also critical to normal signaling in many
cell types, including T cells. Our work will clarify the signaling functions of SHP2, connect known
mutations to specific phenotypes, and help guide the development of SHP2-targeted therapies. In the
long-term, we will apply our novel approaches to other tyrosine phosphatases."

Hearing loss is a prevalent condition affecting millions of individuals worldwide, primarily caused by the
irreversible loss of auditory hair cells. While non-mammalian species possess the remarkable ability to
regenerate hair cells, mammals, including humans, lack this regenerative capacity. Therefore, understanding
the regenerative potential of hair cells in mammals is crucial for developing effective therapies to restore hearing.
The objective of this project is to decipher the mechanisms for inducing S-phase entry in adult mammalian
supporting cells and investigate their regenerative potential for sensory hair cell regeneration in the auditory
system.
In AIM 1, the study will align transcriptomic and epigenetic data at single-cell resolution to establish a baseline
profile of supporting cells before, during, and after hair cell loss. The analysis will identify the molecular signatures
associated with the quiescent state of supporting cells in mammals and explore the influence of epigenetic factors
on the regenerative incapability of supporting cells and their differentiation into functional hair cells. Comparative
analysis with chicken datasets will refine strategies for inducing cell cycle re-entry in supporting cells. AIM 2
focuses on developing a strategy to specifically target adult supporting cells after acute and chronic hair cell
damage. The study will employ an inducible gene expression strategy in adult supporting cells using adeno-
associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene transfer. AIM 3 investigates the possibility to induce division in mature
supporting cells and hair cell fate specification using a co-misexpression approach with multiple transcription
factors.
The project will utilize innovative techniques such as multi-omics low-depth single-cell RNA-seq and single-
nucleus ATAC-seq to characterize supporting cells at different time points post-hair cell insult. The employment
of Fbxo2VHC/WT mice and inducible gene expression strategies using AAV-mediated gene transfer will ensure
accurate representation and temporal control of gene expression in supporting cells. The use of various controls
and statistical methods will ensure robust data analysis and mitigate technical biases.
The outcomes of this research will shed light on the molecular and epigenetic identity of supporting cells, identify
potential targets for therapeutic interventions, and refine strategies for inducing cell cycle re-entry and hair cell
regeneration. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the development of regenerative therapies for hearing
loss, providing hope for millions of individuals worldwide."
10876196,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Genetically encoded sensors that can detect and quantify proteins and other ligands are useful tools for studies
of target dynamics and biomedical applications. Despite this capability, however, the principal limitation of
genetically-encoded sensor generations is a lack of flexible design strategies to produce a quantifiable readout
upon target binding with minimizing perturbation of target function. One of the examples is a difficulty to generate
a sensor for free (i.e., unconjugated) Nedd8. Nedd8 is a post-translational modifier that regulates the cullin-RING
E3 ligases, a large class of ubiquitin ligases, via its conjugation, known as “neddylation”, to the cullin subunit.
Neddylation enzymes are being actively explored as drug targets for treatment of heretofore undruggable solid-
tumor cancers. The overall objective of this proposal is to establish a new design strategy to generate biosensors
for quantification of free Nedd8 in vitro and in cells. My central hypothesis for free Nedd8 sensor can be designed
that incorporates a free Nedd8 binder and two reporter domains. The rationale for this project is that such a
sensor can be used to monitor and quantify free Nedd8 in vitro and in live cells. Importantly, the strategy we
develop can be generalized as an approach to generate genetically encoded sensors for other targets. We have
recently developed a selective free Nedd8 sensor (eDEN1-FRET) producing Forster Resonance Energy Transfer
(FRET) signal for free Nedd8 quantification. Based on this preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested
by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Design, preparation, and characterization of genetically encoded sensors for
free Nedd8 for in vitro and live-cell experiments;, 2) Systematic identification of structural factors affecting signal
dynamic range for reproducible quantification of free Nedd8;, and 3) Measurement of free Nedd8 in reconstituted
enzyme reactions, cell lysates, and live cells. This research proposal is innovative in that it offers flexible design
strategies for sensors development without requiring target modification. The proposed research is significant
because it is expected to provide free-Nedd8 sensors for studies of free Nedd8 dynamics in live cells and in vitro,
with broader implications for biomedical applications. Importantly, students involved in this project will have the
opportunity to develop new tools for biology. This creative experience will equip students with the confidence
necessary to thrive in a scientific environment and facilitate their pursuit of careers in biomedical research."

Fibromyalgia is a chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder that has a strong negative impact on quality of life and
is strongly biased towards women. There is a dire need for the development of targeted therapeutics as patients
are not responsive to current therapeutics. The significantly greater prevalence of chronic muscle pain in women
suggests female-biased mechanisms in the pathophysiology of its development and maintenance. Recent
literature on neuroimmune communication in chronic pain signaling have uncovered sexually divergent
mechanisms; however, there are little to no studies assessing how cellular metabolism in immune cells can
modulate pain processing. The research plan during the F99 phase of this proposal will test the specific
hypothesis that maintenance of chronic muscle pain is mediated by sex-specific differences in monocyte
activation and metabolism using a mouse model in which metabolism of monocytes is modulated by deletion of
liver kinase B1 (LKB1), a metabolic kinase. Anti-inflammatory functions are much more metabolically demanding
than pro-inflammatory functions, so these cells will have diminished anti-inflammatory activation. We anticipate
monocytes without LKB1 have a magnified pro-inflammatory phenotype during chronic muscle pain that is
maintained by distinct translational profiles in males and females. Assessment of pain behaviors, RNA
sequencing, flow cytometry, and cellular metabolism assays will allow for the identification of phenotypic changes
within peripheral monocytes driving the development and maintenance of chronic muscle pain. The work and
described in the F99 phase of this proposal will further our understanding of sexually dimorphic mechanisms of
immunometabolism as a driver of chronic muscle pain and provide direction for the development of targeted
therapeutics to reduce the impact of chronic muscle pain on patient quality of life. The focus of the K00 phase
will be to study immunometabolism and chronic pain in patients with fibromyalgia using neuroimaging and
expanding skillsets in immunology and computational biology. The ultimate goal of this proposal is preparation
for transition to a faculty position in neuroscience at a research institution as an independent translational

 Mutant forms of KRAS are a key driver in human tumors but remains refractory to therapeutic intervention
despite over three decades of research. Clinical attempts to directly or indirectly inhibit KRAS function have
both yielded unsatisfactory results. The difficulty for developing small molecule KRAS inhibitors has heightened
the importance of alternative methods targeting the oncogene. One such strategy involves therapeutic nucleic
acids, which make it possible to deplete target proteins that are intractable to conventional drug modalities. We
have developed a novel form of nucleic acid therapeutics, termed pacDNA, that substantially enhances the
antitumor activity of nucleic acid drugs by elevating in vivo stability, accelerating cellular uptake, and improving
plasma pharmacokinetics and tumor accumulation, allowing a much lower dosage to be used compared to
conventional methods. The pacDNA also suppresses nearly all side effects associated with traditional nucleic
acid drugs by reducing unwanted nucleic acid-protein interactions. In this proposal, we aim to build upon our
promising preliminary results, and gain deeper insights into the cell biology of the pacDNA with respect to cell
uptake mechanism, intracellular trafficking, KRAS depletion and subsequent cell signaling, and demonstrate
efficacy in KRAS-dependent non-small cell lung cancer cell lines and 3D models. In addition, we will study the
primary pharmacology and antitumor activity of pacDNA in advanced preclinical lung cancer models including
an orthotopic tumor model, a patient derived tumor model, and a syngeneic genetically engineered mouse
model (GEMM), and perform initial in vivo safety and tolerability studies. The outcome of this project will be a
safe and potent anti-KRAS agent that can be readily translated into clinical studies for non-small cell lung
cancer and potentially additional cancer classes."

Impaired endothelial cell (EC) function is one of the first indicators of systemic cardiovascular disease. EC
dysfunction impairs local organ blood flow regulation, a primary cause of end-organ damage in most
cardiovascular diseases. The discovery that ECs also synthesize carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen sulfide
(H2S), in addition to nitric oxide (NO), which elicits vasodilation has opened a new chapter in endothelial
gasotransmitter biology. While increasing evidence supports a key role for H2S in cardiovascular homeostasis,
disparate findings in previous studies leaves a significant gap in knowledge on the regulation and significance of
H2S signaling in the vasculature. Recently, we identified a novel regulator of H2S signaling that leads to profound
differences in vasodilatory sensitivity between primary and tertiary segments of the circulation. Intriguingly, our
preliminary data show that H2S dilates small (resistance) arteries in an endothelium-dependent manner at
concentrations that have no effect in large arteries. However, depleting EC membrane cholesterol in large
arteries unmasks H2S-mediated vasodilation, suggesting membrane lipid content and domains regulate H2S
signaling. Moreover, our preliminary data show that native EC cholesterol content is greater in large arteries than
resistance arteries. The concept that innate regional differences in EC membrane cholesterol content mediate
functional differences in EC dilation is wholly novel, and our preliminary data (Fig. 6) demonstrate this may be
caused by increased cholesterol efflux via ATP-binding cassette family a1 (Abca1) and phospholipid transfer
protein (Pltp). Importantly, we have previously shown that changes in EC membrane cholesterol appear to
contribute to dysfunction in disease. Therefore, EC membrane cholesterol is an important but uninvestigated
variable in vascular function. The overall goal of this project is two-fold. First, to elucidate mechanisms leading
to the functionally significant differences we have observed in EC membrane cholesterol content between large
and small arteries. The second is to define ways in vitro and in vivo that these differences in EC membrane
cholesterol control EC function, specifically H2S-induced dilation. Thus, we hypothesize that augmented
cholesterol efflux in EC of resistance arteries enhances downstream H2S signaling
Aim 1: Determine the mechanism(s) leading to heterogeneous membrane cholesterol content between
large and small arteries.
Aim 2: Determine the mechanism(s) by which membrane cholesterol regulates H2S signaling in EC.
 Completing the proposed studies will fill an existing knowledge gap by elucidating the regulation of H2S dilation
to identify differences in EC function between small and large arteries. Conceptually, the project is very innovative
in its focus on the novel ability of membrane cholesterol trafficking to act as a regulator of vasodilation. This work
will increase our understanding of the fundamental properties of EC, significantly impacting our understanding
of blood pressure regulation and local blood flow control, and may identify drug targets for the treatment of
multiple vascular-driven diseases.

Recent studies have identified a large number of variants in SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor
attachment protein receptor) machinery components such as SNAP25 that give rise to intractable early
childhood brain disorders. In this project, we will use rodent hippocampal neurons as well as human embryonic
stem cell derived neurons and a unique SNAP25 variant knock-in mouse model, to fully define the synaptic
transmission and plasticity deficits associated with key disease causing SNAP25 variants and evaluate their
responsiveness to neurotherapeutics. Importantly, our studies have identified SNAP25 variants that
dramatically alter spontaneous release with limited or no effect on properties of action potential evoked
neurotransmission. As spontaneous release process is a key determinant of synapses' homeostatic state and
responsiveness to certain neurotherapeutics, we expect that the effects of these mutations will go beyond their
immediate impact on the release process and alter synaptic plasticity as well as treatment response. Overall,
we aim to test the hypothesis that disease causing neurotransmitter release machinery variants elicit crucial
downstream signaling defects altering plasticity mechanisms that affect responsiveness to therapeutics via
three Specific Aims. The first aim will address synaptic mechanisms adversely affected by SNAP25 variants
using electrophysiology, single synapse optical imaging, electron-microscopy and super-resolution imaging.
The second aim will focus on examining SNAP25 variant induced synaptic deficits in human neurons. In this
system, we will evaluate the impact of experimental therapeutics that elicit homeostatic synaptic plasticity on
SNAP25 variant induced deficits. Finally, aim 3 will examine circuit specific synaptic transmission and plasticity
deficits in a unique SNAP25 variant mouse model. Information attained from these studies will provide new
insight to the synaptic substrates that are affected not only by these disorders but also a number of
neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders with synaptic abnormalities including major depressive disorder,
autism, schizophrenia and neurodegeneration."

 There are few women and underrepresented minorities (URM) entering into the fields of hematology
and pediatrics as well as positions of leadership. It is critical that more underrepresented hematology
researchers are trained to better understand, identify, and reduce health disparities in the field and study
diseases that are relevant to underrepresented communities, such as sickle cell disease and thalassemia, to
improve outcomes.
 We have developed an innovative, multidisciplinary training program in nonmalignant
hematology with faculty mentors who have unique expertise and experience training students. The
goal of this R25 application, “Increasing Diversity in Hematology: Training for Underrepresented students,” is
to recruit underrepresented high school graduates and local community college students to Stanford University
to 1) obtain an introduction to clinical aspects of nonmalignant hematology; 2) participate in didactic lectures
and laboratory experience in hematology research, 3) be exposed to ethics in research; and 4) explore career
development options. Given the declining number of underrepresented translational and basic researchers in
hematology, a training program in hematology will be critical to fill the pipeline and ultimately increase the
number of underrepresented leaders in hematology.
 In this application, we seek funding for 5 recent underrepresented high school graduates and 5
underrepresented community college students each year to spend 8-weeks during the summer with faculty
who have expertise in mentoring underrepresented students. Students will have the opportunity to perform
research in one of the 30 expert faculty mentors’ laboratories. Trainees will be selected from a pool of >200
eligible high school graduates from cities throughout the country and >1400 students from 26 local community
colleges surrounding Stanford University. The funding will support the students’ salaries and living expenses.
 The students will participate in a curriculum consisting of lectures, workshops, and research seminars.
Lectures will focus on introduction to hematology and various research techniques. Career development
workshops for trainees include writing scientific abstracts, giving presentations, ethics, and preparing posters.
Students will also receive “hands on” experience with appropriately matched mentors and their trainees, e.g.
postdoctoral fellows, based on the students’ interests. There will be a poster symposium at the end of the
program. The Program Directors and Internal Advisory Committee will evaluate the program annually. The
External Advisory Committee will review the R25 program every year and meet with the Program Directors,
Internal Advisory Committee members, and students. The R25 program will be evaluated by the student
participants every year. We will utilize the strengths of Stanford University to recruit underrepresented
students to the hematology, including the breadth and depth of investigators across many disciplines, to train
future leaders in the hematology."
10887519,"Transplantation of therapeutic cells holds great potential to cure or provide relief to various ailments. In
the clinic, cell grafts often perish or cease to function within a short period post-transplantation. An emerging
strategy is the use of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an adjuvant
to cell therapy. However, there remain challenges for effective EV delivery to and retention at the target sites,
and the inability to elucidate the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles of EVs using a clinically relevant
tool. Moreover, a few new studies indicated that multiple deliveries of EVs are essential for therapeutic outcomes,
which are hard to accomplish using the current clinical administration routes. We propose to develop theranostic,
injectable microspheroid EV-delivery systems (EVDS) for local, targeted, and sustained-delivery of EVs while
enabling EV tracking in vivo with magnetic particle imaging (MPI). The design of our EVDS is modular where
each main component of the system can be independently modified to suit different purposes. Our interest lies
in pancreatic islet transplantation to treat type 1 and advanced type 2 diabetes. Two designs of EVDS – LipoCap
and MICap – are proposed. LipoCaps (500 μm) can be infused into the liver via the portal vein (a clinically tested
islet transplantation protocol) for co-implantation with islets, or for follow-up doses post-transplantation. MICaps
(900 µm) are appropriate for implant site with larger volumes, such as the intraperitoneal cavity. Both designs
aim to obtain a local, sustained delivery of EVs to islets. LipoCaps and MICaps will be composed of ultrapurified
alginate, an FDA-approved excipient of food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. In order to minimize non-
specific uptake by nearby fat and tissues after the release from alginate matrix, EVs will be loaded inside islet-
targeting liposomes prior to alginate encapsulation. This will be achieved by conjugating the liposomes to
exendin-4, a ligand of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptors which are abundantly expressed on the surface of islet
beta cells. In addition, EVs will be labeled with clinical-grade ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide
nanoparticles (USPIO) to facilitate imaging by MPI. MPI is an emerging modality that provides “hot spot”
visualization as well as EV quantification, much alike to PET and SPECT without the use of radioactive agents.
Unlike 1H MRI, background artifacts from blood pools and motion effects are not an issue with MPI. MPI is
reported to be more sensitive than 19F MRI and CT, and therefore may reduce the quantity of labels introduced
into the patients. MPI may inform physicians on the temporal and spatial behavior of EVs which, in turns, may
afford EV therapy to be customized. To systemically investigate the feasibility of the project, three specific aims
are proposed: 1) To synthesize and characterize LipoCaps and MICaps carrying MSC-EVs, and to test their
effects on human islets’ survival and function in vitro; 2) To develop a USPIO-labeling method that will preserve
EV properties while maximizing MPI detection sensitivity; 3) To test if the proposed EVDS can improve islet
survival and function in immunodeficient NU/J mice while being tracked by MPI."
10887637,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Preserving movement-related independence is a clinical and public health priority, as well as a major goal of the
National Institute on Aging and NIH’s strategic plan for research on aging. Our work has demonstrated that low-
functioning (LF) older adults have a more rapid functional decline than those who are high-functioning (HF).
The biological mechanisms that lead to accelerated functional decline in LF older adults remain poorly
understood, and few therapies are available to prevent its progression. As diverse as the etiologies of physical
disability are, a growing body of evidence strongly implicates the mitochondria (Mt) as playing a key role in the
initial onset and progression of functional decline in many individuals. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been directly
linked to accelerate telomere attrition, genome instability, epigenetic alterations, stem cell exhaustion, cellular
senescence, impaired proteostasis, and deregulated nutrient signaling, all key hallmarks of aging. What’s more,
perturbations in cellular and mitochondrial iron transport and handling may contribute to increased mutations
and deletions, which lead to a reduction in mtDNA copy numbers and thereby negatively affect mitochondrial
(Mt) function. Cellular iron import and export are critical for optimal cellular function. Iron levels are modulated
by the hormone hepcidin via binding and subsequent degradation of the iron export protein ferroportin (Fn). Iron
acquisition (import) occurs through transferrin receptor and is highly responsive to intracellular iron levels. We
also have documented increased skeletal muscle Mt iron stores which increased oxidative stress and the
susceptibility of Mt permeability transition pore (PTP) opening (a measure of Mt resiliency) with age.
Based on our pilot data our central hypothesis is that greater circulating hepcidin levels and muscle iron
deregulation (↓Ferroportin → ↑ Cellular and Mt Iron Levels → ↓TfR-1) in LF older adults will lead to Mt dysfunction
(↑Sensitivity to PTP, ↑Deletions/Damage, ↓Mitochondrial Respiration) and accelerated progression of functional
decline in LF compared to HF older adults.
To test our central hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective longitudinal study in which we will follow HF and LF
research participants (70 to 80 years) for 3 years and obtain plasma and skeletal muscle biochemical measures
of iron regulation and mitochondrial dysfunction at baseline and throughout the follow-up period. The Short
Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) will be used to classify LF (SPPB ≤ 9) and HF (SPPB > 10) participants.
We will annually assess the participants’ physical function through established measures (SPPB, 6-minute walk,
and muscle strength). We will assess changes in health behaviors, including activity levels, dietary intake, and
sleep at annual follow-up visits. For the proposed study, we will examine cross-sectional and longitudinal
associations of dysfunctional iron regulation with levels of Mt and physical function. If our hypotheses are correct,
results will be used to design clinical trials testing pharmacologic therapies that target hepcidin and muscle
abnormalities found to be associated with functional decline in LF older adults."

Despite the many physical, psychological, and social benefits that can be gained, many youths do not regularly
achieve recommended amounts of physical activity (PA). Summer is a particularly challenging time away from
the structure and resources schools provide that facilitate health bringing changes in social relationships as well
as the built environment to which youth are exposed. Reviews of existing evidence highlight a significant need
for more nuanced measurement including the use of intensive longitudinal data (ILD) to separate the effects of
social and built environments as well as their reciprocal determinism and mutual influence on youth PA.
Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a promising method to collect ILD by gathering real-time self-reports
of behaviors, contexts, and perceptions in naturalistic settings. Social network analysis (SNA) has the potential
to provide a more nuanced and in-depth information such as dyadic and personal network measures of social
bridging, bonding, norms, and influence. To examine these influences on a more granular level, this project
will evaluate the feasibility of combining EMA and SNA techniques to collect primary data describing
social and built environment associations with PA within a sample of youth during the summer. To
examine the feasibility of using both EMA and SNA, 100 youth (12-15 years, going into 7th-9th grade) will be
recruited through a partnership with a local school district to participate in a survey, 7-day EMA, and follow-up
interview. Youth will report their most salient social connections and built environment perceptions via researcher
administered surveys. EMA will elicit momentary perceptions of social and built environments, which will be time
matched with the accelerometer assessed PA data. Specific characteristics of youth personal networks will be
captured through SNA and momentary perceptions of these networks using EMA. Likewise, we will measure
built environment through momentary perceptions and GIS data. Feasibility and acceptability will be assessed
by examining predictors of EMA response rate and using qualitative interviews. Further, we will use ILD to
uncover micro-temporal dynamics, bidirectional effects unfolding over a short amount of time. We will quantify
the heterogeneity between youths in micro-temporal dynamics by identifying ‘digital phenotypes,’ an individual-
specific web of links between social and built environmental determinants. The utility of digital phenotypes lies
in their ability to identify overlaps in ILD. This proposed K01 will provide developmental support for Dr. Tyler
Prochnow to: 1) obtain hands-on experience in the application of EMA methods in PA research; 2) train in the
evaluation of the built environment in PA research including geospatial analysis; and 3) develop an
understanding of intensive longitudinal data analysis and digital phenotyping applied to health behavior research.
The results of this proposed K01 project will generate significant new knowledge describing the built and social
environmental determinants of PA behavior among a diverse sample of youth in the summer. This project is
innovative in its application of both EMA and SNA techniques to characterize these relationships."

In the United States, approximately 6.2 million people live with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease
(AD). Postmenopausal women account for up to 70% of them. The overall goal of this proposed research is
to elucidate the progressive pathophysiological mechanisms by which menopausal hormone therapy (HT)
influences the risk of AD dementia in women. The applicant’s prior work showed that the timing of HT use
relative to menopause onset influences females’ susceptibility to the deposition AD pathology in later life. It
is critical that longitudinal cohort studies and randomized controlled trials are conducted to substantiate
these findings. During the K99 phase, the applicant will combine three observational studies (n=772) with
longitudinal biomarkers of AD, as measured with positron emission tomography (PET), to determine to
influence of HT and its timing on neocortical Aβ accumulation (over 6.5 years; Aim 1), region-specific tau
accumulation (over 4.2 years; Aim 1) and cognitive decline (over 7.4 years; Aim 2). To achieve these aims,
the applicant will leverage their existing strengths in neuroimaging, genetic-risk, cognitive neuroscience and
big data and gain expertise in following five areas of training: (1) PET-neuroimaging (2) Biofluids (3)
Statistics (4) Hormones and (5) Clinical trials (analytical approaches). With these skills, the applicant will be
well positioned in the R00 phase to conduct the final aim: to determine how early and late HT
randomization impacts the pathological progression of AD, relative to respective placebo groups, as
measured with multiple plasma AD biomarkers (Ab42/Ab40, p-tau181, p-tau217, p-tau231; Aim 3). In the R00,
the applicant will utilize existing samples from the Women Health Initiative; a landmark randomized
controlled trial on HT (n=3,472). Further, non-AD specific plasma biomarkers will be integrated to determine
how HT randomization impacts markers of astrogliosis (Glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFAP) and axonal
damage (Neurofilament light chain; NfL) and in addition, how GFAP and NfL may moderate the effect of HT
on the pathological progression of AD. A highly innovative component of this project is the use of cutting-
edge multi-modal measures of AD, wherein PET biomarkers and novel plasma biomarkers are integrated
across observations studies and a randomized controlled trial. Successful outcomes will alleviate
uncertainty regarding the downstream impact of HT on the brain and inform how exogenous hormones alter
the underlying neurobiology of AD. The project will highlight hormones as sex-specific risk factors
underlying sex differences in the prevalence of AD. These outcomes will have direct implications for AD
prevention and treatment strategies. For the applicant, this program will enhance a rapid transition to
independence using a short period of intensive training and mentorship from researchers at Massachusetts
General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, which will seamlessly intertwine with the aims of this proposed
research direction."
10767803,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading cause of chronic liver disease with a prevalence of 25%
in the general population. NAFLD is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, where it shows a prevalence up to
80%, and a strong progression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH, and advance stage of NAFLD). To date,
there are no FDA-approved pharmacological treatments for NAFLD. However, thiazolidinediones (TZD), which
are effective anti-diabetogenic drugs, may be used to treat NAFLD/NASH. Specifically, TZD activate peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) in adipocytes, macrophages, and hepatic stellate cells (HSC),
and they should reduce insulin resistance, inflammation, and fibrogenesis, respectively. Despite having some
positive effects, TZD are not currently used to treat NASH, and it is possible that their true potential as anti-
NASH drugs are indeed reduced by direct negative actions on hepatocyte function. In fact, our preliminary
studies show that hepatocyte PPARγ is a relevant factor in the regulation of hepatic gene expression that
contributes to the progression of NASH, and reduces the therapeutic effects of TZD in the liver of mice with
NASH. In this proposal, we hypothesize that hepatocyte PPARγ is a negative regulator of
phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT) and betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT),
disrupts methionine metabolism, and promotes NASH. In our Aim 1, we will define the contribution of hepatocyte
PEMT and BHMT in the TZD-mediated reversal of NASH. Specifically, we will restore the expression of PEMT
or BHMT with adeno-associated viruses in PPARγ-intact mice after the development of NASH and treat these
mice with TZD to reverse NASH. Also, hepatocyte PEMT and BHMT will be restored in mice with hepatocyte-
specific loss of PPARγ expression without a TZD treatment. This aim will show how PEMT and BHMT improve
liver health, and reduce steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis to enhance the therapeutic actions of TZD in the
reversal of NASH. In aim 2, we will determine if PPARγ directly disrupts the metabolism of methionine in
hepatocytes. Briefly, we will use targeted metabolomics in mouse and human primary hepatocytes or in perfused
livers of controls and mice with hepatocyte-specific loss of PPARγ expression that are treated with TZD. These
experiments will identify how TZD alters the use of methionine in hepatocytes, and contributes, in a hepatocyte-
specific PPARγ-dependent manner, to sustain steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis despite the positive actions
of TZD on adipocytes, macrophages, and HSC. Overall, in this proposal we will describe how hepatocyte-specific
PPARγ negatively regulates methionine metabolism to promote NAFLD, and to limit the potential of TZD as a
therapy for NASH. The outcomes of this project will lead us to develop therapeutic strategies that enhance the
use of TZD, and to develop new treatments for NAFLD and the care of NASH patients."

Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults, a subset of which have mutations in the metabolic
gene isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1). Cancer-associated IDH1 mutants (the most common of which is
IDH1R132H) are neomorphs that produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate [(R)-2HG], which is thought to
contribute to glioma formation. Mutant IDH (mIDH) inhibitors that block (R)-2HG production have been recently
shown to improve outcomes in lower-grade IDH-mutant glioma patients and are poised to become standard-of-
care. However, response to mIDH inhibitors is heterogeneous, and our understanding of how these drugs may
work in glioma has been severely limited by a lack of faithful animal models of lower-grade IDH-mutant gliomas.
 In an effort to better understand these unanswered questions regarding mIDH1 biology, I made a
genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model of mIDH1-driven grade 3 astrocytoma that circumvents key
limitations of existing models and provides the opportunity to address fundamental unanswered questions
regarding mIDH biology in lower-grade gliomas. I leveraged this GEM and other models to show that IDH-mutant
gliomas are sensitive to de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibitors (e.g. dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH)
inhibitors) due to an increased susceptibility of IDH-mutant cells to DNA damage caused by these drugs.
However, whether this sensitivity to DNA damage extends to other standard-of-care therapies, and the
mechanisms underlying these effects, is not fully understood. My overall objective is to leverage the key
advantages of my grade 3 IDH-mutant GEM to address fundamental questions regarding mutant IDH in glioma:
I will determine the response of my GEM model to mIDH inhibitors and evaluate molecular signatures of mIDH
inhibitor treatment, determine whether mIDH inhibitors and/or DHODH inhibitors alter response to radiation, and
identify mechanisms underlying how IDH-mutant gliomas respond to DNA damaging treatments.
 I am a radiation oncologist with a research background in glioma biology and a long-term goal of directing
my own independent laboratory as an academic physician scientist. I aim to focus my research on understanding
the mechanisms driving glioma growth, with the goal of harnessing this knowledge to develop novel therapeutic
strategies. I am conducting research in the laboratory of Dr. William G. Kaelin, Jr., MD at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute (DFCI), which I will continue during my proposed K08 research. As an Instructor, 80% of my time is
spent on research in the Kaelin lab and 20% is on patient care treating patients with glioma tumors. I have
assembled an expert Scientific Advisory Committee to help guide my research and career development: (1) Dr.

Cannabis is the most popular drug used amongst adolescents with many teens using more frequently than ever.
Although perceived as relatively harmless, adolescent consumption of ∆-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main
psychoactive constituent in cannabis, is associated with vulnerability to a variety of psychiatric conditions
including addiction. Parallel to increased use in teens, THC content in cannabis is now at unprecedented levels,
and emerging data shows use of high potency cannabis is specifically linked to the development of cannabis
use disorder (CUD). Unfortunately, research determining how adolescent high-dose THC (HD-THC) exposure
affects neurobiological circuits underlying psychiatric-like behaviors is still lacking. I therefore completed a battery
of experiments to disentangle the long-term effects of high dose THC on reward responsivity and stress reactivity
in rats. I observed that adolescent HD-THC (but not low dose) uniquely increased stress reactivity in adulthood,
a phenotype implicated in addiction risk. In stressed HD-THC rats, RNAseq of the basolateral amygdala (BLA),
a region implicated in stress reactivity and cognition, revealed distinct downregulation of astrocyte-specific genes
concomitant to upregulation in excitatory- and inhibitory-related genes. HD-THC animals also exhibited
decreased astrocyte process length and branching, indicating HD-THC-related stress reactivity is associated
with perturbations in astrocytes both on a transcriptomic and morphological level. HD-THC rats also exhibited
increased risky decision making and impulsivity after re-exposure to THC in adulthood, cognitive facets tightly
linked to multiple psychopathologies including substance use disorders. THC-induced cognitive deficits
correlated with BLA Gfap mRNA expression. These results indicate that astrocytes, and their interactions with
neurons, likely play a significant role in THC-induced behaviors in adulthood relevant to psychiatric risk. The
effect of adolescent HD-THC experience on the transcriptome and function of neuronal and astrocyte populations
has yet to be explained. Under the guidance of my mentor, Dr. Yasmin Hurd, and mentorship committee, Drs.
Anne Schaefer, Bin Zhang, Joseph Cheer, Eric Nestler, and Xiaosi Gu, I will use single-cell sequencing and fiber
photometry to determine how adolescent HD-THC exposure affects astrocyte transcriptomic diversity and
maturation (aim 1) and calcium activity (aim 2). I will then causally assess the role of astrocyte activity on THC-
related phenotypes (aim 3). After modulating astrocytes using chemogenetics, I will examine the effect on
neuronal transcriptomic landscape, as well as calcium activity during decision-making and after THC re-exposure
in adulthood. This research program will provide novel mechanistic insights into the protracted effect of
high-dose adolescent THC on astrocyte maturation, calcium activity and function in cognitive behavior
while providing me key skills to help my transition toward becoming an independent investigator."

Maintenance of the Animal Feed Regulatory Program Standards (AFRPS) and the
Development of Preventive Control Inspection Infrastructure by the Missouri Department
of Agriculture, Bureau of Feed, Seed.
Since Missouri is home to a significant percentage of the nation’s livestock and pet food
production, the regulation of feed is of vital importance for the protection of livestock feed and
pet food consumers and producers. As evidenced by recent significant feed adulteration events,
feed is an important link to the human food supply and is therefore an important element of the
human food safety equation.
The Bureau of Feed & Seed (Bureau) has regulatory responsibility of livestock feed and pet
food sold, manufactured and distributed in Missouri. The Bureau operates under the authority of
the Director of the Missouri Department of Agriculture and within the Division of Plant Industries
and also operates the Missouri Feed Control Laboratory (Lab). The Laboratory analyzes 5,000
surveillance feed samples annually. The feeds represented by these samples are produced
both in Missouri and across the nation and are obtained by program inspectors on a weekly
basis from manufacturing, distributing and retail firms.
The Bureau considers the implementation and maintenance of AFRPS as an important step in
fulfilling its role as a crucial and significant partner with FDA in the protection of this state’s and
our nation’s food supply. The Bureau‘s intent is to utilize cooperative agreement funds to
continue to meet the critical needs of the feed program to maintain full implementation of the
Standards and develop additional infrastructure to reach the capacity and capability to inspect
the full inventory of Missouri feed facilities for compliance with the Preventive Control Rule for
Animal Feed.
The feed program expects to utilize FDA Cooperative Agreement funds to improve program
capability in the following ways: Maintain inspection strength to provide sufficient risk based
inspections, provide education & outreach to industry, ensure appropriate program staff training
levels, build compliance and enforcement infrastructure, and acquire and maintain technology to
improve program productivity and efficiency in regulatory processes.
The Bureau is committed to enhancing its cooperation and collaboration with the FDA and other
state feed control programs by sharing data, best practices and processes, software
development and actively promoting and advancing the improvement of human and animal food
safety in an effort to bring continuous improvement to the partnership for food protection."

Dissecting the Mechanism of SETDB1 and its K867 Monoubiquitination in Lung Cancer Progression
 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide
and associated with high mutation burdens. During the last decade, biomarker-driven targeted therapies have
achieved clear clinical benefits in patients with several oncogenic driver mutations such as EGFR, BRAF and
ALK. However, the treatments for tumors with the most prevalent KRAS mutations remain challenging despite
of recent breakthrough in targeting KRAS-G12C mutation. In KRAS mutant NSCLC, the constitutively activated
downstream signaling ultimately leads to transcription reprogramming to sustain tumor growth and progression.
This process is orchestrated by a cohort of crucial transcription factors, whose temporal and spatial expression
is associated with distinct epigenetic changes. Thus, dissecting epigenetic mechanisms in this process could
open new avenues for targeting strategies. SETDB1 is a principal methyltransferase catalyzing histone H3K9
methylation, a major repressive epigenetic modification. The focal amplification and upregulation of SETDB1
have been observed in a wide range of cancers including NSCLC, suggesting it has pro-oncogenic function.
However, the mechanisms of action of SETDB1 in NSCLC remain elusive. In preliminary study, we uncovered
that SETDB1 upregulation in lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) correlates with poorer prognosis and significantly
co-occurs with KRAS gene alternations. In NSCLC cells harboring oncogenic RAS, SETDB1 loss attenuates
migration and invasion, invadopodia formation and ECM degradation. These phenotypic changes correlate
with reactivation of transcription factors FOXA2 and CDX2 which function as key regulatory nodes to impede
metastatic progression of KRAS mutant lung ADC. More importantly, Setdb1 loss in tumor cells derived from
metastatic KrasG12D;p53fl/fl lung ADC abolished their spontaneous ability to metastasize from the subcutaneous
tumor to the lungs. These findings argue for a novel concept that SETDB1-mediated epigenetic mechanisms
are critical for oncogenic KRAS-induced transcription reprogramming during lung ADC progression. Moreover,
we have demonstrated that SETDB1 is monoubiquitinated at lysine-867 by the UBE2E family of E2 enzymes
independent of E3s and this monoubiquitination is essential for SETDB1-mediated H3K9 methylation and ERV
silencing. Accordingly, one objective of this proposal is to delineate SETDB1's pro-metastatic activity in KRAS
mutant lung ADC using various genetically engineered mouse models and xenograft models. Another objective
is to dissect the mechanisms of lysine-867 monoubiquitination in SETDB1's pro-metastatic activity in vivo and
in vitro. Our central hypothesis is that SETDB1 plays important roles in KRAS mutant lung ADC progression
through epigenetic mechanisms that require its monoubiquitination dependent enzymatic activity. This project
is significant because it will characterize SETDB1 as an actionable drug target in KRAS mutant lung cancer
and identify novel molecular interfaces for targeting. Our long-term goal is to develop better and more effective
therapeutic strategies by delineating epigenetic mechanisms in lung cancer."
10891409,"The goal of the project is to diminish the morbidity and mortality associated with esophageal cancer as patients
with this cancer continue to suffer from extremely poor survival and high case-fatality rates. Esophageal
adenocarcinoma (EAC) is the most common histologic type of esophageal malignancy in the US and has
experienced an alarmingly rapid and largely unexplained rise in incidence over the past four decades in much
of the western world. Previous attempts to curb the morbidity and mortality associated with EAC in the US
have focused on an endoscopic screening, which is invasive and costly. However, innovative new technologies
for esophageal cancer screening that are both less invasive and costly have created the opportunity to lower
the bar for screening to where it could be a realistic option, particularly for those who are higher risk.
While the performance metrics of the device are important, equally critical are identifying and resolving barriers
to implementation. We propose to study potential factors for patients, providers and health care systems that
could impede screening programs.
This R01 proposal will leverage a previously developed and validated natural history simulation model of EAC.
The PI has made significant contributions to the fields of esophageal cancer screening, prevention and treatment
utilizing the EAC model to assess and analyze critical aspects of EAC cancer control. The prior work and model
will provide an exceptionally strong foundation for the current research project. The research team is comprised
of experienced investigators who provide the broad and complementary expertise necessary for this project and
have a track record of successful collaboration.
The overarching premise of our proposal is that novel approaches to esophageal cancer screening have the
potential to improve EAC mortality, but that the successful implementation and population impact will depend
on: 1) the screening modality characteristics; 2) patient, provider, and health system’s barriers; and 3) the
profile of the patients to be screened. We will accomplish these project goals by completing four specific aims.
In Aim 1 we will use our validated simulation model of esophageal cancer to test and assess whether a cell
sampling device can be cost-effective for population screening. In Aim 2 we will study potential patient,
provider and health system barriers to esophageal cancer screening. For Aim 3 we will personalize screening
by determining which patient profiles will benefit from screening. Finally, in Aim 4 will assess the population
cancer control impact of the potential implementation of the esophageal cancer screening strategy defined by
the prior aims.
By award period end, we will have developed a personalized approach to targeted EAC screening that is
rational and cost-effective."
10891410,"Project Summary/Abstract
 The objective of this project is to improve the treatment of depression in cancer patients. Up to 25% of
people with cancer will become clinically depressed, significantly affecting their quality of life and functioning.
Depression has been associated with a decreased ability to tolerate and complete cancer treatment, as well as
significantly increased healthcare costs. Unfortunately, about 75% of cancer patients with depression do not
receive adequate treatment, and patients in rural settings are even less likely to receive adequate treatment.
Reasons for this large treatment gap include: (1) lack of standard processes for psychosocial follow-up and
treatment adjustments; (2) inadequate availability of mental health clinicians with experience in behavioral and
psychopharmacologic treatment of cancer patients; (3) patient inability to follow up with psychosocial treatment
due to medical illness, financial barriers, and transportation and other logistical barriers; and (4) ongoing stigma
and lack of engagement related to mental health care.
 Collaborative Care Management (CoCM) is an evidence-based system of care that has been shown to
lead to sustained improvement in depression symptoms and quality of life in patients with cancer and other
medical conditions. CoCM is a population-based, integrated care approach, where care managers, who are
clinicians such as social workers, nurses or psychologists, deliver behavioral treatments, coordinate
psychosocial care, monitor outcomes, and adjust treatment with the input of a psychiatric consultant. Although
the CoCM model has been shown in a recent meta-analysis to be highly effective in the cancer setting,
high-fidelity implementation has been slow, particularly in low-resourced and rural areas. The use of
technology has the potential to enhance implementation and fidelity of CoCM in diverse cancer settings.
 This proposed study will use a human-centered design approach to develop, build, and test a web and mobile
platform to enhance the implementation and fidelity of CoCM of depression for patients being treated at urban
and rural cancer centers. In Phase I of the study, patient-facing web and mobile applications and a clinician-facing
website will aim to: (1) enhance treatment engagement among patients and clinicians; (2) collect timely
patient-reported outcomes for measurement-based care; (3) promote patient-centered shared decision-making
for better treatment adjustments; and (4) maximize adherence to evidence-based guideline-level behavioral
and pharmacologic treatments. In Phase II of the study, the technology-enhanced CoCM system (t-CoCM) will
be compared to usual CoCM (u-CoCM) in a pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation
randomized controlled trial to evaluate their ability to achieve optimal fidelity of CoCM and clinical outcomes."
10891413,"Hypoparathyroidism (HPT) is a rare disorder characterized by low parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium
levels. Patients suffer consequences of hypocalcemia, including paresthesias, arrhythmias, and seizures.
Conventional treatment to prevent these life-threatening events is calcium and active vitamin D. However,
complications of HPT, including kidney and cardiovascular disease, cataracts, basal ganglia calcifications and
neuropsychiatric disorders, occur despite, and possibly due to, conventional treatment. Although we found
increased bone calcification may be beneficial to the skeleton, calcification of end-organs may be fully or partially
responsible for these complications. Registry, retrospective, and claims studies have reported vascular
calcifications in HPT patients; we noted brain calcifications, and observational data document coronary artery
calcifications. Other HPT-associated metabolic derangements may also be contributory. Unfortunately, the
pathogenesis, epidemiology, natural history, and links between HPT, end-organ diseases, vascular
calcifications, and other derangements are unclear. This represents a significant scientific gap and impedes the:
(1) diagnosis, monitoring, mitigation, and prevention of HPT associated complications; (2) development, study,
and implementation of new strategies to prevent HPT-associated end-organ damage; and (3) ability to conduct
studies leading to advances in the HPT treatment paradigm. These gaps are particularly relevant in light of PTH
treatment, a developing off-label therapeutic for HPT. PTH treatment had pro-calcific side effects reported in
FDA registry trials for osteoporosis and its possible role in calcification and end-organ diseases in HPT are not
clear. Indeed, although studies reported that HPT managed with conventional treatment was associated with
kidney function decline, we found that kidney function did not decline in patients managed with PTH instead of
conventional therapy. Also, our data suggest a link between altered bone gene expression and dysregulation of
calcium. We identified circulating microRNAs highly associated with low bone turnover, a major risk factor for
extra-skeletal calcification. Data suggest these same miRs may be involved in vascular calcification
development. This application will provide a rigorous standardized approach to longitudinal data collection in
HPT on end-organ damage and calcification propensity. Our central hypothesis is that a natural history cohort of
HPT enables the study of end-organ complications. We also hypothesize that end-organ disease is related to
calcification propensity and severity. The Aims are to: 1) Build a prospective cohort of longitudinally followed
HPT patients to study the epidemiology and clinical impact of end-organ damage; 2). Determine the organ-
specific physiologic consequences of HPT; 3). Elucidate determinants of HPT-associated end-organ damage
from biochemical testing and calcification imaging. For the first time, prospective natural history data in this rare
disease will define a dynamic model of HPT-associated end-organ damage. Thus, the data will be critical to
inform development, study, and implementation of strategies to mitigate HPT-associated co-morbidities."
10892670,"Abstract: Biostatistics Facility (BF)
The Biostatistics Facility (BF) is a UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) shared resource that provides
experimental designs and data analyses for clinical, pre-clinical and translational research at HCC. Each HCC
disease center has a contact statistician who oversees the support of that center’s clinical trials, grant
applications, and pre-clinical and translational research. The laboratory-based and population programs are
also served by statisticians selected on the basis of disease focus and technical specialty (e.g., RNAseq
expression statistical analysis). The master statisticians support the programmatic biostatisticians’ work and
also function independently. In addition to traditional statistical methods, the faculty and staff are proficient in
Bayesian, computationally intense and machine learning methods. BF worked closely with the Cancer
Therapeutics, Cancer Biology, Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy, Biobehavioral Cancer Control,
Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, and Cancer Virology programs in the last funding cycle. BF personnel
regularly interact with Cancer Bioinformatics Services, Cancer Genome Facility and IMCPL to ensure the
integrity and appropriate statistical analyses of biomarker and -omics data. BF personnel meet on a nearly
daily basis with CPDM to ensure that clinical trials are designed, implemented, completed and reported in
accordance with the requirements of the Department of Health and Human Services. Due to the rapidly
increasing complexity of research technology for DNA sequencing and genotyping, RNA sequencing and
expression, targeting and discovery proteomics, and immunoassays, programmatic statisticians work closely
with biostatisticians (some who are also programmatic biostatisticians, and some outside the BF),
bioinformaticians, epidemiologists and informaticians who are experts in these platforms. Over 95% of the BF
effort is dedicated to cancer-related research HCC."

10892682,"Abstract: In Vivo Imaging Facility (IVIF) 
Advances in cancer management require the development of new therapies, and state-of-the-art imaging 
technologies are needed to assess response to those therapies. The Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) In Vivo 
Imaging Facility (IVIF) provides novel quantitative imaging techniques that trace biomarkers of molecular 
events and immunotherapy response associated with effective cancer therapy. Validation of advanced imaging 
techniques that are specific for relevant cellular processes are required to detect and measure the efficacy of 
novel anticancer therapies and measure early tumoricidal response. As part of this facility, PET tracers 
targeting various tumor markers and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, as well as complementary 
optical and MR methodologies, are being developed to sensitively and specifically quantify drug-cancer cell 
interactions. The IVIF provides a critical shared resource for testing PET tracers in in vivo rodent models of 
cancer and validating promising agents in humans through quantitative imaging trials. The overall goal of the 
IVIF is to provide pre-clinical and clinical imaging services to HCC investigators to assist in visualizing 
mechanisms of biomarker action, provide approaches for early disease detection, and monitor therapeutic 
efficacy. The IVIF supports all 7 programs at HCC, and has contributed to high impact publications in 
Immunity, Cancer Cell, Theranostics and Nature Communications, among other journals. IVIF had 76 users of 
which 66 were HCC investigators. Of the 66 HCC users, 42 had peer-reviewed funding. 
The Specific Aims of the IVIF: (1) Assess biomarker expression throughout cancer treatment using a single

Key Services Include: (1) PET radiotracer development and production for human PET-CT and PET-MRI; (2) 
pre-clinical PET-CT and clinical or preclinical assessment of biomarker expression during cancer treatment; 
and (3) developing methods for monitoring drug treatments and other types of therapy with PET-CT, CT, 
and/or MRI through the use of molecular imaging, standard imaging assessments, tumor volumetrics, 
radiomics and radiogenomics."
10892683,"Abstract: Tissue and Research Pathology Services (TARPS)
One of the essential components of any translational research investigation is the availability of high quality,
appropriately selected human biospecimen samples. The Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) recognized the value
of a good, systematic, scientifically, and ethically correct biospecimen repository more than 18 years ago and
implemented a system-wide initiative for tissue and biological specimen accrual with the establishment of the
Tissue and Research Pathology Service (TARPS) Shared Resource under the umbrella of the University of
Pittsburgh (Pitt) resource also known as the Pitt Biospecimen Core (formerly the Health Sciences Tissue
Bank). TARPS has been housed and extensively supported by HCC and the Department of Pathology. This
has led to the development of a well-organized biospecimen resource, providing high-quality, well-banked
specimens with extensive database support providing the clinical annotation so essential to good research.
TARPS is a CAP-certified biorepository and serves as the central hub, acquiring and triaging biospecimen
materials and de-identified patient information. It is currently housed within the Department of Pathology
diagnostic evaluation facilities, thus providing immediate access to specimens and patient information of
interest. The resource has Pathologist administrative oversight and medical supervision at the three flagship
hospitals (Presbyterian, Shadyside, Magee), and the largest community hospital (Passavant), with plans in
progress to add Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh later in 2019.
At HCC, TARPS has played an instrumental role in supporting multi-investigator and multi-institutional efforts
including: The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA); the caHUB project as a funded site for the Biospecimen
Pre-analytical Variables (BPV) task order; the NCI’s Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC),
SPOREs in lung, head and neck, melanoma and skin, and ovarian cancers and many other collaborative team
science projects. In FY2019, 65 out of 121 users were HCC members representing 6 CCSG research
programs (CB, CEP, CII, CT, CV and GS). Usage was stable from 79% to 91% between 2015 and 2019."
10892685,"Abstract: Genome Stability (GS)
The Genome Stability (GS) Program is devoted to understanding the molecular pathways that maintain
genome integrity, how these processes are altered in cancer cells, and finally how these alterations may be
exploited to kill tumor cells. This program has four broad themes: (1) mechanisms of genome stability, (2)
radiation and oxidative damage, (3) genotoxic stress responses, and (4) aging and cancer. Fundamental
research in genome stability is essential for advancing understanding of the mechanisms of tumor formation
and provides a valuable source of novel targets and strategies for cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.
Significant highlights of the program have been seminal discoveries regarding the action of DNA repair
proteins at the single molecule level, the use of targeted oxidative base damage at telomeres to study
subsequent telomere dysfunction, the role of the alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathway in
aggressive neuroblastoma tumors, development of approaches to mitigate radiation damage, mechanistic
insights into cell death pathways including ferroptosis, and the use of ATR inhibitors in conjunction with ionizing
radiation or cisplatin to kill tumor cells through enhanced immune responses. Growth and impact of the
program has been greatly enhanced by recruiting 18 new faculty from across the University of Pittsburgh and
through HCC-supported recruitment. This Program is co-directed by Patricia Opresko, PhD and Bennett Van
Houten, PhD. Dr. Opresko is a Professor of Environmental and Occupational Health who is internationally

10892686,"Abstract: Cancer Virology (CV) 
Viruses are the cause of approximately 15% of human cancers. While significant advancements have been 
made in the last few decades, there is no vaccine or specific targeted therapy for numerous cancer viruses 
and their associated malignancies. The mission of the Cancer Virology (CV) Program, which is closely aligned 
with that of Hillman Cancer Center (HCC), is to prevent and cure viral and nonviral cancer by acquiring new 
knowledge of viral infection. CV members will achieve this goal by identifying new cancer pathways targeted 
by cancer viruses (Aim 1); identifying novel therapeutic targets/agents for viral cancer and developing new 
anticancer virus-based therapeutics (Aim 2); identifying novel biomarkers for viral cancers (Aim 3); and 
discovering new cancer-causing viruses (Aim 4). To facilitate the execution of these specific aims, CV has 
developed tangible goals, which are to establish a productive, highly collaborative group of investigators 
devoted to these aims, provide unique intellectual resources to HCC in the area of cancer virology, and build 
an exceptional research program with multiple generations of scientists studying cancer viruses. As an 
integral program of HCC, CV takes advantage of the exceptional academic environment and rich resources of 
HCC. CV achieves these goals by providing fertile ground for fundamental cancer research using cancer 
viruses and viral cancers as model systems, active recruitment of investigators in cancer virology, support for 
internal and external interactions and collaborations, for program symposiums, for internal and external 
seminars and retreats and for pilot project research in cancer virology, stimulation of research in the catchment

progression. The main objective of CB is to foster basic discoveries of molecular and cellular mechanisms of
cancer that are then used in other Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) programs to advance translational and clinical
research. The program is led by Ronald Buckanovich, MD, PhD and Steffi Oesterreich, PhD. Buckanovich
is Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Hematology-Oncology, and Oesterreich is Professor and
Vice-Chair in the Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology. These two leaders have highly
complementary expertise that they use to synergistically drive the thematic goals of the program.
CB has three primary themes: (a) hormone response and signaling, (b) drug resistance and metastases, and
(c) data science. CB has world-class investigators focused on these cancer-relevant thematic areas. All three
areas are characterized by extensive collaborations within and across various other programs, and are
significantly facilitated by the expertise and equipment available through HCC shared resources. The aims of
CB are to: (1) discover and elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms of cancer initiation, progression and
metastases, (2) transfer program discoveries to other HCC programs for application in the clinic in the form of
novel preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic approaches, (3) educate and mentor the next generation of cancer
biologists, (4) accelerate research in areas of special importance in our catchment area, particularly through
the work directed at the high incidence and mortality of breast and prostate cancers, and finally (5) facilitate
collaborations within and outside CB via seminars, regular meetings, focused symposia, and a yearly retreat.
CB has 43 members representing 17 academic departments and 5 schools within the University of Pittsburgh.

10892689,"Abstract: Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention (CEP)
The overarching goal of the Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention (CEP) Program is to reduce cancer burden
and mortality in our catchment area and beyond through three interactive themes on the continuum from
cancer initiations to cancer prevention and early detection. Theme 1 is Discovery of Risk and Causative
Factors for Cancer Development and Progression with a specific aim to discover and characterize novel
modifiable and unmodifiable risk and causal factors for cancer development. Theme 2 is Cancer Prevention
with a specific aim to discover and evaluate novel anti-cancer natural compounds and vaccines for reduction of
cancer incidence. Theme 3 is Cancer Screening and Early Detection with a specific aim to develop and
validate novel biomarkers and modern imaging technologies for early diagnosis of cancer, for improvement of
cancer outcomes and reduction of cancer death. These themes reflect major working groups and initiatives
that coalesce program members with other cancer center investigators, through inter-programmatic
collaborations to achieve these specific aims.
Under the leadership of James Herman, MD (co-leader) and Jian-Min Yuan, MD, PhD (co-leader), the CEP
has 26 members representing 11 departments in 2 schools of the University of Pittsburgh. These Program
members have been awarded $5.4M (annual total direct) research grant funding, of which $3.6M is from the
NCI and $1.8M from other sources. All CEP members are engaged in cancer-relevant research focusing on
the discovery of novel risk/causative factors for the development of cancer, the efficacy of primary cancer
prevention strategies and effectiveness of cancer screening and early detection methods. CEP members
collaborate with and compliment the efforts of the BCC program, which focuses on implementation of risk
behavioral change programs such as smoking cessation and weight control and reduction. Between 2015 and
August 2019, CEP members published 639 cancer-relevant papers that resulted from 10% intra-programmatic,
27% inter-programmatic, and 81% inter-institutional collaborations and included high-impact publications in
Science, Nature, JAMA, Lancet, JNCI, and JCO. The program members bring their scientific vigor and
population-based research expertise to UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) and provide unique education
and training experience to the next generation of scientists to conduct cutting-edge translational research on
cancer etiology and prevention. With the outstanding support of HCC, this highly effective CEP has
successfully created synergy among the Program members with members of HCC other programs as well as
other cancer centers, which have resulted in many team science projects that advance the program’s research
agenda. Guided by the HCC strategic plan, the CEP members will develop and build large initiatives and
implement research projects that have significant impact on cancer burden in the HCC catchment area."
10892690,"Abstract: Biobehavioral Cancer Control (BCC)
Recognizing the importance of research focused on the person in whom cancer develops and is treated, as
well as on the tumor itself, Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) has included a program focused on behavioral issues
in oncology since its inception in 1985. The overarching goal of the Biobehavioral Cancer Control (BCC)
Program is to reduce the burden of cancer across all phases of the cancer control continuum, from cancer risk
through cancer survivorship, via research centered on behavioral factors and the patient/person experience.
Grounded in the behavioral sciences, program investigators conduct preclinical, translational, and clinical
research studies (including randomized interventional trials) that are largely encompassed by two central
themes: (1) Cancer risk reduction focuses on behavioral factors known to contribute to cancer risk,
particularly tobacco use and the biobehavioral mechanisms underlying the initiation, maintenance and
cessation of tobacco use; and (2) Cancer survivorship focuses on characterization of disease and treatment-
related symptoms in cancer survivors, the biobehavioral mechanisms underlying those symptoms, and
personalized management strategies to prevent or reduce cancer and cancer therapy-related symptoms and
improve outcomes. BCC is a highly transdisciplinary program with a strong track record of research
productivity as evidenced by publications and grant support. Under the leadership of Catherine Bender, PhD,
RN and Dana Bovbjerg, PhD, BCC has 45 members representing 15 departments and 6 schools within the
University of Pittsburgh. BCC members conduct cancer-focused research supported by $5.4M in total annual
direct funding of which $3.3M is NCI funding, $2.0M is other peer-reviewed and $0.1M is non-peer-reviewed. A
return of $3.2M was obtained on investment of $251K of CCSG developmental funds. From 2015-2019, BCC
members published 493 cancer-related publications representing 17% intra-programmatic, 16% inter-
programmatic, and 58% inter-institutional collaborations. Consistent with HCC’s overall strategic plan and the
cancer challenges of our catchment area, the specific aims of BCC are to: (a) investigate behavioral factors
known to contribute to cancer risk reduction, with a particular focus on biobehavioral mechanisms underlying
initiation, maintenance, and cessation of tobacco use (Theme 1); (b) develop and test innovative biobehavioral
interventions to reduce cancer risk behaviors with a particular emphasis on tobacco use and cancer prevention
behaviors (Theme 1); (c) characterize disease and treatment-related symptoms in cancer survivors including
the biobehavioral mechanisms underlying those symptoms (Theme 2); and (d) develop and test personalized
management strategies to prevent or reduce cancer and cancer therapy-related symptoms and improve
adherence to therapy, quality of life, and functional ability of cancer survivors (Theme 2). These aims will be
addressed with key HCC support for BCC research activities at both strategic and logistical levels."
10898382,"Abstract:
Older adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD) present on the spectrum of Alzheimer's Disease and Related
Dementias (ADRD) approximately 10 years earlier than age and sex matched controls. The prevalence of
accelerated age-related cognitive decline and dementia is remarkably high in older adults with CKD, affecting
as many as 20-50%. Cognitive impairment in this population leads to poor health outcomes, decreased
medication and medical care adherence, functional decline and an accelerated loss of independence, and
premature institutionalization. The accelerated age-related cognitive decline in patients with CKD is due, in
part, to the CKD disease process itself, which leads to a reduction in white matter integrity that is
superimposed on accelerated neurodegeneration of brain regions including atrophy of the hippocampus.
Moreover, reduced kidney function is independently associated with lower cerebral blood flow leading to
cerebral hypoperfusion, which further exacerbates cognitive decline. Current treatment regimens for CKD do
not include strategies to prevent accelerated cognitive decline and related dementia. The available
pharmaceutical therapies to enhance cognition have only modest short-term effects on slowing cognitive
impairment, have intolerable side effects, and require dose-reduction in CKD patients. Thus, there is a
pressing need to develop non-pharmacological therapies to prevent or forestall cognitive decline in older adults
with CKD at risk for ADRD. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that a 6-month home-based
walking exercise program in 116 older adults with mild cognitive impairment and CKD will improve executive
function, cognitive subdomains, brain white matter integrity, structure, and functional connectivity compared to
attention control. We will achieve this objective by addressing the following specific aims. 1: Does exercise
work? Quantify change in executive cognitive function (primary outcome), and cognitive subdomains. 2. For
whom does exercise work? Examine if factors (e.g. age, sex, cognitive impairment, and, comorbid
conditions) moderate exercise-induced improvement in cognitive function domains at 6-months. 3. How does
exercise work? Using MRI we will quantify change from baseline to 6-months in white matter integrity,
functional connectivity, cerebral blood flow and perfusion, and hippocampal volume. We will also evaluate the
mediation effects of total exercise volume on cognitive function domains and MRI measures at 6-months. Our
long-term goal is to develop community-based, behavioral interventions to prevent age-related cognitive
decline and ADRD in at risk populations across the lifespan. This study will address a critical gap in our
understanding of the use of exercise in the prevention and treatment of accelerated age-related cognitive
decline in older adults with CKD and mild cognitive impairment. By combining cognitive function assessment
with MRI, we will be able to evaluate the brain-behavior response to exercise and discern the relationships at a
level previously not conducted in this population. The potential clinical impact is high and readily translatable."
10892829,"The lack of effective treatment against cancer metastasis is in large part due to the complexity of the metastatic
transformation process and incomplete understanding of the key underlying mechanisms. The list of genes and
pathways associated with carcinogenesis is growing and anti-cancer agents targeting single gene activities have
reached clinics and shown primary tumor growth inhibition. However, these agents fall short in effectively treating
metastasis, leading to poor long-term patient survival and reinforcing the challenge of cancer complexity. It has
long been a clinical practice to grade the levels of malignancy based on morphological changes of tumor cells
and tissues, where a high-grade cancer generally correlates with poor patient outcomes, suggesting cancer
specific pathognomonic features can be used as readouts for the malignant potential of cancer tissues. Here we
utilize a “top-down” approach, in which specific subcellular pathognomonic structures unique to metastatic
potential are used as surrogate markers for malignancy. We reason that such cellular substructures should
reflect the complex and unique malignant properties better than any single gene or gene product. These
structures not only provide an in vitro experimental platform (cell lines) to investigate the key factors important
for cancer metastasis (and subsequent in vivo validations), but also serve as a phenotypic marker for anti-cancer
drug development. To this end, we have validated the perinucleolar compartment (PNC), a nuclear body, as
such a marker for cancer cell malignant behavior.
PNCs are highly prevalent in metastatic tumors and PNC prevalence positively correlates with disease
progression and inversely correlates with patient outcomes in several cancers. Using PNC prevalence reduction
as a phenotypic marker for metastasis in a high-content screen, we developed the phase I clinical candidate
metarrestin, a potent PNC inhibitor for a large array of cancer cell lines. Metarrestin inhibits invasion in vitro,
blocks metastatic development in three mouse models of human cancers, and extends survival of mice in a
metastatic pancreatic cancer xenograft model without discernable adverse effects.
This proposal describes a two-pronged approach for the development new anti-metastasis therapeutic leads.
We have identified eEF1A2 as a molecular target for metarrestin and will use inter-disciplinary, complementary
approaches to leverage interactions with eEF1A2 to develop more potent PNC prevalence inhibitors as next
generation therapeutic leads. In parallel, we will use PNC prevalence as a phenotypic readout to interrogate
additional structurally distinct high-throughput screening hits. These hits have been vetted for PNC activity,
counterscreened for cytoxicity and DNA binding, and confirmed to possess efficacy in in vitro migration and
invasion experiments. Both complementary approaches capitalize on the knowledge gained from the
development of metarrestin and facilitate the development of new therapeutic leads and chemical tools for
investigating the role of eEF1A2 and PNCs in metastasis."
10892830,"Project Summary
High-density lipoproteins (HDL) are the single strongest predictors of longevity and protect against a wide array
of diseases, from chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration, to acute infection and
sepsis mortality, and everything in between. If we can get HDL right, we can live long, healthy lives. Yet despite
over 50 years of research, HDL have remained an enigma and therapeutic approaches for improving HDL
function have proven elusive. HDL are highly heterogeneous and difficult to isolate and characterize because of
their colloidal, multi-molecular nature yet very small size (< 20 nm in diameter). A critical barrier to progress is
the lack of technologies to simultaneously quantify the size and number of HDL particles, and isolate them such
that they remain intact and amenable for a variety of both compositional and functional analyses. The objectives
of this project are to gain new technological knowledge on the application of our instrument using size exclusion
chromatography coupled with multiple inline static and dynamic optical detectors, and to measure the
quantitative advantages of this technology over state-of-the-art approaches for the isolation and physicochemical
characterization of HDL particles. In particular, this project will solve the critical problem of quantifying the number
of particles using a non-destructive approach that simultaneously measures and fractionates the particles by
size, making it possible to evaluate the function and composition of different size-based HDL subclasses on a
per particle basis. Currently, researchers are limited by the simple problem of not having a good denominator:
the only option is to express the amount of an important constituent or functional capacity in the HDL we have
measured based on a rough substitute for “concentration” (e.g. total protein in the isolated fraction). Therefore,
if there is more of a certain protein (or higher functional capacity) in sample A vs. B, there is no way to distinguish
whether that is simply because sample A has more particles in it or whether there are more molecules of that
protein (or higher functional capacity) per particle. Different sizes of HDL carry different absolute and relative
amounts of individual proteins, lipids, and other components, from as few as 2 molecules of the main
apolipoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, and 12 molecules of cholesteryl ester in the smallest HDL, to as many as 4-6
molecules of apolipoprotein A-I and hundreds of molecules of cholesteryl ester, with similar variability in the
concentrations of other critical components that confer dozens of functions, from antioxidant, to
immunomodulatory, to anti-proteolytic to name a few. And because particle size determines binding affinity to
receptors, clearance rates, and likely even whether HDL can cross the blood-brain-barrier, knowing the number
of particles of different sizes, and also the per particle composition of the cargo they carry is critical to the
development of sensitive, actionable diagnostics, and targeted, effective therapeutics. Thus, the technology
developed in this project will profoundly enable the biomedical research community to answer critical questions
about HDL functional biology across a broad array of clinical and therapeutic applications."
10892804,"Project Summary/Abstract
Listed in the WHO top nine most dangerous pathogens, SFTSV has 12-30% fatality rates, rapidly
spreads through tick-to-animal/human, human-to-human and animal-to-human and induces
immunopathogenic disease with a characteristic thrombocytopenia. Virus reassortment is a process
of genetic recombination that is exclusive to segmented RNA viruses in which co-infection of a cell
of natural host and vector with multiple viruses may result in the shuffling of gene segments to
generate progeny viruses with novel genome combinations. Reassortment greatly affects virus
fitness and directly influences antigenic variation, confounding available methods of virus control. In
this application, we will test the hypothesis that tick-mediated natural course of SFTSV infection and
reassortment introduces phenotypic changes of fitness, transmissibility, antigenicity, or pathogenicity
into progeny reassortants. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the natural course of SFTSV
infection and reassortment for fitness, immunogenicity, transmissibility, and pathogenesis in in vitro
and in vivo animal models and H. longicornis ticks, ultimately bridging basic research to clinical
application."

10893404,"PROJECT SUMMARY (ABSTRACT)
Water-washed diseases (infections related to inadequate water access and poor sanitation) are a preventable
public health issue that continues to affect the 1.4 million people in the U.S. who still lack access to basic water
and sanitation. The COVID-19 pandemic brought to the forefront a reminder that Native American households
are 19 times more likely to lack indoor plumbing than White households. Historically, AN communities with a
lower proportion of in-home piped water and sanitation services have disproportionately higher rates of
respiratory and skin infections compared to plumbed communities, and these infection rates decreased after the
installation of in-home water services in some communities. Inadequate funding, engineering challenges,
affordability, and now climate change have hindered the installation and maintenance of centralized piped water
and sewer systems in remote Alaska. There is therefore an urgent need to evaluate whether novel, targeted
water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions reduce water-wash disease disparities. To address this
need, this study will evaluate the impact of a targeted WASH intervention developed specifically for American
Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) communities, known as the Portable Alternative Sanitation System (PASS), on
water use, waste management, water-wash disease and well-being (defined by both biomedical and locally-
defined categories) over time in AN households. We will do this through two Specific Aims: 1) Characterize the
lived experiences of household water- and sanitation security (HWSS), health, and well-being in remote AN
households across the water and sanitation service spectrum using community-based measures and 2) Evaluate
the impact of the PASS on in-home water storage and use, quality of life, water security and reliability, and
prevalence of water-washed diseases. Through this mixed methods, longitudinal study, we will provide evidence
that demonstrates how a targeted WASH intervention affects water-wash diseases, in-home water use and
waste management, and overall well-being in AIAN communities. This will also enable tribes, tribal health
organizations, and related stakeholders beyond Alaska to evaluate the PASS system to decide if it is appropriate
for their own communities. This study builds on our previous work in the community of Kivalina with a greater
sample size, comparison of data from piped and unpiped households, and longitudinal data from the post-COVID
era. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal evaluation of how an in-home point-of-use water treatment
and waterless toilet system affects household water and sanitation security, health, and well-being in an Arctic,
Indigenous context."
10893412,"Administrative Core: Summary
The strong nutrition, obesity and metabolism research base at UCSF is composed of 58 investigators from 22
departments or organized research units and four schools across 7 UCSF Campuses, as well as UC Berkeley.
The primary purpose of the UCSF NORC Administrative Core is to ensure that all components of the UCSF-
NORC are working in unison in order to maximally benefit this critical set of investigators. This is achieved by
an administrative infrastructure that provides mechanisms to ensure the integration of cross-departmental,
multidisciplinary research programs and shared research facilities, cohesion in educational/seminar programs,
and the coordinated facilitation of support for pilot research in emerging obesity and nutrition research areas.
The Administrative Core provides leadership, infrastructure, administrative support, advice and oversight to all
UCSF-NORC operations and to the members of the UCSF-NORC community. The Administrative Core
supplies the central support for day-to-day operation and continuously develops the NORC's long-term visions
and strategies. It also provides the interface to obesity and nutrition researchers from institutions across
Northern California, to other NIH NORCs, to the NIDDK, and to the lay community. An efficiently operating
Administrative Core facilitates the goal of understanding, and developing new methods to treat, prevent and
ultimately cure, the underlying causes and complications of health concerns related to nutrition, obesity and
metabolism.
To achieve those aims, the UCSF NORC Administrative Core will continue to:
· Facilitate and monitor progress within, and among, the NORC research thematic areas.
· Provide oversight of UCSF-NORC shared resources of special need for nutrition, obesity and metabolism
studies to enhance the efficiency of human and basic research within the NORC.
· Support a Pilot & Feasibility Program to cultivate the development of new sustainable, research programs
centered on obesity, nutritional and metabolism themes.
· Support an Enrichment Program that both provides research information and fosters collaborations within and
among obesity- and nutrition-related research disciplines.
· Provide the organizational structure for effective mentoring of NORC investigators.
Through its programs and services, the Administrative Core will thus bring together a community of
investigators from interrelated disciplines to enhance and extend the effectiveness of nutrition, obesity and
metabolism research at UCSF and beyond.!"
10893413,"Biomedical Core A (Human Metabolism): Summary
The UCSF-NORC has facilitated clinical and translational studies in humans. During the first award period,
members of the UCSF-NORC had greater access to clinical research facilities and services that are housed in
different research units and departments, and the NORC administrative infrastructure was able to efficiently
coordinate their activities to serve NORC research needs. The NORC Human Metabolism Core will continue to
provide that coordinating function to integrate Core activities with NORC research, and will facilitate greater
access to a metabolic laboratory assay unit in this new grant period. The current and newly proposed NORC
Human Metabolism Core services include:
1) Body composition, exercise, and metabolism testing to measure metabolic output and functional
performance, as well as total and regional fat content, lean body mass and bone density.
2) One of the world's most advanced radiologic imaging facilities that will visualize and quantitatively
measure anatomical structures and their intra-tissue lipid and water content.
3) Consultation services to provide assistance with nutrition and biobehavioral measurements, research
study design, participant recruitment, biostatistical analysis, data management, and grant/manuscript editing.
4) Clinical research services to assist with participant measurements, metabolic procedures, phlebotomy,
and biospecimen processing and shipments.
5) In the current application, we propose to expand our Core services to include a new metabolic
laboratory assay service which will run hormone, adipokine and inflammatory panel assays for NORC-related
studies.
Currently, 23 of the total 58 UCSF-NORC investigators use or plan to use the Human Metabolism Core
services to conduct obesity-related studies and measure metabolism, physical activity, nutrition, body fat
content and distribution, and a range of obesity related laboratory biomarkers With the breadth of research
programs at UCSF, continued NORC support for a dedicated NORC Human Metabolism Core will enable
exciting research programs to pursue novel, previously unexplored directions in obesity, nutrition and/or
metabolism research."
10893417,"Biomedical Core B (Mouse Metabolism): Summary
The study of obesity, nutrition, and metabolism relies on methods to measure feeding patterns, metabolic rate,
activity, body composition, and fat distribution. Model organisms are a mainstay in the study of metabolism,
obesity, and its consequences. Laboratory mice are the most fundamental and common models for studying in
vivo physiology and disease pathophysiology, and the UCSF NORC Biomedical Mouse Metabolism Core
(Core B) is specifically geared to measure a wide variety of metabolic parameters in mice, as well as in mouse
and human tissues, and in cultured cells. The information gained by studying mice, which are often genetically
modified through use of Core C (Genetics and Genomics) and examined in conjunction with epidemiological
and behavioral studies done in humans (Core A), is essential to understand mechanisms underlying metabolic
disease risk, and the potential effectiveness of nutritional and pharmacologic approaches to ameliorate obesity
and its consequences.
21 of the 58 investigators in the proposed UCSF-NORC currently conduct research studies in which rodent
models are monitored using the types of equipment and analytical approaches housed in Core B. Another 4
NORC investigators indicate that their research has developed to a point where their use of facilities in Core B
is imminent. Experts in charge of running Core B keep abreast of the rapidly evolving application of these
sophisticated methods, and ensure that NORC researchers are trained in their proper implementation. The
presence of the facilities, and the availability of NORC support that is designed to assist the entry of NORC
researchers into technologically unfamiliar areas, ensure the success of UCSF-NORC research.
Core B provides access to, assistance with, and training in the use of sophisticated methods and instruments
for those studies. Specifically, Core B provides tools and facilities for:
1. Precise and real-time measurement of feeding, energy expenditure, locomotor activities, respiratory
exchange ratio, and thermoregulation in conscious mice.
2. Analyzing lean mass, fat mass, free and total body water in conscious mice, as well as bone mineral
density and other aspects of body composition in anesthetized mice.
3. Cellular energetic measurements using the Seahorse FX24 Bioanalyzer, which measures the oxygen
consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) of live cells and tissues in a 24-well plate
format. OCR and ECAR are key indicators of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, and provide a systems-
level view of cellular metabolic function in cells and ex-vivo tissue samples from model organisms and humans.
4. Equipment for urine and fecal collection and blood pressure measurement.
5. Rodent incubators that allow for the study of mice under cold ambient or warm thermoneutral conditions.
6. Gnotobiotics service. Gnotobiotic technology enables breeding and maintenance of germ-free animals
devoid of any associated microorganisms, including bacteria, archaea, microscopic fungi, parasites, and
viruses.
Most importantly, Core B provides non-invasive methods that permit mice to be followed over time. The ability
to conduct longitudinal studies in mice is particularly significant for tracking the changes in body composition,
feeding behavior, and metabolic activity that both trigger and respond to the development of obesity and its
associated complications. Overall, this Core significantly lowers the methodologic barriers to help NORC
researchers achieve the efficient and proper application of a series of highly sophisticated tools. These tools
accelerate a variety of diverse and interrelated studies in obesity, nutrition, ingestive behavior, and metabolism."
10893418,"Biomedical Core C (Genetics & Genomics): Summary
Twenty-four of the 58 laboratories within the UCSF-NORC employ genetics or genetic manipulation in their
research. Some focus on uncovering genetic alterations regulating feeding behavior, metabolism or nutritional
homeostasis associated with obesity and its health complications in humans. Others use genetically-defined
animal models to study the mechanisms underlying those processes. The targeted alteration of genes within
those model organisms is a tractable method to test molecular hypotheses about the involvement of those
pathways. Still others use expression profiling of samples from humans, model organisms or cell lines to
establish candidate pathways involved in energy balance.
The UCSF NORC Genetics and Genomics Core provides access to, assistance with, and training in the use of
an array of sophisticated methods and instruments for genetic and genomic assessment of molecular
pathways underlying nutrition and obesity. As the Genetics and Genomics Core facilities are overseen by five
administrative units at UCSF, this Core provides the infrastructure through which NORC users make use of
those facilities. The Genetics and Genomics Core assists NORC users to identify and access those facilities.
The NORC also supports the development of novel genetic and genomic technologies that are determined via
a well-defined process to be of emerging need to the NORC research base.
The NORC Genetics and Genomics Core provides tools and facilities for:
1. Global expression analyses, including single cell sequencing, to uncover relevant pathways in
laboratory interventional studies.
2. Functional studies involving genetic alteration of model organisms or cell lines, including targeted
knock-outs/ins and transgenics.
3. Maintaining and generating animal models required for NORC research.
Overall, this Core lowers methodological barriers to help NORC researchers achieve the efficient and proper
application of genetics and genomics tools. These capabilities accelerate a variety of diverse and interrelated
studies of obesity, nutrition, food intake and metabolism."
10902057,"PROJECT SUMMARY
BRCA2 mutation carriers are highly predisposed to breast and ovarian cancer (60% risk for breast cancer and
30-40% for ovarian cancer), and also have increased risk for other cancers like prostate and pancreatic.
However, the mechanisms underlying these phenomena are still poorly understood. The molecular pathogenic
steps, especially the earliest ones that drive the transition of normal cells (BRCA2mut/+) in a BRCA2 mutation
carrier to tumor cells are largely unknown. Experiments detailed in this proposal will provide valuable clues to
what those early steps could be. The knowledge and understanding of the way a normal, presumably healthy
cell in BRCA2 mutation carrying individual starts becoming a tumor cell, will give us a much-needed early
advantage to help design preventive strategies and contribute towards decreasing B2 mutant cancer incidence.
The experimental strategy described in this proposal is based on our recently published work that shows
increased single stranded DNA (ssDNA) accumulation in BRCA2 deficient cells, and on our preliminary data that
shows high abasic site and uracil accumulation in BRCA2 deficient cells. Our preliminary data also shows
defective nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway in BRCA2 deficient cells. Based on our strong preliminary
data, we propose to study the role of APOBEC/AID family of cytosine deaminases in generating abasic sites in
BRCA2 deficient cells. We will also use BRCA2 patient derived tissue to design new ways to classify variants of
unknown significance and also learn how increased abasic site and uracil in B2 heterozygous cells could
contribute to genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Finally, we will also study whether BRCA2 deficient cells are
defective in NER when undergoing replication stress, and if this weakness in BRCA2 mutant tumors could be
targeted by combination drug therapy.
 This study provides an opportunity to address the question of early DNA damaging events that drive
BRCA2 mutant tumorigenesis, and has the potential to provide the much needed, critical information that will
help with the design of effective cancer prevention and therapeutic strategies for BRCA2 mutation bearing
women."
10902058,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mimicking protein-like cavities and functions requires to precisely organize surface groups on well-defined,
porous scaffolds to function in a concerted and orchestrated manner. Here, we propose to generate fully
sequence-defined robust nanocages for selective, multivalent recognition and catalysis reminiscent of protein
cavities. Building on the PI’s unique interdisciplinary expertise in supramolecular, organic, and computational
chemistry, the primary objective is to create strategies to design and synthesize fully sequence-defined
nanocages as artificial receptors for sensing biomolecules (e.g., enkephalins in the brain) and as selective
artificial enzymes (e.g., for site-selective modification of peptides). We will direct the positioning of the endohedral
functional groups (e.g., mono-, di-, or tripeptides) with chiral, sequence-defined covalent templates (e.g.,
sequence-defined peptide dendrimers and a-helical peptides), which will transfer their outer amino acids onto
the endohedral sites of the nanocages in a stereocontrolled manner. The Schneebeli lab has synthesized and
characterized robust, hydrazone-linked nanocages required to bulid the sequence-defined nanocages. These
nanocages have been successfully applied as receptors for small molecules, and as size-selective
polymerization catalysts, which lays the foundation for the proposed selective neuropeptide recognition and site-
selective catalysis. We will pursue two parallel avenues to create the fully sequence defined nanocages. In
Project 1, we will template nanocage formation directly in a sequence-defined manner, assembling the
nanocages with hydrazone bonds (which are reversible under acidic conditions) and then cut out the templates.
In Project 2, we will stereoselectively functionalize preformed [8+12]-nanocages (created with a novel,
cyclotrimerization-based synthesis) with the help of a-helical peptide templates and equilibrating imine bonds,
and then reduce the imine bonds and cut out the templates. This research is novel in the concept, synthetic
approach, characterization, and applications, because (i) fully sequence-defined asymmetric nanocages
represent a considerable shift in the current research of artificial molecular receptors and artificial enzymes, (ii)
hydrazone-linked nanocages and cyclotrimerization-based nanocages syntheses (pioneered in the Schneebeli
group) are powerful approaches to access large and chemically-robust nanocage frameworks capable of holding
up to 12 endohedral functional groups with full sequence definition, and (iii) the creation of robust, protein-mimetic
cavities may ultimately yield numerous advances in both fundamental structural and mechanistic knowledge of
artificial receptor/artificial enzyme design. The proposed research is significant, because it will enable synthetic
chemists to independently control the endohedral sites of porous nanocages, ultimately offering new
opportunities and approaches to rapidly sense biomolecules and catalyze new, stereoselective chemical
reactions for therapeutics development."
10902062,"Project Summary:
It is becoming increasingly clear that one of the ways that cells interpret and encode information into multiple cell
fates is by multiplexing information through dynamic encoding. This is especially true for the MAPK/Erk pathway,
that governs many cell processes including cell proliferation, differentiation and migration. For years, how such
diverse outcomes were controlled by the same pathway remained elusive, but the advent of single cell studies
and optogenetics has elucidated the many ways in which Erk activity can be interpreted into distinct cell fates,
and even more recently, the role of dynamics in these complex decisions. The role of developmental Erk
dynamics in determining and coordinating human gastrulation, however, has not yet been investigated. We will
combine live cell kinase activity reporters and optogenetic control over intracellular signaling pathways to probe
the role of ERK dynamics in positioning and coordinating the three germ layers. Additionally, we will uncover
whether RASopathy causing mutations influence human gastrulation to pace the way for potential therapeutic
intervention.
 This proposal brings together recent advances in stem cell and molecular engineering. We utilize
advances in 2D micropatterning, cellular optogenetic control, live cell kinase activity reporters and CRISPR Cas9
genome editing. Together, these technologies give us unprecedented control over and visualization of
microengineered models of human gastrulation, thereby enabling us to investigate the principles of dynamic
information transmission. Our platform does not face the same ethical barriers that have limited human embryo
research, allowing us to provide otherwise unavailable information about human embryonic development. In this
proposal we focus on the role of Erk signaling dynamics in coordinating the three germ layers, as well as uncover
impact of RASopathy mutations. In Aim 1 we will image and quantify Erk signaling dynamics using the Erk kinase
translocation reporter during the process of gastrulation and determine which features of signaling dynamics are
predictive of germ layer fate. Aim 2 will allow us to identify which of these dynamical features are sufficient to
determine the cell fate outcome using cellular optogenetics. Finally, in Aim 3 we will uncover whether RASopathy
mutations lead to gastrulation defects and investigate whether these are linked to disruption to Erk dynamical
signatures using CRISPR Cas9 gene editing and our 2D gastruloid model. Approaching this cell biological
question from a systems level perspective, using reproducible precisely controllable tools that are otherwise
unavailable without optogenetics and microengineered platforms, has the potential to shine new light on the field."
10890441,"SUMMARY
Chronic pain and disability after bone fracture in the aged population are common. Approaches to pain
management following orthopaedic surgery often include the use of opioids. The use of non-narcotic drugs such
as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for fracture pain is of limited use in the United States because
of data suggesting that NSAIDs inhibit early fracture healing. Therefore, identifying new analgesics that do not
compromise bone healing or contribute to chronic pain conditions is important. Here we will explore the role of
the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is widely distributed in sensory nerves that
innervate the skeleton, in both the bone healing process and in mediating chronic pain due to bone fracture in
mice. Our approach will test the hypothesis that CGRP signaling is beneficial for bone healing following fracture
but compromises the return to normal physiological functioning of the individual due to nociceptive neuron
sensitization. This hypothesis will be tested in a setting of a murine model of surgically created femoral fracture
using male and female mice. These mice will determine the impact of fracture-targeted delivery of CGRP
(tCGRP) on bone healing in animals with treatment of a re-purposed anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody to
modulate nociceptive pain due to fracture. Successful completion of this application will provide new insights as
to how modulation of CGRP regulates bone healing, inflammation, and pain states. This project, testing
therapeutic strategies associated with the regulation of CGRP, may ultimately improve fracture healing and
reduce the need for opioid usage for post-fracture pain management."

The overall goal of Core B is to provide the infrastructure and support for the ascertainment and collection of
phenotypic data and biological samples on 4000 African Americans (AA), 4000 Hispanic/Latinx Americans (HL)
and 5000 Africans (AF) from the US and Africa. The phenotypic data gathered by Core B will sent to Core E
and used for adjudication and harmonization by Core C, while the blood, plasma, and RNA samples collected
by Core B will be sent to the John P. Hussman Institute for Human Genomics (HIHG) at the University of Miami
(UM), used for DNA genotyping for Projects 1 and 2 and future WGS studies in FUS 2.0 and biomarkers and
expression studies (Core D). The work of Core B will provide the necessary materials for both common and rare

Aim 1 will recruit and ascertain AA and HL participants in four US and nine AF sites. The AF sites are in eight
different countries, all members of the African Dementia Consortium (AfDC). The University of Ibadan, Nigeria,
will be the primary coordinating site for the other AfDC sites. We will ascertain ~13,000 individuals/participants
(6,500 cases and 6,500 controls) consisting of AA (n=4,000), HL (n=4,000) and AF (n=5,000). Specific Aim 2.
We will collect clinical, neurocognitive testing, blood samples and metadata on AA (n=4,000), HL (n=4,000) and
AF (n=5,000) participants. Tubes for DNA, RNA and plasma will be collected. This study will provide a resource

The overall goal of the Adjudication and Phenotype Harmonization Core (Core C) is to generate the high
quality, analysis ready, clinical diagnoses and harmonized phenotypes. needed to develop the READD-ADSP
resource. Developing this resource is in line with NIA's mission to ensure that Alzheimer's disease gene
discovery represents all groups including those that have been traditionally underrepresented. Further, the
clinical deliverables from Core C will be invaluable to qualified investigators who access the READD-ADSP
resource. To produce these clinical deliverables, Core C will adjudicate 13,000 participants (cases/controls) from
US sites (n=8,000) and AfDC sites (n=5,000) and harmonize multi-domain phenotype data from the US and
African cohorts. The adjudication and harmonization objectives will be accomplished via two aims: (1) Acquisition
and processing of clinical data (e.g., data dictionaries and operation manuals) and metadata for adjudication and
harmonization; (2) Adjudication and harmonization of clinical data from US and AfDC sites and delivery clinical
diagnoses to Core E for distribution to Projects 1 & 2 and both clinical diagnoses and harmonized data to
NIAGADS for distribution to the ADSP-Phenotype Harmonization Consortium and the broader scientific
community. Ultimately, the value of the READD-ADSP resource resides in its potential to expand understanding
of AD genetics in underrepresented groups with implications for therapies that integrate personalized

The dual impacts of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and unintended pregnancies constitute a major health burden for
women worldwide and justify the development of highly-effective next-generation multipurpose prevention
technologies (NGM) that combine safe, effective, and easily reversible long-acting contraception with HIV
prevention. Here, we propose to adapt a memory wire copper intrauterine device (IUD) frame as a platform for
intrauterine delivery of antiretroviral (AVR) drugs to provide user friendly HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)
and contraception. We propose to evaluate ARV drug delivery systems compatible with IUD delivery for duel-
protection up to three years. In Aim 1, we will formulate candidate antiviral drug/prodrug solid dispersions in
matrix, reservoir and electrospun drug delivery systems and integrate these into an existing copper IUD to
optimize drug loading, dissolution rate, chemical and functional stability, and stable integration with and
functional attributes of the IUD. We will then evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic effects of intrauterine
delivery of candidate devices in baboons, and measure drug concentrations in the vagina, cervix, and
endometrium. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use the macaque model to evaluate the protective efficacy of the drug-
eluting delivery system for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis against a repeated low-dose vaginal SHIV162P3

 Fungal pathogens pose a devastating threat to human health, infecting billions of people worldwide and
causing more than 1.5 million deaths each year. Candida albicans is one of the most pervasive fungal pathogens,
killing almost 40% of people suffering from bloodstream infections. Treating these infections is extremely difficult,
as fungi are closely related to humans and there are very few drugs that kill the fungus without host toxicity. With
the emergence of drug resistance, the development of new therapeutic strategies is now crucial. To address
this important clinical need and identify new antifungal drug targets, it is critical to uncover mechanisms
that enable C. albicans to cause life-threatening human disease.
 We are one of the first academic labs to obtain a powerful functional genomics resource that we are
uniquely positioned to expand to allow us to test the function of almost every gene in the C. albicans genome.
This resource includes a collection of conditional expression strains that covers ~40% of the genome where one
allele of a target gene is deleted in the diploid pathogen, and expression of the remaining wild-type allele is
governed by the tetracycline-repressible promoter. During the prior funding period we: developed a pipeline to
expand the resource to genome scale, optimized a functional genomics platform for massively parallel analysis
of fungal virulence traits using next generation sequencing with pooled assays to quantify the relative proportion
of each strain, which are uniquely marked with molecular barcodes; optimized high-resolution image analysis of
cellular morphology and structures; and developed assays for identifying genes important for commensalism,
virulence, and interaction with host immune cells. Our efficient high-throughput analyses established the power
of systematic genetic analysis to uncover new biological insights that could not have been predicted based on
current paradigms and enabled focused, hypothesis-driven dissection of key mechanisms governing host-
pathogen interactions. Our studies will provide the first global analysis of C. albicans morphogenesis,
commensalism, and virulence, and will reveal fundamental biological mechanisms that could not be
predicted without a systematic genetic approach.
 Our studies will: 1) complete the collection of tetracycline-repressible conditional expression strains to
cover non-essential genes, since genes required for pathogen viability in vitro provide little insight into host
adaptation or virulence; 2) identify novel regulators of key virulence traits such as morphogenesis; and 3) identify
determinants of C. albicans host adaptation and virulence on a genome scale. Our comprehensive strain
resources and compendium of phenotypic profiles will be made available to the community, advancing the field
with a publicly accessible database and interpretive machine learning model to maximize insight. This work will
provide the most comprehensive functional genomics resource for any fungal pathogen and will reveal
genes governing host adaptation, revealing new strategies to cripple fungal pathogens."
10898837,"Project Summary/ Abstract
Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a complex disease influenced by both genetic variability and multiple
environmental factors. In the population, anxiety and stress are thought to be important drivers of alcohol
consumption, with ethanol’s anxiolytic properties suggested as contributing to progressive increases in alcohol
consumption and relapse. While there are foundations for genetic underpinnings of both AUD and anxiety
disorders, there is little evidence to define and support the genetic variability in the mechanisms driving ethanol’s
efficacy as an anxiolytic. The Miles laboratory has published a prior study, using recombinant inbred BXD mouse
strains, demonstrating a robust quantitative trait locus (QTL) underlying acute ethanol anxiolysis [3]. From this
QTL, Ninein (Nin) was implicated as a strong candidate quantitative trait gene driving variation in the anxiolytic-
like response to ethanol in the light-dark transition model of anxiety [7]. Ninein is a microtubule associated protein
(MAP) located in the centrosome and cytoplasm that anchors the minus ends of microtubules and has been
implicated in axonal growth and branching [6] Ninein has been shown to interact with Gsk3b, a known ethanol-
responsive gene implicated in synaptic plasticity and neurotransmitter trafficking that the Miles laboratory has
shown to modulate ethanol consumption [28]. Alternative splicing variants and exon-specific associated changes
in microtubule dynamics in neurons implicate that variability in Nin genomic sequence could drive genetic
variation in behavioral responses to anxiety and ethanol. This project will examine the role of Nin and Nin
transcript variant expression in basal anxiety, ethanol-induced anxiolytic-like activity and ethanol consumption
using a regulated Nin knockout model, brain region selective viral vector gene delivery and CRISPR/Cas9 exon-
skiping analysis. These objectives will be approached via the following specific aims: 1) Characterize role of
region-specific Nin on ethanol-related behaviors in C57BL/6J (B6) mice using a tamoxifen induced knockout. 2)
Characterize the role of alternative splicing of Ninein on ethanol and anxiety-related behaviors of C57BL/6J (B6)
mice, using CRISPR/Cas9 viral vectors in exon-specific deletions."
10896541,"Mitochondria play an essential role in cellular function and impact human health through varied mechanisms,
including energy metabolism, cell signaling, and apoptosis. Many aging-related diseases have a mitochondrial
(MT) component, with studies highlighting associations with cardiovascular disease, frailty, and overall mortality.
In addition to inherited variation, mitochondria experience somatic mutations at much higher rates than the
nuclear genome, introducing a state of heteroplasmy, defined as having more than 1 mtDNA allele within a cell.
Using whole-genome sequence data from ~200,000 samples in the UK Biobank (UKB), we found that increased
levels of MT heteroplasmy are associated with all-cause mortality, with individuals harboring a heteroplasmic
nonsense mutation having a 1.7-fold increased risk of death, even after adjusting for the total number of
heteroplasmies. These data indicate that the functional nature of the heteroplasmic mutation is a key driver of
increased mortality risk. We propose to directly test the impact of heteroplasmic nonsense mutations across a
range of variant allele fractions (VAF) on MT function through base editing of the MT genome followed by a
comprehensive suite of MT functional assays. Given the strong link between primary MT disorders and cardiac
function, we further propose to test the impact of these variants on cardiomyocyte electrical activity using human
induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). In the ~200,000 UKB participants, we have identified
47 ultra-rare heteroplasmic nonsense single base-pair changes. Nineteen of the variants are targetable by
existing MT base editing technologies. We propose to optimize constructs to target all 19 bases in HEK293T cell
lines, which have served as the model system for MT genome editing, and then select up to 2 constructs per
gene for downstream functional analyses in additional cell lines. To functionally characterize heteroplasmic
nonsense mutations, we will first expand the range of VAF through a combination of single-cell expansion and
the use of mitoTALENs and test the hypothesis of a dose-response relationship between VAF and MT function.
We will then use a series of high-throughput assays to comprehensively characterize the mutant cell lines by
assessing MT function (e.g., cellular respiration, glycolytic flux) and quantity (mtDNA-CN, nucleoid density,
mass). We will then use hiPSC-CMs to test whether deleterious heteroplasmic variants across a range of VAFs
modify electrical excitability, repolarization, or conduction, or compromise the development and maturation of
cardiomyocytes. The increasing recognition of the role of MT heteroplasmic mutation in aging-related disease
has created an urgent need to functionally characterize these mutations. Indeed, while this proposal focuses on
heteroplasmic nonsense mutations, we have already identified ~1000 ultra-rare heteroplasmic missense and
non-coding mutations at highly constrained sites that likewise increase risk for all-cause mortality. Thus, the
proposed experiments will provide the foundational framework for future studies to distinguish benign from
deleterious MT heteroplasmic mutations at these 1000s of potentially deleterious heteroplasmic sites."

Antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV infection effectively blocks viral replication, but fails to eradicate the virus,
which can be a source of persistent inflammation. The pathways by which chronic, treated HIV infection drives
inflammation are poorly defined, particularly in children and adolescents who acquire HIV perinatally. Perinatal
HIV infection occurs in the context of a developing immune system, requires life-long treatment, and even with
effective ART, treatment is associated with increased risks of metabolic, neurocognitive and cardiovascular
complications that result from this HIV-induced inflammation. Thus, to understand the mechanisms driving
inflammation in this vulnerable population that faces decades-long infection and treatment, we will study
HIV-induced inflammation in a unique cohort of perinatally infected adolescents in Kenya who have been
maintained on ART and followed clinically since their first year of life. To complement these valuable
longitudinal clinical samples, we have developed organoids of human secondary lymphoid tissues, a major HIV
reservoir site. The lymphoid organoids we are using are highly relevant to pediatric and adolescent infections
as they are derived from pediatric/adolescent tissue, contain all major immune cell types, infectable with HIV,
and are manipulable via gene editing, siRNA transfection, and antibody/small molecule inhibitors to probe
mechanisms driving HIV-induced inflammation. Our goal is to use these unique resources to identify
HIV-induced inflammatory networks in perinatally-infected adolescents on long-term ART and to define the viral
factors that drive HIV-induced inflammation. We will make use of single cell techniques, which to date have
only been applied to adult cohorts, to map the cell-intrinsic inflammatory networks induced during chronic
treated HIV infection and define the viral genes that initiate these cascades. In addition, to fill a gap that has
been missing in prior studies, we seek to understand how these rare infected cells initiate downstream
cascades of inflammation that drive pathology by studying communication networks using methods we recently
developed to infer cell-cell communication at the single cell level. This powerful combination of a long-term
pediatric treatment cohort coupled with mechanistic studies in a robust ex vivo lymphoid culture system will
provide a unique window into HIV-induced inflammation. Successful completion of this project will define
mechanisms by which residual HIV RNA expression during treated infection drives inflammation in perinatally
infected adolescents and establish models to test therapeutics."

Children living in rural regions of the United States have limited opportunities for research participation. The
Institutional Development Award (IDeA) Program was launched in 1993 to enhance biomedical research
opportunities in states with low rates of National Institutes of Health funding. The Environmental influences on
Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) was formed in 2015 to
provide clinical trial participation opportunities to children living in IDeA states and to enhance workforce capacity
for pediatric clinical trials. The ARkansas ECHO ISPCTN Site (AREIS) based at Arkansas Children’s Research
Institute will build upon previous work and continue to expand research participation opportunities for children
living in rural regions in Arkansas. To this end, AREIS will continue to work closely with the Data Coordinating
and Operations Center, with other ISPCTN sites, and with local experts affiliated with the Clinical and
Translational Sciences Award at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. In the next cycle of funding,
AREIS will 1) provide research expertise and leadership to the ECHO ISPCTN for the development and
implementation of robust clinical trials in high priority ECHO focus areas; 2) increase clinical trials competency
and leadership skills among AREIS faculty and staff; and 3) leverage existing resources to implement innovative
community engagement and community partnership approaches that will enhance the participation of rural
children in clinical trials. Innovations in clinical trials, such as the incorporation of telehealth approaches, will
allow AREIS to conduct research in low-resourced settings, such as rural communities. The collective impact of
this research with increase the enrollment of rural children in clinical trials in ECHO focus areas and increase
clinical trial competencies among faculty and staff affiliated with AREIS. In addition, the continued development
of strong partnerships with other ISPCTN sites and the DCOC will enhance the success of future research
collaborations in ECHO priority areas."
10902075,"The lysosome is an essential organelle to recycle materials delivered by endocytosis and
autophagy. Inborn genetic defects affecting the lysosome cause debilitating and fatal lysosomal
storage diseases (LSDs, ~70 in humans). One severe form of LSD, the I-cell disease, leads to
skeletal dysplasia, short stature, cardiomegaly, and death in the first decade. It is caused by
mutations in the GlcNAc-1-phosphotransferase enzyme (GNPT), which functions at the cis-
Golgi to label lysosome enzymes with sorting signal mannose-6-phosphate (M6P). Missing M6P
leads to the secretion of most lysosomal enzymes and defective lysosomes. In early 2021, a
new type of severe LSD similar to the I-cell disease was reported. Patients will develop skeletal
dysplasia, short stature, cardiac defects, and some die in early childhood. Their lysosomal
enzymes are also secreted into the plasma. It is caused by mutations in TMEM251, but the
cellular function of TMEM251 and the molecular mechanism for the disease remain to be
addressed.
In a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen to identify genes critical for the degradation of
human lysosome membrane proteins, we independently discovered TMEM251 to be essential
for lysosome function. Knocking out TM251 leads to lysosomal dysfunction due to the secretion
of unprocessed lysosomal enzymes. Consequently, lysosomes accumulate numerous
undigested materials such as autophagic bodies and endocytic vesicles. Consistent with human
pathology, knocking out TM251 in Zebrafish leads to cardiac defects and skeletal dysplasia.
We hypothesize that TM251 functions in the M6P biogenesis pathway of lysosomal enzymes.
We will pursue three specific aims to characterize the role of TM251 in lysosome biogenesis. In
aim 1, we will characterize membrane topology, localization, and oligomerization of TM251. In
aim 2, we will dissect the relationship between TM251 and the GNPT complex at both cellular
and organismal levels. In aim 3, we will study the signaling cascade that leads to lysosome
upregulation after knocking out TM251. Our findings will uncover the role of TM251 in the M6P
biogenesis and provide a molecular mechanism for a new lysosome storage disease that
severely affects child health."

Patients with extrabronchial tumors that induce malignant central airway obstruction (MCAO) face significant
morbidity and only 1-7 months median overall survival. An estimated 20-30% of patients with lung cancer will
have MCAO during the course of their disease, but other malignancies that metastasize to the airway can induce
central airway obstruction. We have recently reported, in a Phase I study, that Photofrin® mediated image-
guided interstitial photodynamic therapy (I-PDT) with our novel treatment planning and light dosimetry platform
is safe, with promising outcomes. Three out of 10 treated patients are alive at 26.5, 12 and 8.3 months. Our
image-based treatment planning was used to guide the administration of the light dose rate (irradiance) and light
dose (fluence) to the target tumor while sparing adjacent normal tissue.
Our goal is to improve the rate of complete and partial tumor response of extrabronchial MCAO to I-PDT. To that
end we propose to increase tumor blood oxygenation that will increase laser light transmission and oxygen
supply known to improve the efficacy of PDT. Murine studies reported that palliative x-ray radiotherapy (p-XRT)
can increase tumor oxygenation and alter vasculature. We therefore explore the use of p-XRT to improve tumor
response to I-PDT. Our preliminary data demonstrate that p-XRT followed by I-PDT (p-XRT/I-PDT) significantly
increases (p<0.05) complete response of locally advanced mouse tumors, in comparison to either I-PDT or p-
XRT. Under compassionate care exemption we showed that I-PDT delivered 48 ± 4h after 8Gy x1 p-XRT can
provide control of extrabronchial MCAO in two patients. There are no effective treatments for extrabronchial
MCAO. Thus, the overriding significance of our proposal is its responsiveness to an unmet clinical need.
We hypothesize that standard of care p-XRT (8Gy x1) followed by I-PDT is safe and will improve treatment
outcomes in patients with extrabronchial MCAO, and that this improvement is due to changes in the
tumor microenvironment. To test our hypothesis, we propose to accomplish the following aims.
Aim 1. To conduct a Phase I/II study to test the safety and efficacy of p-XRT followed by I-PDT in patients
with extrabronchial MCAO. We define success as demonstrating that this treatment is safe and result in ≥50%
of participants having partial or complete tumor response and/or significant improvement in quality of life and
physical performance at 3 months post treatment. We will

Aim 2. To define the mechanisms by which p-XRT improves tumor response to I-PDT in mouse models.
We will define how changes in tumor microenvironment impact light transmission and tumor response, as well
as the contribution of anti-tumor immunity to tumor control and tumor-free survival.
These data will inform the design of a future randomized Phase II trial of p-XRT/I-PDT versus standard of care."
10881750,"In breast cancer, collagen re-alignment is predictive of subtype, outcome and recurrence with limited data on
contribution to racial disparities. For African-American (AA) women, breast cancer mortality is higher than any
other race/ethnicity, in spite of having lower incidence rates. A disproportionate number of African-American
women are affected by aggressive metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) without significant knowledge
of mechanisms driving this ancestry-dependent difference. Collagen processing is a primary feature of TNBC
tumors with increases in tumor adjacent collagen deposition, altered tumor-stroma ratios, and re-alignment of
collagen fibers at tumor borders leading to metastasis. However, a knowledge gap exists on understanding
ancestry-dependent translational and post-translational mechanisms of the collagen structure in any breast
cancer type progression. Our preliminary data reports, for the first time, that post-translational regulation of the
collagen triple helical structure by hydroxylated prolines (HYP) is a defining mechanism of racial disparities in
normal and TNBC tissue. Consequently, this proposal focuses on identifying ancestry-dependent translational
and post-translational mechanisms of collagen re-alignment that can ultimately be used to predict and potentially
prevent breast cancer metastasis in AA women. In Aim 1, we will define ancestry dependent post-translational
HYP regulation of collagen sequences from low grade to invasive triple negative breast cancers. Novel
technological platforms will be combined to measure collagen sequences from the tissue microenvironment with
measurement of collagen fiber changes and immune infiltrate. In Aim 2, we will identify HYP post-translational
regulation of collagen sequence variants in ancestry-mapped normal breast tissue stratified by density,
socioeconomic status, marital status, contraceptive use, and risk factors of smoking and alcohol. We will further
determine if collagen sequence variants can be used as a companion scoring metric for prediction of breast
cancer risk. In Aim 3, ancestry-defined normal and metastatic human breast cells will be used to precisely trace
ancestry dependent collagen processing and oncogenic signaling influenced by collagen sequence variants.
This study will increase our understanding of racial disparities in metastatic collagen re-alignment, working to
generate better ancestry-dependent biomarkers for earlier detection of breast cancer and limit mortality due to
breast cancer in minority populations."

Migraine is a prevalent neurological disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. The underlying
pathophysiology of migraine likely involves diverse mechanisms within the trigeminal pain pathways and pain-
related structures in the brain. Recently introduced medications targeting CGRP mechanisms including
antibodies and small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists appear to act outside of the blood brain barrier. These
medications are effective as preventive treatment in some patients implicating the role of meningeal CGRP in
migraine pathology. However, many patients do not respond to these therapies and even those that do often
experience “breakthrough migraines” suggesting the existence of non-CGRP peripheral migraine mechanisms.
The brain circuits mediating migraine pain remain understudied. Cephalic nociceptive pathways involve
activation of trigeminal afferents and transmission of the nociceptive signal through the second order cells in the
trigeminocervical complex (TCC) to multiple brain regions. Human neuroimaging studies during a migraine attack
have demonstrated activations in the amygdala and dorsal pons, encompassing the parabrachial nucleus (PBN).
The PBN receives both exteroceptive and interoceptive sensory inputs and projects to multiple sites including
the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), an area mediating emotional aspects of pain. Our preclinical studies
using pharmacological and optogenetic activation of dural afferents, neuronal tracing and behavior suggest a
functional pathway from the dura mater to TCC, PBN and CeA that may promote migraine-like pain.
In this proposal, we will use opto/chemo-genetic methods, microscopy with immunostaining and RNAscope,
CRISPR-Cas9 (i.e., CRISPR) genetic manipulations, electrophysiology, calcium imaging and pain behavior to
investigate if, and how, the PBN→CeA pathway may promote migraine-like pain elicited by activation of dural
afferents using several different approaches in male and female mice. Aim 1 will measure the effects on markers
of neural activation in brain networks (microscopy) and consequences on pain behavior; Aim 2 will use brain
slice electrophysiology and calcium imaging with pharmacological, CRISPR or opto/chemo-genetic
manipulations of PBN outputs to evaluate plasticity of CeA cell types; Aim 3 will use chemogenetic inhibition of
PBN outputs or CRISPR deletions in the CeA to evaluate possible inhibition of migraine pain behaviors.
Our studies aim to address significant gaps in our knowledge of central pathways of migraine pain. We will
determine the potential relevance of the central PBN→CeA circuit as a common pathway of migraine pain that
can be engaged by CGRP-dependent and CGRP-independent peripheral mechanisms."

The United States currently has the highest COVID-19 infection and related mortality rates in the world. In
California, Latinos account for the highest percent of COVID-19 cases (58.9%) and deaths (47.3%) and are
disproportionately represented in occupations deemed as ‘essential’. Latinos also suffer from higher rates of
poverty and chronic disease which places them at greater risk of COVID-19 infection and related complications.
In collaboration with Family Health Centers of SD (FHCSD) and working with Community Health Workers (aka,
promotores/as), we will implement a multilevel intervention to increase COVID-19 vaccine completion rates and
see faster vaccination uptake among Latinos. A total of 10 clinics will be randomized to either a Standard Clinical
Practice consisting of standard clinic-based strategies to promote COVID-19 vaccine uptake among patients or
a Multilevel Intervention consisting of an individualized/tailored intervention delivered by Health Educators
working within the clinics plus a multi-component community intervention delivered by community promotores.
This project will test the immediate and short-term effectiveness of the multilevel intervention to increase COVID-
19 vaccine uptake. In addition, we will test the effectiveness of the proposed intervention on long-term behavioral,
mental, and physical health outcomes. Lastly, this project will assess implementation outcomes including
program acceptability and feasibility by patients and clinic staff and community environment. This study aims to
increase the uptake of completing the COVID-19 vaccine in a population that has exceptionally high rates of
morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. We will harness our research team’s extensive experience in
developing multi-level interventions working with Health Educators and promotores to promote behavior change
among Latinos, and leverage a strong community-academic collaboration that maximizes community impact and
sustainability. This research will lead to the development of sustainable and scalable community-academic
models designed to respond quickly, efficiently, and effectively to both this existing and future public health
threats."
10881754,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Infection due to Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a current global health burden and is estimated that globally more
than 58 million people have chronic HCV with about 1.5 million new infections occurring per year. If left
untreated HCV infection can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite significant recent
advances in the development of highly effective and affordable HCV treatment, one of the major challenges in
HCV infection management is rapid and early diagnosis of active HCV infection particularly those in resource-
limited settings. Worldwide, only 21% of HCV-infected people are diagnosed. Of particular interest are the
American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) who are disproportionally affected with new HCV infection rate of
2.9 cases/100,000 as compared to 0.5 cases/100,000 in African Americans and 1.2 cases/100,000 in non-
Hispanic Whites with significantly higher mortality rates compared to non-AI/AN ethnic and racial groups.
The two-step HCV testing process of HCV antibody testing followed by confirmatory HCV RNA testing is
expensive, time-consuming, and suboptimal, which has led to significant drop out of HCV-infected individuals
from the cascade of HCV management before receiving care. The HCV antibody testing cannot be used for
detecting active infection due to its inability to distinguish between resolved HCV (R-HCV) and viremic HCV (V-
HCV). The currently available HCV RNA testing assays including the POC HCV RNA assays are still lab-based
and expensive and may not be available in most resource-limited settings and those with HCV-related health
disparities including AIs/ANs. Low-cost, rapid, sensitive, and specific POC HCV antigen testing is an attractive
alternative approach that holds great promise for one-step HCV screening and diagnosis. There is currently no
commercially available and FDA-approved POC HCV Ag testing device. The already developed HCV Ag
assays are lab-based, relatively expensive, and more importantly not sensitive/specific enough particularly
when tested with samples with clinically relevant low viral loads (<1000 IU/mL), which has limited their clinical
utilities. The Abbott Architect HCVcAg assay had a sensitivity of 64.7%-81.9% when tested with HCV serum
samples with <104 IU/mL viral loads and 0.0%-19.7% when tested with HCV serum samples with <1000 IU/mL
viral loads. Therefore, to increase access to HCV care particularly those disproportionally affected such as
AIs/ANs, there is an urgent need for inexpensive, rapid, sensitive, and specific POC HCV Ag diagnostic
testing. The main goal of this interdisciplinary project is developing a smartphone-based diagnostic system for
rapid (<30 minutes) and sensitive (LoD of 200 IU/mL to 1000 IU/mL) HCV detection using fingerprick volume
(<100 µL) of a whole blood sample placed on an inexpensive (<$2 material cost), disposable, and mass-
producible microfluidic-based cartridge. We will validate the proposed device with HCV-infected patient blood
samples collected from AIs/ANs."

To feel, remember and act in a social environment, incoming social stimuli must be processed and represented.
Recent advances have revealed several routes of social information flow which converge on the dorsal (d)CA2.
Ensembles encoding individual identity have also been found in the dCA2, but how diverse social information is
integrated to form coherent social representations remains elusive. Studies in human participants have provided
early evidence that the hippocampus tracks two social features, familiarity and hierarchy, jointly. However, it is
poorly understood how neural ensembles encode social characteristics and how incoming information instruct
the formation of social representations based on those characteristics.
To address this major knowledge gap, our overall objective is to bridge circuit and population coding mechanisms
to determine the neural basis of social information processing. As familiarity and hierarchy are two factors by
which social relationships are evaluated across species, we reason that dissociating their circuit and population
coding mechanisms will reveal how social information is structured in the brain. Our preliminary data suggest
that the dCA2 is functionally relevant for hierarchy and familiarity behaviors and its activity scales with rank
distance. Given that the entorhinal cortex shows grid-like activity in rank representation, we hypothesize that the
dCA2 may display place cell-like dynamics to signal familiarity and hierarchy distance on an abstract social
cognitive map. We will test this hypothesis in Aim 1 with bulk (fiber photometry) and single-cell imaging
(Miniscope) of the dCA2 in response to varied familiarity or hierarchy stimuli. Using the imaging data, we will
evaluate predictive models of coding strategy with linear classifiers. In Aim 2 we will assess how social
presentations of familiarity and hierarchy arise. We have preliminary evidence that distinct neuromodulator
activity in the dCA2 correlates with rank distance. As neuromodulators are mainly released into the dCA2 by the
paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), we hypothesize that specific neuromodulators released by
the PVH differentially impacts the geometry of the social characteristics. Thus, we will use novel neuromodulator
sensors to monitor their dynamics and manipulate their signaling during Miniscope recordings. Finally, we will
test their functional relevance by inhibiting their release from the PVH during hierarchy and familiarity behaviors.
The approach detailed in this proposal is highly innovative because it leverages new technological advances
(novel neuromodulator sensors) and integrates cutting-edge techniques (manipulation of neuromodulator
signaling with Miniscope imaging and computational modeling) to address a major knowledge gap in social
cognition. As no unified theories of circuit and population coding mechanisms for social information processing
exist, the proposed research is highly significant. A mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulatory inputs
regulate neural population coding will provide druggable targets, which have the potential to transform
therapeutic treatment of social cognitive deficiencies in neuropsychiatric disorders."
10874646,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The protective effect of education against Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) is found to be
smaller for racial/ethnic minority individuals than for non-Hispanic White individuals. Identifying factors that
modify or mediate the education-ADRD relationship presents a unique opportunity to address the racial/ethnic
disparities in ADRD and ultimately improve population health. However, most research relies on respondents’
education to assess the education-ADRD relationship, failing to consider the roles of other family member’s
education or the social context and environment in which education occurs and affects ADRD. The major goal
of the proposed research is to develop a novel framework that incorporates multigenerational education and
multidomain contextual measures and use it to clarify the heterogeneous effects of education on ADRD risk
among racial/ethnic groups by analyzing nationally representative longitudinal data. We propose to achieve this
goal through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a multigenerational framework and use it to estimate
the effect of multigenerational education on the respondent’s ADRD risk and the racial/ethnic disparities. Aim 2
is to construct multidomain contextual measures of structural inequality and racism and estimate their effects on
individual’s ADRD risk and the racial/ethnic disparities. To provide historical and population contexts for
understanding results from Aims 1 and 2, in Aim 3 we will estimate how education effects on ADRD risk may
differ across four birth cohorts.
The proposed research is significant because it will help reduce racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive impairment
and ADRD risk by clarifying multigenerational pathways and identifying mediators and modifiers of the
heterogeneous education-ADRD relationships among demographic groups. The proposed research is
innovative because it will develop a new multigenerational and multilevel mediation approach to understanding
why the education-ADRD risk relationship differs among racial/ethnic groups. It will also contribute new
contextual data to a nationally representative data set."
10874748,"Post-traumatic headache (PTH) commonly occurs following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as
concussion. PTH is a secondary headache that often presents with a migraine-like phenotype and is subdivided
as acute or persistent (PPTH) depending on whether it resolves within 3 months after injury. The pathophysiology
of PTH and PPTH is not understood and no evidence-based treatments exist for these conditions. Critically,
PPTH might differ from PTH, not only in the duration but also in underlying mechanisms and responsiveness to
treatment. The reasons for emergence of PPTH in some patients remain unclear but may be related to risk
factors including pre-existing migraine and the experience of a previous mTBI. We have developed an approach
to investigate the mechanisms of PTH and PPTH as well as potential strategies for treatment. Using a weight
drop method in male and female mice that recapitulates biomechanical properties and clinical features of mTBI,
we have shown that a single mTBI is sufficient to induce clinically relevant PTH symptoms including an acute
period of allodynia, elevated CGRP blood levels and lowered thresholds for induction of cortical spreading
depression (CSD). Additionally, we have explored the concept that the transition from acute to chronic pain
states may rely on a “pain memory” that can be studied using the “two-hit” model of hyperalgesic priming where
a prior insult confers vulnerability to a subsequent provocative stimulus. Thus, following resolution of acute
allodynia, mTBI mice transition into a long-lasting persistent phase (PPTH) where, remarkably, allodynia can be
reinstated by physiologically relevant and common migraine triggers, including stress. CGRP is established in
migraine pathogenesis and our data also suggest an important role in promoting PTH. Treatment with either a
CGRP antibody or with onabotulinum toxin A (botox) prevents mTBI-related allodynia (PTH) as well as
subsequent provoked allodynia representative of PPTH. However, blockade of CGRP after mTBI sensitization
is established is ineffective in blocking provoked allodynia, while botox still maintains efficacy. We have
hypothesized that mTBI results in CGRP release from meningeal afferents promoting PTH and central
sensitization that underlies the development of PPTH, but that PPTH may be maintained in a CGRP-independent
fashion. Additionally, we hypothesize that existing sensitization prior to a mTBI event will promote vulnerability
to the development of CGRP-independent PPTH. We explore these hypotheses with two related but,
independent, aims using behavioral, neurochemical, immunohistochemical and electrophysiolgical analyses.
Aim 1 will determine whether, and when currently available therapies can block mTBI-related outcomes relevant
to PTH and if these treatments can prevent the expression of PPTH. Aim 2 will determine if prior sensitization
promotes more severe, long-lasting and CGRP-resistant PPTH. Our studies will fill in significant knowledge gaps
about the role of CGRP in promoting PTH and the importance of pre-existing sensitization in establishing CGRP-
independent PPTH. Such information will influence treatment as well as guide the discovery of new therapies."

10875158,"PROJECT SUMMARY - OVERALL
The goal of the Penn State Roybal Center is to develop and test novel interventions to improve adherence to
behavior change and enhance cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults. Prospective observational
studies indicate that physical activity is one of the most promising strategies for preventing Alzheimer’s
Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD). Unfortunately, most middle-aged and older adults are not
engaging in the recommended level of physical activity. One of the major barriers to a large national trial to
validate physical activity as a strategy for preventing AD/ADRD is the limited rate of adherence to behavior
change following a physical activity intervention. To address that limitation, the Penn State Roybal Center will
accelerate the translation of basic discoveries about motivation and adherence to behavior change into
principle-driven scalable and potent interventions that can be successfully implemented in the real world to
improve physical activity adherence and enhance cognitive function. Our team of experts in aging, behavioral
science, computer science, engineering, medicine, and physical activity will pursue four specific aims. First, we
will conduct three clinical trials to develop principle-driven scalable and potent behavioral interventions that
engage targeted mechanisms of adherence to behavior change following the end of an intervention, improve
adherence dynamics, and enhance cognitive function in middle-aged and older adults. Interventions will
leverage consumer and wearable technology and integrate generative artificial intelligence with predictive
modeling to deliver precision interventions. The trials span NIH Stages 1 and 3 and are integrated by a process
model of adherence dynamics. Second, we will activate a scientific community applying experimental medicine
methods to engage targeted mechanisms of adherence to behavior change and enhance cognitive function.
Third, we will accelerate knowledge translation by disseminating findings via a multi-pronged strategy that
targets the public, scientists, industry, and policymakers. Finally, we will facilitate translational research to
prevent AD/ADRD by managing a pilot program, supporting regulatory compliance in clinical trials, and
engaging with an External Advisory Committee and the Roybal Coordinating Center. These aims will be
pursued through an Administrative Core and a Behavioral Intervention Core. The Center will advance the field
by (1) developing a flexible method for transparent and controllable artificial intelligence content generation that
will reduce delays for intervention adaptation and accelerate scaling and providing access to that method via a
web app that can be integrated with existing messaging interventions, (2) establishing evidence-based
strategies for engaging targeted mechanisms of adherence to behavior change, (3) elucidating the processes
that influence adherence and cognitive function following an intervention, and (4) characterizing the effects of
adherence to physical activity following an intervention on cognition across multiple time scales."
10875159,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The goal of the Administrative Core for the Penn State Roybal Center is to accelerate the translation of basic
research on mechanisms of adherence to behavior change into principle-based potent and scalable
interventions that increase adherence to physical activity and enhance cognitive function after an intervention.
The Administrative Core will provide management oversight and oversee communication activities that involve
our research team, NIH representatives, and the broader research community. The Core will also engage in
financial oversight and planning and ensure regulatory compliance with the Office of Research Protections and
any ancillary review processes. Administration and support of the pilot program to extend the Center’s impact
across institutions will operate through the Administrative Core. And finally, the core will initiate strategic
planning activities that anticipate, shape, and respond to emerging priorities at the NIH and in the broader
scientific community. These activities are reflected in five specific aims. First, the Core will support clinical trials
by monitoring and reporting on timely progress, fidelity, quality, and effectiveness of scientific and fiscal
operations. Second, the Core will lead a robust targeted pilot grant program, including organizing review
panels, with consultation from Center leaders and the External Advisory Committee. Third, the Core will
expand the reach of Center activities in strategic science communication and collaboration opportunities with
industry leaders, non-profit organizations, external research institutions and government agencies. Fourth, the
Core will convene and coordinate an External Advisory Committee to provide feedback to the Director on
scientific and administrative decisions. Finally, the Core will coordinate communication among team members,
meetings, and travel to annual Roybal Center network meetings organized by the coordinating center and
funder. By drawing on best practices for soliciting, reviewing, and managing pilot studies, the Administrative
Core will ensure that the pilot grant program is structured, transparent, and effective in identifying innovative
projects with high potential for impact. These efforts aim to lay the foundation for a large national trial to
validate physical activity as a preventive strategy for Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias (AD/ADRD)."
10875160,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT CORE
The goal of the Behavioral Intervention Core for the Penn State Roybal Center is to develop principle-driven
scalable and potent digital intervention components that promote adherence to physical activity and enhance
cognitive function following the end of the active intervention period. Drawing on an experimental medicine
approach and Stage 0 research, our team identified three validated target mechanisms of adherence to
behavior change: automatic affective evaluations, experienced automaticity (habit strength) and identity. The
strategies for engaging these reflexive targets differ from those used to engage self-regulatory targets (e.g.,
goals, plans) because the reflexive targets are grounded in associative learning processes. We will investigate
two intervention strategies that can engage these targeted mechanisms of adherence to behavior change:
precision messaging and evaluative conditioning. A Community Advisory Board will assist us in refining our
prompt engineering architecture for using generative artificial intelligence (AI) to create intervention content
that is unbiased, unlikely to hallucinate, and culturally sensitive. Trial 1 (NIH Stage 1) will evaluate the non-
inferiority of AI-generated content relative to human-generated content. Trial 2 (NIH Stage 1) will use a within-
person experimental design to determine the optimal daily message budget for promoting physical activity in
middle-aged and older adults. Trial 3 (NIH Stage 3) will use a factorial experiment to evaluate the main and
interactive effects of the two intervention components on targeted mechanisms of adherence to behavior
change, physical activity adherence dynamics following the end of intervention, and cognitive function across
multiple time scales. These trials will accomplish four scientific aims involving content development, target
engagement, adherence dynamics, and cognitive function. We will develop a scalable prompt engineering
architecture that enables a transparent and controllable generative AI system to produce personalized
principle-based intervention content for middle-aged and older adults. We will develop principle-driven
behavioral interventions that engage targeted mechanisms of adherence to behavior change following
intervention. We will elucidate factors contributing to behavioral adherence and enhanced cognitive function in
the six months following the end of the active intervention period. We will characterize the effects of adherence
to physical activity following intervention on cognition across multiple time scales. Collectively, these trials will
fill a need for interventions that support long-term adherence to physical activity and enhance changes in
cognitive function following the end of active intervention support. In combination with evidence from
prospective longitudinal studies linking physical activity with reduced risk for Alzheimer’s Disease and related
dementias (AD/ADRD), this work will provide a foundation for a future national trial of long-term effects of
physical activity interventions on cognitive decline and prevention of AD/ADRD."
10896214,"Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in the hospital and
long term health care settings. In addition to the patient toll, the treatment-associated costs of
C. difficile infections to the United States healthcare system have been estimated at $5 billion.
Although the rate of C. difficile infection in the United States is rising, surprisingly little is known
about the mechanisms by which C. difficile spores maintain their extreme resistance properties.
C. difficile is believed to be acquired by the host in the form of a dormant spore which
contaminates the nosocomial environment. In other organisms, a significant amount of resistant
to UV and genotoxic chemicals is provided by the small acid soluble proteins (SASPs). SASPs
are thought to nonspecifically bind to DNA and alter its form to prevent the formation of
thymidyl-thymidine adducts (thymidine dimers) upon UV exposure. These proteins also provide
resistances to reactive oxygen, acids, crosslinking agents and minor resistance to heat. In C.
difficile, however, nothing is known about how these important proteins contribute to the C.
difficile spore resistance spectrum. C. difficile SspA provides resistance to UV but SspA & SspB
play a role in spore formation. The C. difficile ΔsspA ΔsspB double mutant strain does not
produce mature spores suggesting that these SASPs regulate, at some level, the sporulation
program. This application will analyze the impact of SASPs on spore biology in three aims. Aim
1 investigates how SspA & SspB contributes to spore formation and how the C. difficile SASPs
protect the C. difficile genome from UV damage. Aim 2 investigates mechanisms by which the
SASPs contribute to spore formation. Aim 3 investigates how the protease that degrades the
SASPs during germination is regulated and its spectrum of activity in the spore. Successful
completion of these aims will thoroughly characterize the impact of SASPs on spore resistance
and lead to the future design of agents that can clean a contaminated environment."
10896224,"Abstract:
Liquid–liquid phase separation of RNA-binding proteins (RBP) is a recently appreciated means of intracellular
compartmentalization underpins the biogenesis of diverse membraneless organelles. Despite clear biological
utility, dysregulated phase separation of RNA-binding protein (RBP) leads to protein aggregation and fibrils
formation, which are key pathological features of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. The central hypothesis
of my work, and the driving force of my lab, is that reversing aberrant phase transition and aggregation is a
potential avenue to combat these fatal diseases. In fact, we and others have established that nuclear import
receptors (NIRs) such as Kapβ2 can reverse protein aberrant phase transition and elevated Kapβ2 expression
can suppress neurodegeneration caused by disease-linked RNA-binding proteins. Thus, NIRs and other
regulators of protein phase transition could be leveraged therapeutically to restore normal function of
membraneless organelles and mitigate proteotoxicity caused by aberrant phase transition. However, several key
knowledge gaps regarding the regulation of phase transition must be filled, to lay the foundation to develop such
therapeutic strategies. Thus the long-term goal of my research program is to achieve a more comprehensive
understanding of the regulatory mechanism of protein phase separation and leverage our understanding of
phase regulation to develop strategies with therapeutic potential to reverse proteotoxicity induced by aberrant
phase transition. I seek to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the regulation of protein phase separation, both
in health and disease conditions.
We propose to focus on three main themes over the next five years: (1) Define the mechanism of how Kapβ2
reverses protein aberrant phase transition. (2) Define the scope and specificity of Kapβ2 and other nuclear import
receptors in their function in regulating phase separation in live cells. (3) Based on our preliminary results that
RNA oligonucleotides with specific sequences have diverse activities in regulating RNA-binding protein phase
separation, we will identify the sequence space of RNA in regulating RBP phase separation and develop
innovative single-molecule fluorescence-based biophysical methods to understand the mechanism of RNA’s
function. Our work will significantly contribute to our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of phase
separation in cells and how the breakdown of this regulation leads to disease conditions. Furthermore, this work
will set the stage for developing strategies to enhance the activity of Kapβ2, as well as RNA-based
oligonucleotides that can mitigate toxic aberrant phase transition, both of which provide the basis for developing
innovative therapeutics to restore the healthy protein phase in cells."
10896228,"Project summary: Synaptic plasticity in brain structures like the hippocampus has been hypothesized to
underlie an essential brain function - consolidating transient experiences into long-lasting memories. The
importance of sleep for promoting long-term memory storage, and the disruptive effect of sleep deprivation on
memory, have been appreciated for nearly a century. However, it remains unclear how sleep-associated
changes in the activity of specific brain circuits contribute to synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and other
structures. The studies proposed here will test a novel hypothesis – that sleep and sleep loss differentially affect
memory consolidation through their differential effects on separate subpopulations of hippocampal interneurons.
We will use a simple behavioral paradigm for studying sleep-dependent memory consolidation in mice
(contextual fear memory; CFM) in combination with state-targeted pharmacogenetic and optogenetic
manipulations of parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM+) hippocampal
interneurons. In the context of these experimental manipulations, we will measure downstream effects on sleep-
associated CFM consolidation, hippocampal network activity, microcircuit-level changes in neuronal structure,
and biochemical changes in genetically-defined cell populations. We will first assess the effects of learning itself
(contextual fear conditioning; CFC) and subsequent sleep or sleep deprivation (SD) on neuronal morphology
using cell type-specific Brainbow labeling, and intracellular processes using cell type-specific translating
ribosome affinity purification (TRAP). We will then determine how state-specific manipulations of hippocampal
PV+ interneuron activity (which disrupt of rescue sleep-dependent CFM consolidation) affect these sleep-
dependent processes. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that SD disrupts CFM consolidation by selectively
activating SOM+ interneurons in the hippocampus, leading to suppression of activity in neighboring neurons. We
will test whether pharmacogenetic activation of these neurons (mimicking effects of SD) disrupts CFM
consolidation in freely-sleeping mice, and whether inhibition of these neurons during SD (mimicking effects of
sleep) rescues CFM consolidation. We will then assess the effects of changing SOM+ interneuron activity levels
on post-CFC changes in hippocampal network activity patterns, neuronal morphology, and cell biology. Together,
these studies will test the necessity and sufficiency of state-dependent activity in defined hippocampal neuron
populations for long-term storage of new memories."

10896389,"The HIV and opioid epidemics intersect, impacting millions of people worldwide. Antiretroviral therapy (ART)
has improved and extended the lives of people with HIV, PWH. However, milder chronic HIV associated
neurocognitive impairments known as mild HAND or HIV-NCI persist. HIV-NCI affect 15-40% of PWH and
because they persist for life, worsen with age, and affect adherence to medications, they can significantly
reduce quality of life and increase mortality risk. Many PWH have opioid use disorder, OUD, a comorbidity in
PWH that can exacerbate HIV-NCI. Our novel findings in the first funding cycle demonstrate that buprenorphine,
a well-established opioid agonist therapy used to treat OUD, may also be a therapy for NCI. Buprenorphine
acts as a partial agonist to the mu opioid receptor (MOR) and full antagonist to the kappa opioid receptor (KOR)
and according to some studies, it may improve neuropsychological outcomes in people with OUD with or without
chronic HIV infection. Our studies suggest that this beneficial activity of buprenorphine may due to its
interactions with peripheral blood CD14+CD16+ monocytes, which we showed express MOR and KOR, are
preferentially infected with HIV, and have a selective advantage to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) in response to
CCL2 in vitro. This increased transmigration is reduced by buprenorphine, in part by its ability to limit
CCL2/CCR2 signaling. Our novel findings in EcoHIV infected mice with HIV-NCI demonstrate that
buprenorphine treatment can reverse HIV-NCI in these mice in correlation with a decrease in inflammatory
monocytes in their brains, reduction in HIV brain burden, and a reduction in dendritic pruning, a marker of HIV
mediated NCI. We hypothesize that buprenorphine mitigates HIV neuropathogenesis and can treat HIV-NCI in
PWH with and without OUD. We also propose that this is mediated through its activity on the Mu and Kappa
opioid receptors. Our studies will also identify receptor(s) by which buprenorphine is exerting its mechanism of
action and will enable the development of second-generation therapies derived from buprenorphine that
specifically target these receptor(s). In Aim1, we will characterize in vitro mechanisms of buprenorphine
mediated inhibition of CD14+CD16+ monocyte transmigration across the BBB and characterize the role of MOR
and KOR in these processes. In Aim 2, we will use genetically modified mice to address individual and combined
roles of MOR and KOR in buprenorphine therapy in the preclinical model of EcoHIV driven HIV-NCI and the
importance of these receptors specifically on myeloid cells in NCI development. In Aim 3, we will characterize
transmigration across a BBB model of mature human monocytes using PBMC from PWH on buprenorphine
and correlate this with the PWH's cognitive functions. These will provide further support for use of
buprenorphine as a therapy for HIV-NCI in PWH with and without OUD. The studies will be performed by a
highly interactive group of HIV scientists, animal model specialists, and infectious diseases, HIV, and OUD
physician scientists, and a neuropscychologist, all recognized experts in CNS disease."
10896392,"Project Abstract
This proposal seeks to understand how biochemical networks organize specific reactions in space
and time, with a focus on regulatory mechanisms in cell signaling and gene expression. We aim
to develop biochemical model systems to understand how cells direct kinase activity in complex,
interconnected signaling networks and to engineer tools to study structure-function relationships
in eukaryotic genomes. These efforts will help us to dissect the mechanistic features that enable
precise spatial and temporal control over biochemical reactions, provide new strategies to
engineer cellular functions, and inform the design of more effective therapeutics that target
specific cellular processes. In cell signaling, scaffold proteins coordinate the formation of physical
complexes that assemble multiple signaling proteins. Scaffold proteins are widely assumed to act
by tethering proteins together to accelerate specific reactions. Recent mechanistic and structural
studies, however, have revealed unexpectedly complex biochemical mechanisms that regulate
signaling through conformational changes and allosteric effects. This complexity is likely
magnified in cellular environments, where multiple pathways compete for shared components and
a plethora of different regulatory factors perform functions that are poorly understood at the
molecular level. In particular, we currently lack a mechanistic framework to understand how
scaffold-mediated kinase reactions are affected by competing scaffolds, phosphatases, and
accessory proteins that assemble higher-order complexes. Addressing this knowledge gap with
quantitative kinetic frameworks, functional models and structural studies is critical for
understanding how cells precisely process and integrate different signaling inputs to achieve
specific outcomes. Conceptually-related questions arise in genome regulation, where spatial
organization also plays a central role. Eukaryotic genomes adopt 3D structures that appear to
promote specific biochemical processes by positioning genes in proximity to remote DNA
regulatory sites or to localized proteins, but this model has not been rigorously tested. A major
challenge is the lack of robust tools to systematically perturb genome structures and assess
effects on function. Recent CRISPR-Cas methods show promise but have not yet been widely
adopted, possibly due to limited efficacy and generalizability. Developing more robust tools to
systematically perturb genome structure will enable us to address critical knowledge gaps in the
relationship between genome structure and function."

The University of Washington (UW) Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) Clinical Core is a valuable
component the center's overall aim of supporting meaningful and innovative ADRD research. Advances in
human genetics, pathological and imaging technologies have revealed the biological diversity of ADRD. The
UW Clinical Core aims to capture this spectrum of ADRD heterogeneity in its longitudinal cohort to support
multi-modal study of participants. Sensitive phenotyping is critical to the interpretation of post-mortem
pathology and ante-mortem imaging heterogeneity. To that end, we have expanded our neuropsychological
evaluation to identify relative vulnerable and resilient cognitive domains. Acknowledging that effective ADRD
therapies for all requires improving study of ADRD in under-represented groups, we have developed a strategy
with our Outreach Recruitment and Engagement Core to enhance the diversity of our ADRC. Over the last 5
years the UW ADRC has built a strong collaborative relationship with the Partners for Native Health, led by Dr.
Dedra Buchwald. In this cycle we continue this effort through developing consensus algorithms for longitudinal
cognitive and clinical data collected by Dr. Buchwald's team. Additionally, we work with the UW ADRC's
Native Research and Resource Core (NRRC) to build upon data derived from community based participatory
research approaches in the AI/AN population and develop community sensitive uniform ADRD clinical
evaluations. The rationale driving the Clinical Core composition is to a) reflect the UW ADRC scientific theme
of heterogeneity and resilience b) respond to the scientific needs of the ADRC research community and c)
increase the racial, socioeconomic and educational attainment diversity of the Clinical Core. In this cycle, the
Clinical Core will 1) Characterize clinically and follow longitudinally persons with normal aging, prodromal and
symptomatic ADRD representing the clinical, anatomic and risk heterogeneity of disease, and promote their
inclusion into research 2) Promote the inclusion of underrepresented groups in ADRD research and collaborate
to establish diagnostic algorithms in AI/AN studies 3) Use modern psychometric approaches to co-calibrate
cognitive scores across UDS, pre-enrollment clinical tests, and external studies to integrate pre-enrollment
cognitive data and facilitate interoperability across and 4) obtain longitudinal CSF, blood and skin
biospecimens from a well-characterized cohort of research participants presenting with normal and
pathological aging, prodromal dementia and ADRD."
10896951,"The primary objectives of the Data Management and Statistics (DMS) Core are to provide data
management and statistical support to the cores and affiliated projects of the University of Washington
Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (UW ADRC). The DMS Core computer and data management
specialists construct, modify, and maintain the databases needed to store, integrate, and access the UW
ADRC data across cores and from outside sources, while ensuring up-to-date computer security. They write
the code for seamless integration and data flow between computers and databases that are in the individual

They coordinate all data flow and data corrections; carry out data quality control and quality assurance
analyses; collaborate with other cores to make necessary data corrections, and submit data to the National
Alzheimer's disease Coordinating Center for sharing with other investigators. They also develop data
representations and data access procedures, and collaborate with other cores to derive attributes of the data
that are used for data queries. The DMS Core statisticians are available to all cores, development projects, and
affiliated projects for consultation and assistance regarding statistical design, analysis, and interpretation of
data, and to initiate new collaborations. They also assist in manuscript preparation and, when needed,
evaluate, develop and/or implement new analytical methodology as working software.
The specific aims are: (1) To provide data management support for projects, cores, affiliated projects and
development projects. This includes ensuring database entry of all Clinical Core data; timely upload of clinical,
neuropathology, and targeted genotyping data to NACC; tracking and monitoring of data completion and
quality; coordination of data flow between cores; coordinating and processing of data corrections; development
of data extraction tools; and maintenance and continued development of the databases. (2) To provide
statistical support for projects, cores, development projects and affiliated projects of the UW ADRC. This will
include providing statistical consultation on design, analysis, and interpretation of results; carrying out data
analyses; assisting with associated manuscript preparation; and evaluating and extending statistical
methodologies. (3) To maintain the computing environment needed to achieve aims 1 and 2.
The Data Management and Statistics Core of the UW ADRC will provide the necessary data management
assistance needed to efficiently and accurately store and retrieve the data collected by the center. Through
assistance with statistical data analysis it will also facilitate the translation of data into scientific discoveries
relevant to the prevention, treatement or diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In doing so, the DMS Core will
facilitate the overall goals of the UW ADRC in its mission toward reducing the burden of Alzheimer's disease."
10917428,"ABSTRACT – MOLECULAR AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING CORE 
The Molecular and Translational Imaging Core (MTIC) provides Lurie Cancer Center (LCC) members with multi- 
modal imaging capabilities that support their cancer research by enabling users to apply advanced imaging 
technologies to their preclinical and clinical studies. The ability to track injected or engrafted cells, administered 
agents, and tumor growth and metastasis in a non-invasive fashion is an invaluable tool in the development and 
testing of new diagnostic and therapeutic agents that can improve patient care. 
The MTIC has sites on both the Evanston and Chicago campuses. Instrumentation that is available to users at 
one or both sites includes MRI, PET/CT, SPECT/CT, and IVIS (fluorescent, bioluminescent and near infrared 
optical imaging). The MTIC provides expert staff in each of these modalities and allows investigators to apply 
the most appropriate imaging methods to their cancer studies. The MTIC collaborates closely with other LCC 
core facilities, including the Developmental Therapeutics Core, the Flow Cytometry Core, and the Mouse 
Histology and Phenotyping Core. During the most recent reporting period, MTIC scientific and technical staff 
provided support to 45 LCC users, 43 of whom had peer-reviewed funding. The scheduled installation of a 
radiochemistry production facility on the Chicago campus, and plans by the MTIC to offer additional, state-of- 
the-art imaging modalities during the next CCSG cycle, will further increase the value of this facility to Lurie 
Cancer Center members."
10886718,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Brain responses to stimuli are not static over time but are dynamically modulated by the context of concurrent
and preceding stimuli. This supports the rapid detection of behaviorally relevant information which may be key
for survival in complex environments. In the visual system, neural activity as early as primary visual cortex (V1)
is increased to stimuli that deviate from contextual patterns, a phenomenon termed “deviance detection.” In
human EEG recordings, this deviance detection is reflected in the “mismatch negativity”, an early scalp potential
elicited by rare stimuli in, for example, an “oddball” sequence. Visual mismatch negativity, and likely deviance
detection, is altered in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, indexing fundamental visual processing
deficits that may undermine how affected individuals relate to their world.
 Despite this basic and clinical significance, the neural circuitry for generating deviance detection is unknown.
Our past work has utilized mice to address this question at a basic level, given the powerful set of genetic and
optical tools available in this animal. We identified robust deviance detection in mouse V1, particularly in
pyramidal neurons (PYRs) in superficial cortical layers (layer 2/3). We then showed that V1 deviance detection
is dependent on i) local GABAergic interneurons and ii) top-down inputs from higher cortical areas (anterior
cingulate; ACa). Exactly how these circuit elements interact to modulate V1 activity in context, producing
deviance detection to novel stimuli, is unclear.
 The current project will build these preliminary insights to test a detailed circuit hypothesis of how deviance
detection responses emerge in V1 in layer 2/3. Specifically, we propose that top-down input to V1 (from ACa)
engages a mutually inhibitory interneuron circuit, involving namely vasoactive intestinal peptide- (VIP) and
somatostatin- (SST) neurons. This serves to transiently modulate the excitability of subsets of PYRs dependent
on their feature selectivity, attenuating responses to redundant stimuli and augmenting responses to deviant
stimuli. To test this hypothesis, we will present visual “oddball” and control sequences to awake mice (which
allows us to parse true deviance detection from the absence of simple neural adaption). We will employ two-
photon calcium imaging and spatiotemporally precise optogenetic interventions (one and two-photon) to record
and manipulate cell-type specific activity dynamics in V1. In aim 1, we will optically probe PYR excitability with
single cell resolution during specific phases of the oddball paradigm, assessing PYR responses relative to their
feature selectivity. Next, we will optically suppress SST and VIPs in V1 (aim 2) and then top-down ACa inputs to
V1 (aim 3) at specific phases of the oddball paradigm while recording PYRs, SSTs, and VIPs to precisely test
predictions of our circuit hypothesis. This focused, technologically advanced approach, applied during a passive
and highly translatable sensory stimulation paradigm, will provide fundamental insights which could transform
how basic visual processing and central visual circuitry is studied and understood in health and disease."
10886719,"COPD SUBTYPING AND EARLY PREDICTION USING INTEGRATIVE PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL
MODELS
ABSTRACT
One of the main obstacles in developing efficient personalized therapeutic and disease management strategies
is that most common diseases are typically defined based on symptoms and clinical measurements, although
they are believed to be syndromes, consisting of multiple subtypes with variable etiology. Identifying disease
subtypes has thus become very important, but so far it has been met with limited success for most diseases. In
asthma, a notable exception, it was the clinical characterization that led to successful subtyping; and this is now
incorporated in treatment guidelines. Unsupervised machine learning approaches of single data modalities (e.g.,
omics, radiographic images) have not produced actionable subtypes due to instability across cohorts. Developing
data integrative approaches for multi-scale data, which are becoming available for a number of diseases, is
expected to lead to robust subtyping and provide mechanistic insights of disease onset and progression.
This proposal focuses on developing new computational methods, based on probabilistic graphical models
(PGMs), to address this unmet need; and apply them to investigate three problems of clinical importance in
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the fourth leading cause of mortality in USA. Our
underlying hypothesis is that PGMs can integrate and analyze under the same probabilistic framework
heterogeneous biomedical data (omics, chest CT scan, clinical) and identify disease subtypes and their main
determinants. The objectives of our proposal is to build a comprehensive computational framework for disease
subclassification, identify stable COPD subtypes at the baseline and longitudinally, and build interpretable
models of the disease The deliverables of this project are: (1) new integrative computational approaches for
clinical subtyping from multi-scale data; (2) new predictors of COPD progression and severity; (3) new
discoveries of longitudinally stable COPD subtypes; (4) new predictors of future development of COPD; (5) new
omics datasets that will be invaluable to future research in the area (baseline and longitudinal).
To ensure the success of the project we follow a team science approach. This multi-PI proposal builds on the
ongoing efforts of our group in the area of graphical models and their applications in biomedicine; and the
ongoing collaboration of the three PIs that have complementary strengths: Prof. Benos (systems medicine and
machine learning), Dr. Hersh (COPD genetics and genomics) and Dr. Sciurba (clinical aspects of COPD). It is
powered by the access of the investigators to three major COPD cohorts (COPDGene®, SCCOR, ECLIPSE) that
contain multiple parallel deep phenotyping and omics data from thousands of patients and controls. Although in
this project we focus on COPD, our methods are generally applicable to any disease, therefore our project will
have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables. We believe that due to their robust nature and
interpretability, PGMs will soon become the norm for multi-scale biomedical data integration and modeling, when
genetic and genomic data collection will become routine prognostic and diagnostic tools in clinical practice."
10886720,"Current standard of care for kidney transplant (KTx) recipients has only modestly improved long-term
aggregate graft and/or patient survival, identifying a crucial unmet medical need. As the at-risk KTx population
is heterogeneous, the currently employed and relatively homogeneous therapeutic approach to
immunosuppression in KTx in the US and Canada is suboptimal, and results in a significant proportion of over-
immunosuppressed recipients, many with tacrolimus-related toxicities. In this U01 application, Co-PIs Heeger
and Nickerson will build upon their past, productive collaborative efforts, their established multicenter trial
consortium and infrastructure, as well as their expertise in biomarkers and mechanistic studies to address this
unmet need. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to determine the utility of the HLA-DR/DQ
molecular mismatch (mMM) score, as a risk stratifying biomarker in KTx. While retrospective studies showed
strong correlations between the HLA-DR/DQ mMM score and the risk of developing biopsy proven acute
rejection (BPAR) and/or donor specific antibodies (DSA), no prospective studies have tested the HLA mMM
score as a risk stratifying biomarker for immunological KTx injury. Nor have any studies attempted to test
whether and how the HLA-DR/DQ mMM score performs as a predictor of outcome following a change in
transplant immunosuppression. Herein, we propose a multicenter observational study with a nested
randomized controlled (RCT) trial to address these deficiencies. We will prospectively test the utility of the
HLA-DR/DQ mMM score as a prognostic biomarker of primary alloimmunity [T cell mediated rejection (TCMR),
DSA, and antibody mediated rejection (ABMR)] in KTx (Aim 1, observational study of 800 KTx). We will also
test the hypothesis that the HLA-DR/DQ mMM score is a predictive biomarker that identifies KTx recipients
who will tolerate substituting the calcineurin inhibitor with self-administered, subcutaneous abatacept
(costimulatory blockade), without an unacceptable increased risk of BPAR, while reducing the morbidity of CNI
off-target effects (300 KTx, Nested RCT with a non-inferiority endpoint, Aim 2). Accompanying mechanistic
studies (Aim 3) will provide novel immunological and molecular insights that will also aid in interpreting graft
and recipient outcomes of the trial. If successful, the work will provide crucial information capable of positively,
and directly affecting clinical care. The results from the proposed work also have the potential to influence
positively the design of future RCTs by providing an HLA-DR/DQ mMM score-based stratification or
enrichment strategy for enrolling subjects into trials most likely to be informative for the proposed study agent--
thereby increasing likelihood of trial success in the shortest possible time."
10886621,"Persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) have markedly reduced bone mass and the loss of skeletal
architectural integrity, which predisposes them to low-impact fractures. Currently, there is no practical treatment
to reverse the severe bone loss in persons with chronic SCI. In the proposed study, a dual pharmacological
intervention will be tested to improve bone health. Restoration of bone mass below the level of injury would be
expected to reduce the morbidity associated with fractures and permit safer participation in upright activities.
Quality of life would be substantially improved because of the ability to engage more securely in activities of daily
living and to integrate into the community. Despite the depressed skeletal activity below the level of lesion in
persons with chronic SCI, net bone loss occurs because resorption exceeds formation, with a difference
between these rates in those with SCI being greater than that observed in the able-bodied population. Thus, it
would be anticipated to be of value in persons with chronic SCI to increase bone turnover with the objective to
increase bone formation over that of bone resorption. In a preclinical study that administered an anti-sclerostin
antibody to rats 12 weeks after complete spinal cord transection bone, mineral density (BMD) was almost fully
restored at the distal femoral metaphysis, with improved bone structure, and mechanical strength; in contrast,
vehicle-treated animals after complete spinal transection had a marked reduction in distal femoral metaphysis
BMD and a deterioration in bone structure and mechanical strength. When used to treat postmenopausal
osteoporosis, romosozumab, a human monoclonal anti-sclerostin antibody, was more effective to increase
bone mineral density (BMD) and to reduce fracture than any other anti-resorptive or bone-anabolic agent, and
this effect was also evident for the appendicular skeleton, which is the site in individuals with chronic SCI of
greatest bone loss and most frequent fracture. Because of the absence of clinical options available for the
treatment of osteoporosis in individuals with chronic paralysis, the investigators have proposed to test an
antagonist of sclerostin, which is a potent bone anabolic agent with proven efficacy in treating women with
postmenopausal osteoporosis, to improve bone mass and reduce fragility fractures.
 Thirty-nine male and female subjects with chronic, motor-complete SCI (>3 post injury, American Spinal
Injury Association Impairment Scale A & B) between the ages of 18 and 50 years old who have aBMD at the
distal femur at the distal femur ≥0.7 g/cm2 but ≤1.0 g/cm2 will be recruited for participation in a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group clinical trial. The outcome measures of the proposed study are
bone mineral density (BMD) by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and dual energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DXA), and biochemical markers of bone resorption and formation. Specific Aim 1: To restore
≥5% of baseline integral volumetric BMD (vBMD) at the distal femur measured by peripheral quantitative
computed tomography (pQCT) with 12 months of romosozumab therapy (primary specific aim). Specific Aim
2: To maintain, or to further increase, the gain in the distal femur vBMD at 24 months post the baseline
measurement with dual drug therapy (12 months romosozumab followed by 12 months of denosumab)
(primary specific aim). Specific Aim 3: To demonstrate that the magnitude of change in biomarkers of bone
formation at 1 month of romosozumab therapy are associated with the greatest change in distal femur vBMD at
12 and 24 months (secondary specific aim). Exploratory Aims: Additional variables by pQCT for changes in
the proximal tibia vBMD, distal femur and proximal tibia trabecular BMD (tBMD), cortical BMD of the tibia (38%
of the tibial length), microarchitecture at the distal tibia, and changes in areal BMD at the distal femur, proximal
tibia, and total hip by DXA will be obtained. Additional time points for biomarkers for bone resorption &
formation will be obtained and related to changes in BMD. If successful, this approach will change standard of
care for persons with chronic SCI and increase the ability to perform upright rehabilitation activities."
10886629,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Childhood maltreatment is associated with insecure attachment, emotional dysregulation, and abnormal threat
detection. Here we propose that abnormal dysregulation of the brain beta-endorphin signaling pathway plays a
central role linking childhood maltreatment with insecure attachment and with long-term behavioral
abnormalities. This idea is supported by work showing that dysregulation of the main beta-endorphin receptor
(mu-opioid receptor, or MOR) is associated with insecure attachment, emotional dysregulation, and abnormal
threat detection. To test this premise, we developed a mouse model of complex trauma, abbreviated UPS. UPS
recapitulates several key features of childhood maltreatment including the presence of multiple adversities,
fragmented abusive maternal care, insecure attachment, impaired maternal buffering, increased threat detection,
and abnormal social exploration. We also discovered that neurons in the hypothalamus expressing the agouti-
related peptide (Agrp) are rapidly activated in response to unpredictable maternal separation in infant mice.
Activation of Agrp neurons triggers the emission of ultrasonic vocalizations—the equivalent of the infant cry—
and solicited dam’s attention and care. Thus, Agrp neurons function as an alarm system for the infant during
distress. Intertwined with Agrp neurons are proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, which are the main source of
beta-endorphin in the brain. We found that POMC neurons of infant mice are rapidly activated by reunion with
the dam. Activation of POMC neurons suppressed, while their ablation increased, the emission of ultrasonic
vocalizations in infant mice. Thus, POMC neurons function as a buffering/safety system for the infant that is
triggered during interactions with the mother. Based on these and other observations detailed in the proposal,
we hypothesize that complex trauma in childhood—modeled by UPS in mice—impairs the ability of the mother
to activate POMC neurons leading to reduced MOR signaling in Agrp neurons. This in turn causes prolonged
activation of Agrp neurons and sustained distress that further erodes maternal buffering, secure attachment, and
the ability of UPS mice to socialize and assess threat later in life. Work in Aim 1 will use fiber photometry in live
moving pups and slice electrophysiology to characterize the effects of UPS on POMC and Agrp neuronal
activation and its impact on MOR signaling in Agrp neurons. Work in Aim 2 will determine the contribution that
POMC neurons and MOR signaling make to maternal affiliation/buffering and threat detection/social behavior in
adolescence. Work in Aim 3 will test the extent to which sustained activation of Agrp neurons in infants is
responsible for the behavioral abnormalities seen in mice exposed to UPS. Successful completion of this work
will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which complex trauma in childhood programs abnormal
attachment, enhances threat detection, and impairs social behavior."
10886729,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by resistance of hepatic, skeletal muscle and
adipose tissues to insulin and a relative deficiency of insulin secretion by pancreatic β cells. T2D has a substantial
genetic component, and over the past decade human genetic studies have identified over 400 association
signals across diverse populations. However, in most cases the specific variants and genes responsible for these
association signals are not known. T2D signals include loci for which functions of the protein products encoded
by nearby genes are poorly characterized, the closest known gene is distant, or more than one gene appears to
be a plausible biological candidate. Identifying the causal variants, the regulatory gene networks affected by the
change in DNA sequence, and the mechanisms by which such variation leads to disease are critical steps toward
understanding the genetic architecture of T2D, validating potential drug targets, and developing novel therapeutic
strategies. Here, we propose large-scale multi-disciplinary functional genomics projects in islet, liver, adipose
and muscle cells to determine the contributions and mechanisms underlying T2D risk-associated variants and
their downstream effector transcripts. Throughout the project, we leverage our prior and ongoing generation of
genomic data sets and genome-wide and targeted screens for function of variants and genes. To complement
these efforts, we will first collect genome-wide array and sequencing-based association study results, identify
conditionally distinct association signals and construct credible sets of variants. We propose to link variants to
effector transcripts through analyses of genome-wide transcriptomic and epigenomic data, perturbation assays
that alter thousands of variant-containing regulatory elements and effector transcripts, perturbations of tens of
specific variants, and integrative computational analyses. Next, we propose systematic evaluation of hundreds
of potential effector transcripts through use of genome-wide and targeted screens of insulin secretion, lipid
accumulation, mitochondrial function, glucose uptake, and differentiation state, with assay selection depending
on cell type. Based on these results, we propose focused studies on tens to hundreds of potential effector
transcripts to evaluate electrophysiology, gluconeogenesis, lipid metabolism and signaling pathways, and we
propose thorough investigation the context-specific mechanism of action of individual genes. Finally, we propose
to analyze, integrate, and visualize all data by placing effector transcripts into cell-type and environmental
context-specific networks, selecting network nodes as candidate biomarkers and modulation points for drugs,
and building a framework to understand the tissue-specific contribution of variants and transcripts to individual
disease heterogeneity. Successful completion of these aims will translate T2D association signals into biological
insights and therapeutic targets."
10885270,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1/YKL-40) is a well-known biomarker for the early detection of
neuroinflammation and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It acts as a master regulator of immunity in peripheral tissues,
engaging defined cell surface receptors to regulate a wide range of injury and repair responses. In the brain,
CHI3L1 is primarily secreted by astrocytes and indicates the reactive, neurotoxic state triggered by inflammation
and other stress. The association with CHI3L1 expression and AD pathological and clinical manifestations is well
established, but the exact mechanism by which CHI3L1 contributes to AD pathogenesis is still unclear. The
dynamic interactions between microglia, astrocytes and neurons are central in the inflammatory neurotoxicity
that leads to neurodegeneration in AD. Understanding the intricate cellular cross-talk in human neural systems,
as well as the role of CHI3L1 in this process, thus signifies a critical need for developing therapeutics for AD.
Using human stem cell-based methods and original transgenic mouse models, the overall objectives are
twofold: i) to define the signaling mechanism whereby CHI3L1 governs neurodegeneration caused by glial
activation; and ii) to develop the translational potential of these signaling mechanisms to prevent neuronal
damage in AD. Our central hypothesis posits that CHI3L1, derived from astrocytes, functions as a signaling
molecule that mediates inflammatory responses in a manner specific to different cell types, ultimately promoting
neuronal degeneration and regulating microglial inflammatory profiles. Importantly, we also hypothesize that by
silencing CHI3L1 signaling in neurons, we can mitigate neurotoxicity and ameliorate AD pathology. To dissect
the complex interactions between brain cell types, we plan to utilize to iPSC-based cultures consisting of pure
and mixed populations of human microglia, astrocytes and neurons. Furthermore, we will leverage our unique
transgenic mouse strains with astrocyte-specific CHI3L1 conditional knockout to rigorously test our hypothesis.
To accomplish the overall objectives, we will pursue the two specific aims: Aim 1 is to investigate how CHI3L1
induces neuronal apoptosis and neurodegenerative changes through interactions with receptors on neurons and
microglia, by using iPSC-based neural culture systems to dissect the neuroprotective role of CHI3L1 and inspire
the development of anti-neuroinflammatory therapeutics; Aim 2 is to determine the translational potential of
targeting CHI3L1 signaling for neurodegeneration in AD, by manipulating astroglial expression of CHI3L1 and
its identified neuronal receptor to remedy brain pathology and behavioral defects in AD-relevant mouse models.
 The expected outcomes of this study include defining a CHI3L1-mediated signaling mechanism that
governs neurodegeneration in AD pathogenesis. This work is highly significant and innovative as it aims to
elucidate the biological role of CHI3L1, a prominent AD biomarker. By understanding the involved molecular and
cellular functions of CHI3L1, this study could pave the way for new treatments for AD and relevant disorders."
10876243,"Over the past 30 years, the scope of Systems Neuroscience has expanded enormously. Functional brain imaging has provided the opportunity to study the neural mechanisms of complex cognitive functions in humans. Concurrently, powerful techniques such as optogenetics have made it possible to dissect neural circuits with unprecedented resolution. In parallel, computational approaches such as deep networks and Bayesian models are increasingly central to the field as a whole, putting a premium on advanced quantitative skills and literacy. Clearly Systems Neuroscience is now a trans-disciplinary field, integrating theoretical frameworks and techniques from molecular biology, neurophysiology, cognitive science, ethology, computer science, statistics, and more. In the face of this remarkable expansion, PhD programs face three challenges. First, although the body of knowledge relevant to Systems Neuroscience has increased in breadth and depth, students also face increased pressure to conduct research, publish, and get independent funding early in their career. Second, systems-level research is conducted in multiple departments and PhD programs. At Washington University, these include the PhD programs in Neuroscience, Psychology, and Biomedical Engineering. Yet, students coming from different disciplines often do not speak each other’s language. Third, a successful career in science requires a broad portfolio of professional skills – writing papers and grant proposals, collaborating with colleagues with different scientific backgrounds, presenting results in scientific venues and to wider audiences, navigating the academic job market – that exceed the normal coursework. The Cognitive, Computational and Systems Neuroscience (CCSN) pathway was developed in response to these challenges. CCSN is an elite pathway available for graduate students in years 3-4, with eligibility from multiple PhD programs relevant to Systems Neuroscience broadly defined. The emphasis of CCSN is on trans- disciplinary training and professional skills development. To access the pathway, students must complete (in years 1-2), three pre-requisite and foundational courses on systems neuroscience, cognitive science and animal behavior, and computational neuroscience. In year 3, CCSN students take two additional courses – one providing foundational knowledge and hands-on training with advanced quantitative methods and data-science tools, and the other allowing them to develop a trans-disciplinary grant proposal – which often becomes an actual NRSA application – shaped by peer, instructor, and committee feedback. In year 4 (and throughout the pathway), CCSN students take part in multiple Career Development activities, including mentoring junior students, organizing scientific events, interacting with external speakers, participating in informal dinners with CCSN faculty, and taking part in community outreach. The CCSN pathway has existed for ~15 years and has a demonstrated history of remarkable success. Here we request funds for 5 fellowships. Contingent on the success of this application, Washington University will provide matching funds for an additional 5 slots."

10877134,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Quantitative Science Shared Resource (QSSR)
Quantitative science shared resources have been, from the beginning of cancer centers, a centerpiece of the
support that underpins and adds value to a cancer center. The same holds true today, although needs and
solutions have evolved. At present, as a matrix Shared Resource (SR) within the Dan L Duncan Cancer Center
and the Advanced Technology Cores of Baylor College of Medicine, the Quantitative Science Shared Resource
(QSSR) continues to play a critical role. The Resource, originally titled Biostatistics and Informatics Shared
Resource (BISR), was initially established as part of the first CCSG application in 2006. In response to changing
needs, we have renamed the SR and restructured services and collaborative support to focus on biostatistics,
bioinformatics, and computational infrastructure in the form of our High Performance Compute (HPC) cluster.
Specific Aims of the Shared Resource include:
Aim 1. To provide state-of-the-art design, conduct, analysis, and interpretation to clinical, translational, and basic
 science cancer-related research through biostatistical, bioinformatic, and multi-omic methods;
Aim 2. To provide access to high quality, professionally managed high performance computing;
Aim 3. To coordinate with other high-throughput oriented Shared Resources on their analytic and data
 management needs;
Aim 4. To assist the DLDCCC with education and training, scientific review, data monitoring, and strategic
planning.
The QSSR is a critical resource to the Cancer Center. During the last 4 years we contributed to virtually every
aspect of Cancer Center endeavor – ranging from basic through clinical research, coordination of data flows with
other shared resources, scientific review, and education. Despite having transitioned to management as a BCM-
wide matrix SR, we continue to have a very high level of cancer focus. We are well represented at the leadership
level of the Cancer Center, where QSSR leaders serve on a number of committees, including the Executive
Committee. We are well-positioned to advise the DLDCCC on quantitative aspects of strategic initiatives and to
respond to new or changing priorities. During the last funding period, we continued to grow strategically, adding
faculty, staff and restructuring services, according to the plans put forward in our initial and subsequent
applications, and on advice of oversight and advisory committees, and Cancer Center leadership. Future plans
include additional faculty and staff recruitment, promoting enhanced access to High Performance Computing,
and assisting high-throughput technology-oriented shared-resources with improved data management and
analysis pipelines."
10877135,"CELL SIGNALING AND METABOLISM (CSM) PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY
The renamed Cell Signaling and Metabolism (CSM) Program incorporates three central Themes; New Target
Discovery Theme, Cancer Metabolism Theme, and the Cell Signaling and the Microenvironment Theme. The
scientific goals of the Program are to better understand cancer biology through use of multi-omics platforms in
order to identify and assess new targets of opportunity and therapeutic approaches. The Program has
considerable strength in new discovery through integration of genomic and epigenomic deconvolution
approaches, coupled together with metabolomics to inform on putative signaling pathways. The Program has 40
Research members, 23 Clinical, 7 Adjunct and 3 Shared members who interact via thematic subgroup meetings
and the Disease Working Groups. Members represent 16 basic science and clinical departments, including
Molecular and Human Genetics, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Molecular and Cellular Biology, Pathology
and Immunology, Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, and Obstetrics and
Gynecology. Members focus on multiple different cancer types including pancreas, gastrointestinal, liver, lung,
prostate, bladder, and head and neck cancers. During the last budget year, the CSM Program had a total direct
funding of $14.2 million that included $4.2 million in NCI funding, $2 million from other NIH institutes, $4.7 million
direct in other peer-reviewed funding, and $3.4 million direct from other non-peer reviewed funding. During the
previous 5 years, Program members have published a total of 706 manuscripts with 24% resulting from intra-
programmatic collaborations, 18% inter-programmatic, and 73% from inter-institutional collaborations. Several
publications and joint funding have resulted from an enhanced communication effort between members via
thematic subgroup interactions. In particular, considerable effort has been made and future plans include use of
multi-omic approaches to identify targetable altered signaling pathways that are informed by metabolic
interrogation. This includes a focus to identify pan-cancer alterations. These efforts are also based on catchment
area issues, including smoking and obesity, in particular. In addition, considerable effort is focused on identifying
biological mechanisms that underlie health care disparity. Future directions include expanding formal career
enhancement and trainee educational efforts via enhanced communication and programs. Specific Aims are: 1.
To identify and characterize the overlapping molecular underpinnings and pathways regulating metabolic
rewiring to delineate key common molecular mediators associated with cancer onset and progression. 2. To
evaluate actionable signaling pathways and biological targets that are causal or a consequence of metabolic and
molecular mediators of cancer progression. 3. To enact translation of key findings through interactions with the
Center for Drug Discovery, the Therapeutic Innovation Center, and the Disease Working Groups to foster
development of novel diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches."
10877137,"NUCLEAR RECEPTOR, TRANSCRIPTION, AND CHROMATIN BIOLOGY (NRTBC) PROGRAM
PROJECT SUMMARY
The overall objective of the NRTCB program is to conduct impactful basic research and to promote rapid
translation of discoveries linked to NR-dependent and epigenetic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of
carcinogenesis to the clinic to accelerate development of new preventative and therapeutic interventions. The
program has 2 main themes: (1) Identification of NRs that contribute to cancer pathogenesis and progression,
disclosure of their mechanisms of action, and evaluation of their potential as novel therapeutic targets, and (2)
Biology and function of chromatin regulators that mediate epigenetic regulation of transcription in cancer. The
program has 20 actively funded Research Members, 2 Clinical, 2 Adjunct, and one Shared Member with
extensive research experience related to the 2 themes and drawn from several departments including Medicine,
Molecular and Cellular Biology, Molecular and Human Genetics, and Pharmacology. The program is led by Dr.
Suzanne Fuqua, a translational research expert in estrogen receptor action in breast cancer, together with 2 Co-
Leaders, Dr. Cheryl Walker, an internationally recognized expert on environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factor
interactions in cancer and Dr. Nicholas Mitsiades, a clinical researcher with extensive experience in oncology
clinical trial design and execution in the area of NRs and prostate cancer. Members of the Program have $15.9
million (direct costs) in cancer-related research funding, of which $9.9 million is peer-reviewed and $6 million is
non peer-reviewed. Peer-reviewed funding includes nearly $6.4 million in NIH support, of which $5.3 million is
from the NCI. NRTCB Program members have a strong record of programmatic interactions as evidenced by 16
externally funded programmatic grants. Members continue to make outstanding research progress as evidenced
by over 321 cancer-related publications over the past 5 years of which 25% and 70% involve intra- and inter-
programmatic collaborations and 52% are inter-institutional. Major scientific accomplishments include novel
discoveries of (1) a role of androgen receptors in breast cancer resistance to endocrine therapies, (2) a role for
the NR, CAR in liver cancer, (3) a novel miRNA-regulated signaling axis required for suppression of COUP-TFII
driven prostate cancer metastasis, (4) glucocorticoid receptors as novel therapeutic targets for RUNX1-ETO
positive acute myeloid leukemia, (5) a role for epigenetic regulators in control of cytoskeletal dynamics, (6) a role
for Warburg-associated glycolytic reprogramming in epigenetic activation of SRC-3 driven oncogenic
transcriptional programs, and (7) a role for prostate cancer associated mutations in SPOP in regulation of
androgen receptor turnover. Translational advances include: (1) Preclinical validation of the NR4A activator,
dihydroergotamine, as a novel therapeutic drug for AML, (2) Four new investigator-initiated trials including:
tamoxifen for treatment of bladder cancer; meclizine, an inverse agonist for CAR, for treatment of liver cancer;
Sertraline for treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome; and racial disparities in hormonal therapy response in men
with metastatic prostate cancer, and (3) Commercial development of new first-in-class therapies targeting SRC-
3 with Coactigon Inc."
10877139,"Mechanisms in Cancer Evolution Program (MCEP)
PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the Mechanisms in Cancer Evolution Program (MCEP) at the DLDCCC is focused on
understanding molecular mechanisms that generate heterogeneity (genetic and non-genetic or epi-genetic) and
environmental drivers that spur evolution of cancers. Evolution occurs by variation, which creates heterogeneity
and selection. Heterogeneity is generated by intrinsic genomic and non-genetic phenotype-plasticity
mechanisms, as well as by alteration of cellular programs by extrinsic viruses, the microbiome, and nutritional
modulation. The goal of the MCEP is fundamental basic science discovery of how these molecular mechanisms
work. New paradigms discovered can open new translational directions (throughout the DLDCCC Programs and
by others), including novel evolutionary biomarkers, diagnostic, preventative, and therapeutic tools. For example,
whereas conventional therapies kill cells or stop them from growing (are anti-proliferative), proposed novel
interventions that would slow evolution, promise new and fundamentally different ways to inhibit oncogenesis
and thwart resistance. Also, identification of biomarkers of highly evolvable cells may allow detection of at-risk
individuals, and earlier detection of cancers. The MCEP currently has 26 members: 25 are Research members
from the BCM Departments of Molecular and Human Genetics, Molecular Virology and Microbiology,
Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pediatrics-Oncology, Medicine-Infectious Disease, Pathology and
Immunology, and the Huffington Center on Aging; one is an adjunct member, appointed at the University of
Texas, Austin. Members of the MCEP published a total of 576 cancer-related papers in the previous funding
period with 25% in journals with Impact Factors of 10 or above. Of the 576 manuscripts, 11% represented intra-
programmatic, 46% inter-programmatic, and 68% inter-institutional collaborations. The MCEP currently has a
total of $10.5 million in selected cancer-relevant funding (direct costs per annum), which includes $2 million from
NCI, $5.8 million in other NIH funding and $2.2 million in other peer reviewed funding mostly from the Cancer
Prevention and Research Initiative of Texas (CPRIT). The two MCEP Aims encompass mechanisms of
promotion of heterogeneity by: (1) Intrinsic Evolution Promoters (mutation, genome rearrangement,
recombination, epigenetic heritable protein- and RNA-error-mediated variation); and (2) Extrinsic Evolution
Promoters, including viruses, microbes generally, the microbiome, and nutritional modulators of both host and
microbiome. The CCSG supports this Research Program by providing key Shared Resources, particularly High-
Parameter Flow Cytometry; Advanced Microscopy and Image Informatics; Genomic, Transcriptomic,
Epigenomic and Single-Cell, Metabolomics, and Proteomics; as well as administrative support for meetings,
clubs and interest groups, and pilot funding and recruitment funds."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The main goals of the Breast Program (BCP) are to advance the understanding of breast cancer development,
and the prevention and treatment of breast cancer; to translate laboratory discoveries to clinical practice; to
facilitate intra-programmatic and inter-programmatic interactions; and to provide an enriched learning
environment for students and postdoctoral medical and laboratory-based trainees. The Program has 27
members (22 Research members and 5 Clinical members) and shares 2 members with the Cell Signaling and
Metabolism Program and one member with Cancer Cell and Gene Therapy Program. Jeffrey Rosen, PhD is the
Leader of BCP, and Mothaffar Rimawi, MD, the Co-Leader. BCP includes both a strong basic science group and
a clinical breast center that has a large and active clinical and translational program. As of July 2019, the Program
has total direct funding of $17.4 million, of which $14.2 million is peer reviewed including $6.3 million from the
NCI. In the last 5 years, members of the Program published 301 cancer-related manuscripts in peer-reviewed
journals of which 36% represented intra-programmatic, 21% inter-programmatic, and 65% inter-institutional
collaborations. The BCP is organized around 4 Research Themes: (1) Stem Cells, (2) Treatment Resistance,
(3) Cross Talk and Signaling, and (4) Metastasis and the Tumor Microenvironment. Translation to the clinic is
an integral component of all of these Themes. Our clinical trial portfolio is robust and highly translational. Our
investigators designed and led national and international trials that have the potential to alter the way we
understand and treat breast cancer. BCP investigators translated and led several laboratory discoveries into
national and international clinical trials including 2 trials at the cooperative group level, 2 trials with the TBCRC,
and one global trial. The impact of those trials is likely to alter the way we treat breast cancer. Major
accomplishments of the BCP are: (1) The development of proteogenomics as both a discovery and diagnostic
tool that may identify new therapeutic targets and hypotheses in treatment-resistant advanced breast cancer, (2)
The development of novel small molecule therapeutics to target the unfolded protein response in combination
with chemotherapy in breast cancer, and (3) New insights into the role of RNA splicing in breast cancer
progression. Other achievements include: studies to confirm mechanisms of resistance to endocrine and HER2
targeted therapies, the construction of a unique multiparameter molecular classifier to identify patients whose
tumors can be safely treated with target therapy alone, the identification of novel targetable vulnerabilities in
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), the elucidation of signaling cascades involved in bone micrometastasis,
and the definition of 2 “myeloid subtypes” that contribute to the therapeutic response to immune checkpoint
blockade in TNBC. Several of these observations have formed the basis for the renewal of a Specialized Program
of Research Excellence (SPORE) application that has been continuously funded for 27 years."
10877143,"CANCER CELL AND GENE THERAPY (CCGT) PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY
The goals of the Cancer Cell and Gene Therapy (CCGT) Program are to incorporate advances in cellular and
gene therapy into the treatment of cancer. The CCGT Program is a sub-component of the Center for Cell and
Gene Therapy and has 21 Research members and 9 Clinical members from multiple departments at BCM,
including Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery, Pathology and Immunology, Molecular and Cell Biology, Neuroscience
and Molecular and Human Genetics. The Program received a total of $3.1 million in direct support from the NCI
last year and overall received $14.6 million in direct peer-reviewed funding and $23.1 million in total direct
funding. In the last 5 years, members of the Program published 412 cancer-related manuscripts in peer-reviewed
journals, of which 42% represented intra-programmatic collaborations and 31% inter-programmatic, while 37%
included external collaborators and 34% were published in journals with an Impact Factor >10. Our research
focuses on three themes: normal and malignant stem cells, adoptive immunotherapy of cancer, and improving
outcomes of stem cell transplantation for cancer. CCGT has basic, translational, and clinical research
components. Our basic investigators work on understanding the mechanisms by which normal and malignant
stem cell growth is controlled, and on the molecular and cellular interactions involved in the development of
tumor vasculature and stroma. These researchers are also identifying new targets for immunotherapy, and
optimizing presentation of weak tumor antigens to the immune system. Our translational investigators are moving
cell- and gene-based therapies from the bench to the bedside in a series of small-scale iterative laboratory-
clinical-laboratory protocols, and are also developing pivotal trials. We have a long history of successful and
timely implementation of clinical translational projects in gene and cellular therapy, and we have the resources
to supply and test all the clinical reagents required, through our clinical research infrastructure and the Cell
processing and Vector Production Shared Resource. Major accomplishments in the last 5 years include first-in-
man trials of 10 new cell types/constructs and transfer of several strategies to industry for late-phase testing. We
have shown activity of virus specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in virus-associated cancers (resulting in licensure
of the approach to three companies for late-phase trials) and in ongoing studies are showing anti-tumor activity
of genetically modified T cells in subjects with T cell lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and
nasopharyngeal cancer. Our clinical researchers run the adult and (in collaboration with the Pediatric Cancer
Program) pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplant programs and are extending the applicability of
transplantation for malignancy by using pre-transplant immunotherapy to enable transplant and post-transplant
immunotherapy to augment graft-versus-tumor activity and reconstitute anti-viral immunity.

PROJECT SUMMARY
The mission of the Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences (CPPS) Program is to conduct exceptional
translational research in cancer prevention and control. CPPS achieves this goal by promoting and facilitating
innovative, multi-disciplinary scientific interactions focused on reducing cancer incidence, morbidity and
mortality, and improving cancer outcomes. CPPS membership is comprised of nationally and internationally
recognized scientists with expertise that spans the cancer continuum. The setting of CPPS' research priorities
includes promoting scientific inquiry directed at addressing the cancer prevention and control needs of the people
and communities of the Houston, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), our catchment area (CA). This
includes special emphasis to facilitate the conduct of research that addresses the cancer health disparities
specific to our CA. Following extensive strategic planning and exceptional targeted recruitments, we have
focused and expanded our research efforts to reflect our expertise and the urgent needs of our CA into 3 Specific
Aims as foundational to CPPS research.
Aim 1 (Cancer Etiology and Primary Prevention) encompasses our scientific breadth and depth in the genetic
and environmental causes of childhood and adult cancers and aims to advance risk assessment and guide
primary prevention efforts. Aim 2 (Secondary Prevention and Cancer Outcomes Research) combines our
outstanding secondary prevention and outcomes research to advance early detection, predictive, prognostic,
behavioral, and surgical measures of cancer outcomes. Included are innovative behavioral interventions to
reduce the negative consequences of cancer in our CA via individual, family, and community engagement. CPPS
is also the programmatic home for national experts in quantitative methods and risk modeling (Aim 3). Their work
integrates biomedical data and computational models to enable precision-based cancer prevention and improve
cancer outcomes.
CPPS has 35 Research and 14 Clinical members representing multiple scientific disciplines. Many of our
members have research interests spanning 2, or even all 3 Specific Aims. CPPS members have been successful
in obtaining independent funding to support their research: 100% of our Research members have peer-reviewed
cancer-related research grants or contracts, resulting in a research portfolio (annual direct) totaling $17.5
million, of which $16.2 million is peer reviewed, $4.0 million is from NCI, and $9.6 million from other peer
reviewed funding with $7.1 of that from CPRIT. During the current funding period, CPPS Program members
published 1208 papers, of which 26% were intra-programmatic, 21% were inter-programmatic, and 40% were
inter-institutional. About 37% of the publications are in journals with an impact factor above 5, and 13% are

10877151,"COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT (COE) PROJECT SUMMARY
Community Outreach and Engagement (COE) has been an integral component of the Dan L Duncan
Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) since its inception in 2007 when the Office of Outreach and Health
Disparities (OOHD) was established. Its main activity is to ensure that the diverse and medically underserved
populations of the DLDCCC’s catchment area benefit from innovative outreach, education, screening, and
primary prevention strategies. The OOHD has grown in scope and is charged with disseminating and
implementing evidence-based interventions into practice, with over $10 million in grant funding from NCI, NIH,
and the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas (CPRIT). The DLDCCC’s COE is led by the
OOHD, which leverages over a decade of working with academic and community partners to promote cancer
awareness and prevention in the catchment area, with particular focus on medically underserved and
racial/ethnic minority populations. The COE serves as a driver for the translation of research from the
Research Programs and Disease Working Groups into practice in the catchment area.
The COE leads the characterization of the catchment area to define the cancer burden and identify efforts to
address cancer disparities. Through expanded partnerships with CHI St. Luke’s and continued partnerships
with Texas Children’s Hospital, the catchment area of the DLDCCC was recently expanded to include
communities of the Houston, Texas Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), representing a diverse population of
more than 7 million individuals. In our catchment area we have identified triple negative breast, prostate in
African Americans, lung, colorectal, liver, cervix, HPV- and HIV-associated malignancies, and pediatric cancers
as major cancer burdens and/or cancers that disproportionally affect our catchment area population. Obesity
and underutilization of cancer screening were identified as risk factors. Over the next 5 years, the COE will: (1)
Continuously monitor the cancer burden and risk factors in the DLDCCC catchment area and promote the
engagement of research programs to address the cancer burden and disparities in the catchment area; (2)
Engage the DLDCCC catchment area populations in cancer prevention, control, survivorship outreach,
education, and research to reduce cancer burden and disparities in the catchment area; and (3) Disseminate
and promote integration of evidence-based interventions and findings from research DLDCCC programs,
locally (e.g., in our catchment area), regionally, nationally, and globally through outreach, collaboration, and
policy. This work will be accomplished with guidance from our Community Advisory Board and in close
collaboration with DLDCCC Programs. It will leverage the COE’s strong expertise in developing patient-
centered educational resource, methods to address cancer disparities, and implementing and disseminating
multi-pronged, evidence-based interventions into practice."
10877153,"CPDM PROJECT SUMMARY
The Clinical Protocol and Data Management component of the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center

10877155,"PROTOCOL REVIEW AND MONITORING SYSTEM (PRMS) PROJECT SUMMARY
The Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) has
established the Protocol Review and Monitoring Committee (PRMC) to provide systematic internal oversight of
the scientific and research aspects of all interventional cancer clinical protocols conducted in DLDCCC
institutional facilities. By BCM and DLDCCC policy, the PRMC has authority to approve and close all DLDCCC
clinical research protocols. Chaired by Stacey Berg, MD, the PRMC is organized into an Executive Committee
and 3 Working Groups, with a total of 49 members. The PRMC assigns each protocol a scientific merit score of
1–9 according to standard NIH review descriptors. In addition, a DLDCCC priority score of High, Medium, or Low
is assigned to aid protocol prioritization. Studies that have been approved by the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation
Program or Cancer Prevention and Control Protocol Review Committee, or that are supported by an NIH funding
mechanism that required full peer review as part of the funding process undergo an expedited administrative
review. In addition, for multi-site institutional trials, the protocol may be eligible for expedited PRMC review if
BCM is not the lead site and the approved PRMS of the lead site has performed full scientific review of the
protocol.
The PRMC also monitors progress and accrual of active studies. At the time of each open protocol's annual IRB
review or more often if deemed necessary, the Executive Committee conducts a full review to ensure that
adequate scientific progress is being made. In addition, the Executive Committee reviews the accrual to all open
protocols in each Program on a quarterly basis. Protocols whose accrual continues to lag are subject to closure
by the PRMC, as are protocols whose scientific goals may have been superseded by developments in the field.
PRMC review complements, but does not duplicate, IRB or Data Safety Monitoring Committee review.
From 2016 to 2018, the PRMC reviewed an average of 64 new submissions per year, including 10 DLDCCC
investigator-initiated institutional, 27 National Group, 2 other externally peer reviewed, and 17 industry-
sponsored protocols. In addition, an average of 226 progress reviews and 27 amendment reviews per year were
also performed."
10877562,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Weight loss is associated with a reduction in obesity-related health risks, but can be difficult, with preventing
subsequent weight regain even more challenging. As such, understanding mechanisms underlying energy
balance regulation and identifying strategies for successful weight loss and maintenance are important goals,
and are key components of the Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research. One factor that may contribute to
susceptibility to obesity is a high responsivity to high-calorie foods, which promotes increased caloric intake.
The parent study for this supplement aims to investigate the neuronal and behavioral effects of an intervention
designed to alter affective associations with food, using a novel implicit priming paradigm. Parent project goals
are to further delineate the neuronal mechanisms underlying the intervention, establish intervention impact on
longer-term food preferences and eating behaviors, and determine if it can facilitate weight-maintenance in
individuals with overweight/obesity. Effects of the intervention on neuronal responses to visual food cues and
measures of eating behaviors (food intake, preferences) are measured acutely, but also following 12 weeks of
weekly intervention. Weight and body composition are measured before and after the intervention, and, to
assess lasting effects, 12 weeks after the intervention has ended. This supplement to promote diversity in
health-related research will support research training and career development for an incoming graduate
student who belongs to a group underrepresented in health-related research. The supplement will support her
addition of an assessment of early-life adversity to the parent project, to determine if early-life adversity
impacts the neuronal response to food cues in brain regions involved in reward processing, and if this
mediates effects of adversity on adiposity. The supplement project fits well within the scope of the parent grant,
will strongly support the PhD candidate’s research and training goals, and will also meaningfully contribute to
the parent project."
10899617,"Pneumonia remains the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. Ly6Chi monocytes (iMCs) have an essential
role in the maintenance of homeostasis and control of pulmonary infection. While it has now been recognized
that the functions of iMCs are governed by microenvironment, the impact of local cytokine milieu on iMC function
remains elusive. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), one of the most important host
cytokines that modulate the functions of iMCs, plays a critical role in host defense against several significant
pulmonary pathogens; however, the precise mechanisms by which GM-CSF regulates iMC function to control
pulmonary infection is still not fully understood. My recent studies have discovered that GM-CSF promotes
inflammatory cytokine production by iMCs and MC-derived cells for control of L. pneumophila infection, and that
GM-CSF enhances aerobic glycolysis of MCs which is required for GM-CSF-dependent inflammatory cytokine
production ex vivo. The goal of this proposal is to address the critical gap in knowledge regarding the
mechanisms underlying GM-CSF-mediated metabolic regulation of iMC function for control of pulmonary
infection in vivo. In my preliminary studies, I observed that inhibition of aerobic glycolysis in iMCs exhibited a
significant reduction of inflammatory cytokine production during in vivo L. pneumophila infection, and that
inhibition of histone acetyltransferase, a key enzyme downstream of Acetyl-CoA metabolism for histone
acetylation, abolished GM-CSF-dependent inflammatory cytokine production ex vivo. These preliminary findings
provoke the central hypothesis that GM-CSF supports iMC function for control of pulmonary infection through
aerobic glycolysis-mediated epigenetic reprogramming. My central hypothesis will be tested by 3 aims: Aim 1
will test the hypothesis that GM-CSF supports iMC functional activities to control L. pneumophila infection. Aim
2 will test the hypothesis that GM-CSF regulates aerobic glycolysis of iMCs, which is required for MC-mediated
antibacterial function. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that aerobic glycolysis supports acetyl-CoA-mediated histone
acetylation, which contributes to GM-CSF regulation of MC function. Overall, this proposal will provide insight
into the mechanisms underlying GM-CSF-mediated metabolic control of iMC function against bacterial
pneumonia."
10894897,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
A common and deadly form of familial heart disease is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which is typically
characterized by adverse cellular and ventricular remodeling and systolic dysfunction. DCM is often associated
with loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric or cytoskeletal proteins. Mechanotransmission and
mechanosignaling in cardiomyocytes (CMs) rely on these protein networks, particularly in the costamere, which
provides a direct mechanical link between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the Z-disk of the sarcomere. The
costamere may therefore regulate both ‘inside-out’ mechanotransmission (transmitting sarcomere-born forces
out to the ECM) and ‘outside-in’ mechanosignaling (transmitting/transducing extracellular mechanical signals
into the CM)—the dysfunction of either of which may be central to DCM progression. My overall hypothesis is
that the costamere and cortical cytoskeleton of cardiomyocytes provide key mechanosensitive protein networks
that regulate mechanical signalling pathways initiated by intracellular and extracellular forces, and that specific
defects in these structures inhibits their ability to transmit and transduce mechanical forces, causing contractile
dysfunction and pathological cell remodelling. Supporting this, the costamere protein Filamin C (FLNC) has
recently been implicated in a variety of human cardiomyopathies, including DCM. During my F32 postdoctoral
training, I used a new mouse model that exploits cardiac-specific and inducible homozygous FLNC deletion to
trigger rapid DCM development. I found that a loss of FLNC causes significant reductions in the tissue- and cell-
level contractility, as well as significant CM remodeling accompanied by a reduction in cortical cytoskeleton
stiffness. However, whether FLNC mutations in humans with DCM cause similar defects in cortex structure and
mechanics, systolic mechanotransmission, and mechanosensitive gene regulation requires further investigation.
Thus, the goal of my proposed research is to integrate quantitative subcellular-level structural and
biomechanical measurements with quantitative measurements of intracellular stress distributions and
hypertrophic gene expression patterns in response to intra- and extra-cellular mechanical perturbations
using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) expressing a patient-
specific FLNC-truncating mutation. To accomplish this, I will: (1) combine X-ray diffraction imaging, atomic
force microscopy, and multiscale computational modeling to test the hypothesis that a loss of FLNC disrupts
‘inside-out’ mechanotransmission of sarcomeric forces by dysregulating myofilament lattice geometry via altered
cortical cytoskeleton mechanics in murine CMs, (2) apply these biophysical methods and hypotheses to a new
human DCM model made from gene-edited hiPSC-CMs expressing a patient-specific FLNC-truncating variant,
and (3) combine FRET-based molecular tension sensor imaging, in-vitro extracellular mechanical loading
techniques, and quantitative transcriptomics to test the hypothesis that truncated FLNC dysregulates ‘outside-
in’ mechanosignaling in hiPSC-CMs and promotes DCM remodeling."

Abstract
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the US. Over the past
several decades, androgen deprivation therapy has been the primary therapeutic option for patients with
advanced PCa; however, the majority of patients developed into a poor prognosis stage of castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC), which eventually led to mortality. And the current therapeutic agents for CRPC
patients only extend survival by around 2.5 - 5 months. Therefore, novel and effective therapeutic strategies for
CRPC patients are urgently needed. The long-term goals of this study are to identify druggable signaling
pathways that offer more effective treatment options for patients with CRPC. The objective is to identify the role
of Plk1/p62/Nrf2 signaling pathway in CRPC, and to exploit the potentially therapeutic strategies that could be
benefit the CRPC patients. The central hypothesis is that Nrf2 is activated by a noncanonical mechanism
involving p62 phosphorylation by Plk1 in CRPC. Our hypothesis will be tested by pursuing Three Specific Aims:
(1) to determine the novel role of Plk1 as regulator of cellular response to oxidative stress. (2) examine the role
of Plk1/p62/Nrf2 axis in tumor growth in mouse models. And (3) whether inhibition of Plk1/p62/Nrf2 signaling
pathway enhance the efficacy of CRPC therapy. The expected results will reveal a novel molecular mechanism
to show how Plk1 contributes to PCa progress, and will open up new avenues for application of Plk1 inhibitors
as a therapeutic option. The team, with expertise in Plk1 in mouse models, Plk1 in cancer cell biology, PCa
pathology, GU oncology and biostatistics, will be able to finish the proposed research in a timely manner."
10877841,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Early childhood mental health problems constitute a significant public health concern with wide-ranging impacts
on functioning both concurrently and later in life. Although childhood mental health is influenced by a variety of
factors, the quality of relationships with caregivers plays a critical role. Critical, coercive, and conflictual parent-
child interactions have been consistently linked with increased risk of externalizing and internalizing symptoms,
whereas supportive and nurturing relationships have been shown to confer protective effects. Early intervention
of maladaptive family relationships is thus crucial for preventing or offsetting negative developmental trajectories
in at-risk children. A variety of therapeutic methods have been developed and employed to foster positive parent-
child relationships and improve child mental health, including parent training/education, in-person therapy, home
visiting, school curriculums, and web programs. However, systematic obstacles interfere with the accessibility,
generalizability, and acceptability of these traditional appointment- and module-based approaches. Furthermore,
limitations in the family-centered flexibility, individual responsiveness, and broad availability of these services
render them inadequate to address the unique needs of at-risk populations who would benefit from more readily
accessible and inexpensive 24-hour support that is provided in real time and real life—when and where support
is needed most. Not surprisingly, research finds that roughly half of the families who do participate in traditional
appointment- and module-based mental health services fail to show sufficient symptom improvement. Just-in-
time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), in contrast, utilize smartphones, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI) to
identify and respond to psychological and behavioral processes and contextual events as they unfold in everyday
life. Although JITAIs have the potential to transform the way people receive mental health support, barriers to
their successful, wide-scale implementation remain. Using pilot data collected from smartphones and wearables,
our interdisciplinary team of psychologists and engineers used AI to build machine learning algorithms to detect
psychological states and contextual events, such as ongoing moods and relationship conflict, in couples. In the
current project, we propose developing and testing a JITAI to provide opportune supports to families in dynamic
response to contextual events and shifting psychological states to amplify attachment bonds, regulate emotion,
and intervene in maladaptive parent-child interactional patterns. Building on our prior research, we will (1) build
software to unobtrusively capture real-time data from commercially-available mobile devices, (2) use machine
learning to develop algorithms to automatically monitor psychological and behavioral processes relevant to child
mental health, (3) launch a JITAI to provide as-needed intervention, and (4) carry out a micro-randomized clinical
trial to test the efficacy, acceptability, and safety of our JITAI for decreasing child internalizing and externalizing
symptoms. Our project will contribute to the development of technology ecosystems and service delivery models
with the power to meaningfully transform the accessibility and dynamic responsiveness of mental health care."

The ongoing goal of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is to establish
electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) biomarkers that can be used for stratification and/or as
sensitive and reliable objective assays related to social function in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) clinical trials.
This renewal application seeks to further validate promising measures through three studies designed to
enhance and extend the original ABC-CT study: (1) a confirmation study of the original findings in a new cohort
using similar design (T1: Baseline, T2: 6 weeks post baseline, T3: 24 weeks post baseline) and sample
size/characteristics (200 with ASD, 200 with typical development (TD)); (2) a follow-up study of the original cohort
(N=399) to re-administer the biomarker and clinical batteries 2.5-4 years after original ABC-CT enrollment; (3) a
feasibility study of parallel EEG and ET biomarkers in preschool-aged (3-5-year-old) children (25 with ASD, 25
with TD). The biomarker and clinical batteries measure key facets of social-communication in ASD using well-
validated paradigms appropriate for the intended developmental and cognitive range. The study will rely on the
same leadership and five Collaborating Implementation Sites (“Sites”) from the first phase, all highly experienced
in multi-site collaborative clinical research using the proposed clinical, EEG, and ET methodologies. The Data
Coordinating Core (DCC) will provide a secure informatics infrastructure for communication and data integration
across the consortium to ensure organized data management, quality control, and reliable upload to the National

(DAAC) will oversee consistent use of scientific standards and methodological rigor for data acquisition,
processing, and analytics. The Administrative Core, in coordination with federal partners in this cooperative
agreement, will oversee the operations of the sites, DCC, and DAAC to ensure methodologically and ethically
rigorous, efficient completion of study aims: 1) In the confirmation study with a new cohort, evaluate whether
EEG and ET measures, individually or in combination, have utility as stratification biomarkers and/or sensitive,
reliable measures of change in clinical trials; 2) In the follow-up study of the original ABC-CT cohort, assess
long-term stability, sensitivity to change, and longitudinal predictive value of the markers; 3) In the feasibility
study, determine the viability of parallel EEG and ET measures as potential biomarkers in 3-5-year-old children
with ASD and TD. Blood (DNA) samples will be collected from participants with ASD and biological parents for
future genomic analyses, and raw, processed, and analyzed data will be shared to create a community resource

10880371,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The objective of this Ohio State University postdoctoral clinical T32 training program entitled: “Training
Hematology and Oncology Fellows in Clinical Research” is to provide a state of the art clinical research training
experience, specifically for postdoctoral fellows in Hematology and Oncology with an M.D., D.O., or equivalent
degree who have demonstrated a firm commitment to patient oriented cancer research. The overriding goal of
this training program is to prepare Hematology and Oncology fellows in the OSU Divisions of Hematology and
Medical Oncology for academic careers in patient oriented clinical and translational cancer investigation.
Progress in cancer therapy and prevention requires strong collaborative efforts, and patient oriented physician
investigators provide a critical link with physician-scientists and basic scientists toward this goal. The recent
explosive growth of scientific discoveries and the increasing complexity of cancer clinical trials, particularly phase
I/II studies of novel therapeutic agents and regimens, make it imperative that trainees in Hematology/Oncology
acquire the proper training through appropriate mentoring, to prepare them for careers in clinical and translational
investigation. This T32 program will prepare fellowship trainees for productive academic careers by providing an
intellectually rigorous curriculum, strong mentoring and support from senior faculty, protected time for academic
training during fellowship, “hands on” experience in developing and writing clinical studies and research papers,
and ample opportunities to enhance their OSU experience with extramural programs and workshops sponsored
by the NCI or other professional academic organizations such as ASCO and ASH. The participating members
consist of the 2 Program Directors, Coordinating Committee members, Advisory Committee members, primary
mentors, and contributing faculty, who were chosen based on their prior track record of successful mentoring
and their demonstrated commitment to clinical and translational research. T32 fellows will commit for two years
of training. The strengths of the OSUCCC, primarily in the fields of cancer prevention and experimental
therapeutics, is the perfect environment to our planned success. Our T32 proposal is designed to foster and
ensure the development of fellowship trainees, who we will train to assume academic clinical research positions
as faculty members upon graduation. The T32 program is engineered to empower trainees to become
independent clinical and translational investigators. Trainees will have mandatory an elective training in various
settings, including the opportunity to obtain one or two master degrees; they will be required to create an
investigator initiated clinical study and will start its implementation during training; they will be required to apply
for funding for their own study through peer reviewed grant mechanisms; and they will be offered the opportunity
to network nationally with the NCI and oncology professional organizations. OSUCCC is also deeply committed
to training women and members of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups for academic careers as shown
in continuous efforts to recruit and train female and underrepresented minority fellows."
10898919,"Health data contain a wealth of information for research. Health data, such as found in electronic health
records (EHRs), allow for the identification links between health events, such as drug exposures and side-
effects. Some of these links indicate stable dependencies deemed as causes. Causal insight allows reverse-
engineering disease. If confounding is not addressed, it will be difficult to distinguish causative from correlative
links. Our approach is to identify confounders explicitly. Graphical causal modeling (GCMs) can discover
causal links from data and prior knowledge. GCMs summarize causal links between variables. Automated
selection of variables would allow GCMs to scale and yield more insight from data. Literature-based discovery
(LBD) methods were developed to identify links between concepts in the literature. Advanced methods permit
the search for concepts linked to each other through specific verbs, e.g., “causes”, “treats”. Our hypothesis is
that we can exploit structured knowledge extracted from the literature to inform GCMs. In prior work, we found
that LBD + GCM was better at identifying side-effects in EHR data than traditional methods. Compared to
methods which use solely data, we hypothesize that our method will increase the ability to detect causal
relationships from EHR data. The first aim is to determine the extent to which LBD-informed GCM improves the
identification of causal links for drug safety. We will build LBD-informed GCMs using publicly available
reference datasets for drug safety. These reference datasets contain drug/side-effect pairs for performance
benchmarking. (A) Test the ability of GCM algorithms to identify known causal links solely using data. We will
systematically evaluate GCM algorithms based on their ability to re-discover causal links in a reference
standard. Results will guide our studies on how GCM can be tuned. (B) Determine the effect of adding different
subsets of LBD-derived information to GCMs at identifying drug side-effects. We will build causal models using
increasing numbers confounders. The second aim is to test the ability of LBD built with disease-specific
literature to improve the relevance of LBD derived confounders for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We chose AD for
its high prevalence and relative lack of effective pharmacologic treatment. (A) Compare LBD strategies in a
disease-specific setting. We will test LBD variants using disease-specific literature or with LBD lacking subject-
matter restrictions. (B) Define the ability of robust LBD-informed GCM to validate drug repurposing candidates
for treating AD symptoms. We will test the ability of advanced methods to iteratively resolve hidden latent
confounding, when detected, to improve effect estimates. The fulfillment of these aims will yield new methods
to combine insights from the literature with causal modeling to uncover causal relationships of drug exposures
on adverse events and on beneficial outcomes."

Making advances in oral health depends on training highly skilled scientists capable of conducting rigorous
dental, oral and craniofacial research, and on preparing them to work in multi- and interdisciplinary teams to
translate research findings into applications that improve the health of the public. The proposed training
program at the University of Washington (UW) is a competing renewal of an existing T90/R90 training grant
titled Comprehensive Training in Interdisciplinary Oral Health Research. By leveraging the breadth and
strength of academic research programs available at the UW, we have successfully created and refined a
comprehensive training program that offers a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary oral health research areas,
including public health, behavioral, and clinical, as well as basic and translational sciences. Our previous
NIDCR-funded training programs have been highly effective, with 85% of our former predoctoral and/or
postdoctoral trainees from the prior 15 years going on to work in research-intensive or research-related
positions. Research areas included are public health, behavioral, and clinical, as well as basic and translational
sciences. The Department of Oral Health Sciences (OHS) in the School of Dentistry serves as the focal point for
the program, providing core content for all trainees. Other participating departments include Biostatistics,
Epidemiology, and Health Systems & Population Health in the School of Public Health. Areas of focus are in
basic and translational sciences include molecular and genetic approaches to health and disease; craniofacial
structure, function and development; and stem cell biology/tissue regeneration/engineering. Our objectives are
to: 1) provide rigorous, discipline-based training in basic/translational or public health/behavioral/clinical oral
health research (achieved through departmental graduate programs and mentored research); and, 2) provide
experiences that develop trainees' skills for participating as strong contributing members of multi- and
interdisciplinary research teams (achieved through core seminars and research presentations, as well as
individualized career development opportunities, based on the trainee's Individual Development Plan). Pre-

Over 130 million Americans suffer from the devastating consequences of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or prediabetes. Skeletal muscle accounts for up to 85% of insulin-induced blood glucose clearance, and insulin resistance for muscle glucose uptake is an essential, and perhaps primary defect for T2D. One exercise bout can enhance subsequent insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (ISGU) by muscle, but the mechanisms have remained elusive. The long-range goal is to fully understand the molecular, cellular, and physiological events responsible for this significant health benefit. Recent research using a unique Akt substrate of 160 kDa-knockout (AS160-KO) rat model revealed that expression of AS160 (a key regulator of GLUT4 glucose transporter localization) is essential for the elevated postexercise ISGU. Specific Aim 1 will identify specific Rab proteins that collaborate with AS160 to regulate postexercise insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Research using L6 myocytes identified the key Rab proteins that regulate insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, but the specific Rab proteins required for AS160-dependent regulation of ISGU in authentic skeletal muscle are unknown. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-approach will be used to identify the roles of these Rab proteins on ISGU in muscles from sedentary and exercised rats. Specific Aim 2 will elucidate AS160’s regulation of subcellular GLUT4 localization in muscle postexercise. Knowledge of AS160’s role in GLUT4 distribution is limited to insulin’s ability to elevate GLUT4 exocytosis to cell surface membranes in unexercised muscle. A powerful new microscopy-based approach (STERM, Sample Thinning Enhanced Resolution Microscopy) will examine GLUT4 distribution in 7 different myocellular compartments. Coupling STERM with the AS160-KO model will be used to test if AS160 is crucial for postexercise regulation of GLUT4 distribution in both cell surface and intracellular membrane compartments. We will also determine insulin and exercise effects on AS160’s distribution in intracellular compartments. Specific Aim 3 will elucidate estrogen receptor dependent mechanisms contributing to greater postexercise insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Although AS160 expression is essential for elevated postexercise ISGU in both sexes, AS160 phosphorylation of key sites is required only in male rats. Estrogen receptor (ER) mediated processes are major regulators of muscle ISGU under resting conditions, but the ER’s role for enhanced PEX-ISGU is unknown. We will use an AAV-approach to alter skeletal muscle expression of ER and probe pAS160’s sexually dimorphic role on PEX-ISGU. We will then identify ER-linked differences in skeletal muscle protein expression. We will also determine the extent to which ER-linked effects on muscle expression of specific proteins are required for mechanisms underlying increased PEX-ISGU. This research will significantly advance fundamental knowledge and address a critical barrier to progress in the field by elucidating specific mechanisms for greater postexercise ISGU, a major health benefit."

Gastrointestinal diseases caused by enteric viral pathogens such as norovirus and rotavirus impose a
significant global health burden and can be lethal in vulnerable populations. For these and other viral
pathogens, interferon (IFN) family cytokines are among the most potent elements of the antiviral immune
response. Thus, IFN pathways are clinically relevant targets for treatment of disease, and are an important
area for continued foundational research. We and others have shown that the most recently discovered type of
IFN (type III IFN, IFN-λ) promotes innate antiviral immunity in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) while minimizing
inflammatory damage that can accompany a type I IFN response. Our most recent work has now identified a
homeostatic IFN-λ response, stimulated by bacterial microbiota, that elicits antiviral genes within pockets of
intestinal epithelium prior to viral exposure. Our studies of mouse rotavirus infection suggest that homeostatic
IFN-λ preemptively limits viral infection of IECs. The objective of this research proposal is to define the cellular
source of homeostatic IFN-λ production in the intestine (aim 1), the mechanistic basis for its expression (aim
2), and its impact on enteric viral disease (aim 3). Based on our prior work and preliminary studies, our central
hypothesis is that intestinal dendritic cells produce homeostatic IFN-λ during transient exposure to bacterial
products, promoting preemptive antiviral responses in epithelial cells. Through the studies of this research
project, we will identify the basis of the localized homeostatic IFN-λ response in IECs, thereby advancing our
fundamental understanding of this IFN type in the antiviral immunity to enteric viral pathogens."

This proposal seeks to investigate the predictive ability of psychological and epigenetic markers for success of
lifestyle interventions in patients with obesity. Obesity is a growing public health crisis, and in the coming
decades it is expected that 50% of Americans will have obesity. Current treatment practice typically begins with
lifestyle interventions, followed by the addition of pharmacologic or surgical treatment if lifestyle interventions
fail. However, many individuals fail lifestyle interventions, their obesity continues to progress, and they
develop additional obesity-related comorbidities such as Type II Diabetes. While patients may be placed on
anti-obesity medications following the failure of lifestyle interventions, studies have demonstrated that
increased duration of obesity increases the risks of obesity-related morbidity.
Both behavioral and biological factors contribute to the development, maintenance, and progression of obesity
and obesity-related diseases. Stress has been found to increase the risk of obesity, and psychological resilience
factors such as self-control affect feeding behavior as well as biological markers such as insulin resistance.
Research has also suggested epigenetic modifications as a potential biological mechanism through which
environmental factors may affect obesity and may contribute to comorbidities such as Type II Diabetes.
Methylation of specific CpG sites has been associated with obesity and there are indications specific
methylation patterns may be predictive of worsening obesity and/or the development of insulin resistance. The
objective of this proposal is to utilize psychological and epigenetic data to predict obesity, insulin resistance,
and HgbA1C in response to lifestyle interventions. Findings from this study may be directly applicable to
clinical practice. By identifying patients with psychological (Aim #1) or epigenetic (Aim #2) factors at baseline
that predict likely failure of lifestyle interventions, these patients could be directed toward pharmacologic or
other treatment more likely to help. Specific epigenetic changes following lifestyle interventions (Aim #3) could
also predict long-term success or failure and may guide whether escalation of treatment is needed. Ultimately,
we hope this study will lead to development of a multi-modal predictor of treatment outcomes (Exploratory
Aim) which can provide individualized, prospective guidance of treatment decisions.
This proposal will integrate state-of-the-art facilities at Yale with a highly interdisciplinary team and an
established, well-funded ongoing study. The applicant has assembled a team of expert mentors in clinical trials
treating obesity, the neurobiology of obesity, stress and resilience, epigenetics, and advanced computational
methods. Formal didactics, scientific workshops, and national meetings will support the applicant’s training
and help leverage his robust clinical foundation with fellowship training in psychiatric care for the medically ill.
The vital support from this K23 award will allow for the applicant’s development into a leading independent
researcher applying psychiatric and computational methods to improving outcomes in patients with obesity."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends initiating human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccination at ages 11-12 to confer protection against anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers, though it can be
started as young as age 9. Two doses by age 13 is considered “up-to-date” (UTD), i.e. protected before the
onset of sexual activity. Nationally, UTD coverage was only 62% in 2021. In North Carolina (NC), a largely
rural state, UTD HPV vaccination coverage is only 47% in rural adolescents. Novel approaches are
needed to alleviate barriers to HPV vaccination coverage in rural areas, where adolescents may have less
access to health care or a pediatrician who routinely recommends HPV vaccination. Recommending HPV
vaccination at age 9 could increase UTD coverage in rural adolescents by allowing earlier completion of the
series and more time to achieve UTD coverage, promoting maximal and timely HPV prevention. Achieving
parity in rural HPV vaccination rates can greatly reduce urban-rural cancer disparities, including
cervical cancer. The goals of the proposed K01 project are to 1) define optimal systems for recommending
HPV vaccination at age 9 years in rural NC clinics; 2) assess acceptability and appropriateness of age-9
vaccination among rural caregivers; and 3) conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation study of age-9 HPV
vaccination in rural clinics. Specific Aim 1 will collaborate with health care personnel in rural clinics to
measure appropriateness and acceptability of age-9 HPV vaccination, identify opportunities for clinic-based
interventions to promote it, and incorporate these insights into a preliminary intervention plan. In Specific Aim
2, we will gauge rural caregivers’ acceptability of age-9 HPV vaccination for their children, and modify the
intervention plan as needed to maximize acceptability. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will pilot the intervention in four
rural clinics, using electronic medical records to measure UTD HPV vaccination coverage in a cohort of 9-
year-old patients over two years. My technical skills in study design and data analysis will be
complemented by extensive training in clinical research and implementation science to successfully
complete this project, relying on mentorship from experts in pediatric and adolescent health care,
implementation science, rural health, development and evaluation of clinical interventions, and research with
health care personnel. By establishing collaborative relationships with clinic research networks, understanding
the key factors associated with rural health disparities, and becoming adept at developing, implementing, and
measuring evidence-based interventions, my research career promises to increase vaccination behaviors in
areas that are most vulnerable to infections and their consequences. In addition, I will become a well-rounded
and nimble vaccine researcher, studying myriad health areas that could benefit from the introduction of novel
vaccines or improved delivery of existing vaccines. This training will prepare me to lead R01-funded studies,
including large scale clinical trials to reduce health care disparities in underserved areas."
10887339,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Over 43M Americans (~13% of the population) will suffer from social anxiety disorder in their lifetime
(Kessler et al., 2012) – 20M of which will have fear of public speaking (Kessler et al., 1998). Cognitive-behavioral
therapy (a major component of which is exposure therapy) is a leading treatment for social anxiety disorder but
is only fully effective in ~45% of individuals (Loerinc, et al., 2015). Exposure therapy is the clinical proxy of
Pavlovian extinction in which the individual approaches their feared situation (e.g., social situation) without the
expected aversive outcome (e.g., negative social judgment). Several basic research findings show that stronger
reward processing is linked to better extinction of fear, suggesting that enhancing reward processing can improve
exposure therapy. First, reward processing is involved in extinction learning at the time of omission of an
expected aversive outcome, such that the omission is experienced as “relief-pleasantness” as measured by self-
report and by neural mechanisms of reward processing (e.g., Lange, et al., 2020). Second, direct stimulation of
the reward circuitry has been shown to enhance extinction of fear (Sierra, et al., 2023). Third, low self-reported
reward processing is associated with low relief-pleasantness (Leng, et al., 2022). Fourth, social anxiety disorder
is associated with poor reward processing (Cremers, et al., 2015). Lastly, anhedonia – a robust correlate of poor
reward processing and social anxiety – is associated with poor extinction of fear (Young, et al., 2021). Thus,
enhancing reward processing may be especially likely to improve exposure therapy outcomes in social anxiety
disorder (Aim 1) by increasing relief-pleasantness when an expected aversive event does not occur (Aim 2). In
this K23, we will conduct the first experimental therapeutics study investigating the effects of target engagement
(reward processing) on subsequent exposure therapy outcome (social anxiety; specifically, fear of public
speaking). To this end, socially anxious participants with a fear of public speaking and low reward processing
will undergo the behavioral portion of Positive Affect Treatment (PAT-B) or Relaxation Treatment; both
treatments are expected to decrease negative affect, but PAT-B is expected to improve reward processing more
than Relaxation Treatment (Craske et al., 2023). Subsequently, all participants will undergo Exposure Therapy
for fear of public speaking with the primary outcome being multi-modal assessment of public speaking anxiety.
For experimental therapeutics, the target is reward processing, which we will measure primarily as relief-
pleasantness in fMRI fear conditioning during extinction at the time of electric shock omission (measured neurally
and with computational modeling of self-report relief-pleasantness). The training plan will help the Candidate
gain expertise in experimental therapeutics, fMRI, and computational modeling in the service of his career goal:
to improve our understanding and treatment of anxiety disorders. This K23 may improve the efficacy of exposure
therapy, our understanding of its mechanisms, and help millions of people with social anxiety disorder."

African-American/Black, Indigenous, and Hispanic are among the fastest growing populations in the US but
make up only a small percentage of the biomedical research workforce. This disconnect is particularly acute in
science and engineering graduate programs where students from underrepresented (UR) groups accounted for
just 13.5% of doctoral degrees awarded in 2018. Furthermore, significantly more students from UR groups
complete a master’s degree (MS) en route to their doctorate than their non-UR counterparts, identifying MS
programs as an important pool from which to recruit PhD candidates from diverse backgrounds. Consistent with
these national trends, self-assessments at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM) revealed that just 13% and 17% of doctoral degrees awarded
over the past five years were to students from UR groups. In just five years, the Bridges to the Doctorate Program
(B2D) program has had a significant impact on the diversity of the MS program in Biological Sciences at Towson
University (TU), increasing the representation of students from UR groups from 11% in 2015 to 42% in 2020,
mirroring the local demographics (45.3%). 100% of our B2D trainees have graduated with an MS degree. Of
the trainees who have graduated, 67% have applied to PhD programs and 83% of those who applied,
were offered admission to top doctoral programs including those at UMSOM and JHUSOM. These data
highlight the need for programs like B2D that support students from UR groups as they prepare to apply to
doctoral programs and succeed in transitioning from MS to PhD programs to complete their doctorate. The TU-
UMSOM-JHUSOM B2D will integrate the TU MS program and research resources at the UMSOM and JHUSOM
in an innovative curriculum of training and mentoring to meet the following four objectives. 1: To provide
trainees with a strong knowledge base in cell and molecular biology, develop analytical thinking, and
cultivate science self-efficacy. 2: To train students to independently design and conduct experiments with rigor
and to effectively analyze results. 3: To provide trainees with the tools needed to successfully apply to doctoral
programs and ultimately earn a PhD. 4: To foster an inclusive, supportive community that promotes student
success by providing opportunities for career exploration and peer/professional mentoring. The proximity of TU,
UMSOM, and JHUSOM campuses facilitate the collaborative implementation of joint training activities. B2D
scholars will be actively recruited from local and national minority-focused training programs and undergraduate
institutions through e-marketing, social media, and in-person approaches. The professional development of B2D
trainees as they progress from MS to PhD programs and beyond will be tracked as an important metric of
program success. All aspects of the B2D will be critically evaluated by systematic program assessment. B2D
training will thus enhance diversity in the biomedical workforce."
10889081,"Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (chemobrain; CICI) is a common neurotoxicity affecting >50%
of patients8 treated with widely used chemotherapeutics, including taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel)9-11 and platinum-
based agents (e.g., cisplatin).8,9,12 There are no FDA-approved interventions. Mitochondrial dysfunction and
neuroinflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) are mechanisms thought to drive CICI, but how these
are triggered remains elusive.6,13-15 Our preliminary studies implicate CNS alterations of sphingolipid metabolism
and increased sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) formation, offering a novel target for therapeutic intervention with
S1P1 receptor subtype (S1PR1) antagonists.
 In preliminary studies of cisplatin-induced cognitive impairment, S1P increased in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
and hippocampus (key centers of cognition) where S1PR1 was expressed. This was associated with
mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) nitration and inactivation and activation of the NOD-, LRR- and
pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. MnSOD tightly regulates peroxynitrite (PN)-mediated
nitroxidative stress,16,17 but is also inactivated >80% when nitrated by PN.18-20 This PN-mediated process has
been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction in many disease states.17-19,21-23 NLRP3 is critical for interleukin-1β
(IL1β) and IL18 maturation,24-26 powerful inflammatory cytokines in cognitive impairment.27-31 Systemic
administration of the orally bioavailable, CNS penetrant S1PR1 functional antagonist FTY72032 blocked MnSOD
nitration/inactivation, NLRP3 activation and attenuated CICI without adversly affecting locomotor activity
(preliminary data). These findings are very exciting, since FTY720 (fingolimod) is FDA-approved for multiple
sclerosis with good safety profiles.33-36 How chemotherapy triggers S1P/S1PR1 signaling is not known, but
preliminary data suggest glial cell toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) as a likely link.
We hypothesize that chemotherapy engages TLR4 to drive S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the CNS that contributes
to CICI through PN-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and NLRP3-mediated neuroinflammation (Fig. 1). We
will test this hypothesis in naïve and tumor-bearing male and female mice. In Aim 1, we will investigate
S1P/S1PR1 signaling in the CNS, temporal and cellular distribution of S1PR1 and test whether S1PR1
antagonists prevent and reverse CICI without interfering with antitumor effects. In Aim 2, we will use
pharmacological and genetic approaches to define the role of TLR4 in sphingolipid metabolism and S1P
formation during CICI and test the impact of S1PR1 inhibition on mitochondrial dysfunction and NLRP3-driven
neuroinflammation. S1PR1 antagonists are not expected to interfere with chemotherapy efficacy; we and others
have shown that these drugs block tumor cell growth, inflammation and metastasis.37-43 Our studies are
anticipated to provide paradigm-shifting insights that establish S1PR1 in CICI and expedite translational
investigation of medicines that are already FDA approved (fingolimod/ozanimod) as adjunct to chemotherapy."
10889082,"Project Summary
 Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype representing 15-20% of newly
diagnosed breast cancer cases. Due to a lack of known molecular targets, treatment options for TNBC are
limited, and 30-50% of patients acquire resistance to standard care. I aim to better understand the metabolic
dependencies of TNBC cells to reveal novel targets that could be exploited therapeutically. TNBC cells tend to
exist in a mesenchymal-like state, having undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during which
cells acquire a more motile and invasive phenotype. Because EMT is associated with poor breast cancer
prognosis, understanding the molecular drivers and adaptations during this process will identify targetable
dependencies of metastatic cancer cells. microRNA-200c (miR-200c) is well-established as a suppressor of
EMT that tends to be lost in TNBC. Using miR-200c as a tool to push TNBC cells into a more epithelial-like
phenotype, I have identified novel changes to cholesterol metabolism occurring during EMT. This project
delineates how EMT regulates cholesterol metabolism and the functional consequences of these changes.
 In the F99 portion of this grant, I establish how reversal of EMT by miR-200c alters cholesterol
metabolism proteins including the low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) and Niemann-Pick-Type-C1
(NPC1). LDLR is responsible for endocytosing LDL particles, which are the primary source of cholesterol for
breast tumor cells. After fusion of endocytic vesicles with the lysosome, NPC1 is specifically required for the
processing and transport of cholesterol from lysosomes to other cellular components. These changes suggest
an altered demand for cholesterol mesenchymal-like versus epithelial-like TNBC, the consequences of which
are evaluated in Aim 1B of this project. My preliminary data also demonstrates that NPC1 activity is critical to
survival of TNBC cells in vitro. In Aim 1B, I outline experiments to understand overall cholesterol uptake and
intracellular cholesterol levels during EMT and delineate the critical role of NPC1 on TNBC cell viability. This
work is the first to establish altered dependency and expression of LDLR and NPC1 in EMT and breast cancer
progression.
 In the K00 phase of the proposed project, I will expand on my interest in the metabolic requirements of
the metastatic cascade. I will move into investigating how extracellular mechanical cues driven by the
extracellular matrix (ECM) drive metabolic adaptations to promote invasion and migration during metastasis.
Further, I will evaluate whether the EMT phenotype of cells influences these adaptations. Gaining a better
understanding of how cancer cell metabolism supports changing ECM and how mechanical demands
encountered during metastasis will provide insights into development of therapeutic targets within tumor
metabolism."

officers and our Scientific Advisory Board, we are planning to combine the methodology and infrastructure of
the ARTFL and LEFFTDS programs into one, expand to include collecting neuropathological data and
specimens, and address ongoing and new goals. This combination of efforts in one cohesive program entitled,
“ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD),” will better address the
evolving need for FTLD research while retaining the many positive aspects of the original programs. The
ALLFTD Administrative Core will integrate the input from NIH staff, the Scientific Advisory Board, Patient
Advocacy Groups and Industry Partners with the six other cores and two projects to carry out the project goals,
which includes providing an administrative structure to manage personnel and budgetary issues, communicate
with NIA/NINDS, and oversee participant safety and compliance with NIH and other federal research
standards. Additionally, the ALLFTD Administrative Core will promote academic FTLD research within and
outside of the ALLFTD consortium by ensuring the collection and availability of high quality data. The ALLFTD
Administrative Core will strive to ensure that all data, samples, and imaging scans are contributed to the
national repositories such as the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC), National Centralized
Repository for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (NCRAD), and Laboratory of NeuroImaging
(LONI). A partnership with the NIA/NINDS Program Officers and Patient Advocacy Group partners will assist
the ALLFTD Administrative Core in many of its tasks, as well as provide guidance via regular web conferences
and yearly meetings. The Patient Advocacy Group partners will also assist the ALLFTD Administrative core by
providing education, outreach, and assistance with study recruitment. Lastly the ALLFTD Administrative Core
will work closely with industry partners to create an ALLFTD-Treatment Unit. This treatment unit will have an
administrative structure based on a set of internationally harmonized clinical trial principles and will promote
pre-competitive collaborations, clinical trials, and data sharing with industry and research partnerships."

The ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) protocol represents an
expanded and integrated international research consortium involving seven cores and two projects; ALLFTD is
designed to substantially and comprehensively increase the amount of longitudinal data, numbers of
biospecimen samples and MRI scans that are publicly available for research in FTLD, to ultimately foster
development of disease-modifying therapies. Previously, the Advancement of Research and Treatment in
Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ARTFL; U54 NS092089) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Familial
Frontotemporal Dementia Subjects (LEFFTDS; U01 AG045390) protocols collectively enrolled >1100
participants at 18 sites, including >380 members of families affected by MAPT, GRN and C9orf72 mutations
(surpassing the original LEFFTDS target of 300), with the remaining participants being sporadic FTLD patients
enrolled through ARTFL. Detailed clinical and neuropsychological data, including (but not limited to) the
National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set Version 3 and FTLD Module has been
completed, with almost 1200 data packets uploaded to NACC to date. Biofluid samples, including DNA, PBMC,
mRNA, plasma and serum on the vast majority of participants, and CSF on a subset, have been collected
during the ARTFL/LEFFTDS studies, transferred and processed at the National Centralized Repository for
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias. Over 900 MRI scans using a standardized protocol have been
performed in 585 participants, and these data have undergone quality control inspection and transferal to the
Laboratory of NeuroImaging. All data, samples and scans are available and have been used by investigators
within and outside of the ARTFL/LEFFTDS Consortium. The ALLFTD Clinical Core will continue to build on the
obvious success of the ARTFL and LEFFTDS protocols by recruiting additional participants in either the
longitudinal or biofluid-focused arm. The Clinical Core will enroll and evaluate up to 1100 participants annually
in the longitudinal arm, and will include 500 asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic members of kindreds with
familial FTLD and 600 mildly symptomatic sporadic FTLD patients. Approximately 1000 additional FTLD
patients will be recruited into the biofluid focused arm. In partnership with the FTD Disorders Registry,
participants in both arms will be followed remotely, requested to complete questionnaires and provided with
periodic updates and information of FTLD research opportunities. The sites in the Clinical Core will provide
high quality clinical data, biofluid samples and MRI scans to be integrated for use in all cores and projects, and
shared with the scientific community."

10889903,"ABSTRACT – ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal FTLD: GENETICS CORE
The overarching goal of the Genetics Core is the accurate and timely generation, annotation,
interpretation and sharing of state-of-the art genetic data on all frontotemporal lobar degeneration
(FTLD) patients and blood relatives enrolled in ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal FTLD (ALLFTD) to
support FTLD research within and outside of the ALLFTD Program. Genetic characterization of this
unique cohort is critically important to test hypotheses and interpret research findings obtained in the other
ALLFTD Cores and Projects and will be invaluable to future FTLD gene discovery efforts within the larger
research community. The work proposed in this Core is highly complementary and non-overlapping with
currently ongoing NIH-funded FTLD sequencing efforts, which will be leveraged to enhance the genetic
characterization of our participant cohorts. More than 1,100 unique individuals have been enrolled in ARTFL
and LEFFTDS since their inception in 2014 and an additional 1,600 unique individuals are expected to be
enrolled as part of the ALLFTD protocol. Consequently, DNA of at least 2,700 individuals will be available for
genetic studies, making this an unprecedented resource. Most notably, on all 2,700 subjects, the Genetics
Core will: generate genome-wide single nucleotide variant (SNP) data; perform targeted mutation screening of
~300 neurodegenerative disease genes; determine presence or absence of causal mutations in known disease
genes; and integrate genetic data in the form of polygenic risk scores (PGRS) for downstream analyses in the
Projects. These important goals are achieved through the following Specific Aims: 1) Perform genetic
analyses to determine ethnicity and relatedness between ALLFTD participants. Genotyping using the
Infinium Omni2.5Exome-8 Kit will be performed in all newly ascertained ALLFTD participants (n=1,600) and
combined with previously obtained genotype data (n=1,100) to determine the ethnicity and relatedness
between ALLFTD participants, to call copy-number variants (CNVs) and to calculate PGRS; 2) Perform
targeted mutation analysis in ALLFTD participants. We will follow an efficient, step-wise, approach to
genetically characterize ALLFTD participants, including C9orf72 and ATXN2 repeat expansion testing, targeted
gene sequencing of ~300 neurodegenerative disease genes with sequence validation and manual curation of
observed variants using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines, and whole-genome
sequencing and analysis of newly ascertained genetically unexplained familial FTLD patients; and 3) Generate
PGRS for ALLFTD participants. Distinct datasets from published genome-wide association studies will be
used to generate PGRS in study participants for use in the Projects, including PGRS for individual
neurodegenerative diseases and PGRS that reflect related pathologies such as immunological disorders. As
our sample size increases we will further derive PGRS from genomic data generated as part of ALLFTD,
especially for FTLD clinical subtypes."
10889904,"ABSTRACT – ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal FTLD: NEUROIMAGING CORE
Brain imaging has taken on critical roles in dementia research, including its use for diagnosis and staging of
multiple neurodegenerative disorders and enrichment of study groups for clinical trials. In the earliest stages of
neurodegenerative disease, when symptoms have not yet developed, imaging and other biomarkers may be
the only disease indicators that can be used to quantify drug effects in clinical trials, and imaging may
ultimately guide use of approved treatments. The goal of this project is to create a neuroimaging core for the
ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal FTD (ALLFTD) project. The core will ensure optimal quality and efficient,
innovative use of brain images collected for the project by designing and ensuring faithful application of a
standardized acquisition protocol across the 19 clinical sites and promoting the application of advanced
imaging technology in the FTLD field. We will design acquisition protocols that optimally utilize the scanner
capabilities for the advanced sequences at each study site and allow harmonization of images across the
study. All scans, along with the quality control information, will be made available to the public through the
Laboratory of Neuroimaging (LONI). We will provide innovative technology and resources for understanding
the contribution of MAPT, GRN or C9orf72 genes to neurodegeneration in FTLD and reliable estimates of
changes in cortical volume in asymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers as well as patients with
sporadic FTLD, in preparation for future clinical trials. We will provide resources for establishing the
topographic distribution of brain structural changes across the FTLD spectrum, and work with LONI to maintain
an archive of images and establish appropriate processes to ensure ethical and efficient access to the data.
The Neuroimaging Core will pursue the following aims: 1) Establish and maintain a harmonized MRI
acquisition protocol for acquisition and quality control of T1, FLAIR, T2, diffusion, ASL-perfusion, and task free
functional MRI across 19 participating sites and supply MRI scans for research projects and the research
community, while protecting patient confidentiality. 2) Operate a standardized quality control, image processing
and data analysis program. 3) Supply processed cross-sectional and longitudinal data including regional
cortical volume measurements and longitudinal change in cortical volume on serial MRIs for ALLFTD Projects
1 and 2, and also share these data with the research community. 4) Consult with ALLFTD and outside
researchers and share research tools to facilitate use of imaging data for analysis. The leaders of this
proposed neuroimaging core have extensive experience with image analysis and leadership of multicenter
imaging efforts, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), which set the standard for
multisite imaging studies in dementia. This will help to ensure smooth conduct of the imaging activities for
ALLFTD."
10889908,"ABSTRACT – ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal FTLD: Project 1
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is the overall term for a group of devastating neurodegenerative
disorders that have a profound effect on the lives of patients and their families. Research in FTLD is entering
an exciting period as potential disease-modifying drugs are being developed. One highly attractive approach
for therapy is to start treatment before symptoms occur. However, FTLD is currently almost always diagnosed
long after symptoms have begun, when the disease has already had profound effects on the brain. About
twenty percent of FTLD is due to autosomal dominant mutations, most commonly in the MAPT, GRN, or
C9orf72 genes (familial, or f-FTLD). Mutation carriers can be identified before the onset of dementia, and are
therefore critical for studies that would seek to delay or prevent symptoms. Intervention studies in f-FTLD will
require unique approaches for tracking the effects of treatment. First, they must choose measures that
demonstrate that an intervention is resulting in clinical benefit, even in people who are experiencing few if any
symptoms. Second, they must show that the treatment prevents or delays the onset of symptoms. However,
the age when a mutation carrier will develop dementia varies dramatically in f-FTLD, and there are no reliable
markers for predicting age of onset. Without such predictive tools, it is impossible to target patients who are
approaching symptom onset and calculate how many people would be needed for a study of symptom
prevention. The overall goal of this project is to prepare for clinical trials in f-FTLD by developing better
methods for selecting participants and for tracking disease burden to demonstrate treatment effects. The
project will pursue the following specific aims: 1) To identify the best clinical and imaging measures for tracking
disease burden in mutation carriers who are asymptomatic (FTLD-CDR=0), or mildly symptomatic (FTLD-
CDR=0.5), 2) To develop a multimodal risk score to predict worsening symptoms in asymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic mutation carriers using baseline clinical, genetic, protein biomarker and imaging data, and 3) To
quantify the value of tracking change in cortical volume over one year for predicting future worsening of
symptoms in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic mutation carriers."
10889909,"ABSTRACT – ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal FTLD: Project 2
Improvements in understanding the biology of FTLD, combined with revolutionary advancements in drug
development, have created new compounds that can alter the fundamental biological mechanisms that cause
FTLD. FTLD is most commonly associated with either underlying tau (FTLD-tau) or TAR DNA binding protein
43 (FTLD-TDP) brain neuropathology and many new treatments that are now entering clinical trials target one
or the other of these molecular pathologies. This creates a major challenge for designing clinical trials: how to
measure the effects of these new molecularly-targeted therapies in clinically heterogeneous, symptomatic
FTLD populations. The first goal of this project is to develop new clinical tools and surrogate endpoints that can
measure disease progression in heterogeneous FTLD clinical populations. The second goal is to develop
methods to stratify patients at the time of clinical trial enrollment to define populations with more predictable
rates of change or responses to specific therapeutic strategies. We will develop optimized clinical, imaging
and biomarker endpoints for symptomatic FTLD clinical trials that could include multiple clinical and genetic
variants with a single molecular pathology (referred to as a basket trial design) or could be deployed in patients
with a common phenotype (standard parallel design) to improve power to detect treatment effects. Longitudinal
clinical, imaging and fluid biomarker data will be collected in a multicenter clinical trial-ready population
representing the full clinical spectrum of FTLD, including both sporadic FTLD (n=600) and symptomatic f-FTLD
(n=167) from the ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (ALLFTD) consortium,
which constitutes the core group of centers that will support recruitment for FTLD clinical trials in North
America. We will also examine the impact of developing personalized outcomes in a trial by using each
patient's baseline characteristics to predict which measures will decline over time, with a particular emphasis
on maximizing what is most clinically meaningful to that patient. The specific aims are to: (1) identify the best
clinical and MRI-based endpoints to measure efficacy in “basket design” clinical trials that enroll patients
according to predicted underlying protein pathology, (2) develop trial enrichment strategies that combine
multiple baseline characteristics to predict clinical change in FTLD, and (3) investigate inflammation as a
potential late stage therapeutic target in symptomatic FTLD."
10889925,"Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is an understudied clinical neurodegenerative condition. Nevertheless, this
is the most common dementia after Alzheimer disease (AD) in people younger than 65. The most common
pathology associated with dementia in FTD is frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) due to transactive
DNA binding protein of ~43 kD (TDP-43), known as FTLD-TDP. FTLD-TDP pathology is also found in ALS and
many other conditions associated with aging including Limbic-predominant Age-related TDP-43
Encephalopathy (LATE). Since our discovery of FTLD-TDP in human disease, major gaps in understanding the
pathophysiology and spread of human FTLD-TDP pathology and poor antemortem identification of patients
with dementia due to TDP-43 pathology have been immense impediments to developing disease-modifying
treatments that aim to target this pathology. In this Program Project Grant (PPG), we propose a novel and
unique multidisciplinary research program focused on elucidating pathophysiologic mechanisms of human
TDP-43 pathology, identifying FTLD-TDP in vivo in dementia and aging, and understanding the clinical
consequences of FTLD-TDP pathology. With greater insight into mechanisms of disease associated with TDP-
43 pathology, translational work will fill major gaps in in vivo diagnosis and prognosis. Administrative Core A is
designed to provide administrative support including regulatory and financial management for the scientific
work proposed by the five Projects and four Cores of this PPG, coordinate the interaction of these
multidisciplinary Projects and Cores through an Internal Executive Committee (IEC) consisting of the Project
Leaders (PLs) and Core Leaders (CLs), ensure that annual goals are maintained with guidance from an
External Advisory Committee (EAC) of experts together with NIA staff, disseminate and coordinate our work
with other scientists at and beyond University of Pennsylvania (Penn), engage young scientists in research
investigating TDP-43, and disseminate knowledge to patients and families who have FTLD-TDP-related
disorders. We achieve these goals through seven Specific Aims."
10889927,"Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is an understudied clinical neurodegenerative condition even though it is
the most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in people <65 years old. The most
common frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology associated with FTD is TDP-43 proteinopathy
known as FTLD-TDP. Although rare mutation carriers can be identified who have FTLD-TDP pathology during
life, there are no known biomarkers for the vast majority of FTD patients with sporadic disease that can reliably
distinguish patients with FTLD-TDP histopathology from those with FTLD-Tau pathology, nor from patients who
present with clinical FTD but are atypical variants of pathological AD. This has resulted in major gaps in
knowledge that severely limit our understanding of TDP-43-associated pathophysiology, significantly constrain
the development of disease-modifying treatment trials, and severely impede designing clinical end-points to
follow for prognosis and for treatment trials. It is thus necessary to collect data that help define the specific
pathologic form of FTLD during life more accurately, and relate these data to imaging, biofluid biomarker,
genetic and autopsy data studied in this PPG. Moreover, disease-modifying treatment trials require well-
characterized natural histories of phenotypes related to FTLD-TDP in order to identify clinical markers
indicating a beneficial treatment response. The Clinical Core will work with other cores and projects to improve
our understanding of the TDP-related degeneration of multilevel neural networks examined in this Program
Project Grant (PPG). To these ends, we will recruit patients with sporadic clinical FTD who have a high
likelihood of having FTLD-TDP pathology such as semantic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA),
behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) co-occurring with svPPA, PPA and bvFTD with co-occurring amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS). We will also recruit symptomatic carriers of mutations associated with FTLD such as
PGRN and C9orf72. We will assess these cases annually with a brief but comprehensive neuropsychological
battery, recruit cases for imaging and biofluid studies, and recruit cases for autopsy. We propose four Specific
Aims to achieve these goals."
10889931,"Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is a progressive disorder characterized by pathology and
neurodegeneration in a predominantly frontal and temporal anatomic distribution. However, there is extensive
heterogeneity of disease distribution across individuals with FTD, including several clinical phenotypes, several
underlying pathological sources of disease, and distinct sources of genetic contributions. Multimodal
neuroimaging, including structural MRI (sMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI), provides an important tool to
characterize the heterogeneous and distributed loci of FTD in individuals in order to objectively improve the
diagnostic discrimination between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP, relate these pathologies to phenotypes, and
inform the biological mechanisms of these complex network disorders. Functional perfusion MRI (pMRI) and
resting state BOLD fMRI (rsfMRI) approaches enhance sMRI and dMRI by providing additional unique insights
into the origin, rate, and pattern of early disease and longitudinal progression. 7T MRI provides a unique
opportunity to better understand the microstructural mechanisms that distinguish FTLD-TDP from FTLD-Tau.
Thus, the overall goal of Imaging Core C is to provide the necessary infrastructure to support state-of-the-art
3T and 7T MRI acquisition and network analyses of neuroimaging data in Projects I-V of this research
program. This Core will also be closely integrated with Cores B-E to facilitate our interdisciplinary and
convergent in vivo and ex vivo approach to improving our understanding of FTD as a network disorder. In
particular, we will generate graph “nodes” reflecting MRI-derived structural properties of FTD brains and graph
“edges” reflecting structural and/or functional connectivity to facilitate the network neuroscience approach of
each individual project. To accomplish this goal we propose 3 Specific Aims: (1) Collect state-of-the-art in vivo
3T MRI multimodal neuroimaging data in FTD patients including sMRI, dMRI, pMRI, and rsfMRI; (2) Provide a
cross-sectional and longitudinal image processing pipeline for standard operating procedure (SOP)

The National Capital Area (NCA) Minority/Underserved NCORP will be based at Georgetown Lombardi
Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC), comprising Medstar Georgetown University Hospital (MGUH) and
MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) as the primary affiliate, with a catchment area comprising 48.3%
non-Latino Blacks (NLB) and 10.6% Hispanics/Latinos (H/L) that includes Washington, D.C. and adjacent
counties in Maryland and Virginia. MWHC serves predominantly, i.e., > 85% minority and underserved
populations; and treats more than 2,000 predominantly minority cancer patients and 48,000 outpatients,
annually. The cancer burden and disparities are greatest among NLB population in the catchment area as
evident by some of the highest mortality rates in the nation for breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. Among
the H/L population, cancer is the leading cause of death with H/L patients typically presenting at a later stage
compared to Non-Latino White (NLW) patients. High rates of preventable cancer risk factors such as obesity,
physical inactivity, and smoking, coupled with much lower screening rates for certain cancers, such as colorectal
and cervical cancers in minorities contribute to the cancer disparities seen in the catchment area. The NCA
NCORP proposes to address one of the most significant factors associated with these cancer disparities - limited
access to optimal and cutting edge prevention, cancer control, and cancer care delivery by increasing awareness
and providing access to cancer clinical trials among NLB and H/L in the catchment area. LCCC’s Office of
Minority Health and Health Disparities Research (OMH), represents the community outreach arm that is led by
Dr. Adams-Campbell, that has established viable academic-community partnerships that enable the NCA
NCORP to conduct clinical research in areas of prevention, control, screening, health disparities, and cancer
care delivery among the minority populations of interest. In light of an aging population and the increasing number
of cancer survivors, this NCORP has the expertise and leadership as evident by demonstrable research in these
areas that address cancer control and patient centered cancer care delivery. Furthermore, the ability to address
cancer prevention and control among adolescents and young adults (AYA) is also a key strength of our team.
The NCA NCORP will address the needs of our catchment area via cancer prevention, control, screening as well
as treatment and imaging studies. The specific aims of the proposed National Capital Area NCORP are to: (1)
Design and participate in clinical trials in cancer clinical research that improves the quality of care and the health
outcomes of the US population in our catchment area; (2) Increase the participation of the greater DC area’s
community oncologists and medical specialists and their patients in NCORP-led clinical research; and (3)
Expand health disparities research focused on clinical research participation via community outreach,
engagement, and education."
10891485,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is a major vision-impairment problem that emerges after cataract
surgery and Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy is required to restore vision. During PCO, the lens epithelial
cells (LECs) that remain tethered to the anterior capsule after cataract surgery proliferate, migrate to the
posterior capsule where they undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and secrete extracellular
matrix, leading to fibrous tissue formation along with wrinkling of the posterior capsule. Transforming growth
factor-2 (TGFβ2) has been proposed as a major driver of EMT. We have previously demonstrated that the
advanced glycation end products (AGEs) present in aged lens capsules promote the TGFβ2-mediated EMT of
LECs. In our preliminary studies for this proposal, we have discovered that capsule-AGEs through binding to
RAGE receptor promote senescence of LECs. We have also observed that senescent LECs promote EMT of
nonsenescent LECs through paracrine mechanisms. Our data also suggest a greater synthesis of TGFβ2 in
senescent cells than nonsenscent cells. Based on these observations, we propose a novel hypothesis that
capsule AGEs induce senescence in LECs, which promotes the EMT of LECs during posterior capsule
opacification. This hypothesis is further supported by our recent observation of senescent cells in the
posterior capsules of psuedophakic human donor eyes. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that lens capsule
AGEs induce senescence of LECs through formation of reactive oxygen species in cells cultured on AGE-
modified extracellular matrix. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that senescent cells promote the EMT of
human LECs through paracrine mechanisms. The secretion of TGFβ2 and IL-6 from senescent cells and their
ability to induce EMT in nonsenescent cells will be investigated. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that
inhibition/downregulation of RAGE prevents LEC senescence and PCO-like changes in human capsular bags.
Together, the proposed studies are expected to expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of
lens fibrosis and aid in the development of novel drugs for treating PCO."
10891486,"U01 Application: The role of senescent beta cells in T1D and T2D
Abstract
Recent studies including our own suggest a marked increase in β-cells expressing key components of cellular
senescence in islets from Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients, implicating β-cell
senescence as a critical contributor to islet dysfunction. Recently, it was reported that ablation of senescent
cells by non-specific senolysis in mouse models of T1D and T2D improved diseease outcome. However, these
studies did not determine which senescent cell type was relevant to the beneficial effect, nor did they address
to what extent senescence occurs in the human endocrine pancreas before and during the development of
T1D and T2D. To close this knowledge gap, in Specific Aim 1 we will determine the prevalence, transcription
signatures and epigenomic landscapes of β-cell senescence in T1D, pre-T1D and T2D donors using
immunostaining, imaging mass cytometry, single cell RNAseq, single cell ATACseq, DNA methylome
determination and Cut-and-Tag analysis for key histone marks. In addition, we will evaluate the hypothesis that
irreparable damage to telomeres drives senescence in β-cells, a possible scenario that could provide a
mechanism for senescence to occur in islet cells of diabetic patients. In Specific Aim 2, we will test whether
metabolic and/or inflammatory stressors drive senescence in human β-cells and determine the effect of
senescence on β-cell function using scRNAseq and secretome analysis. We will evaluate if induction of
senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in human islet cells is p16
dependent, employing the pseudo-islets approach and using our hyperglycemic xeno-transplantation model to
assess the direct effect of senolytics on human islet function. In Specific Aim 3, we will employ a novel
transgenic mouse, the ‘SenKiller’ model, to enable cell-type specific and inducible ablation of senescent cells in
any lineage including β-cells. Using this mouse model in combination with the appropriate β-cell specific Cre
driver, we will provide a definitive answer to the question if senescent β-cells are critical in the development of
glucose intolerance in models of T2D and islet autoimmunity in models of T1D. Together, this proposal will
determine the occurrence of senescence among islet cells from T1D and T2D donors using large cohorts and
multiple experimental modalities, explore the natural drivers of senescence and consequences to islet function
as well as secretion of pro-inflammatory substances, and employ novel mouse models to unequivocally
determine if elimination of senescent b-cells impacts diabetes progression in mouse models of T1D and T2D.
The data generated here will address burning questions in the field, namely, is senescence increased in islets
from diabetic patients, and are these cells important in the overall pathophysiology of T1D and T2D. These
critical questions will have therapeutic relevance regarding the potential efficacy of targeting senescent β-cells
with senolytic therapies."

Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality. Approximately 42% of cancer cases in the U.S. are potentially
avoidable, including 15% caused by excess body weight and physical inactivity. However, most U.S. adults are
physically inactive. Public health guidelines recommend combinations of activity intensity, frequency, and
duration to achieve a “dose” of at least 150 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity. While
this approach produces health benefits, it fails to address features of physical activity that may lead to
sustainability such as emotional experiences during behavior. To promote long-term maintenance, evidence-
based strategies are needed describing how affect can be incorporated into physical activity
recommendations. Although some people experience pleasure during physical activity, it can be extremely
unpleasant for others, especially among overweight and inactive individuals. Incentive salience theory proposes
affective responses (e.g., liking, disliking) during behavior influence affectively-charged motivations (e.g.,
wanting, dreading) to engage in future behaviors. However, whether modifying these affective mechanisms is a
useful intervention approach for increasing for physical activity is unknown. Using an experimental medicine
approach, this Phase 1 trial will test whether affective mechanisms can be experimentally manipulated
in real-world settings and whether affective mechanisms mediate the effects of interventions on physical
activity behavior among adults who are at elevated cancer risk. Pathways will be tested through a daily self-
regulation intervention delivered using interactive mobile technology among physically inactive adults (18-65
years) who are overweight or obese. In an affect-based condition, self-regulation strategies will target daily goals
related to enjoyment and feeling good during physical activity. In contrast, an intensity-based condition will target
daily heart rate goals during physical activity. Two enhancements to the affect-based condition are: (1) tailored
activity type and context recommendations to satisfy personally important psychological needs and (2) savoring
practices to increase the saliency of positive emotions during physical activity. A Formative study (N=36) will
iteratively test and refine the treatment implementation in terms of acceptability and feasibility of the content,
delivery, usage, and engagement. Subsequently, a 16-week Comparison study (N=280) will optimize the
treatment effects using a factorial (within x between) cross-over design. Affective mechanisms and physical
activity will be measured in daily life using real-time ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and
accelerometry, respectively. Specific aims are (1) test treatments to experimentally manipulate affective
mechanisms, (2) determine whether affective mechanisms mediate effects of treatments on physical activity,
and (3) explore cross-person and cross-situation moderating effects such as self-regulatory capacity and
situational factors. Overall, this study is impactful because it fulfills an explicit need for the systematic
translation of fundamental behavioral science processes into new health behavioral interventions."

10899595,"Project Abstract/Summary
People with HIV (PWH) have a high burden of respiratory symptoms due to chronic lung disease, of which
COPD, diagnosed by spirometric obstruction on pulmonary function testing (PFT), is best studied. The most
common finding on PFTs, however, is an abnormal diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) with normal
spirometry, or iso↓DLco. The clinical relevance of the iso↓DLco PFT phenotype is not known. Iso↓DLco is more
common in PWH than in the general population, and HIV is an independent risk factor for reduced DLco.
Preliminary work from our lab has shown that PWH with iso↓DLco have an increased respiratory symptom
burden compared to PWH with normal PFTs. Iso↓DLco is also associated with a unique set of plasma
inflammatory/immune biomarkers compared to other PFT phenotypes like spirometric obstruction, suggesting
that the iso↓DLco PFT and biomarker pattern has a unique clinical correlate. The pathophysiology underlying
this finding is not known but may be related to early structural lung disease (emphysema or interstitial lung
disease) or pulmonary hypertension. Alternatively, iso↓DLco may be a sequela of chronic inflammation in the
setting of long-standing HIV infection and possibly co-infection with other viruses like cytomegalovirus (CMV),
which affect HIV persistence and immune activation. The central hypothesis for this study is that iso↓DLco is a
unique HIV phenotype, possibly mediated by CMV-induced vasculopathy. The study will be nested within I AM
OLD-DA, an established longitudinal cohort of PWH in San Francisco, USA and Kampala, Uganda, and will
leverage the existing research infrastructure. In San Francisco we will use advanced imaging analyses of chest
CTs to understand the etiology and potential causes of iso↓DLco. In Aim 1, we will evaluate CTs for emphysema,
interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension and air trapping; based on our pilot study, we expect that in
about half of the PWH with iso↓DLco, imaging analysis will not identify a reason for the PFT finding. In Aim 3,
we will test for association between iso↓DLco, CMV and distal pulmonary vascular remodeling (‘vascular
pruning’) using quantitative CT methods with a working hypothesis that CMV-mediated vascular pruning is
associated with iso↓DLco. In Kampala, Uganda, we will study a demographically and clinically distinct cohort or
PWH and HIV-negative controls to determine the prevalence of iso↓DLco and its associated respiratory symptom
burden (Aim 2). Altogether, the results from this study will help generate a deeper understanding of this PFT
phenotype and determine if CMV is a modifiable risk factor for iso↓DLco and a target for therapeutic intervention.
Completion of this project will also provide a platform for training Dr. Katerina Byanova, a pulmonary and critical
care fellow at the University of California San Francisco, in the conduct of high-quality, patient-oriented clinical
research. This grant will provide Dr. Byanova with the support necessary to acquire the knowledge and skills to
become an independent clinical investigator and a leader in HIV-related lung disease.

10913641,"Project Summary
 Epigenetic clocks based on DNA cytosine methylation (DNAme) are currently the most robust biomarkers
of aging in mammals. They can accurately estimate the age of diverse biosamples and are responsive to
interventions–such as caloric restriction or rapamycin treatment—that are thought to slow aging. Despite their
increasing ubiquity in the field, the biology underlying epigenetic clocks is poorly understood. Likewise, their
potential as a readout to test pharmaceutical interventions and discover new aging-associated genes is yet
unrealized. One of the main limitations to using DNAme clocks at scale is the cost of current methods. Commonly
used technologies to assay epigenetic age, such as methylation chip and RRBS, measure hundreds of
thousands of CpGs and cost hundreds of dollars per sample. An economical, targeted approach that can
measure virtually any epigenetic clock is badly needed to enable larger experiments with epigenetic age as the
primary readout.
 For the F99 phase of this proposal, I have developed a new method called Tagmentation-based Indexing
for Methylation SEquencing (TIME-Seq) that enables targeted DNAme clock sequencing of dozens to hundreds
of samples simultaneously. I have shown that TIME-Seq is capable of measuring diverse epigenetic clocks at a
range of scales and decreases costs 1-2 orders of magnitude. I plan to validate the method via comparison to
conventional methods and build novel epigenetic age predictors and biomarkers trained on age-related frailty
metrics.
 In the K00 phase, I will investigate the biology driving epigenetic clocks using aging mouse muscle as a
model. I will take a multiomic approach, using TIME-Seq and established genomic methods, to test the
hypothesis that heritable loss of silencing at developmental loci, in part, drives ticking of the clocks.
 This proposal will provide the aging field with a much-needed method for cost-effective and high-
throughput epigenetic clock assay, as well as novel biomarkers based on frailty, which can be used in academic
research and a clinical context. Ultimately, the method will help us understand how and why it is possible to build
DNAme clocks and what they tell us about epigenomic dysfunction during aging."

Aortic stenosis (AS) is a serious condition that affects 2-4% of the elderly, and is responsible for U.S. healthcare
expenditures of over $6 billion annually attributable mostly to valve replacement procedures. Frequently, AS is
diagnosed by non-invasive imaging before it is severe or symptomatic. Yet there are no pharmacologic therapies
to slow progression of disease. The pathobiology of AS involves the myofibroblastic and osteoblastic
transformation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) that mediate matrix remodeling and calcification. The plurality
of events and signaling pathways that influence VICs is one reason for lack of effective medical therapy. Using
in vivo molecular imaging of the aortic root and comprehensive echocardiography, we have found that mice that
lack the ability to cleave von Willebrand Factor (VWF) multimers from the endothelial surface develop
progressive AS and load-related left ventricular hypertrophy. Valve leaflets from these animals demonstrate
endothelial adhesion of platelets and platelet extracellular vesicles, and also typical patterns of VIC proliferation
and transformation. These findings are consistent with the idea that platelets contribute to AS by binding VWF
and acting in a juxtracrine fashion through local release of platelet-derived growth factors, cytokines, and reactive
oxygen species (ROS) which are known to stimulate VIC transformation. Accordingly, inhibiting platelet
interaction with VWF at the valve endothelial surface could prevent the activation of many parallel signaling
pathways that contribute to AS. Our overall goal is to integrate non-invasive imaging with histology,
transcriptomics, and blood markers to characterize this potentially treatable mechanism for AS. In Aim 1, we will
provide definitive evidence that platelet adhesion contributes to AS by longitudinal assessment of mice deficient
for the ADAMTS13 protease that cleaves shear-activated VWF from the endothelial surface. We will investigate
whether deletion of platelet GPIb, the counterligand for VWF; and treatment with recombinant ADAMTS13.
Because platelet-endothelial adhesion also contributes to vascular stiffness, a systems-biology approach will be
used with non-invasive imaging of arterial compliance, LV remodeling, and load-dependent indices of LV
function. In Aim 2, we will test whether novel pharmacologic approaches that reduce excess endothelial-
associated VWF multimers suppress the development of AS and LV remodeling in the murine models. Therapies
will include (i) n-acetylcysteine which inhibits VWF self-association, and (ii) an acetovanillone inhibitor of Nox2
which reduces the generation of ROS and, consequently, excess endothelial-associated VWF. In Aim 3, a proof-
of-concept prospective clinical trial will be performed in patients with mild or moderate AS to determine whether
blood markers of abnormal VWF proteolysis and platelet-derived signaling factors predict rapidly progressive AS
and arterial non-compliance. These data will be integrated with novel echocardiographic features of valve shear
based on the known shear-dependency of “opening” of the otherwise cryptic VWF A1 domain for platelet GPIb
binding and shear-related transcriptomic control of platelet signaling molecules"
10892946,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are at the apex of the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cellular hierarchy. The
quiescent fraction of LSCs provides a reservoir of self-renewing cells that sustain leukemia growth, prevent clonal
exhaustion, and are treatment resistant; thus, eliminating LSCs is the `holy grail' of any anti-leukemia treatment.
In previous studies, we showed that miR-126 is necessary to maintain a quiescent subfraction of LSCs that
prevent clonal exhaustion. We demonstrated how SPRED1/miR-126 autoregulatory loop in LSCs and in BM
endothelial cells (ECs) converge to increase miR-126 levels in LSCs, protect them and support leukemia growth.
We showed that high miR-126 levels are due to both LSC autonomous mechanisms, resulting in enhanced
endogenous production, and non-autonomous mechanisms, through exogenous miR-126 supply from ECs.
To deplete miR-126 in LSCs and ECs, we designed a novel oligodeoxynucleotide anti-miR-126 inhibitor, called
miRisten. Our data show that pharmacological miR-126 deprivation by miRisten significantly decreases LSC
endogenous production of miR-126 and decreases the exogenous supply of endothelial miR-126. The net result
is a significant decrease of miR-126 that damages the homeostasis and activity of LSCs, as demonstrated in
serial transplant experiments. In addition, we now have evidence that miR-126 enhances mitochondrial
metabolism (i.e., oxidative phosphorylation) and mitochondrial dynamics (i.e., mitochondrial fusion) in LSCs
through SPRED1/ERK/p-BCL-2/NRF2 signaling. Accordingly, depletion of miR-126 by miRisten treatment
significantly downregulates BCL-2 and disrupts mitochondrial metabolism, leading to increased levels of reactive
oxygen species and apoptosis of LSCs. In addition, miRisten disrupts LSC mitochondrial function by upregulating
the dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1), inducing mitochondrial fission, decreasing mitochondrial membrane
potential, and inducing expression of mitophagy marker proteins. Since mitochondria-centered metabolism is
the main metabolic energetic source for LSCs, we propose to dissect how miRisten exploits the mitochondrial
metabolic vulnerability as a novel mechanism of action to eliminate LSCs. Furthermore, after conducting
Investigational New Drug application (IND)-enabling pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and toxicology studies,
we will rapidly translate miRisten from bench to beside with a first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial of miRisten in
patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) AML. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that miRisten targets miR-
126-depended metabolic vulnerability of LSCs and will provide a novel therapeutic approach for LSC elimination
in AML. We propose the following Specific Aims (SAs): SA#1: Determine the mechanisms of miRisten-induced
mitochondrial metabolic vulnerability in LSCs. SA#2: Conduct pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, efficacy
and toxicology studies of miRisten to inform dose and schedule selection for human studies. SA#3: Conduct
a first-in-human phase 1 trial of miRisten in patients with r/r AML. This project will translate novel discoveries on
miR-126 into the clinic, by conducting preclincal studies that culminate in a first-in-human trial of miRisten."

 There is an urgent need to train investigators in the related fields of kidney, urology and hematology. In
this U2C/TL1 proposal we bring together expertise in research and education from four of the leading medical
schools in the New York City (NYC) metropolitan region, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Columbia
University Irving Medical Center, the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Renaissance School of
Medicine at Stony Brook University, to establish the “New York Consortium for Interdisciplinary Training in
Kidney, Urological and Hematological Research” (NYC Train KUHR) (pronounced “NYC Train cure”). The NYC
Train KUHR builds on three, well-established and successful nephrology T32 grants with over 70 years of
experience at Einstein, Mount Sinai and Columbia, most recently training 8 post-docs per year at the 3
institutions and an O’Brien Center in Urology at Columbia to create an interdisciplinary approach to training
pre- and postdoctoral fellows. The program brings together both private institutions (Einstein, Columbia and
Mount Sinai) and the public State University of New York at Stony Brook.
 The training program will include over 100 preceptors from the 4 institutions, all of whom have a
remarkable track record in training and research in KUH and complementary disciplines. The preceptors
include MD and PhD scientists with expertise in research in KUH diseases from neonates to geriatrics. It will
employ comprehensive, well-rounded and integrated educational approaches that support interdisciplinary,
cross-institutional peer-to-peer networking activities to enhance education and professional development,
providing the foundation for a successful career in KUH research. At its full capacity, the NYC Train KUHR
program will be home to a diverse and inclusive cadre of 9 pre-doctoral and 16 post-doctoral trainees. In line
with the size of this multi-institutional endeavor, the leadership of the NYC Train KUHR program will follow a
multi-PD/PI structure with 8 Principal Investigators (PIs) representing all 4 institutions. The MPIs will provide
experienced and cohesive leadership for both the administrative and training components of the program.
 The program will be organized around four cores, an Administrative Core, a Networking Core and a
Professional Development Core under the U2C component, and the Training Core under the TL1 component
of the award. The NYC Train KUHR will be governed by an Executive Committee comprised of the program
leadership, which in conjunction with other committees, will ensure that the program achieves its overarching
goal: “To train a new generation of investigators, who will recognize the value of interdisciplinary collaboration
in KUH research”. This new cadre of investigators will be endowed with the scientific knowledge and skills to
work across different disciplines, facilitating the development of new ideas and novel concepts that will
ultimately generate the scientific discoveries needed to improve care and quality of life of people with KUH
diseases."
10892953,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSKP) is a significant problem in many women with hormone receptor-
positive early stage breast cancer receiving treatment designed to prevent cancer recurrence by blocking
estrogen production via systemic inhibition of the aromatase enzyme. MSKP interferes with functional status,
adherence to therapy, and increases utilization of health care resources. Unfortunately, very little is known
about the molecular mechanisms underlying MSKP related to a decline in estrogen in women with breast
cancer. Evidence supports that dysregulation of adrenergic function is present in women with MSKP. In fact,
both β-antagonists and α2-agonists have been investigated as treatment for MSKP pain disorders, and
evidence from our group as well as others support a role for pain inhibition via α1-antagonists. The purpose of
this K99R00 proposal is to provide the applicant with the necessary training and research experience to
examine the dynamic RNA transcriptome and DNA methylome to identify genes and biological pathways that
are involved in development of cancer pain. The purpose of the proposed K99 study is to generate knowledge
about MSKP development within the context of declining estrogen in women with breast cancer. The K99
phase of this project capitalizes on data and blood samples generated through an ongoing project that recruits
postmenopausal women newly diagnosed with early stage breast cancer who will receive aromatase inhibitor
therapy (R01CA196762, the EPICC study). The K99 also benefits from an ongoing project generating DNA
methylation data from blood samples of the women in the EPICC study (R01CA221882). The specific research
aims for the K99 study are to (1) test the hypothesis that 6 months of decreased estrogen leads to changes in
gene expression and this is related to changes in the pain phenotype in women with breast cancer; and (2) test
the hypothesis that 6 months of decreased estrogen leads to changes in DNA methylation and this is related to
changes in the pain phenotype in women with breast cancer. The K99 training plan leverages the superb
research-intensive environment and resources at the University of Pittsburgh to ensure the applicant’s
development of (a) proficiency in omics (particularly transcriptomics and epigenomics), (b) competency in
analysis and bioinformatics of omics data, (c) proficiency in pain mechanisms, and (d) knowledge and skills for
professional career development. The specific aims of the R00 study are to (1) identify changes in the
regulation of genes that are associated with variability in cancer pain based on cancer type; (2) identify
changes in the regulation of genes that are associated with variability in cancer pain based on cancer therapy;
and (3) explore the potential mediating and moderating effects of sex on the relationship between gene
regulation and pain. This research generates the knowledge needed to develop a research program focusing
on developing a profile for predicting individuals at risk for chronic pain development that includes
demographic, clinical, and omics data."

The goal of the proposed collaborative Capacity Building Project between the Alaska Native Tribal Health
Consortium (ANTHC) and Alaska Pacific University (APU) is to increase capacity for conducting culturally
responsive and respectful health research that addresses the unique setting and health needs of AN/AI
Peoples. The objective is to continue the momentum of the NARCH X funded Alaska-based research training
and education program “Alaska Indigenous Research Program” (AKIRP) in building a network of Indigenous
and non-indigenous students, researchers and health professionals and scientists. The AKIRP is innovative
and unique in that it differs from conventional approaches to cultural competency education and training by
bringing together diverse perspectives and epistemologies - Indigenous and Western worldviews and ways of
knowing - in an effort for mutual understanding, reciprocity, respect and the co-production of solutions that
address health disparities among AN/AI Peoples. This is known as “Two-Eyed Seeing” or “Etuaptmumk”, a
framework that was first proposed by Mi’kmaw Elders Albert and Murdena Marshall as a way to bridge
Western science and Indigenous knowledge. The AKIRP aims to 1) provide Indigenous-centered cross-cultural
health research education and training, 2) offer internship and mentorship opportunities and 3) providing career
development support and research guidance and consultation. Continuing the AKIRP contributes to the overall
goal of the ANTHC NARCH XII to conduct tribally-driven health research in pursuit of ANTHC’s vision that
Alaska Native people are the healthiest people in the world. The expected long-term outcomes are new and
improved ways of conducting research in collaboration with Indigenous peoples and communities to find
solutions to health disparities and inequities that have not been addressed successfully before."
10893419,"Pilot and Feasibility Program: Summary
The Pilot and Feasibility (P&F) Program has been major pillar of success for the UCSF-NORC, and we expect
it to be a critical element of it's future growth and development. This program annually provides $50,000 of
funding to a minimum of 3 proposals that are exploratory in nature. P&F Awards allow applicants to collect the
preliminary data for subsequent grant applications that are needed to for these investigators to develop
sustained, long-term new research directions. The intentions of this program relate directly to the major UCSF-
NORC goal of strengthening a growing interactive community of Obesity & Nutrition researchers by:
− Helping new investigators and junior faculty establish NORC-relevant research programs
− Attracting scientists with established programs in other areas of research into the fields of nutritional
 sciences, obesity, and related disorders.
− Fostering highly innovative techniques, tools, and directions in basic and clinical obesity- and nutrition-
 related research, including clinical studies in minority and other underserved patient groups.
− Developing new and innovative collaborations among NORC investigators and between NORC
 investigators and faculty members from other disciplines.
A straightforward guideline-driven review process is used to select P&F proposal for funding. The request for
applications is conducted through a UCSF-wide website, the Research Allocation Program, that today lists
over 30 intramural funding opportunities. UCSF investigators routinely turn to this site to identify intramural
research opportunities, which ensures that the NORC P&F program is able to reach its primary target of junior
investigators and those new to the nutrition, obesity and metabolism field.
The review process involves an initial assessment of each application by an ad hoc internal NORC committee
that includes the UCSF-NORC P&F Program Director and the Directors of the other NORC Programs, after
which promising applications are sent out for review by extramural academic researchers knowledgeable about
the types of projects being proposed, and also often involved with intramural P&F programs at their own
institutions. After scores are returned, applications are ranked and the initial intramural committee allocates
grants accordingly, while also ensuring that funded projects reflect a diversity of research areas. The
committee also identifies established researchers to mentor P&F awardees who are junior and/or new to the
field.
The collection of success metrics, regular review of the P&F program by the NORC Executive Committee and
advice on P&F funding by our External Board has ensured that the program continues in a high quality
manner."
10893421,"Enrichment Program: Summary
The mission of the UCSF-NORC Enrichment Program remains to provide exceptionally high-quality
opportunities for investigators at UCSF to exchange research information, for recognized experts in obesity
and nutrition to enlighten the UCSF community on both research and clinical practice, and for faculty to
educate trainees, as well as to strengthen the multidisciplinary and collaborative network that links nutrition and
obesity research being conducted across UCSF. However, the Program has also grown in specific and
transformative ways. This growth includes A) Networking with other academic institutional NORCs from around
the country to increase scientific exchange between colleagues; B) Specific efforts to engage, cultivate, and
grow a diverse clinical and translational research community relevant to NORC objectives; and C) Establishing
the UCSF-NORC as a hub for sharing research in obesity and nutrition with institutions across Northern

grant funding, are impressive given they were fully implemented in only four years.
The Director of the Enrichment Program, Dr. Suneil Koliwad (also Co-Director of the NORC) has been tasked
with implementing the Program's mission over the funding period. Dr. Koliwad performs this function in close
collaboration with the Center Director (Vaisse, PI) and an oversight committee that includes the other NORC
Core and Program Directors, the principal investigators of relevant NIDDK-sponsored T32 training grants and
the organizers of key NORC-connected seminar series and symposia.
The specific objectives of the program are to:
1. Strategically integrate a complementary yearlong set of speakers regularly interspersed in the weekly
UCSF Endocrine Grand Rounds, Diabetes and Obesity Seminar Series, and institution-wide talks within the
graduate school seminar series. This effort includes the recruitment of both preeminent scientists working at
UCSF, speakers from neighboring top-tier academic centers within the region, and renowned NORC visiting
professors (in collaboration with the Diabetes Center Distinguished Speakers Series) from around the world.
2. Oversee the maintenance of a high-quality weekly Obesity and Nutrition Journal Club at UCSF in order to
implement further the training components of the NORC mission.
3. Conduct and strategically continue to grow the annual UCSF Diabetes, Obesity, and Nutrition Retreat.
4. Continue to host interdisciplinary collaborative enrichment activities, including a clinical engagement
symposium co-sponsored by the Center for Obesity Assessment and Treatment (COAST), which incentivize
core utilization by promoting joint projects between clinical and basic researchers at UCSF.
5. Co-host the annual COAST Sugar, Stress, Environment, and Weight (SSEW) symposium.
6. Provide speakers as part of continuing medical education (CME) activities relevant to obesity and nutrition.
By facilitating continued achievement of these specific objectives, renewed funding of the UCSF-NORC
Enrichment Program will allow it to realize the ongoing mission and long-term goal of fostering a highly
collaborative, world-class learning environment that advances and promotes successful basic, translational,
and clinical nutrition and obesity research at UCSF and across the Northern California Region."

10893526,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of the Genomics & Cell Biology Core will be to facilitate the application of cutting-edge
genomics, bioinformatics, cell biology, and immunology techniques to nutrition and metabolic research. This
will be accomplished by encouraging multi-disciplinary approaches and collaborations to study nutrition-related
topics, and by overcoming the barriers to using complex and expensive techniques by providing appropriate
consultation and training to NORCH Investigators. The guiding philosophy of the Genomics & Cell Biology
Core is that although many projects can be advanced by the use of sophisticated genomic and cell biology
techniques, their expense and difficulty of first use represent a significant barrier. The Core is specifically
designed to overcome this barrier by providing personalized consulting and training to NORC-H investigators
that is not typically available in most NGS, genomics, bioinformatics, cell biology, or immunology core facilities.
Following the retirement of Core Director Dr. Fred Ausubel (who has been the Director of Genomics Core since
the original inception of the Center grant since 1994), Dr. Alessio Fasano, a renowned Celiac disease
researcher and previously and Co-Core Director, has assumed the role of Director. The Co-Associate Director
(Bioinformatics and Next Generation Sequencing) Dr. Ruslan Sadreyev, and Co-Associate Director (Cell
Biology) Dr. Haining Shi will remain in charge of respective parts of the Core. There are 5 specific Aims of the
Core: 1) provide consultative services related to genomics, cell biology, and immunology research design; 2)
provide space, technical personnel, and specific training and supervision for utilizing specialized techniques
and equipment used in cell biology, immunology, and genomics research, including single-cell transcriptional
and epigenomic profiling, assistance in the development of high-content high-throughput assays using
automated microscopic imaging, fluorescent activated cell sorting, and development of animal models; 3)
provide a variety of genomics-related services related to next-generation sequencing; 4) provide bioinformatic
analysis of various types of high-throughput data, including bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-
Seq, CUT&RUN, Hi-C, metagenomics, proteomics, as well as computational analysis of molecular pathways,
networks and phenotypes; and 5) conduct enrichment tutorials and workshops in basic concepts in genomic,
bioinformatic, cell biology, and nutrition and GI immunology-related techniques, and coordinate summer
internships for undergraduates and medical students. This will be accomplished through the significant
expertise of the Core Directors and staff, with the help of advanced instrumentation for bioinformatics analysis,
most up-to-date next generation sequencing instruments, automated microscopy and imaging based high
content screening assays, a variety of equipment for carrying out immunological, cell biology, and morphology-

Over the past twenty-five years, there has been tremendous growth in the development of lab-on-a-chip
technologies for clinical, environmental and biological applications. These devices are constructed using
fabrication technologies that were originally developed to produce integrated circuits. Similar to integrated
circuits, these devices can integrate several different bioanalytical processes into a single platform only a few
centimeters in size. Microfluidics have been used for many applications in biomedical research, from analyzing
the contents of single cells to mimicking the complex environments of human organs to better understand cell-
cell interactions. The KU Nanofabrication Facility is a Core Laboratory supported by the COBRE Center for
Molecular Analysis of Disease Pathways at the University of Kansas. It provides the resources and personnel
for the production of micro- and nanoscale devices that are used by project investigators for their studies.
Equipment and training are available to investigators for the fabrication of devices for biomedical, biophysical,
and bioanalytical studies related to disease pathways.
The goals of KUNF in Phase 3 are (1) to develop and maintain a Core infrastructure that allows the efficient
design and fabrication of nano- and microscale devices for use by project investigators and researchers from
the University of Kansas, other regional universities, and private institutions for biomedical research, (2) to
provide outreach, training and assistance in the development of nano- and microfluidic devices for the
investigation of disease pathways, (3) to provide access to and assistance with the development of nano- and
microfluidic devices and to fabricate custom devices for investigators, and (4) to continue developing a critical
mass of Core Lab users, so that the facility becomes a self-sustaining, integral part of the biomedical research
infrastructure in the state of Kansas and the surrounding region."
10902059,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The Recruitment and Engagement in Care to Impact Practice Enhancement (RECIPE) project has a goal
to reduce the science-to-practice gap in sickle cell disease (SCD) by identifying individuals who are not receiving
guideline based SCD care. Up to 50% of affected adults may not see SCD specialists, which limits the delivery
of disease-specific screenings and treatment with disease modifying therapies. Issues are worsened for
individuals living in rural regions or with socio-economic challenges known to accentuate health disparities. This
team of investigators has been working to address this problem since the inception of the NHLBI-funded Sickle
Cell Disease Implementation Consortium (SCDIC). In our previous studies, we identified a need to optimize
research methodologies to engage individuals in evidence-based SCD care and established foundational terms
through a Delphi consensus process, for “unaffiliated patients with SCD” and “SCD specialist”. The current
project, RECIPE, will advance these efforts to identify and link unaffiliated patients to SCD specialists by applying
implementation science research to adapt existing methods used in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care.
Similar to SCD, individuals with HIV have faced significant healthcare scrutiny causing reciprocal misgivings
about healthcare. In this project, we will adapt models for patient identification and engagement in HIV to SCD
using a multi-staged, patient-oriented process. We embed this work in the Interactive Systems Framework for
Dissemination and Implementation to ensure high quality implementation and evaluation in each stage of the
affiliation process, with emphasis on the readiness of health systems to serve traditionally underserved
populations and sustainability of this work in these areas."
10890957,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by the accumulation
of neurofibrillary plaques and tangles, cognitive decline, mood and behavior changes, and dementia. Despite
the recent FDA approval of Leqembi, limited progress has been made towards identifying more efficacious AD
treatments, underscoring the need for new treatment strategies. Compared to the general population, patients
with AD have a significantly higher incidence of epilepsy, and the risk for developing epilepsy is even higher in
patients with early-onset AD. Furthermore, over 40% of AD patients without a history of epilepsy exhibit
subclinical epileptiform activity. This overlap between epilepsy and AD suggests a shared underlying disease
mechanism, and we propose that this commonality may be leveraged to guide novel treatment strategies.
Mutations that increase activity of SCN8A (which encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.6) are
associated with epilepsy and a range of behavioral abnormalities. Interestingly, increased Nav1.6 expression has
also been observed in brains from AD patients and mouse models of AD. We hypothesize that increased
SCN8A activity in AD contributes to multiple clinically challenging features of AD, including epileptiform
discharges, cognitive impairment, and AD neuropathology. Consistent with this hypothesis, Yuan et al.
recently reported reduced Ab plaques and amelioration of cognitive and synaptic deficits following hippocampal
knockdown of Nav1.6 in 5-month-old male APP/PS1 mutants, and SCN8A was recently nominated as a potential
therapeutic target for AD (Agora AD knowledge portal).
 Hyperexcitability and tau neuropathology in AD originate in the locus coeruleus (LC), and the LC is
anatomically and functionally connected to other vulnerable brain regions that develop AD pathology, including
the hippocampus which is also critical for seizure generation and cognitive behavior. Furthermore, degeneration
of the LC is a pervasive characteristic of mid- to late-stage AD and contributes to the progression of forebrain
pathology and cognitive impairment. In our Preliminary data, we show that Scn8a is highly expressed in the LC,
suggesting an important role for Scn8a in the LC. As Nav1.6 is located at the axon initial segment and regulates
neuronal excitability, we predict that reducing Nav1.6 in the LC may prevent or delay hyperexcitability of the LC,
which in turn, may prevent or slow the development of multiple AD phenotypes. Thus, targeting SCN8A in the
LC may provide a novel therapeutic opportunity to prevent disease progression in AD. In the proposed studies,
we will establish the effect of selectively SCN8A knockdown in the LC or hippocampus on seizure susceptibility,
epileptiform activity, behavior, and AD neuropathology."

for downstream analyses. This core utilizes the combined specialized expertise, experience, and cutting-edge
technological and analytical methods at UM and CWRU. To accomplish these goals, the core has established
three specific aims that interact with and support other cores and both projects. These specific aims are: 1)
Prepare, store, track, and allocate high quality DNA, plasma, and PAXGEne RNA tubes from the newly
ascertained cohorts (N=5,000 individuals from African sites and 8,000 individuals ascertained from US sites);
2) Generate and perform quality control on genome-wide SNP array data for all collected samples and plasma
AD biomarkers including total Tau, A 40, and A 42, phospho-Tau181, and Neurofilament light on a subset of
900 individuals (300 Nigerian, 300 African American, and 300 Cuban); and 3) harmonize analytical pipelines with
pre-existing genotyping and biomarker data with newly generated genotyping and biomarker data for
dissemination through Core E to the projects and NIAGADS. In completing these aims this core plays a critical
role in bridging the ascertainment and data management cores and generates data for both projects and the
broader AD research community. Moreover, the biospecimens including extracted DNA, frozen plasma,
PAXGene RNA tubes will serve as a standing resource for future AD basic and translational research."

support and track demographics, cognitive testing results, pertinent medical history and history of cognitive
problems from the Ascertainment and Outreach Core (Core B), 2) manage phenotype and genomic data
produced by the Adjudication and Phenotype Harmonization (Core C) and Genomics and Biomarker (Cores D)
Cores, 3) support databases for phenotypes, genotype and biomarker data, analysis results (all Projects), and
annotations (Cores C, D and Projects), 4) perform imputation of genotyping data for analysis in Projects, 5)
provide cloud computing analysis support and optimization to Projects, and 6) provide server support for the
READD-ADSP website and dashboard. The final READD-ADSP resource, including data collected within this
application and future biomarker and whole genome sequencing, will create an invaluable resource for the
Alzheimer disease genomics research community. Identification of population specific genomic associations
facilitated by this resource will both increase our biological understanding of Alzheimer's disease and ensure
that therapeutic development will benefit all populations."
10897887,"SUMMARY
Historically, interactions between substrates and/or inhibitors and enzymes have been viewed in terms of binding
of small molecules to relatively rigid protein targets. However, computational and experimental studies have
revealed that many proteins, in particular DNA polymerases, undergo molecular motions over a wide range of
timescales. Such conformational flexibility is critical for enzymatic activity, drug action and drug resistance.
Moreover, contemporary structural biology approaches, such as X-ray crystallography, only have the ability to
resolve the structures of thermodynamically stable species, and cannot inform on kinetic intermediates. Our
group has developed cutting-edge technology - “on-the-fly” time-resolved cryo-electron microscopy (EM) - that,
for the first time, facilitates visualization of novel protein conformations, including those transiently occurring
during catalysis. Specifically, we have developed two TR cryo-EM approaches: (i) rapid chemical mixing of
enzyme and substrates; and (ii) photo-activation that takes advantage of caged substrates and/or amino acid
residues. We have developed substantial preliminary data that support the feasibility and power of these
approaches. In this application, we will apply this technology to address biologically and clinically relevant
knowledge gaps in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) biology, with specific focus on the incorporation of
nucleosides and nucleoside inhibitors, nucleoside inhibitor resistance, and the relationship between DNA
synthesis and ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity."
10898861,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Pancreatogenic diabetes, or type 3c diabetes (T3cDM), is a known complication of acute pancreatitis (AP).
Recent data suggest that T3cDM occurs more commonly than previously recognized and exhibits a spectrum of
defects including features that overlap aspects of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. At present, the extent to which
immune activation, β cell dysfunction, and insulin resistance occur following AP and the genetic, metabolic and
imaging correlates of these phenotypes have not been characterized. To address these knowledge gaps, we
have assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in pancreatitis and exocrine pathophysiology, diabetes,
β cell biology, diabetes genetics, and pancreatic imaging at the Indiana University School of Medicine. The IU
Clinical Center will work with other members of the Type 1 Diabetes in Acute Pancreatitis Consortium to test the
hypothesis that T3cDM encompasses a heterogeneous combination of metabolic and potentially immunologic
phenotypes that are determined by distinct underlying pathophysiologies. We propose the following specific aims
(SA) to meet the goals of this RFA. SA #1: To perform an observational study of robustly characterized adults
with AP in order to address knowledge gaps in the natural history and incidence of autoantibody-positive diabetes
(AAb+), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)/impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and diabetes occurring subsequent to
AP. Enrolled participants will be longitudinally characterized with emphasis on identifying genetic, immunological,
metabolic, and clinical risk factors for the development of AAb+, IGT/IFG, or T3cDM. We will use state-of-the-art
immunologic phenotyping and measurements of pancreatic β cell function to define the physiologic basis for
metabolic dysregulation in T3cDM after AP. In tandem, a biorepository will be developed for undertaking
translational, mechanistic and biomarker investigations and ancillary studies. SA#2: The Imaging Morphology of
Pancreas in Diabetic Patients following Acute Pancreatitis (IMMINENT) study aims to utilize novel quantitative
magnetic resonance imaging techniques as a non-invasive biomarker to identify patients at risk for the

10898864,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Eligibility for the Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program is based on historically low levels of NIH
funding. IDeA states differ from non-IDeA states with respect to the rural/urban distributions of the population
and access to medical care. Compared to children in non-IDeA states, children in IDeA states are more likely
to live in rural areas and are less likely to have access to or receive medical care. Since multi-center pediatric
clinical trial networks are concentrated in centers in non-IDeA states, there are limited opportunities for children
living in IDeA states to participate in clinical research activities.
 The ECHO IDeA States Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) was established in 2016 with 17 clinical awardee
sites and the Data Coordinating and Operations Center (DCOC) at the University of Arkansas for Medical
Sciences (UAMS) in Little Rock, Arkansas. The objectives of the Network are to develop and implement
clinical research in the IDeA states in the ECHO priority areas: upper and lower airway disease; obesity;
neurodevelopment; pre-, peri-, and post-natal outcomes; and positive child health; and to develop capacity
within the IDeA states to conduct clinical trial research.
 This proposal is for UAMS to continue to serve as the DCOC for the ECHO ISPCTN. The specific aims of
the Data Coordination and Operations Center are to
 1) Provide scientific, operational, administrative and logistical infrastructure support to the ECHO IDeA
 States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) to facilitate the development, implementation and
 dissemination of clinical research activities in the ISPCTN; and
 2) Build pediatric clinical research capacity in the IDeA states to enhance the potential for conducting
 clinical trials that address health issues of relevance to children in IDeA states.
 We will work collaboratively with clinical investigators at the ISPCTN sites, Project Scientists and Project
Officers at the NIH ECHO Office, and other participating NIH staff, and collaborating multicenter clinical trials
groups to design and implement studies that will address health issues that disproportionately affect rural and
medically underserved children."

Caregiving for a spouse with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is an extreme, chronic
stressor. There are 16 million informal (i.e., unpaid) ADRD caregivers in America; ADRD caregivers have
chronically elevated inflammation relative to their non-caregiver counterparts1–3. Chronic inflammation is a risk
factor for cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, some cancers, fatigue, depression,
premature aging, mortality, and Alzheimer's disease. ADRD caregivers often need to balance their caregiving
duties with their employment responsibilities, as about half of all ADRD caregivers work over 20 hours per
week4,5. To understand the impact of employment on ADRD caregivers’ psychosocial functioning and
chronic inflammation, researchers must utilize theories and methods from occupational health psychology
and psychoneuroimmunology. Compared to retired caregivers, employed caregivers experience two chronic
stressors: employment and caregiving. Therefore, employed spousal caregivers may experience higher
perceived stress than retired counterparts due to an additive effect of work stress plus caregiving stress.
Working necessitates various demands and takes up a significant portion of time – time that could be used to
care for their spouse or for their own rest and leisure. The time associated with employment, plus caregiving,
may also result in employed caregivers evaluating their caregiving as more burdensome. This study aims to
test the hypothesis that employment plus caregiving is related to poorer psychosocial functioning (i.e.,
perceived stress and subjective caregiver burden) and higher proinflammatory cytokine markers. Although
inflammation has been implicated in studies of caregivers, very few studies have examined the inflammatory
responses of caregivers’ workplace experiences6. Specific Aims: (1) To examine the role of employment
status for ADRD spousal caregivers’ chronic inflammation. (2) To examine the role of employment status for
ADRD spousal caregivers’ psychosocial functioning (i.e., perceived stress and caregiver burden). (3) To
explore psychosocial functioning as mediators between employment status and chronic inflammation.
Concurrent with an R01 project funded by NIA, this project will examine employment, psychosocial functioning,
and chronic inflammation in a longitudinal study of 180 ADRD spousal caregivers (90 employed, 90 retired).
Investigation of the relationship between employment and inflammation would further understanding
of the role of employment as a risk factor for caregivers’ health. Results will yield important
information for tailoring health interventions for ADRD caregivers. This proposed project will also
introduce the applicant to psychoneuroimmunology and enable her research pipeline which will integrate
occupational health psychology and psychoneuroimmunology."

Children living in rural and underserved communities experience poorer health and worse health outcomes
than children living in other areas. Our state, Kansas, exemplifies this problem, with rural children having lower
immunization rates, higher infant mortality rates, and higher rates of obesity than their urban and suburban
counterparts. Also, children and families from rural and underserved areas are much less likely to participate in
clinical trials, which could study these and other health conditions and ultimately lead to improvement in health
for these rural and underserved children and families. The purpose of the current application is to propose that
the state of Kansas, a largely rural state, renew its status as a Clinical Site of the Child Health Outcomes
(ECHO) IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN). Our goals with this application are: 1) to
assure that rural and underserved children in Kansas participate in multicenter clinical trials research, and 2) to
improve the infrastructure for pediatric clinical trials in our state. The current application, Sunflower Pediatric
Clinical Trials Research Extension (SPeCTRE 2.0), has three primary aims focused on improving research
capacity through professional skills development of clinicians and researchers in our state, expanding clinical
trials to rural and underserved children in our state, and evaluating and improving the effectiveness and
efficiency of clinical trials in the network. We propose a strong administrative team and detailed administrative
plan to support this work and have an extensive network throughout our state to support our activities as
planned. Our site was very productive during the initial funding cycle and will expand on these activities during
SPeCTRE 2.0. We propose a very strong Clinical Skills Development Plan focused on implementation science
and individualized training plans that capitalizes upon our strong existing campus resources and our Clinical
and Translational Science Award (CTSA) in Kansas called Frontiers. As noted in our Rural Engagement Plan,
we plan to engage both communities and providers through our Primary Clinical Sites and our Stakeholder
Advisory Committee Sites. We also note that Kansas is a highly rural state with a high volume of pediatric
patients who are rural and underserved who we will bring to the network. Finally, our application includes a
Clinical Trial Proposal of the CoVER (The Collaboration for Vaccine Education and Research) curriculum,
which is a trial that may be considered by the network for potential future dissemination. The results of the
current work could lead to improvement in the health of rural and underserved children in the state of Kansas
and improvements in the infrastructure in our IDeA state to support future pediatric clinical trials."

Photoreceptor Regeneration in a Murine Model of Leber Congenital Amaurosis
ABSTRACT
Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) is an early-onset, severe inherited retinal degeneration that results in
childhood blindness. Gene therapy can effectively restore visual function in the Lca5gt/gt mouse model of the
disease when delivered to neonatal mice before significant retinal degeneration is present. However, in
moderate- and late- stage disease after photoreceptor cell death has occurred, gene therapy is no longer
effective. Cell-based therapies hold great promise for regenerating photoreceptors in late-stage retinal
degenerations, but progress has been limited by low efficiencies of integration and complex cellular
interactions with existing retinal cells.
Photoreceptor precursors represent a heterogeneous pool of diverse cells types that have the potential to
differentiate into mature photoreceptor cells in the developing and diseased retina. Using unbiased single-cell
RNA transcriptomics, I identified several novel populations of Crx+ photoreceptor precursors including
Crx+/Nfix+ and Crx+/Slc39a1+ cells. The scientific objectives of this proposal are to regenerate
photoreceptors in the Lca5gt/gt mouse model of retinal degeneration, by the transplantation of these novel
populations of photoreceptor precursors and by the activation of endogenous repair pathways in Müller glia.
The Aims of the proposal are 1) Subretinal transplantation of Crx+/Nfix+ and Crx+/Slc39a1+ progenitor cells in
Lca5gt/gt mice, and 2) Activation of endogenous Müller glial repair pathways by gene therapy in Lca5gt/gt mice.
In addition to these scientific contributions, this proposal outlines a structured, focused training plan that will
equip me with the skills and expertise that will serve as the foundation for my career in developing cell-based
therapies for retinal disease. The Department of Ophthalmology at the University of Pennsylvania is an ideal
environment for training physician scientists in ophthalmic research, and will provide the protected time,
resources, and mentorship needed for a successful transition to independence."
10896560,"Project Summary/Abstract
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a group of environmental toxins that has been linked to an increased risk
of heart disease, stroke, and cancer, as well as the development of metabolic syndromes such as obesity,
hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes. Metabolic diseases are characterized by both systemic and local
inflammation with adipose tissue, the primary site of PCB accumulation. Adipose tissue is comprised of many
cell types including adipocytes, adipose mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), endothelial cells, and immune cells
such as macrophages. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) play an integral role in regulating the inflammatory
state of adipose tissue and influencing adipocyte function. During the pathological expansion of adipose tissue,
adipocytes become inflamed beginning a cascade of immune cell activation starting with ATMs. The changing
adipocyte secretion profile polarizes the macrophages from an anti-inflammatory phenotype toward an
inflammatory phenotype and increases the infiltration of macrophage precursors into adipose tissue.
Furthermore, these inflammatory ATMs communicate with local adipocytes through the release of soluble factors
causing additional metabolic disruption and lipid accumulation in adipocytes. Despite the essential role of ATMs
in the regulation of adipocyte function and the known accumulation of PCBs in adipose tissue, little is known
about how PCBs affect adipose through ATMs. We have previously shown that PCB-exposed adipocytes have
decreased adiponectin and increased IL-8 secretion, two cytokines implicated in macrophage phenotype
switching. Additionally, we have shown that macrophages exposed to PCBs are polarized toward a more
inflammatory phenotype. The objective of this proposed research is to determine how PCBs alter adipocyte-
macrophage crosstalk to influence the development of endocrine and metabolic disruption. We hypothesize that
adipocyte-macrophage communication will be altered by PCB exposure resulting in functional changes for both
cell types. Our approach to testing this hypothesis is divided into two aims. In Aim 1, we will assess how PCB-
exposed adipocytes affect macrophage recruitment and polarization. In Aim 2, we will investigate how PCB-
exposed macrophages affect adipocyte phenotype and adipogenesis. Through the completion of these aims, we
will uncover the systems-level mechanisms by which PCBs contribute to adipose dysfunction and inflammation
through the disruption of adipocyte-macrophage crosstalk. More broadly, this fellowship will help me achieve my
goals of gaining experience in medicine, toxicology, bioengineering, and environmental chemistry to prepare for
a future career in treating and researching diseases impacted by endocrine-disrupting chemicals."

This proposal aims to explore the innovative potential of a new bacteria-specific “pro-photosensitizer” (pro-
PS) in combatting multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria found in open and chronic wounds. As antibiotic
resistance poses a growing threat to the already overburdened U.S. healthcare system, the search for non-
antibiotic treatments and combination therapies to address MDR microbes has become a top priority. We
recently showed robust and synergistic microbicidal activity by combining 405 nm blue light (BL) with
phytochemical carvacrol or thymol. The combinatory treatment killed MDR bacterial species commonly seen
in hospital-acquired infections as high as 7.0 CFU log10 within 30 min, including Acinetobacter baumannii
(Ab), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which was
demonstrated in planktonic culture and biofilms, both in vitro and in vivo, for standard strains and clinical
isolates, irrespective of antibiotic susceptibility. In this proposal, we will broaden the killing to the BL-
refractory family Enterobacterales such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp), which
are commonly responsible for hospital-acquired infections and often co-infecting with BL-susceptible
pathogens above. They are also listed as an urgent or serious threat by CDC. These species are not
sensitive to BL-mediated bactericides owing to their relatively low levels of biosynthetic porphyrins that act
as endogenous photosensitizers. To target this issue specifically, we will search for bacteria-specific
intermediates capable of increasing porphyrin biosynthesis exclusively in bacteria, thereby sensitizing the
BL-refractory pathogens to BL-medicated bactericides. The potential intermediate will undergo scrutiny for
its selectivity, safety, antibiotic potentiation, and efficacy in killing standard and clinical isolates of E. coli and
Kp in pairing BL. Moreover, the combinatory modality will be combined with red light and antibiotics to
address deep-seated infections. Possible resistance will be also assessed. Aim 2 will validate the
efficiency of the bacteria-specific phototherapy in eliminating superficial and deep-seated biofilms in open
wounds of ex vivo porcine skin and in mice. Due to the increased porphyrin production, the bacteria-
specific intermediate will be also evaluated for its potential as a novel theranostic agent capable of
enhancing killing and real-time detection of bacterial biofilm infections by a cellphone. Over the years,
numerous photosensitizers have been developed for photodynamic therapy (PDT), but none of them are
bacteria-specific. The discovery of a bacteria-specific pro-PS marks a paradigm shift in the treatment of
MDR pathogens, offering distinct advantages in terms of safety, specificity, and efficacy over conventional
PDT."

Abstract
This project will involve the successful completion of the purchasing, processing, and
testing of 48 meat and seafood samples per month. ID Epi will identify, collect and
process samples within the FDA's and NARMS time constraints. Three persons from ID
Epi are dedicated to timely collections and submissions.
The increase in and improved analysis of antimicrobial resistance data specific to
Louisiana, will be scrutinized for trends and relationships, used to better inform the
agency and the public, and studied to develop policies for mitigation and/or prevention.
These activities will demonstrate the importance of the state health department in
protecting and improving the public's health.
The addition of additional target organisms and improvement of laboratory techniques,
such as the extension of whole genome sequencing to additional organisms, will permit
higher quality information and increased ability to identify related cases or outbreaks in
the past, at present, and in the future. The program will facilitate coordination with FDA
and other agencies in investigations of outbreaks. The program will also provide quality
retail meat and seafood surveillance data the FDA NARMS program can use in addition
to other states' data. This increase in quality data can be used to influence policy
regarding antimicrobial use, resistance and trends in resistance."

Texas Southern University (TSU), the nation’s second largest HBCU, has been continuously supported by the
RCMI program for many years, and has significantly strengthened our research environment. In the last RCMI
funding cycle, we successfully developed and deployed three core facilities including Pharmacology, Molecular
Biology, and Environmental Toxicity. These advances have led to productive collaborations on projects including
new drug targets, new lead compounds, preclinical lead optimization, and formulation. However, there is an
unmet need to enhance our research resources and services to include study design, methodology development,
data management, specialized laboratory techniques (e.g., genome editing, animal work skills), instrument
utilization, and collaboration networks. In this renewal application, we propose to establish a Research
Infrastructure Core (RIC) in the Center for Biomedical and Minority Health Research (CBMHR) to support
research and pilot projects by providing these enhanced services (in addition to research infrastructure made
available through previous RCMI funding) to TSU and external users and to facilitate new collaborations in
biomedical research. The specific aims are: Support CBMHR research and pilot projects and provide services
to users to enhance quality and productivity of biomedical research (Aim 1); Develop and validate laboratory
techniques to support CBMHR research and pilot projects and provide trainings to internal and external users
(Aim 2); and Facilitate networking to increase collaborative research projects and grant applications (Aim 3).
We propose to form a faculty expert team, consultant team, and recruit skilled staff to support our users in six
areas in which we have great expertise and credibility. The involved personnel, including core director, co-
director, faculty expert team members, and consultants, will be experts in the key research areas. We also
propose to facilitate new collaborations with experts in other institutions to integrate research resources across
the Houston area. Additionally, we will integrate core information including fee structures into the CBMHR
website to promote our services. Innovations of this proposed RIC include novel research methodology
development, collaborative research projects and grant applications, and collaborative synergism. We expect
that this proposed RIC will significantly enhance TSU’s research capability in biomedical and minority health
research so that more competitive grant proposals can be submitted to different agencies (e.g., NIH) and more
faculty, especially junior faculty, will be successful in their academic career."

The primary goal of the Center for Biomedical and Minority Health Research (CBMHR) Investigator
Development Core (IDC) is to implement a pilot grant program to support preliminary studies of Early Stage
Investigators (ESIs) in conducting basic biomedical, behavioral, and/or clinical science research. Eligible ESIs
are TSU biomedical Assistant Professors, postdocs, and research scientists. Pilot project applicants are
strategically recruited from an existing ESI pool with a high percentage of under-represented minority
scientists, engaged by the CBMHR Administrative Core (ADC) and through multi-college advertisement.
Interested applicants will receive support in proposal development through mentorship, application webinars
and individual help in proposals. Each pilot project recipient is required to have mentors who have had
previous NIH/NSF funding and completed mentoring training conducted by the Gulf Coast Consortia for
Quantitative Biomedical Research (GCC). The IDC will support three pilot projects each year for five years.
Each pilot project award will be up to $50,000 to support awardee’s time and effort in the project, purchase
supplies, and travel to professional meetings. Each pilot project recipient must complete a variety of
professional and individual development activities including Individual Development Plan (IDP), attend
seminars, grant writing workshop, professional presentations, and provide evidence of progress in project and
professionally. We envision that all pilot project recipients will be well-trained and mentored to increase the
competitiveness of their research proposals. The IDC will be directed by the IDC Program Director, who will
report to Execute Leadership Team and Advisory Committee for continuous evaluation and improvement of the
core. The specific aims of IDC are to 1) solicit novel hypothesis-driven pilot project proposals, 2) select novel
hypothesis-driven pilot projects with high potential for development into future proposals for extramural funding,
3) implement a mentoring program to train ESIs in core competencies required for successful biomedical
research professions, and 4) establish mechanisms for ESI, project, and IDC program evaluation and
continuous improvement. The long-term goal of the IDC program is to increase TSU ESIs’ overall research
competitiveness in biomedical, behavioral, and/or clinical sciences in disease states that are disproportionately
affecting the minority population to become successful in obtaining extramural funding from the government
(e.g., the K- or R-series awards from NIH). The IDC’s approach is designed to collaborate with the other cores
in the CBMHR to provide seed funds and mentoring support for ESIs to generate preliminary data to apply for
extramural grants. Pilot project recipients will participate in career development activities at the ADC and have

Texas Southern University (TSU) has a long history of implementing community engagement outreach efforts
addressing health disparities through established partnerships and collaborations with healthcare systems,
Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), and community-based organizations (CBOs). However, these
efforts are siloed among faculty, staff, and student organizations thus depriving us and most importantly the
community, of the unique opportunity to leverage the strengths of all of our CBOs, FQHCs, and healthcare
system collaborators to effectively identify and address the health-related concerns of the Greater Houston
Community (GHC) Underrepresented Minorities (URMs) and increase URM research awareness and
participation.
We propose to develop a Community Engagement Core (CEC) within the Center for Biomedical Minority Health
Research (CBMHR) that will leverage TSU’s many longstanding partnerships and collaborations with CBOs,
healthcare systems, and FQHCs as well as its unique relationship with the URM community. The CEC will
develop innovative programs that will integrate existing yet siloed community engagement efforts across TSU.
We will identify the health-related concerns of GHC URMs through surveys conducted by our healthcare
systems, FQHC, and CBO partners as well as community individuals and CBO partners’ feedback. We will
address health concerns through health education seminars (topics based on health-related concerns of GHC
URMs) and also provide guidance for navigating the vast healthcare infrastructure (including available financial
assistance programs). Clinical research education forums aimed at building trust and reducing barriers to
participation in clinical trials among GHC URMs will be implemented in collaboration with our healthcare system
partners in the Texas Medical Center. We will also host research outcomes conferences to promote the
outcomes of TSU’s biomedical research endeavors in lay-language to facilitate the awareness of research
findings among the GHC URMs. Relevant information will be obtained through the concurrent development of
databases that will exist as an information “hub” for community resources consisting of up-to-date
comprehensive lists of all community-engagement outreaches and activities at TSU and our CBO partners as
well as comprehensive lists of community organizations and partners such as FQHCs, Healthcare systems,
Charity Clinics, Specialty Service Centers, Multi-service Community Centers, governmental and non-
governmental organizations, profit and non-profit organizations, as well as school districts serving the GHC URM.
We will use various social and mass media outlets to ensure awareness of CEC’s activity among the GHC.
The goals of CEC align with the mission, vision, and values of TSU with regards to collaboration, partnership,
community and engagement. Overall, we are convinced that the CEC will be very impactful in bridging the health
disparity gaps for URMs in GHC."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States among men and it is
more common in African American males. Despite initial good responses to androgen deprivation or anti-
androgen drugs, tumors invariably recur and develop into lethal castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Currently, the available therapeutic options for CRPC, including the gold standard chemotherapy docetaxel, have
only met with limited success. The 52 kDa FK506 binding protein (FKBP52) is a promising strategy for novel
targeted therapeutic development. MJC13 and GMC1, two first-in-class drugs that specifically inhibit FKBP52-
mediated potentiation of AR signaling, have been discovered by Dr. Cox at University of Texas at El Paso and
further developed by Dr. Xie at Texas Southern University. The exciting anti-tumor efficacy observed in CRPC
xenograft animal models encourage us to further develop novel targeted nano-drug delivery systems (NDDS)
that specifically deliver MJC13 and GMC1 to the tumor site then steadily release the drug to facilitate synergistic
effect with docetaxel to treat CRPC.
Our aims are to develop folic acid (FA)-conjugated NDDS of MJC13 and GMC1 for specific tumor targeting, high
efficacy and low off-target adverse reactions; to perform comprehensive in vivo pharmacokinetic and
pharmacodynamic evaluations on the optimal NDDS of MJC13 and GMC1; to investigate combination therapy
of MJC13 and GMC1 and docetaxel in comparison to the marketed anti-AR drug enzalutamide. We will use
various techniques, rats, tumor xenograft mouse models and genetically engineered mouse models to conduct
those experiments in collaboration with experts at TSU and other institutions.
This project will seek support and evaluation from the CBMHR Administrative Core, will heavily utilize the
Research Infrastructure Core to perform studies, and will disseminate the research findings from this project with
various TSU communities via support from our Community Engagement Core (CEC). It will further enhance
RCMI institutions’ prestige in the areas of biomedical and minority health research. The successful execution of
this research will result potential advanced treatment for CRPC patients."

The human brain requires continual oxygen delivery to meet its enormous metabolic demand, and suffers
devastating consequences when this oxygen supply is disrupted, as in stroke. While new endovascular
treatments have shown promise to improve cerebrovascular outcomes, they are hampered by the lack
of noninvasive biomarkers to stratify patients who are good candidates for these therapies. In particular,
imaging of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) is a long-
recognized but unmet need in the stroke community. This project develops novel, clinically feasible tools
for non-invasive oxygenation imaging, to study how the brain dynamically meets its oxygen needs and
identify key pathophysiology in neurological patients.
Our specific aims are (1) to enhance MRI-based reconstructions of OEF maps through novel “fingerprint
matching” to microvascular voxel simulations and validation with the [15O]-oxygen gas PET reference;
and (2) to develop a hybrid PET and MRI approach to rapidly image CMRO2 dynamics and its functional
networks during a single resting scan.
The novelty of this work lies in leveraging the unique capabilities of simultaneous PET/MRI scanners.
The use of a PET/MRI system to validate and augment MRI-only methods for clinical OEF assessment
with simultaneous PET scans is highly innovative. Hybrid measurements also allow for new, rapid CMRO2
imaging approaches that embody the best of each modality – fast and quantitative – to model brain
functional connectivity and disease. Success of this proposal will generate novel neuroimaging tools to
study brain oxygen consumption that are broadly applicable to any site with an MRI scanner. These
advancements will enable use of physiological imaging biomarkers to evaluate endovascular therapies
and reduce stroke risk, and enhance our fundamental neuroscience capabilities to understand the
vascular underpinnings of brain function."

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a major mechanism of posttranscriptional regulation that generates
distinct 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTR) on RNA transcripts from most human genes. Mechanistically, APA is
mainly regulated in trans through APA regulators and in cis by single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) enriched in
3′UTRs and downstream gene regions. Several reported examples indicate that APA can regulate the activity
of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. However, the upstream regulatory mechanism and downstream
function of APA in the cancer progression within clinical cohorts, particularly in prostate cancer, remains largely
uncharacterized. Prostate cancer presentation is frequently stratified into groups: highly treatable androgen-
dependent prostate cancer (ADPC), followed by the lethal castration-resistant prostate adenocarcinoma
(CRPC), and ultimately progressing to the most aggressive form, neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC).
While significant efforts have been made to characterize gene expression changes during prostate cancer
progression, a link between APA and prostate cancer progression has not previously been established. Our
preliminary studies found that 3′UTR lengths are significantly shortened in CRPC patients compared with
ADPC patients and are significantly lengthened in NEPC patients compared with CRPC patients. We further
found that APA factor-regulated genes with altered 3′UTRs can function as novel oncogenes for CRPC or
NEPC. Importantly, manipulating 3′UTR lengths of selected novel oncogenes by our developed 3′UTR
CRISPR-dCas13 Engineering System (3′UTRCES) generates distinct molecular outcomes, leading to
decreased prostate cancer growth in vitro and in vivo. We thus hypothesize that APA drives prostate cancer
progression and can potentially be reversed in a clinically meaningful manner. In Aim 1, we will identify APA
target genes during prostate cancer progression to castration resistance through multi-omics analyses in
prostate clinical samples and cell models. In Aim 2, we will develop a computational model, namely
MARS3'aQTL, to infer upstream APA regulators. In Aim 3, we will characterize the molecular regulations,
biological functions, and clinical relevance of inferred APA regulators and will use 3′UTRCES to precisely
interfere with APA of novel oncogenes. Our proposed studies' successful completion will establish APA as an
important targetable posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism, contributing to a more complete understanding
of prostate cancer progression."

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), the commonest type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), is highly
aggressive and despite antiretrovirals continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related death in persons living
with HIV. Notably, up to 90% of HIV-DLBCL are positive for the cancer-causing Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Thus,
understanding how EBV contributes to cancer is essential to discovering new therapeutic approaches.
Cancer cells require DNA repair but how EBV engages and reshapes cellular DNA repair is an underexplored
area. Our studies on EBV-cancer cells and EBV-transformed human B cells (lymphoblastoid cell lines), the latter
an important model of EBV-driven lymphomas in immunosuppressed hosts, converge on STAT3. An
oncoprotein, STAT3 is frequently activated in cancer. Several studies have also shown that EBV+ HIV-DLBCL
frequently exhibit activating mutations in the Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT3 pathway. We have found that EBV
activates STAT3 to circumvent the S phase checkpoint barrier, thereby ensuring cell proliferation but in the
process, loses homologous recombination (HR) that repairs DNA double strand breaks (DSB). As a result, EBV-
transformed and cancer cells become dependent on other forms of DNA repair, in particular, the error-prone
microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) type of repair. This creates a therapeutic vulnerability to synthetic
lethal agents that would otherwise be non-toxic to cells with intact HR. PARP [poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase]
inhibitors are among such synthetic lethal agents that target MMEJ. Indeed, we find that EBV-transformed and
cancer cells are highly susceptible to MMEJ inhibitors that target PARP and the MMEJ-specific DNA polymerase,
POLθ. Supporting this dependence on MMEJ, EBV-transformed cells exhibit genome-wide scars of MMEJ
repair, and, EBV+ HIV-DLBCL display higher abundance of STAT3 and POLQ transcripts compared to EBV-
tumors; POLQ encodes POLθ. Further, by multiomic analyses of several hundred cancer cell lines, we have
identified a STAT3-related gene expression signature that points to a mechanistic link between STAT3 and
reliance on MMEJ repair while predicting susceptibility to synthetic lethal therapies.
We now propose to investigate how EBV uses the JAK-STAT3 pathway to reshape DNA repair and render EBV+
HIV-DLBCL vulnerable to synthetic lethal therapeutic targeting. Using cell lines, xenografts, and patient-derived
EBV+ & EBV- HIV-DLBCL from the NCI AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource (ACSR), we investigate the link
between JAK-STAT3 pathway and DSB repair in EBV+ HIV-DLBCL (Aim 1) and synthetic-lethally exploit JAK-
STAT3-dependent DNA repair deficiency to kill EBV+ HIV-DLBCL (Aim 2).
These studies specifically address PAR-21-348 by identifying mechanisms and generating new paradigms to
reveal how EBV contributes to NHL. In the long-term, these mechanistic insights will uncover novel vulnerabilities
and enable the prediction of responses to synthetic lethal therapies to improve outcomes for EBV+ DLBCL in
persons living with HIV."

 The search for more effective treatment and prevention of tuberculosis has motivated the identification
genes that are essential for the growth and survival of the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb).
These genes are potential new targets for developing and attenuated live vaccines. For example, targeting
metabolite biosynthesis can prevent Mtb from making essential building blocks and generate auxotrophs that
induce protective immunity, but do not cause disease. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) biosynthesis has been proposed
as a drug target because putative biosynthetic genes have been shown as essential in multiple transposon
screens, but Mtb is assumed to be unattainable as a riboflavin auxotroph and depend entirely on de novo
synthesis in vivo because it lacks a homologue for a known bacterial riboflavin transporter. However, our
critical review of the literature along with our preliminary data on inducible knockdown strains for riboflavin
biosynthesis genes provide an opportunity to test our central hypothesis that Mtb takes up riboflavin via a
noncanonical transport mechanism. We will test this hypothesis by identifying metabolites and genes that
support Mtb growth when riboflavin biosynthesis is disrupted and determining whether riboflavin metabolites
are limiting for Mtb growth in the host. If our hypotheses are correct, we expect to identify novel aspects of Mtb
metabolite uptake and utilization and determine the feasibility of target riboflavin biosynthesis as drug targets in
vivo, with potential impcats for the study of metabolite transporters in other intracellular pathogens."
10878114,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The patterns of connectivity across the neural networks of the brain play a critical role in determining how
those networks function. However, the mechanisms through which the architecture of a circuit supports
information encoding or storage remain unclear. In addition, circuit-level activity patterns drive changes in the
strength of synapses across that circuit, which in turn necessarily alters how the circuit behaves. While
considerable work has elucidated many cellular and molecular components of synaptic plasticity, the precise
reciprocal interaction between in vivo activity patterns, synaptic plasticity, and circuit level function remains
unclear. The brain expresses several distinct types of internally generated sequences of neuronal activity
independent of external sensory stimuli, and such temporally precise, self-organized sequences play a crucial
role in information processing and memory formation/retrieval. Due to their independence from external inputs,
internally generated sequences serve as a powerful model to explore the fundamental relationship between the
connectome and network function. The hippocampus, a brain area critical for the formation of many types of
memory, generates a well-defined type of neuronal sequence, sharp-wave/ripple (SWR)-associated replay,
which is observed during “offline” states such as rest or sleep. The central objectives of this proposal are to
identify the in vivo connectome architecture of the hippocampal network, quantify how these connection
patterns regulate activity across the circuit during active “online” encoding and during “offline” SWR
sequences, measure how in vivo activity patterns across this neural network change the weights of synaptic
connections, and establish how those synaptic changes in turn impact circuit function. Supported by
considerable preliminary data, these ambitious aims will be achieved through a combination of ultra-high
density, large-scale in vivo electrophysiology followed by in-depth computational analysis of the resulting data,
and rapid in vivo optical labeling of active neural populations followed by ex vivo physiological quantification of
synaptic function. In Aim 1, we will directly test two models with differing predictions regarding the impact of
local hippocampal connectivity on place field distribution and activity patterns during SWRs. In Aim 2, we will
test the hypothesis that coordinated activity of synaptically connected neuron pairs during behavior (e.g.,
overlapping place fields) potentiates their synaptic connections, which in turn impacts the content of
subsequent SWRs. In Aim 3, we will directly quantify the synaptic consequences of in vivo activity via whole
cell electrophysiology performed in neurons which were either active or silent in an immediately prior
experience. Together, this study is expected to meaningfully advance our understanding of circuit-level brain
function by revealing the fundamental principles which allow precise patterns of activity to be dynamically
generated and propagated throughout the hippocampal network in support of learning."

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or congenital aganglionosis, results from defects in enteric neural crest cell
precursor (ENCC) development in a sex-biased manner. Through human genetic studies we have identified
and/or analyzed 35 genes and loci with multiple pathogenic alleles that explain ~62% of the population
attributable risk, with the greatest effects from mutations within the RET-EDNRB gene regulatory network
(GRN). In this proposal, we use our gene discoveries to conduct genomic, cellular and developmental analyses
in patients and mouse models, and investigate how genetic defects in RET and EDNRB signaling, and other
genetic defects, produce the cellular changes across development that can lead to aganglionosis. We propose
studies to improve HSCR risk prediction from patient genome sequence, advance the mechanistic
understanding of HSCR at the genetic and cellular levels, and identify the rate-limiting genetic steps suitable
for therapeutics. Our goals are to provide a genetic paradigm for uncovering the pathophysiology of a sex-
biased complex multifactorial disorder."

Since completing my K99, I have secured a faculty position at the University of New Mexico, where the work described on the R00 portion of the grant will be conducted.Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability and lost productivity, but we do not know its underlying causes, nor do we have adequate treatments. The development of more effective therapies will require a better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of antidepressants (AD). Newly generated (immature) neurons within the dentate gyrus (DG) have been linked to AD action in addition to their association with hippocampus-dependent cognition, pattern separation, social memory, and stress-induced anxiety. Increased numbers of newborn DG neurons are associated with improved hippocampal function, while decreased numbers are associated with impaired hippocampal function. Moreover, my recent publication showed that suppressing the excitability of newborn neurons without altering neuronal numbers leads to MDD-related phenotypes and abolishes AD effects. Conversely, enhancing the activity of immature neurons without altering neurogenesis is sufficient to alleviate the effects of unpredictable chronic mild stress (uCMS), a well-validated, widely used model of depression. Since immature neurons form synapses more readily, are more excitable, and have greater synaptic plasticity, understanding the complex effects of neurogenesis on behavior requires knowledge of the synaptic connectivity of these neurons, the level of DG activity, the information streams within the DG, and how the experience changes these properties. Thus, I propose to establish an input-defined circuit map of mature and immature DG neurons and to identify the changes in this map, together with activitydependent changes in transcription, in the context of AD treatment and uCMS. In Aim 1, I will establish a presynaptic input map of distinctly dorsal-ventral, mature, and immature DG neurons in everyday life by combining transgenic mouse technology with monosynaptic rabies virus retrograde tracing in the intact brain. Then, I will test the impact of AD treatment and chronic chemogenetic neuronal silencing on these anatomically identified circuits. In Aim 2, I will examine the effects of uCMS, which produces MDD-related behavioral phenotypes, with and without chronic AD treatment and with acute chemogenetic neuronal activation on DG circuitry. In both Aims, I also will examine synaptic, molecular, and behavioral changes and activity-dependent single-cell transcriptomics. By combining gene expression data and DG connectivity with behavioral phenotypes in the light of changes produced by uCMS, AD treatment, and chemogenetic manipulations, I will be able to construct a biologically relevant DG network model that can be used to test functional hypotheses, including dorsal-ventral DG dichotomy. Studying chronic AD treatment and acute/chronic chemogenetic manipulations also will be valuable for identifying signaling pathways underlying AD action, especially fast-acting ADs. Development of this DG network model will help to clarify the critical role of the DG and of neurogenesis in MDDrelated phenotypes and AD action."

There are currently 1.36 million melanoma survivors in the US, and this number is expected to increase to 1.92
million by 2030. Most melanoma patients (92%) survive 5 or more years but face an increased risk of new
primary melanoma. Although survivors are recommended to practice sun protection, sunburns remain common
among this population. The few sun protection interventions that target at-risk adults have had weak or mixed
effects on sun protection, despite often comprising multiple components. Mobile health (mHealth) approaches
to reducing unprotected sun exposure, which are highly acceptable among melanoma survivors, hold potential
for delivering actionable real-time information on sun protection and exposure but have not been designed to
account for sun protection in real time, and little is known about which mHealth components optimize effects on
unprotected sun exposure. Further, there is growing evidence to suggest moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (MVPA) decreases after melanoma diagnosis, potentially due to heightened concerns about spending
time outdoors (thus, decreasing opportunities for outdoor MVPA). Therefore, it is essential that sun protective
interventions do not unintentionally reduce MVPA, a health-enhancing behavior. However, few studies have
explored these relationships. Guided by the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework, the purpose
of this study is to refine and enhance our existing intervention tools in preparation for a fully-powered factorial
experiment to determine what intervention components optimally reduce unprotected sun exposure, and
determine their effects on MVPA. We build on technological and methodological foundations of our prior work,
including an alignment algorithm that combines information from an ultraviolet radiation (UVR) sensor,
actigraphy, and our validated end-of-day Minutes of Unprotected Sun Exposure (MUSE) self-report survey to
determine time spent outdoors, MVPA, and protection-adjusted UVR dose. In Aim 1, through user-centered
design, we will refine intervention tools, including a SESAME app that integrates a UVR sensor and simplified
MUSE survey to quickly assess real-time sun protection. In Aim 2, we will test the feasibility and acceptability
of promising intervention components and research trial procedures in preparation for a future clinical trial that
uses a highly efficient experimental strategy powered to detect effects of individual components on unprotected
sun exposure and accelerometer-measured MVPA. Components include: in-the-moment UVR alerts and UVR
feedback, sun protection monitoring and feedback, UVR weather reports, e-coaching, and action planning.
Findings will inform a fully-powered MOST factorial experiment with components that are effective and
acceptable by melanoma survivors. As an exploratory aim, we will evaluate the effects of each intervention
component on MVPA. Knowledge gained from this study will inform development of more effective,
implementable, and scalable interventions to reduce disease burden in this population."

 youth in Colombian school settings
PROJECT SUMMARY
 This study will investigate a multi-level approach that leverages innovative, culturally appropriate
technology-assisted methods to reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors (SIB) and promote mental health
among Colombian youth: (a) digital platform for youth; (b) digital platform for teachers; and (c) hybrid mental
health training diploma program for teachers. This approach will leverage school settings and technology-
assisted methods to reduce gaps in access to evidence-based suicide prevention interventions in a low- and
middle- income country. The open-access digital platform was developed through a co-design process with
Colombian youth to ensure that it was culturally appropriate, engaging, and easy to use. Key features of the
digital platform include mental health self-help tools, a customizable safety plan, links to online counseling
services, and gamification elements. The digital platform’s teacher interface will incorporate psychoeducation,
brief suicide-risk screening and decision support tools to enhance teacher capacity to assess risk for suicide
and refer youth to the appropriate level of services. The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment
(EPIS) framework, a broad multilevel, context-sensitive implementation science model, will guide the study. A
hybrid-type 1 implementation-effectiveness stepped wedge pilot trial design will allow for evaluation of the
digital platform and hybrid mental health teacher training program implemented within secondary schools in
Bogota, Colombia. Study aims are to:
 Aim 1. Conduct an initial needs assessment with key stakeholders (youth, teachers, caregivers, school
administrators) to identify implementation barriers and facilitators. A mixed methods evaluation will guide co-
creation of a tailored implementation blueprint prior to the implementation phase. User-centered design
methods will be used to refine the digital platform and incorporate end-user feedback into the final prototype.
 Aim 2. Evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, usability and preliminary effects of the digital platform
implemented within school settings (N=3) in reducing SIB and improving mood (e.g., anxiety/depression)
among Colombian youth aged 14-19 (N=150) via a mixed methods approach. Safety planning skills acquisition
(youth-level) and linkages to mental health services (service-level) will be assessed as mechanisms of change.
 Aim 3. Implement a multi-disciplinary capacity building model to strengthen behavioral health and
implementation science research, healthcare delivery capacity, and mental health policy. In partnership with
Pontificia Javeriana University, experts in suicide prevention, data science, and implementation science will be
engaged to build in-country research capacity at the individual and institutional level. Engaging with the Bogota
Mayor’s Office and community advisors will help to better disseminate research findings to key stakeholders."
10874746,"Project Summary
Brain stimulation has shown great therapeutic promise for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders. In
addition to advanced engineering tools, successful implementation of brain stimulation requires a comprehensive un-
derstanding of how this treatment drives changes in network dynamics and connectivity at a large scale and across
multiple brain areas. It also requires the design of controllers that can relate stimulation effects to behavior and function.
To achieve these goals, we will develop novel explainable machine learning models for psychiatric brain stimulation.
To do so, we put forward three overarching goals. First, we aim to learn biologically plausible and ﬂexible functional
connectivity models from electrocorticography (ECoG) data. Then, we plan to develop a computational model based
on a deep graph convolutional net to learn associations between ECoG data and network-scale connectivity. We will
then design a machine learning based guide for psychiatric brain stimulation. Finally, we will use our tools to under-
stand how the network evolves through time. To achieve these goals, the project brings together an interdisciplinary
team of investigators with unique expertise in artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning, computational and theoretical
neuroscience, network science and biostatistics, bioengineering and brain stimulation experiments, and interventional
psychiatric and neural engineering. The team will lead experimental and computational efforts that will produce ad-
vanced explainable machine learning solutions informed by brain stimulation experiments and utilize these tools to
design more efﬁcient and effective brain stimulation therapies."
10896316,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Every year, about 18 million babies are born from mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
While diabetic symptoms usually resolve after delivery, lasting complications can occur for both mother
and child, including fetal overgrowth, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases, and obesity.
While pathologically similar to type 2 diabetes, the rapidity of progression of GDM is unique to
pregnancy, and likely arises from placental dysfunction. Increased blood glucose availability in a
healthy pregnancy is vital for proper fetal development. A surge of placental hormones initiates a state
of mild insulin resistance, which, combined with beta-cell dysfunction, likely causes GDM. Currently,
effective treatments for GDM are limited or unsafe. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the
pathophysiology of GDM becomes essential to prevent GDM and design innovative, non-toxic, and
highly effective GDM treatments. Our research program aims to investigate GDM development by
studying for the first time the role of nutrient-dependent O-GlcNAcylation on placental endocrine
function. Directly dependent on plasma glucose levels, intracellular O-GlcNAcylation is a common
dynamic post-translational modification that impacts numerous signaling pathways and diseases.
Based on literature and preliminary data, we gathered that O-GlcNAcylation affects classical hormonal
secretion (in non-pregnant animals), is critical for placental physiology, and impairs insulin signaling.
Thus, we hypothesize that O-GlcNAcylation-dependent hormonal changes partly drive GDM. First, we
will define the involvement of O-GlcNAcylated protein in physiological placenta endocrine secretion
and, second, assess whether O-GlcNAc deregulations lead to GDM. We hope to propose novel
molecular targets and signaling pathways involved in placental physiology and disease and advance
the prevention and treatment of pregnancy metabolic diseases."

Every 5 minutes, a patient is denied an MRI scan because of an active implanted medical device. Therefore,
there is a clinical need to improve the safety of MRI scans to allow patients with implants to be imaged. Ability
to safely scan patients with implants would have an overall public health impact. If we can develop a safe
framework to be used to image these patients, we will be able to use MRI to monitor the stage of their diseases
and the efficacy of their treatment.
In this project we aim to develop a workflow that utilizes multi-channel and receiver arrays in order to safely
image patients with Deep Bran Stimulators (DBS). We will utilize a pre-scan strategy (accelerated by parallel
acquisition) to calculate RF current induced on DBS leads and predict electrode tip temperature. We are going
to calculate/design implant friendly excitation solutions/pTx pulses and utilize them to reduce RF heating
around the DBS electrodes. We will demonstrate the temperature reduction around the DBS leads using
fluoroscopic probes and evaluate image quality. We will test the performance of our approach by scanning
phantoms, anesthetized animals (swine) and human cadavers. We will finally scan human subjects implanted
with full DBS systems (electrode, extension, IPG) using the methods developed in this proposal."
10893466,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Until recently, life expectancy in the United States (US) had been increasing. However, in the past couple of
years, life expectancy at birth started to decline, following a period of stagnation. Underlying this trend are
increases in mortality rates in specific causes of death, with individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES)
being disproportionately affected. The specific causes of death for which mortality rates have increased include
poisoning, suicide, motor vehicle-related injuries, liver disease and cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus—all of which
are causally linked to alcohol use. Alcohol use has also been found to be associated with heightened mortality
risk among individuals with a low SES.
The proposed project will investigate the role of alcohol use in past and future trends in US life expectancy on
both the national and state level. Fifteen states have been selected for the state-level modeling based on
relevant characteristics (e.g., high mortality rates), covering all nine census divisions and more than 50% of the
population. Years of potential life lost (YLL) will serve as the primary outcome measure, as it is more closely
related to life expectancy per se than mortality rates. The project will I) investigate SES and race/ethnicity as
effect modifiers on the relationship between alcohol use and YLL using National Health Interview Survey data
linked to cause of death data; II) generate a microsimulation model of cause-specific alcohol-attributable YLL
by SES, race/ethnicity, age and sex (for years 2002-2017); and III) model gains in YLL for different alcohol
control intervention scenarios (for years 2018-2028). The microsimulation model will be based on data from the
National Vital Statistics System and Current Population Surveys for the demographic component, the exposure
component will be informed by data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related
Conditions and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. YLL from unintentional injuries, suicide, liver
disease and cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, hemorrhagic stroke and hypertensive heart
disease will be investigated among the adult (18+ years of age) general population of the US. Cause-specific
mortality risks related to alcohol use will account for effect modification by SES and race/ethnicity, if
appropriate. The effects of alcohol taxation, minimum unit pricing, regulation of the availability of alcohol and
screening and brief intervention on alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable mortality will be modeled
under different scenarios.
The findings of the proposed study will directly inform evidence-based alcohol control interventions with the
aim of reducing alcohol-attributable mortality, particularly among the most vulnerable groups of the US
population. Furthermore, the microsimulation model will have the potential to be expanded in the future in order
to include additional states, interventions and/or risk factors."

Studies examining the national landscape of college-going Hispanic students report these students more likely
to start their undergraduate studies at a community college. Yet, only 25% transfer; and a mere 3% obtain an
associate degree. Factors explaining these dismal numbers are: Hispanic students are more likely to be first in
their family to start college; and, students who “stop out” are less likely to return. High-impact educational
practices — such as undergraduate research, internships, and learning communities — have been proven to
support student transfer and degree completion. Given these challenges and opportunities, the proposed Bridges
to the Baccalaureate Research Training Program at EPCC-UTEP is well positioned to address these needs,
given The University of Texas at El Paso’s (UTEP) and El Paso Community College’s (EPCC) statuses as
majority-Hispanic institutions. Moreover, UTEP and EPCC have historically worked together to increase regional
student success, and are the only higher education institutions in the greater El Paso region of Far West Texas
with EPCC’s Rio Grande campus less than one mile away from UTEP. The training mission of the proposed
Bridges program is to develop a pool of diverse, research-oriented community college students who transition to
a 4-year institution, possess the requisite knowledge and skills to complete their baccalaureate degree, and
advance into graduate or professional school to position themselves for careers in biomedical research. The
overarching goal is to provide structured activities to prepare a diverse cohort of community college students
to transfer to and complete a bachelor's degree in biomedical research fields. To meet this overarching goal, the
aims and objectives are: Specific Aim 1: Develop a majority-UR pool of research-oriented undergraduates
who bridge from EPCC to UTEP with majors leading to biomedical careers. Objectives meeting this aim are: (1)
recruit and retain trainees from underrepresented groups who are full-time undergraduates at El Paso
Community College with an interest in biomedical careers; and (2) maintain a transfer rate of 90% of Bridges
trainees to baccalaureate degree programs in the biomedical sciences. Specific Aim 2: Develop a majority-UR
pool of well-trained biomedical scientists who have the necessary technical, operational, and professional skills
to advance in biomedical research careers. Objectives meeting this aim are: (1) create a sense of community
and belonging among Bridges trainees that builds confidence, belonging, and identity as researchers in
biomedical sciences; and (2) increase the percentage of transferred trainees who complete a baccalaureate
degree in the biomedical sciences. Expected outcomes of the proposed Bridges program are: 92% trainee
transfer rate; higher levels of retention and academic achievement at UTEP; increased sense of community and
belonging; increased awareness and educational aspirations of biomedical careers; and enhanced self-
identification as biomedical researchers or scientists."
10893473,"Abstract
Among the BRAIN Initiative’s most important achievements are the genetic identification of many new neurons- types and the creation of genetic tools to access these cell types. However, uncovering the functional roles of these neuron types and how they cooperate across brain areas to generate mammalian behavior remains an outstanding challenge. Thus, inventing ways to monitor how large populations of genetically identified neurons interact across multiple regions of the brain is crucial if we are to comprehend global brain dynamics. Today, electrical recording methods can track neural activity across multiple areas but cannot easily target neurons of specific types. Widefield and two-photon mesoscopes can image the dynamics of identified neuron-types across millimeter-scale regions of cortical tissue but cannot access the distributed sets of cortical and subcortical regions that comprise the major nodes of the brain’s sensory, cognitive, or motor circuits.  To clear this impasse, we invented the ‘Octopus’, a robotic imaging system with multiple articulated optical arms, each a two-photon microscope, that can be flexibly positioned around the brain to record neural activity concurrently in multiple superficial or deep areas of a head-restrained behaving rodent or primate. We designed, built, and tested an initial version of the Octopus with 4 arms, each of which has 5 mechanical degrees of freedom and a micro-optic probe at its tip for two-photon imaging. The design of the arms is based on ideas from surgical robotics and uses remote center-of-motion kinematics to provide a versatile repertoire of robotic arm movements. Using this system, a visual neuroscientist can concurrently image neural activity in the lateral geniculate nucleus, visual cortex, superior colliculus, and pulvinar, and a motor neurophysiologist can image activity in the motor cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, and motor thalamus.  In this project, we will enhance the optical and mechanical design of each Octopus arm and prepare the system for wide dissemination through open-source and commercial routes. Each arm will gain the optical functionality of a state-of-the-art, two-photon microscope for imaging large-scale neural ensemble activity. Specifically, each arm will incorporate optogenetics and allow dual-color two-photon imaging over an 800-µm- wide field of view. These capabilities will allow neuroscientists to monitor two genetically identified neuron- types in each of 4 brain areas, to perturb the dynamics of these cells with optogenetics, and to observe the effects of these manipulations on animal behavior and activity in the other 3 areas. We will also streamline the mechanical design to simplify the initial assembly of the Octopus for new users and to endow the robot arms with additional dexterity. The new design will also be motorized and will provide users with highly intuitive means of precisely steering the robot arms. Finally, to iteratively improve the performance and usability of the Octopus and to validate its readiness for dissemination as a groundbreaking new technology, we will work closely with 7 beta-tester labs to implement multi-area neural imaging studies in awake behaving mice and marmosets."
10893636,"Evolutionary dynamics of combinational antimicrobial treatments
Abstract
Due to over-prescription and misuse, antibiotics are losing their efficacy due to emergence
and rapid rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Of different types of antibiotics, β-lactams
have been prescribed to treat the majority of infections since the discovery of penicillin.
Since then, bacterial resistance to β-lactams, mediated by the production of extended
spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) enzymes, has become widespread. Using β-lactamase
(Bla) inhibitors can restore the efficacy of β-lactams against resistant bacteria, a strategy
which is necessary to preserve existing antibiotics in the face of declining investment in
new antibiotics. However, the effect of combination treatment on selection for β-lactam
resistance is not well understood. Since Bla production benefits both resistant cells and
growth-advantaged sensitive cells, and these benefits may be differentially impacted by
the introduction of Bla inhibitor, leading to non-intuitive evolutionary dynamics. Our
preliminary work suggests that the evolutionary impact of combination treatment depends
on three strain-specific factors: the extent to which producing cells are resistant to the
antibiotic at the individual cell level, the extent to which the inhibitor can suppress this
resistance, and the burden of Bla production. In particular, for Bla variants that offer a
greater degree of private benefit (for the producing cells), the combination treatment can
substantially select for the resistant fraction. However, for variants that primarily serve as
a public good, the combination treatment will be highly effective in selecting against the
resistant cells. Our proposed research will examine these evolutionary dynamics in depth
using a combination of mathematical modeling and quantitative experiments. In particular,
we will use engineered bacteria as well-controlled model systems to test the predicted
evolutionary dynamics. Then, we will test the predicted evolutionary dynamics by using
microbial communities consisting of both resistant pathogens and sensitive bacteria.
Insights learned from the proposed work have implications for guiding effective design of
combination treatments against β-lactam-resistant bacterial pathogens."

Visual impairment engenders mobility losses, debility, illness and premature mortality. These mobility losses
have been associated with unemployment rates that reach 80% globally and to severe compromises in quality
of life (QoL). In many cases, health and wellbeing are ‘attacked’ by vision loss in any form factor and psychosocial
barriers such as anxiety and depression are compounding influences that increase as deficits scale. The fear of
falling is a threat that contributes to this downward ‘spiral’ and often goes unchecked; this fear is alarmingly
justified, as visual impairment precipitates substantial increases in mechanical trips, falls and long-bone factures.
This perfect storm leaves considerable swaths of the population poor, disenfranchised, and experiencing
adverse health outcomes. These startling facts, although true in almost every high-income country, are even
more severe in low- and middle-income countries, such as Thailand. When considered at a basic functional level,
visual impairment destroys access to information about our three-dimensional world and the objects in it, leading
to poor spatial cognition and an inability to navigate successfully, whether that be to a place of employment or a
grocery store. Advanced wearables provide a potential solution to close this gap and provide consistent and
reliable access to the information needed for mobility and orientation during navigation. Our team was
instrumental in developing a novel wearable - VIS4ION (Visually Impaired Smart Service System for Spatial
Intelligence and Onboard Navigation), a personal mobility solution that serves as a customizable, human-in-the-
loop, sensing-to-feedback platform to deliver functional assistance in real-time. Our central hypothesis is that
wearables support spatial cognition in visually impaired (VI) populations, augmenting personal freedom and
agency, and promoting health and wellbeing. We seek to enhance this technology with next-generation mapping
and localization software fashioned into a microservice to support spatial cognition in the VI. We will assess the
performance of this new approach (e.g., mapping) as well as its impact on function (e.g., navigation efficiency),
health (e.g., falls), and wellness (e.g., QoL) metrics. The proposal has five aims in two phases focused on
validating this approach in a global setting. First, we will implement semantic segmentation and image-query-
based localization networks in a small Thai campus to operate independently of both environmental (sensor-
based) and Wi-Fi/cell infrastructure. We will then deploy this augmented platform with VI students. Third, we will
assess for acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility, focusing on experiences with VIS4ION. If milestones
are met for this first phase (R21), we will progress to the second phase (R33). Fourth, we will test the
effectiveness of the improved system over an extended-use period. Lastly, an additional urban area in Bangkok
will be selected and 3D environmental map built for generalizability testing, ensuring that VIS4ION is able to
handle multiple locations with disparate contextual elements. Given this foundation and planned advances, we
predict the platform will substantially mitigate fall and immobility risks and associated adverse health outcomes."

One of the great achievements in medical sciences is the improved survival rate among children diagnosed with
cancer. Although estimates indicate the 5-year survival rate of children diagnosed with a malignancy is near
80%, most of these individuals prior to the age of 40 demonstrate indices of physical limitation normally
associated with the elderly population. Among the treatments received by pediatric cancer patients is multimodal
fractionated x-ray irradiation and chemotherapy. Both induce genotoxic stress that eliminates proliferative cancer
cells; however, multifarious direct and indirect effects of radiation and chemotherapy can negatively impact
normal tissue growth and maintenance especially in actively growing populations. Phenotypes observed earlier
in pediatric cancer survivors is the accelerated onset of frailty indices such as neuromuscular decline. In a murine
model, we find weeks after image guided pediatric fractionated x-ray irradiation of hindlimbs reduced skeletal
muscle fiber size, impaired neuromuscular function, fibrosis, and activation of stress related p53 gene
expression. Among the p53 regulated genes elevated weeks after pediatric fractionated radiation is Growth
Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15), a regulator of food intake and body weight in response to stressors such as
cancer therapies. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) analysis revealed radiation induced GDF15
expression was restricted to muscle resident endothelial cells. Also, we identified a subpopulation of
neuromuscular junction associated muscle resident mesenchymal progenitor cells expressing the receptor
tyrosine kinase Ret that is implicated in mediating GDF15 activity. We find in our murine model of multimodal
pediatric cancer treatment and survivorship, deficits in body weight gain and exacerbation of neuromuscular
related phenotypes observed with fractionated radiation alone. Therefore, our long-term goal is to rigorously
characterize the mechanisms whereby treatment related GDF15 expression impacts neuromuscular related
phenotypes in our murine model of multimodal pediatric cancer therapy and survivorship. Ideally, such insight
would be used to uncover interventions to attenuate pediatric cancer treatment related neuromuscular decline
that increases morbidity and burdens survivors. To accomplish our objectives, we will utilize, assessment of
skeletal muscle integrity, neuromuscular function, imaging analysis, mouse genetics, scRNAseq analysis, flow
cytometry, gene expression analysis, pharmacological treatments, and measures of body weight and food intake.
The specific aims of this proposal are 1) determine if endothelial cell specific loss of p53 or GDF15 knockout
impacts pediatric cancer treatment related fibrosis and neuromuscular deficits, and 2) examine whether Ret
activity regulates pediatric cancer treatment related fibrosis and neuromuscular deficits."
10899057,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Confirmation bias refers to the tendency to interpret new information in a way that conforms to one's pre-existing
beliefs. It is associated with deficits in cognitive functions like working memory and error detection, both
commonly associated with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). As such, age-related changes to the PFC may leave
older adults vulnerable to this bias and its negative outcomes, including financial exploitation. Older adults are
disproportionately impacted by financial exploitation, and as cognitive decline progresses to mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, risk for fraud increases. Given these
connections, confirmation bias may serve as an indicator of cognitive decline and vulnerability to fraud; however,
progress towards understanding these relationships has been hampered by three main issues. First, little is
known about the latent processes shaping confirmation bias in older adults. Second, much of the work to date
has relied on correlations between brain responses and behavior, leaving the causal mechanisms unclear. Third,
behavioral changes over time in this population are underexplored. To address these concerns, this project has
two specific aims. The first is to characterize how age-related differences in cognitive function contribute to
susceptibility to confirmation bias. In an online study, participants will play an investment game involving the
opportunity to update an initial judgment after receiving feedback from a partner (Aim 1). We hypothesize that
older adults showing cognitive decline will exhibit confirmation bias at higher rates than younger adults,
characterized by greater bias towards initial judgments and decreased engagement with conflicting feedback
from the partner. Our second aim is to assess the causal relationship between confirmation bias and the PFC in
older adults using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS; Aim 2). By applying tACS to the PFC, we
will entrain individualized theta rhythms to enhance function across the region. Using the investment task from
Aim 1 concurrent with tACS, it is hypothesized that confirmation bias will be diminished in older adults, particularly
among those with MCI. Finally, to fully characterize the predictive role of confirmation bias, we will follow up with
participants after two years to assess the progression of cognitive decline. It is predicted that higher rates of
confirmation bias at visit one will be associated with greater cognitive decline at follow-up. The funding from this
grant will provide the applicant with the opportunity to learn essential new skills in computational modeling (Aims
1 & 2) and noninvasive brain stimulation (Aim 2). These objectives will be accomplished through a combination
of workshops, expert mentorship, and institutional training. Overall, this project will leverage training in well-
established and cutting-edge techniques to help expand the understanding of cognitive decline and provide
insight into causal links between PFC function and susceptibility to confirmation bias. More generally, it may
provide new insights into reducing older adults' susceptibility to the bias and their risk for financial exploitation."
10899107,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Type 1 diabetes is an exceptionally challenging disease to manage, requiring a host of complex behaviors to
manually regulate one’s blood glucose. Importantly, these disease management behaviors must be responsive
to the ever-changing needs of one’s day-to-day environment; thus, one’s diabetes management must be
fundamentally adaptive. While the psychological burden of diabetes is well documented, investigations into the
implications of psychosocial factors like mood, stress, and social relationships on blood glucose have tended to
focus on broad cross-sectional or between-person findings. However, research has failed to adequately
capture how these psychosocial factors impact blood glucose in real-time (e.g., day-to-day or hour-to-hour),
and thus have limited implications for interventions to reduce disease burden. The proposed research will
address this gap by combining ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) with continuous glucose monitoring
(CGM) data among 50 adults with type 1 diabetes. Participants will complete six brief surveys per day for
fourteen days, reporting on mood, diabetes-specific and overall stress, the quality of their social interactions,
self-care behaviors, food intake, energy expenditure, and insulin dosing. Given recent surges in CGM use,
blood glucose data will be downloaded from participants’ existing devices; the mean, coefficient of variation,
and time in, above, and below range will be calculated across the two hours following each EMA. Aim 1 will
identify links of mood, diabetes distress, and overall stress to blood glucose outcomes across the subsequent
two hours. It is hypothesized that negative mood and stress will lead to worse glucose outcomes, while positive
mood will lead to better glucose outcomes. For links that are supported, self-care will be investigated as a
potential mechanism underlying these relations. Aim 2 will examine the effects of conflictual and supportive
social interactions on blood glucose. It is hypothesized that conflictual interactions will lead to poor glucose
outcomes, while supportive interactions will lead to improved glucose outcomes. Again, self-care will be
investigated as a mediator for any observed links. Exploratory Aim 3 will investigate whether within-person
links of these psychosocial factors to blood glucose differ based on gender and overall relationship quality. It is
hypothesized that females will overall show stronger relations than males, and that higher quality relationships
will buffer against the negative effects of conflictual interactions. This research will contribute to our
understanding of the real-time barriers to diabetes care, paving the way for just-in-time interventions to improve
disease outcomes. In support of this project, the Principal Investigator will collaborate with a team of leaders in
the field. This mentorship team will facilitate additional training opportunities in the patient experience of
diabetes and CGM use, the endocrine functions underlying diabetes and blood glucose regulation, and the
quantitative methods required for dense CGM data. Ultimately, the training plan and proposed research will
enable the PI to establish her future career as a researcher at the intersection of diabetes and digital health."
10887266,"Project Summary/Abstract
A key tenet of the 4DN project is that nuclear functions (e.g., gene expression) is directly influenced by the spatial
organization of the genome, not only in relation to the 1D sequence distance between chromosomal regions but
also with respect to their three-dimensional spatial organization in the nucleus. While there has been substantial
progress in our understanding of the functional implications of the relative proximity of genomic loci in terms of
their three-dimensional spatial distance through sequencing-based (e.g., Hi-C) and imaging-based (e.g.,
Multiplexed FISH) omics data, the functional implications of the dynamic positioning of loci within the nuclear
topography (i.e., the volumetric mapping of loci with respect to the nuclear microenvironment) remains a more
challenging task. In particular, because systematic evaluation of the functional role of the nuclear topography in
health and disease requires the effective integration of sequencing-based and imaging-based omics data from
multiple different tissue types, biological statuses, conditions, and laboratories. This goal requires the
development of standardized nuclear reference coordinate systems in which spatial data from different sources,
often varying largely in nuclear shape, is first mapped against common nuclear landmarks and then integrated
into one Common Coordinate Framework (CCF). Here we propose to establish guidelines for the 4DN Nuclear
CCF and define methods for mapping the location of nuclear boundaries across different experimental systems
and assess the opportunity and feasibility of different experimental methods. We will produce benchmarking
Multiplexed FISH datasets to evaluate different nuclear boundary visualization approaches identified on the basis
of current user practices and will suggest methods that are minimally detrimental to the productivity of
experimental laboratories. Our proposal will expedite the development of a cross-consortium 4DN nuclear CCF
capable of univocally mapping the location of FISH Omics imaged target genomic segments with respect to the
NE, nuclear bodies, the center of the nucleus, and each other in a manner that can then be used to integrate
data across different experimental contexts and will allow incorporation in integrated predictive modeling
frameworks. In summary, by directly addressing the functional significance of nuclear topography on nuclear
function, a CCF would make 4DN-produced imaging data more valuable for computational scientists and for the
community at large."
10884646,"Project Summary
The presence of the 4 allele of APOE (APOE4) is the greatest genetic risk factor for late onset
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), increasing the risk approximately 12-fold when homozygous for APOE4
compared to the most common APOE3/APOE3 genotype. However, the mechanisms by which different
APOE alleles mediate Alzheimer’s risk are unclear. The overall goals for this study are to 1) Investigate
neutrophil activation and lifespan as therapeutic targets to reduce AD risk or progression in the context of
different APOE genotypes and 2) Identify microbial interactions that represent promising targets to reduce
neutrophilic inflammation in the context of different APOE genotypes. A multitude of data demonstrate that
individuals with different APOE genotypes vary in their responses to inflammatory stimuli, and ApoE-
modulated neuroinflammation is emerging as a potential new mediator of APOE genotype-specific
cognitive decline. We propose that the gastrointestinal (GI) and peripheral immune systems represent a
likely bridge between infection or microbial dysbiosis and neuroinflammation, and that neutrophils, as the
most abundant leukocyte with great potential for inflammatory damage, mediate altered responses in
individuals with different APOE alleles to drive neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Our hypothesis is
that APOE4 increases neutrophil activation and lifespan in the GI, periphery, and brain, thus contributing to
neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. This hypothesis is based on compelling evidence from published
work and our preliminary data. Studies have demonstrated that neutrophils infiltrate the brain vasculature
and parenchyma during AD and neutrophil activation in the periphery corresponds with disease
progression in AD. Our preliminary data suggests that APOE alters neutrophil activation in a genotype-
specific manner, as has been observed previously in glial cells. We will address our hypothesis and achieve
our study goals by pursuing the following three aims: 1) Investigate neutrophil lifespan, activation, and
functionality in the GI tract, periphery, and brain based on APOE genotype and age in mice expressing
human APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4 under the endogenous promotor (APOE-TR); 2) Investigate
microbiome changes longitudinally in APOE-TR mice and ApoE modulation of neutrophil responses to APOE
genotype-specific commensal bacteria and A; and 3) Investigate neutrophils as mechanistic drivers of
neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment in response to inflammatory stimuli in the context of different
APOE genotypes. This project is significant because no studies have investigated APOE-specific neutrophil
responses despite a proposed role for neutrophils in AD. This project is translationally innovative and
actionable because the information gained will inform the testing of neutrophil-targeted or microbial-targeted
therapeutic approaches in AD mouse models and humans and determine if they should be tailored based on
APOE genotype."
10884644,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Since 1958, public schools in the United States have used school resource officers (SROs) as a community-
based policing strategy to prevent school violence. However, recent evidence questions the effectiveness of
SRO programs and highlights their link to increased student discipline and arrests, particularly for marginalized
groups. Approximately 28 states have passed policy reforms to mitigate the potentially adverse effects of SRO
programs on student outcomes. Yet, no study has examined whether and how state SRO laws impact student
outcomes, SRO practices, and SRO policies at the local level. This proposed research project will address
these gaps by examining the impact and implementation of state SRO laws in schools with SRO programs.
Aim 1 focuses on assessing state-level variation in SRO policies, including their presence, scope, and
structure, by developing a longitudinal database on state-level SRO laws until 2024. Aim 2 investigates the
association between state SRO policies and disciplinary policies/outcomes in schools with SRO programs
using a nationally representative sample of US public schools with SRO programs. Aim 3 delves into the local-
level implementation of state SRO policies, exploring barriers and facilitators in school districts with SRO
programs. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with school administrators, staff, law enforcement, and
students to understand how SRO programs and policy reforms have been implemented among a diverse
representation of school districts across the US. Aim 4 focuses on the development and testing of a toolkit to
implement SRO policy reforms using findings from Aims 1-3. The acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility
of the toolkit will be evaluated with school districts. By examining the complex interplay between state-level
policies, district implementation, and disciplinary outcomes, this research addresses the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development's goal of improving child and adolescent health and transition to
adulthood through the promotion of positive community-level (i.e., school-level) interventions that prevent youth
violence, injury, and mortality. To strengthen my skills and complete this project, I identified three critical
training areas: 1) Implementation science, with a focus on educational policy and programming; 2) Program
and policy evaluation, with an emphasis on policy surveillance; 3) Qualitative research methodology, with an
emphasis on community-based participatory research. My mentorship team has substantive expertise in public
health, psychiatry, medicine, criminology, and education. Moreover, their methodological skillsets will
strengthen my training goals. The Pathway to Independence award will be my launch pad to become an
independent researcher who works with local school communities to design culturally competent,
interdisciplinary, and health-oriented violence prevention strategies."
10886730,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Osteoarthritis (OA) results from a combination of natural wear and tear associated with aging and/or unnatural
mechanical loading on the joint. Patients who suffer a joint injury (e.g., ligament damage) have increased risk for
early development of OA. Injury-related post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA) often occurs in younger patients.
PTOA and OA are both associated with articular cartilage erosion and other joint changes that cause pain and
loss in quality of life. The available treatments only provide temporary pain relief. However, alleviation of pain
only briefly masks the disease and does not halt or slow its progression. Progression of PTOA/OA to the point
where joint replacement becomes necessary is almost inevitable for large joints because there are currently no
disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) that can stop progression of or cure the disease.
Loss of cartilage associated with OA and PTOA is driven by local upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases
(MMPs). We propose that blocking the cartilage-degrading MMPs could stop the progression of PTOA/OA,
improve quality of life, and reduce the need for joint replacement in afflicted patients. Pharmaceutical companies
have previously tested drugs that can block the activity of MMPs, but these treatments have failed, primarily
because their lack of specificity and lack of delivery approaches that localize the drug to the affected joint.
We propose to develop intra-articularly injected bioadhesive nanoparticles for locally-retained delivery of short
interfering RNA (bioad-si-NPs). The bioad-si-NPs will potently and specifically “knock down” specific MMPs to
halt cartilage degradation in joints with OA or at risk of OA development (following injury). The mechanism of
siRNA enables these molecules to be selective for specific MMPs, and the bioad-si-NPs are designed to be
retained locally at the site of intra-articular delivery; both of these features contribute to our approach having
reduced risk of off target side effects. We will test bioad-si-NPs in animal models of both PTOA and spontaneous
OA and for inhibition of single or combinations of MMPs. In the setting of spontaneous OA, we will also test the
value of initiating treatment at early versus more advanced stages of disease.
This project is uniquely accessible through the interdisciplinary team with bioengineering expertise in intracellular
biologic drug delivery nanotechnologies and RNA chemistry (Duvall), OA biology and animals models (Hasty),
analysis of PTOA/OA animal model joint function/pain (Krug), and clinical care of OA patients (Crofford)."
10886732,"SUMMARY:
Over 60% of children experience severe stress and are exposed to traumatic events including interpersonal
violence, sexual abuse, accidents and injuries – adverse childhood experiences – but there is a mismatch
between their exposure to these experiences and the prevalence of subsequent psychopathology. This
mismatch, in which most children who experience traumatic events do not show psychopathology, may result
from resilience to the events, a lack of diagnosis, or forgetting about the experiences. Resilience to adverse
events involves responding with minimal distress or an early and effective return to normal levels of function.
Forgetting about traumatic events in the very young – referred to as infantile amnesia – has been associated
with critical periods in development involving the formation and strengthening of perineuronal nets surrounding
neurons in specific areas of the brain related to memory formation for highly stressful events. Disrupting these
perineuronal nets may extend or renew critical periods and help allow the memory of adverse experiences to be
erased. Using a new model of hyperarousal in young rats to model adverse childhood experiences, we will
determine the ontogeny, mechanisms, and treatment of hyperarousal. Our overarching goal is to understand
the hyperarousal that results from stressful events. We will test the hypothesis that resilience to and forgetting
about learning-induced hyperarousal is a function of perineuronal nets that form and strengthen during
development around neurons in the circuits underlying associative learning. To test this hypothesis, we focus
on three specific aims: (1) Characterize the ontogeny of hyperarousal and determine the underlying neural
mechanisms, (2) Determine behavioral strategies to “treat” or mitigate hyperarousal in young rats and delineate
the neural mechanisms involved, and (3) Determine the role of perineuronal nets in hyperarousal and its
treatment. We will conduct a series of experiments in which we characterize hyperarousal in young rats,
determine treatments, and then manipulate perineuronal nets before acquisition or extinction of aversive
associative learning to determine whether we can manipulate critical periods to impair the development or
facilitate the forgetting of hyperarousal as well as the conditioned emotional responding to cues associated with
adverse events. The proposed experiments constitute a concerted effort to fill an important gap in our
understanding of the developmental trajectory of hyperarousal that occurs in children following adverse events
– an area of growing concern as the incidence of interpersonal violence, accidents and injuries to children
continues to escalate both in the United States and abroad. We will focus on mechanistic studies that reveal the
underlying neural processes, the role of perineuronal nets, and elucidate age-specific behavioral and
pharmacological treatment strategies."
10886733,"A Multi-Omics Approach to Examine Symptoms and Medication Adherence in Women with Breast
Cancer
Breast cancer is most prevalent in postmenopausal women, and 3.4 million U.S. women are survivors. Most
women with breast cancer are postmenopausal at the time of diagnosis, and at least 70% of tumors are
hormone receptor positive (HR+). Aromatase inhibitors effectively prevent BC recurrence, and current standard
includes adjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in a once daily standard dose regimen for a minimum of five
years. However, AI adherence is a significant problem. Up to one third of women do not fill their initial AI
prescription, adherence to AIs averaged 48% in the first year, and adherence decreases in subsequent 2-5
years. AI-attributed symptoms are the leading reason for not adhering to AI regimens and a major barrier to AI
adherence. Moreover, AI-related symptom type and severity are highly variable among women. The source of
symptom variability is unknown. The etiology of symptoms experienced during AI therapy may have biological
underpinnings, yet little is known about factors in AI (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane) absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) pathways and the resulting symptoms. Symptoms and
adherence, especially their relationship to each other, have not been well-characterized temporally. Further,
potential biologic mechanisms related to AI absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) for
AIs have not been fully characterized.
The dissertation project (F99) will examine temporal patterns of AI symptoms and adherence and their
relationship over the first 18 months of AI therapy. It will also explore the role of genotypic (ADME) and
phenotypic factors in symptoms experienced and AI adherence. The postdoctoral project (K00 phase) will
incorporate two additional molecular methods—microbiomics and exosomics. They will be described and their
potential role in AI symptoms experienced and adherence will be explored.
The purpose of the proposed F99/K00 training and research is to utilize a biobehavioral, multi-omics approach
to gain a deeper understanding of the complex web of AI symptoms and adherence, including the temporal
variability among women and the interplay between symptoms and adherence. It will provide insight into
potential biological mechanisms by describing molecular and phenotypic characteristics associated with
symptoms and adherence. Ultimately, this research will inform future symptom management and adherence
interventions and their timing."

The Emerging Global Leader Award (K43) aims to advance the career development and research activities
of Dr. Omamuyovwi Ijomone, a Senior Lecturer/Researcher at the Federal University of Technology, Akure,
Nigeria. Dr. Ijomone’s overall research goal is to contribute novel information to understanding the
mechanisms of neuronal degeneration. Particularly, he aims to understand how the brain is affected by an
interplay of genetic and environmental factors that trigger neuronal death at critical stages of development.
Neurodevelopmental disorders are diverse conditions resulting from aberrant brain development. Autism
spectrum disorder (ASD), amongst other conditions, falls in this category. The etiology of these diseases is
not fully understood; however, it involves gene-environmental interplay. Environmental overexposure to
heavy metals, specifically nickel (Ni) and manganese (Mn), have been linked to ASD pathogenesis. During
this program, Dr. Ijomone’s research will pioneer the use of the innovative Caenorhabditis elegans model in
the Nigerian biomedical research community, to investigate the role of ASD risk genes, NRXN and NLGN,
in morphological, behavioral, and molecular alterations caused by developmental Ni and Mn exposures. His
research approach will build on gene expression and genetic analysis methodological toolkit to specifically:
1) investigate the role of NRXN and NLGN in neurodevelopmental deficits of Ni and Mn exposures; and 2)
elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental deficits of Ni and Mn exposures upon
NRXN and NLGN mutations. Dr. Ijomone’s career development goals for this program are to: 1) build on
existing, and acquire new knowledge and skills to effectively design and tests hypothesis-driven
translational research ideas; 2) improve grantsmanship and manuscript writing skills, as well as improve
skills for effective communication of scientific findings to policymakers and the general public; and 3)
contribute to the scientific platform in Nigeria and build local research capacity. Dr. Ijomone will undertake
this program under the collaborative mentorship of Prof. Michael Aschner (USA mentor), Prof. Ganiyu Oboh
(Nigeria mentor), and Prof. Herbert Lachman (Co-mentor, USA). Prof. Aschner is a leading
neurotoxicologist with research interest in genetic and environmental interplay during CNS development
and senescence. Prof. Oboh is a top Nigerian researcher with expertise that include toxicology and
neuroprotection. Prof. Lachman is physician and behavioral geneticist interested in the molecular and
genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD. Prof. Janis Weeks (USA), a Professor
Emerita with extensive experience in using the C. elegans model for translational research will provide
additional guidance. Dr. Ijomone will use the K43 award in a structured research and training program to
enable him to develop into a fully independent investigator and a scientific leader.

and hematology/oncology. He is ABIM board-certified in medical oncology. This application describes a 5-
year career development program that will provide the PI a mentored educational experience with the aim of
developing new scientific expertise in tumor immunology, molecular profiling, high-dimensional analysis,
computational biology, and mouse models of human lung cancer. At the conclusion of the award period, the PI
will have acquired the skills necessary to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator in an
academic medical center studying lung cancer immunobiology and immunotherapy and caring for patients with
thoracic malignancies. This research project will capitalize on the expertise and environment of Washington
University in St. Louis, which has a long-track record of developing and supporting physician-scientists. Dr.
David DeNardo will mentor the PI’s scientific and career development. Dr. DeNardo's work is responsible our
critical understanding of how the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancer leads to impaired immune
surveillance and his work has led to several clinical trials on improving immune-based therapies in pancreatic
cancer. An advisory committee of scientists will provide additional scientific and career guidance. Lung cancer
is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Immune checkpoint inhibition, though
revolutionary, is beneficial for a subset of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Unfortunately, the responses are often not durable with nearly 80% of those diagnosed with advanced stage
NSCLC succumbing to their disease within 5 years of diagnosis. The tissue microenvironment of human
NSCLC is characterized by a dense stromal network. Our laboratory has demonstrated that CAFs can impair
response to anti-tumor immunity in pancreatic cancer as well as in models of NSCLC. We have found that
targeting fibrosis via TGFbR inhibition can improve responses to immune checkpoint inhibition but only in the
setting of chemotherapy. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that fibrosis impairs both T-cell priming
and antigen trafficking/presentation and these are restored when TGFbR inhibition is combined with
chemotherapy and immunotherapy. For these studies, we will utilize a genetically engineered mouse model of
human lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of NSCLC, which expresses ovalbumin, which will
enable us to assess immune responses. The identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which
TGFbR inhibition restores anti-tumor immunity when combined with chemotherapy and immunotherapy has
clinically relevant implications with respect to the development of novel immunotherapy strategies for patients
with NSCLC."
10885700,"Project Summary/Abstract
Age-related neurodegenerative diseases are a class of incurable diseases that result in the progressive
degeneration of neuronal cells. Mitochondria are essential cellular organelles that are key sources of
ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria contain their own DNA and protein synthesis
machinery, yet 99% of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA and must be imported into
the mitochondria. Mitochondria are dynamic in both their composition and structure, forming dynamic
tubular networks through fission and fusion reactions. In neurodegenerative disorders such as
Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease, there is a phenomenon known as mitochondrial
fragmentation, in which the normal, elongated shape of mitochondria becomes disrupted and they
instead take on a more fragmented, round appearance. How mitochondrial fragmentation leads to
mitochondrial dysfunction is unknown, but it is important to understand as inhibition of mitochondrial
fragmentation has been found to be protective in disease models of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and
Huntington’s disease. We propose a novel hypothesis that stable localization of nuclear-encoded
mitochondrial mRNAs to the mitochondrial surface and co-translational targeting of proteins to
individual mitochondrial fragments leads to heterogeneity in the expression of mitochondrial proteins
across mitochondrial fragments driving mitochondrial dysfunction. This proposal seeks to establish
basic principles of this hypothesis. To accomplish this, we will (Aim1) quantify the heterogeneity of
protein expression across different mitochondrial morphologies driven by human disease inducing
proteins Aβ42 and Htt103Q. Secondly, we will (Aim2) test the impact of mRNA localization and co-
translation mitochondrial protein insertion on protein heterogeneity and mitochondrial dysfunction.
Finally, we will (Aim3) establish tools for exploring this question in mammalian models by exploring
mitochondrial mRNA localization and protein heterogeneity in mammalian cells. In the short term our
goal is to establish a new model that explains how mitochondria become dysfunctional across different
mitochondrial morphologies. In the long term we will build on these discoveries by conducting further
investigations using mammalian models of neurodegeneration."

drugs promptly. We have a critical need to advance implementation strategies to optimize system
responsiveness to these emerging issues. COVID-19 has increased the urgency for implementation science to
facilitate rapid, equitable responses using existing treatment and prevention efforts. Tier 1 evidence-based
interventions (EBIs), such as the Michigan Model for HealthTM (MMH) lend themselves to addressing emerging
trends. Our overall objectives are to 1) Improve the responsiveness of school-based EBIs in addressing urgent
issues and 2) Find ways to support teachers in implementing updated EBIs, attending to unique considerations
of low-resource schools. We will use After Action Review (AAR), to guide the systematic design of RAPD,
Rapid Adaptation to Prevent Drug use, a novel bundle of implementation strategies. AAR is a reflective
process focused on improving public health systems’ rapid response capacity. Key phases of AAR include: 1)
Objective observation; 2) Analyze gaps/best practices, 3) Identify and test suitable implementation strategies to
improve responsiveness to the next event (e.g., COVID-related drug use escalation). Sustainable strategies
are central to achieving our objectives. Thus, we will also conduct a preliminary stakeholder-focused cost
analysis. The rationale for this research is that designing and testing RAPD will enhance schools’ capacity to
respond to urgent drug issues sustainably, and provide up-to-date, relevant resources for effective and
equitable prevention. The proposed research will address the following aims: Aim 1: Identify implementation
gaps and best practices in responding to urgent drug use events. We will use AAR to review the statewide
response to the vaping crisis using the MMH using rapid qualitative analysis and identify gaps to be addressed
with RAPD. Aim 2: Design and pilot test RAPD implementation and effectiveness. We will design a RAPD to
optimize responses to urgent drug use events and pilot test in schools serving low-income students to assess
equity. We will assess implementation outcomes using a convergent mixed methods design, and effectiveness
via a group RCT comparing RAPD and standard MMH implementation. Aim 3: Assess costs and benefits of
RAPD from multiple stakeholder perspectives. We will use an exploratory sequential mixed methods design to
understand and identify key costs and outcomes from key stakeholder perspectives. We will develop a costing
guide and conduct a preliminary cost analysis to inform an economic evaluation for a larger trial. The proposed
research is innovative because to date implementation strategies have not been designed to support systems
in responding to changing public health trends with attention to equity. In addition, this study focuses on
implementation strategies to reduce the health impact of emerging drugs and provide an infrastructure to make
future adaptations that can be applied in other contexts. The proposed research is significant because it will
advance applying implementation science to achieve access, cost and equity for drug use prevention."
10887427,"This proposal requests support for 8 Ph.D. students in the Carcinogenesis Training Program at Northwestern
University (NU), currently entering year 35. We aim to equip a diverse, exceptionally qualified cohort of pre-
doctoral trainees with the necessary conceptual foundation, laboratory experience and operational skills to
successfully navigate their future careers. The program provides a platform for interactions among students and
faculty in the Cancer Biology Cluster, one of nine intercampus “Research Clusters” in NU’s Life and Biomedical
Sciences (NULABS) Programs. Through mentorship by a diverse, well-qualified and engaged preceptor team,
trainee objectives are to a) elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving tumor growth and progression through
rigorous, interdisciplinary investigation supported by a cancer curriculum, b) gain an understanding of how these
basic science discoveries are translated into clinical practice, and c) acquire collaborative and leadership skills
necessary to develop successful careers in academia, industry, and other cancer research-related career paths.
Dr. Kathleen Green serves as the T32 PI and co-director of the Cancer Biology Cluster, the primary source of
students for 38 preceptors representing 16 departments/divisions. Preceptors are supported by $32.8M in
funding and bring training expertise in four cross-cutting focus areas: 1) Cancer Epigenetics and Nuclear
Dynamics, 2) Membranes, Organelles and Metabolism, 3) Tumor Environment and Metastasis and 4) Physical
Sciences and Therapeutics. After completing two years of tailored coursework students are appointed to the
training grant through a rigorous, competitive evaluation and interview. T32-specific Research-in-Progress
meetings, career development presentations, and continuous training in the responsible conduct of research and
rigor and reproducibility accompany 3-4 years of thesis research. Over its 34-year duration the program has a
94% retention rate among its 158 trainees (inclusive of 15 still in training). Of 135 T32 Ph.D. graduates 81% went
into academic/industry research, largely in cancer biology. During the past 10 years, students published on
average five papers with a current impact factor (2020-2021) of 14.87. A total of 44% of current trainees are from
underrepresented groups. In the next funding cycle, we will expand the scope of student-organized innovative
Nanocourses that allow flexibility in introducing cutting edge concepts; introduce round tables to promote
interdisciplinary communication and collaboration skills; promote training in diversity and inclusion with guidance
from our Diversity and Inclusion Committee; enhance trainee outcomes by augmenting and providing training for
mentors; improve program evaluation through systematic use of RedCAP surveys, Internal and External
Advisory Committees and student Focus Groups. The Carcinogenesis T32 has broad institutional support
reflected by commitments from The Graduate School and the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of
an additional two positions per year. Continued NIH support of the Carcinogenesis T32 will be critical as NU
enters its next growth phase of recruitment into a new medical research tower that opened in 2019."
10887559,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K23 proposal aims to develop and evaluate applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to the diagnostic
investigation of infectious keratitis, a major cause of blindness worldwide. This will be accomplished through
three specific aims: 1) Develop and evaluate an AI model to identify the etiology of culture-proven infectious
keratitis from an existing database of clinical photographs; 2) Externally validate model performance in a real-
world, population-based sample of corneal ulcers; and 3) Develop and evaluate an additional AI model for
automated microscopic diagnosis of fungal keratitis. The AI model developed in SA#1 will be trained using a
clinical photography database (the Culture Positive Ulcer Database) collated from several NIH funded clinical
trials for infectious keratitis (SCUT, MUTT I & II, CLAIR, and MALIN) conducted over the past several decades
as part of the international collaboration between the Francis I. Proctor Foundation and Aravind Eye Hospital in
India. This model's performance will be compared against human experts on culture-proven cases of infectious
keratitis. A second repository of imaging and clinical data from corneal ulcers (the MADURAI database)
currently in development will be used to externally validate the AI model developed in SA#1 (by estimating its
sensitivity and specificity in a real-world sample) and to train the AI model in SA#3. To accomplish these
research goals, we have established an international collaboration between the Casey Eye Institute, the
Proctor Foundation, and Aravind. This provides an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the expertise of my
mentors at Casey in artificial intelligence and computer vision-enabled diagnosis of ophthalmic diseases, the
expertise of the world-class faculty at Proctor in epidemiology, biostatistics, and infectious keratitis, and the
unparalleled volume of infectious keratitis and infrastructure for data collection at Aravind. This collaboration
will facilitate the development of carefully designed and validated AI models which will guide earlier directed
antimicrobial therapy and improve visual outcomes in infectious keratitis.
My primary career goals are to establish myself as an independent clinician scientist performing research at
the interface of technological innovation and international public health. My MPH, medical training, and
research experience have allowed me to develop a strong foundation in public health, the clinical and surgical
management of corneal infections, and medical informatics. Over the past nine months of K12 support I have
begun developing expertise in machine learning and data science, establishing a foundation which I will build
upon during this K23 award period. The successful application of AI to health care problems requires a
multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, AI methodologists, informaticists, and public health experts. This
K23 will allow me to build skills and expertise in each of these disciplines and become well positioned to lead
this movement in the coming years."
10875547,"Americans increasingly believe cannabis to be a harmless substance with therapeutic benefits; cannabis is
increasingly legal in the U.S.; a burgeoning industry has introduced novel, high potency products; and the
prevalence of use and cannabis use disorder (CUD) has increased. The scientific and public health communities
have struggled to keep pace in determining the impact of this changing cannabis landscape. An important barrier
to progress is the lack of an adequate measure of cannabis consumption. Unlike measures of alcohol use that
can discriminate high and low risk drinking patterns, current cannabis measures are inadequate to investigate
cannabis risks and benefits, the impact of policy changes, and the outcomes of clinical trials. Developing valid
measures faces challenges, e.g., estimation of quantity; data collection from sufficiently large and diverse
samples for validation. Leveraging our expertise in cannabis research, measure development, and social media
survey methods, we propose to address these challenges via a rigorous mixed-methods study to develop and
test a family of measures of cannabis exposure: The Cannabis Exposure Inventory (CEI; timeframe, past 30
days), a short form (CEI-S), and a daily form (CEI-D; timeframe, last 24 hours). Aim 1: Prepare initial CEI. Our
expert team will assemble and program an initial version of the CEI using novel items and images to estimate
use. Through cognitive interviewing and a preliminary test-retest study, we will examine how users understand
the items and response categories, and iteratively adjust the CEI. Aim 2: Initial examination of CEI validity. We
will administer an on-line survey with the CEI, validators (e.g., CUD severity) and covariates to 3,000 cannabis
users using well-tested social media survey methods and research panels. Analyses will assess associations
between the different exposure item domains (construct validity) and identify the combination of items most
associated with external validators (convergent validity) to inform further refinement of the CEI. A definitive test-
retest substudy (n=600) will indicate reliability. Aim 3: Confirm CEI validity in a large sample of current users;
develop the CEI-S. We will administer the CEI to 12,000 users to confirm construct and convergent validity,
overall and across major subgroups (e.g., gender, race/ethnicity). We will derive the CEI-S for use in studies
where time does not permit the full CEI. We will conduct a biological validation substudy with n=150 participants,
examining THCCOOH. Aim 4: Prepare and validate the CEI-D. We will create the CEI-D, adjusting the CEI-S
timeframe to the prior 24 hours for use as a daily measure, and examine its validity in a subsample from Aim 3
(n=400). They will complete the CEI-S, then complete the CEI-D, functioning, and mood items for 30 days on a
mobile device. Consistent with FDA guidelines on demonstrating validity of outcome measures, we will test how
CEI-D scores, functioning and mood covary over time. Accomplishing these aims will provide the field with a set
of greatly improved measures of cannabis use that will enhance clinical and epidemiologic research, and lead to
more informed communication about cannabis to clinicians, health educators and policy makers."
10875653,"Project Summary
Constitutively active somatic mutations in the estrogen receptor (ER) ligand binding domain (LBD) have emerged
as a frequent mechanism of endocrine therapy resistance in patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancers.
Unfortunately, there are no therapeutic agents to address this patient population. The long-term goal is to develop
therapeutically useful irreversible ER inhibitors for the treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer, which will
create therapy options for individuals who have failed or relapsed on current therapies. The overall objective is
to identify template-based irreversible ER inhibitors that can bind to the ER with high affinity and form an
irreversible covalent C-S bond with the C530 amino acid residue in the ER LBD. The central hypothesis is that a
pharmaceutically optimized irreversible ER inhibitor can be obtained by incorporating clinically proven ER-
binding motifs and a covalent-bond forming Michael addition moiety in the molecules. This hypothesis is
supported by early triphenylethylene-based irreversible ER antagonists exhibiting uterotrophic effects similar to
tamoxifen, and prototype compounds from our laboratory with thiophene (Raloxifene-like) core demonstrating
lack of such effect but equally potent antagonism in the breast. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing
three specific aims: 1) Design and synthesis of irreversible ER inhibitors; 2) Determine the impact of the
irreversible ER inhibitors on proliferation in breast cancer cells, and 3) Evaluate in vivo pharmacodynamics and
anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy of novel irreversible ER inhibitors. Under the first aim, irreversible ER binding
inhibitors will be synthesized using cores motifs: triphenylethylenes (tamoxifen-like) and benzothiophenes
(raloxifene-like) and are expected to be highly selective, potent, and to exert permanent antagonism. Under aim
two, the synthesized compounds will be evaluated in their ability to form a covalent bond with ER C530 and
inhibit the growth of breast cancer cells. For the third aim, the lead agent from each structural motif group will
be identified for further preclinical studies and efficacy in patient-derived xenograft breast tumor models. The
research here is innovative because it focuses on the use of irreversible inhibitors to overcome endocrine resistance
and incorporates novel moieties to achieve high drug exposure. This contribution is significant because it will
identify a class of irreversible ER inhibitors that display novel antiestrogenic effects, lacks agonist activities, and
has high oral bioavailability, offering new opportunities for the development of innovative therapies to treat breast
cancer."

The mission of the UCLA Cell and Molecular Biology (CMB) Training Program, currently in its 46th year, is to
provide essential training for the next generation of PhDs in the developing fields of genomics, proteomics,
systems biology, quantitative and structural biology, stem cell biology, and bioinformatics so that they are poised
for successful careers in the biosciences. In addition, the CMB provides students with operational and
professional skills training in an inclusive, collaborative, and supportive environment. The CMB Training Program
brings together students and faculty from the life sciences and physical sciences who share a common interest
in cellular and molecular biology but whose interactions might otherwise be limited. The 37 faculty that will
participate in the CMB Training Program are drawn from nine departments that span the UCLA School of
Medicine and the UCLA College. These training faculty are passionate about using cutting-edge multidisciplinary
approaches to tackle complex biological questions at the cellular and molecular level. The proximity of research
buildings and university-supported state-of-the-art shared resources, along with the collaborative spirit that
defines biomedical research at UCLA, facilitate cross-discipline interactions and foster interdisciplinary research
studies. This environment provides trainees a unique opportunity to obtain broad foundational training in modern
cell and molecular biology. CMB trainees are drawn from four PhD graduate programs: the Molecular Biology
Interdepartmental Program; Neuroscience; Biochemistry, Molecular & Structural Biology; and Chemistry. Each
year, the CMB Training Program will recruit 12 new students to a two-year program, which will be inclusive of
students from underrepresented groups in the sciences. As part of the CMB training plan, CMB trainees must
take four foundational courses that were designed specifically for training in modern cellular and molecular
biology research. The objectives of these courses are to train students to develop technical, operational, and
professional skills that will prepare them for biomedical careers including: a broad understanding of the cell and
molecular biology field and the pressing questions and modern approaches used to address them; rigorous
experimental design skills; statistical skills for data analysis; analytical and critical thinking skills; oral and written
communication skills; resilience skills; and an understanding of how to conduct safe and ethical research studies.
Through a CMB career development course, trainees are also exposed to broad biomedical careers and acquire
knowledge on how to prepare and apply for these professions. The CMB Training Program also provides
mentoring and structured cohort-building and training activities, like the CMB Luncheon Seminar Series and the
CMB retreat, that engage, support, and retain students in science and promote collaborative studies among
trainees. Together, the CMB Training Program’s student-centered interdisciplinary research training, active
learning curriculum, career-development activities, mentoring, and community-building activities contribute to
the successful training of diverse students for a broad array of biomedical careers."
10876247,"Protein O-glucosyltransferases 2 and 3 (POGLUT2 and POGLUT3) add an O-linked glucose to a serine
residue in Epidermal Growth factor-like (EGF) repeats containing the putative consensus sequence
C3xNTxGS(Y/F)xC4, where C3 and C4 are the third and fourth conserved cysteine in the EGF repeat. Database
searches reveal that the fibrillins (FBNs) and Latent TGFβ Binding Proteins (LTBPs) have numerous EGF
repeats with the consensus, while other proteins only have one or two. FBN1 and FBN2 are the major
structural proteins in the 10-12 nm microfibrils in extracellular matrix, where they serve as the scaffold for
elastin in elastic tissues, providing elasticity and recoil essential for function of tissues such as lung. Microfibrils
also bind a number of other molecules, including LTBPs, that regulate tissue homeostasis. Mutations in FBN1
cause Marfan Syndrome (MFS) that can result in aortic aneurism/dissection and also cause lung, bone-growth,
and eye defects. Elimination of Fbn1, Ltbp1, or Ltbp4 in mice results in perinatal lethality, recapitulating several
of the phenotypes seen in MFS patients. Nothing is known about the impact of EGF O-glucosylation on
FBN or LTBP function. Using our glycoproteomic mass spectral methods, we demonstrated that 27 of the 47
EGF repeats in FBN1 immunopurified from human dermal fibroblast cultures are modified with O-glucose.
Similar levels of O-glucose were found in recombinant FBN2, LTPB1, and LTBP4 expressed in HEK293T cells.
Secretion of an N-terminal fragment (EGF1-26) of FBN1 was significantly reduced when POGLUT2 and
POGLUT3 were knocked out in HEK293T cells, suggesting that modification by these enzymes, both localized
in the endoplasmic reticulum, are required for efficient folding and secretion of these substrates. The
importance of this O-glucose modification is underscored by our recent observation that the majority of our
Poglut2/Poglut3 double knockout (DKO) mice die perinatally. Survivors have abnormalities similar to Fbn and
Ltbp KOs including lung defects, small size, and syndactyly. Based on these observations, we hypothesize
that O-glucosylation of FBNs and LTPBs is essential for a functional microfibril network. We predict
that loss of O-glucosylation will reduce secretion of these proteins and/or disrupt binding to microfibril
associated proteins, leading to structural and/or signaling defects in tissues. We will test this hypothesis
in three Aims. Aim 1 addresses how loss of O-glucose affects POGLUT2/3 substrate proteins using cell-based
secretion assays, ultrastructural analysis of microfibrils, and analysis of FBN1-ligand interactions. Aim 2 tests
whether conserved amino acids in the putative POGLUT2/3 consensus are required for O-glucosylation, and
whether MFS mutations in these conserved residues mediate their effects on FBN1 by loss of O-glucose. Aim
3 examines whether loss of POGLUT2/3 impairs the microfibril network in developing lungs using mouse
models, histological approaches, and genetic interaction studies. Combined, these aims will provide molecular
mechanisms to explain how O-glucose affects the structure and function of the microfibril network."

PROJECT SUMMARY:
In the last 5-year cycle, the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) leveraged CCSG
Development Funds ($300K) with more than $1.1M in Director's Discretionary Funds to fund 28 Pilot Projects
from 2015 to 2019. The Executive Committee (EC) targeted the RFAs for these awards to meet DLDCCC
strategic plan goals, including promoting high priority areas of research, fostering inter-programmatic
collaborations, and addressing the cancer burden of our Catchment Area. The 28 projects garnered a 9.5 fold
return on investment based on new grant support arising from the scientific pilot projects. The EC also used
institutional funds to develop a new PDX shared resource. In addition, with the discontinuation of the Early Phase
Clinical Research mechanism during this past funding period, the Center requested that those funds ($100k) be
repurposed to provide protected time for young clinical investigators to develop their research programs. Early
metrics from this strategy are promising with the first recipient, Brandon Smaglo, opening two investigator-
initiated trials that have accrued 30 patients. The current recipient, Daniel Wang from the Mechanisms in Cancer
Evolution Program, is developing studies to validate a microbiome signature in recipients of checkpoint inhibitors
and genetically modified T cells. He also created the Immunotherapy Toxicity Working Group.
In the next 5 years, the DLDCCC is requesting an increase in the Developmental Funds budget to $450K/year.
Developmental Funds in this renewal are being requested for two purposes: 1) $250k/year to enhance an
effective and successful Pilot Project program, and 2) $200K/year to expand support of junior clinical
investigators – which has been identified both nationally and in the DLDCCC strategic plan as an important
priority for NCI cancer centers."

PROJECT SUMMARY
The Tennessee Occupational Health and Safety Surveillance Program’s (TN-OHSSP) goal is to
provide basic information about the risks faced by Tennessee workers that is fundamental for
effective policy and interventions. The program also provides more in-depth surveillance on
topics relevant to stakeholders.
The program looks to cultivate its nascent partnerships with such groups as the department of
labor, TOSHA, and safety groups, as well as groups within the Department of Health.
In service to its goals and its partners, TN-OHSSP endeavors to produce several reports:
- An annual Occupational Health Indicator report which conforms to standards set by the
 Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE),
- An annual State of Worker Health report which reviews time trends for the OHI
 indicators, and other related data points.
- A review of workplace related spread of COVID-19 in TN
- Special topic reports on the underserved high-mortality risk occupations, and requests
 from partners, such as causes of work-related hospitalizations.
In addition to developing reports, the program works to improve the available data and
indicators. The program advocates for health data sets to collect occupational data. Under this
project, TN-OHSSP is working closely with the team that gathers laboratory reports of blood
lead levels to gather occupational data for individuals with elevated blood lead levels."
10877972,"ABSTRACT
Hedgehog signaling is a means of intercellular communication that, in vertebrates, relies on immotile cellular
appendages called primary cilia. In our previous work, we discovered that vertebrate Hedgehog signals move
Smoothened to primary cilia, that this movement is necessary for Smoothened activity, and that certain cancers
depend on their cilia for constitutively active Hedgehog pathway activity.
Despite these insights into Hedgehog signaling, how Smoothened movement to cilia is regulated and how ciliary
Smoothened activates the downstream pathway remain unclear. In this renewal application, we examine the
molecular mechanisms by which the Hedgehog receptor, Patched1, controls Smoothened activity (Aim 1), how
Smoothened is activated within the cilium (Aim 2), and how Smoothened activates its downstream effector, the
transcription factor GLI2 (Aim 3).
We have discovered that the ciliary membrane has a unique lipid composition, and that specific ciliary lipids are
necessary and sufficient to activate mammalian Hedgehog signaling. Therefore, the first two aims focus, in part,
on how Patched1 regulates ciliary lipids and how ciliary lipids control Smoothened activity. These experiments
will help reveal how lipids control signaling, and may identify new therapeutic strategies for blocking Hedgehog
pathway-related cancer formation. How Smoothened communicates to GLI2 remains unknown. We have created
a biochemically tractable knock-in Gli2 allele that will allow us to uncover mechanisms by which cilia regulate
GLI2 activity in embryogenesis and oncogenesis.
Thus, the proposed experiments use a combination of mammalian genetic, cell biological, imaging and
biochemical approaches to reveal how the Hedgehog signal transduction pathway uses cilia to transmit
information, both in development and disease."
10877974,"Project Abstract
Non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) of B-cell type, a heterogenous group of lymphoid malignancies, are among the
most common cancers worldwide, accounting for about 4% of all cancers. A dramatic rise in incidence of NHLs
worldwide during the past decades has sparked intense research efforts to understand their pathogenesis.
Genomics studies have uncovered many novel genomic alterations in NHLs, but these remain to be functionally
validated and characterized. Among the most common of the genomic alterations is a missense mutation that
results in leucine-to-proline substitution at position 265 in MYD88 (MYD88L265P), an adaptor protein that activates
oncogenic NF-κB signaling. The MYD88L265P mutation is exceptionally frequent in lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma
(LPL) and activated B-cell type of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ABC-DLBCL). While inhibition of MYD88L265P
adversely impacts the survival of LPL and ABC-DLBCL cells, its role in lymphoma initiation remains to be
clarified. Therefore, to elucidate the lymphomagenic potential of MYD88L265P we generated conditional transgenic
mice overexpressing human wild-type (hMYD88WT) or mutant (hMYD88L265P) proteins in activated B-cells.
Although abundance of both proteins and p65 NF-κB nuclear translocation was increased in transgenic GC B-
cells, we observed that: (i) the MYD88L265P protein differed from the MYD88WT in its stability, ease of aggregation,
and downstream activity; (ii) hMYD88WT did not produce detectable phenotypic alterations, but hMYD88L265P
promoted with high frequency and long latency, a non-clonal, low-grade B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder
resembling human LPL, which occasionally underwent transformation to ABC-DLBCL, suggesting that
MYD88L265P is insufficient by itself to drive neoplastic transformation of mature B-cells, and that secondary
cooperating genetic alterations are needed. In line with our findings, introduction of MYD88L265P into primary B-
cells was recently shown to induce negative feedback mechanisms mediated by TNFAIP3, a negative regulator
of NF-κB pathway residing on Chr6q, along with other important tumor suppressors. Notably, Chr6q deletions
are observed in almost half of LPL cases with small somatic deletions present in up to 80% of patients with
MYD88L265Pmutation and in ABC-DLBCL. Importantly, Chr6q losses are not detected in human MYD88WT LPL
patients, indicating that repression of 6q-related signaling is a critical pathogenetic step specifically in
MYD88L265P-induced LPL. These results indicate that MYD88L265P possesses unique biochemical and functional
properties, and suggest that the hMYD88WT and hMYD88L265P transgenic mice constitute an ideal model system
in which to investigate these properties, as well as the secondary cooperating genetic alterations that are
necessary to fully develop a clonal LPL phenotype and its eventual progression to ABC-DLBCL. Here we propose
to investigate the role of the MYD88L265P mutation, Chr6q deletion (Chr10q in mice) as well as other LPL-
associated loss-of-function gene mutations in B-cell development and function as well as the pathogenesis of
LPL and ABC-DLBCL, and to develop a preclinical mouse models of LPL and ABC-DLBCL for testing therapies."
10878256,"SUMMARY
Many people with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) report that the illness begins
with an “infectious-like” prodrome—typically, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, fever, lymphadenopathy,
and myalgias. Evidence of immune dysregulation consistent with infection has been reported in blood and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by several research groups. Proteomic studies of plasma and CSF revealed evidence
of antigen-driven clonal B cell expansion. Up to 40% of patients are reported to respond to intravenous infusions
of the Toll-like receptor 3 agonist, Ampligen, a double-stranded RNA analogue stabilized with uridine that is
proposed to inhibit viral replication. Others report responses to antiviral drugs specific for herpesviruses, pre-
and probiotics, or fecal transplantation.
The observation that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to chronic disability with clinical features consistent with
ME/CFS underscores the importance of exploring the role of infection in the pathogenesis of ME/CFS. Our
hypothesis is that some individuals with ME/CFS may experience the onset or worsening of the disease due to
an infectious trigger and that previous attempts to implicate infection may have been hindered by suboptimal
sampling methods, with respect to the type of samples collected, the timing of collection, and/or limitations in the
performance of the assays used. To address this hypothesis, we will shift from efforts during the first cycle of the
Center for Solutions for ME/CFS that focused on direct detection of potential microbial triggers to a search for
serological evidence of exposure prior to onset of illness using the unique resource of the Department of Defense
Serum Repository (DoDSR).
The DoDSR comprises >62 million samples collected since 1989 from active and reserve personnel of the Army,
Navy, and Air Force linked to a clinical database that can be used to retrieve sera from individuals with specific
diagnoses. More than 75% of individuals are represented by multiple specimens collected at annual intervals.
Samples collected from people with ME/CFS, before and after diagnosis, and from matched controls, will be
interrogated using a high-density short-peptide phage display system that enables quantitation and
characterization of antiviral responses indicative of ongoing and past infections, as well as reactivation. We will
also test for evidence of immune dysregulation by measuring the levels of cytokines/chemokines using a CLIA-
approved Luminex assay. Finally, we will use results of phage display to develop more practical and less
expensive diagnostic assays that can be used to facilitate timely identification of microbial triggers that may be
associated with the onset and/or exacerbation of ME/CFS."
10877728,"Project Summary
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are the most common clonal blood disorders, characterized by
dominance of the bone marrow by abnormal stem cells and impairment of blood cell production. Patients with
MDS suffer from combinations of anemia, infection, bleeding, and multiorgan failure from progressive disease.
Outcomes are poor, and treatments are inadequate. Key to developing new treatments is better understanding
of the mutations which create these diseases. Roughly half of MDS patients have mutations in spliceosome
genes, and of these, SF3B1 is the most commonly mutated. Mutant SF3B1 is neomorphic, disrupting RNA
splicing to create what we refer to as JEMs (splice Junctions Enriched in Mutant-spliceosome cells), though how
JEMs produce MDS phenotypes is unknown. SF3B1 mutation is regarded as a favorable prognostic marker in
MDS. Yet, there is considerable heterogeneity in the pathologic features and clinical outcomes of SF3B1-mutant
MDS that remains unexplained. As this heterogeneity beguiles effective disease management, its causes need
to be better understood. The premise of our proposal is that a key to understanding SF3B1-mutant MDS is to
study the differences between distinct SF3B1 mutations. This gene is mutated in hotspots affecting multiple
amino acids, and our preliminary data show that specific mutations associate with distinct clinical features, RNA
splicing patterns, and responses to therapy. We also have data that SF3B1 mutations disrupt metabolism in
specific ways that likely affect sideroblastic anemia and metabolic vulnerabilities, and we have developed novel
human models of SF3B1-mutant hematopoiesis with which to study these processes. The proposed work
combines the expertise of a physician-scientist (Dr. Dalton) who specializes in cell biology, genetics, and human
cell modeling of disease with that of a clinical investigator (Dr. DeZern) who specializes in clinical studies of bone
marrow failure disorders. Together, we will pursue three aims: 1) Characterize the landscape of private and
shared JEMs among hotspot SF3B1 mutations in MDS. We will use RNA-seq of primary MDS samples and
isogenic human cell models to map the RNA splicing landscape of different SF3B1 mutations and use this as a
‘way in’ to understanding the pathways they disrupt. 2) Establish the role of distinct SF3B1 mutations in the
growth and differentiation of human hematopoietic cells. We will use primary MDS samples and isogenic cells to
determine mechanisms of sideroblastic anemia, cell fitness, and metabolic vulnerability in SF3B1-mutant
hematopoietic cells. 3) Define the clinicopathologic features of distinct SF3B1 mutations in MDS. Leveraging the
high-quality data from the NHLBI National MDS Study, we will determine how distinct hotspot SF3B1 mutations
affect pathologic and clinical features of MDS through multivariate analysis. Successful completion of these aims
promises to reveal pathophysiologic mechanisms of RNA splicing, redefine disease classification and prognosis,
and improve treatment approaches in MDS."

The goal of the Yale Interdisciplinary Immunology Training Program (YIITP) is to equip predoctoral trainees
with the intellectual and research foundations necessary to become independent scientists/educators
investigating basic mechanisms of immune system development and function. The YIITP, which is entering its
46th year, combines rigorous research training in a highly interactive environment and a thorough academic
program of instruction in immunology and related disciplines with diverse opportunities for career and skill
development. The program leads to the PhD and offers training in virtually all aspects of immune system
development and function as well as host-microbe interactions and mechanisms by which the immune system
prevents and contributes to disease. The YIITP faculty is composed of 35 immunologists with outstanding
records of research accomplishment and training whose labs interact and collaborate extensively (114
collaborative publications in the last 5 years). YIITP Program Directors David Schatz and Carla Rothlin work
together closely in complementary roles to direct the program and together with four additional faculty,
constitute the YIITP Executive Committee, which develops new initiatives, evaluates program success based
on internal and external review, and oversees trainee and YIITP faculty evaluations and appointments. The
principal training entity is the Department of Immunobiology, whose graduate program has consistently been
among the top-ranked immunology graduate programs in the United States. YIITP students enter Yale
predominantly via application to the Immunology Track of the Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS)
Program and are selected for YIITP appointment in year 2 based on a research focus on basic immune
mechanisms. YIITP training involves formal course work, research rotations, teaching, and qualifying exam in
years 1-2, with thesis research beginning in the spring of year one. A longitudinal mentoring program begins in
year 1 and each student is assigned a thesis advisory committee in year 2. Training is enriched by intensive

10878717,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are a class of pulmonary diseases pathologically defined by interstitial fibrosis
and inflammation. Owing to our limited understanding of the upstream initiators of pathogenesis, ILDs have poor
prognoses and limited therapeutics. Mutations in the Alveolar Epithelial Type 2 Cell (AEC2) restricted Surfactant
Protein C (SP-C) gene (SFTPC) in a subset of ILD patients supports a growing hypothesis that AEC2
dysfunction is a driver of disease. When we model these disease-related SFTPC mutations in vitro they
segregate into two major classes based upon how the mutated SP-C isoform stresses cellular pathways that
manage abnormal proteins: mutations that inhibit macroautophagy and mutations that cause endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress. However, how these AEC2 stress phenotypes, which have also been identified in ILD
patients without SFTPC mutations, relate to ILD development remains poorly understood.
To understand this relationship, we have generated two unique Sftpc mutation knock-in mouse models, one
expressing an SP-C isoform that induces AEC2 macroautophagy dysfunction (SP-CI73T) and the other inducing
ER stress (SP-CC121G). Each of these mutations when expressed in the adult mouse lung results in spontaneous
alveolitis and lung injury followed by aberrant repair with resultant fibrotic ILD. These models thus provide proof
of concept that AEC2 stress is capable of driving spontaneous lung pathology and are robust preclinical
platforms. These models also support a second emerging theory of ILD pathogenesis: that in ILD AEC2s, which
must act as critical facultative progenitor cells after lung injury by both proliferating and differentiating to repair
damaged epithelium, develop dysfunction in their progenitor cell capacity. We discovered that while similar lung
pathology develops in each of our Sftpc models, there are divergent AEC2 proliferation phenotypes following
lung injury: SP-CI73T AEC2s become hyperpoliferative and SP-CC121G AEC2s become apoptotic and
hypoproliferative. Thus, our models support the hypothesis that abnormal AEC2 progenitor cell function plays a
central role in ILD development, and also create a platform to develop a mechanistic understanding of how
discrete AEC2 stress signatures result in distinct defects in progenitor cell capacity.
This proposal has three interrelated aims that seek to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms that
relate AEC2 cell stress, dysfunctional progenitor cell capacity, and ILD. Aim 1 uses bioinformatics and in vivo
linage-tracing to characterize the AEC2 stress signaling and progenitor function pathways involved in each
model. Aim 2 provides a mechanistic link between cell stress signaling and progenitor cell dysfunction through
ex vivo organoid culture and in vivo modeling. In Aim 3 we will generate the first ILD patient-derived iPSC
culture model of an ER stress associated SFTPC mutation as a humanized platform to study the pathways
identified in Aims 1 and 2. This proposal will also provided the trainee with the diverse and comprehensive
training necessary to develop a multimodal independent research program on the role of the epithelium in ILD."
10878720,"Pain is one of the most common and costly symptoms in our society. Advances in pain treatment have been disappointing, especially for chronic pain, which is poorly understood and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Given the tremendous cost and impact of pain, it is important to develop an interdisciplinary research workforce capable of leading innovative studies to unravel the causes of persistent pain and discover better pain relief strategies. Our goal is to prepare the next generation of pain researchers to lead this effort. As such, we seek to renew and expand our postdoctoral Interdisciplinary Training Program in Biobehavioral Pain Research at the Johns Hopkins University from four to six positions. Pain is a highly complex phenomenon that involves, genetic, molecular, neurophysiologic, cognitive-emotional, and sociocultural determinants. The treatment of pain remains inadequate in almost every clinical situation and consequently necessitates institutions create specialized, interdisciplinary training in pain research to address the tremendous challenge of developing, evaluating, disseminating, and integrating effective pain treatments into clinical care. As such, the Institute of Medicine’s ‘Relieving Pain in America’ report notes the importance and need for more interdisciplinary pain training programs. Our 26 program faculty cuts across 10 departments in the Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, and Engineering. The overarching goal of the proposed postdoctoral program is to prepare the next generation of innovative research leaders to work cooperatively within an interdisciplinary team to address the complex problem of pain. This proposal emphasizes the neuroscience of pain throughout training. Each faculty mentor is an actively funded scientist, engaged in the education of new investigators, and committed to interdisciplinary collaboration. The two-year program incorporates coursework, seminars and mentored research experiences in at least two scientific domains that are synthesized by: 1) an integrated research project, 2) an extramural grant application, and 3) the writing and publishing of papers. The training objectives are to: 1) develop an enhanced foundation in the neuroscience of pain; 2) engender a broad conceptualization of pain that includes, but is not limited to, neurobiologic, cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and social processes; 3) develop skills for communicating, networking and collaborating with scientists in other disciplines; and 4) design and conduct an integrative pain research project. Each fellow is to be collaboratively mentored by two Core faculty with distinct domains of pain research expertise in either: 1) basic neuroscience, 2) clinical research or 3) behavioral or social science. Fellows take courses in experimental design, statistics, quantitative methods and the responsible conduct of research, which are reinforced throughout several pain-related content and career development seminars. Our goal is to prepare the next generation of pain scientists to lead interdisciplinary research teams that will innovatively address the problem of pain."
10878845,"Project summary:
More than 70% of adults in the USA are obese or overweight, and comorbidities, such as diabetes, pose a
significant challenge to public health. In response to excess nutrients, white adipose tissue expands by both
hypertrophy and de novo adipogenesis. Excessive hypertrophy is linked to insulin resistance, while mechanisms
that promote adipogenesis can limit the pathogenic consequences of obesity. We recently discovered that pre-
adipocytes express an antenna-like signaling organelle called the primary cilium, and that primary cilia are
required for in vivo adipogenesis. We propose that primary cilia function as signaling hubs in pre-adipocytes,
regulating their adipogenic potential, and hence, how white adipose tissue expands in response to caloric
imbalance. Remarkably, we recently discovered that pre-adipocytes isolated from obese human and murine
white adipose tissue have both fewer and shorter cilia compared to lean pre-adipocytes. To elucidate the
functional importance of ciliary signaling in directing how white adipose tissue expands, we propose the following
two aims: (Aim 1) Investigate how obesity affects pre-adipocyte ciliation and ciliary signaling. Pre-adipocytes in
obese white adipose tissue are known to differentiate poorly due to a cell-intrinsic defect that decreases their
adipogenic potential. This contributes to adipocyte hypertrophy, inflammation, and tissue dysfunction. We
propose that the obese white adipose tissue microenvironment promotes pathogenic loss of pre-adipocyte
primary cilia. This loss results in impairment of ciliary, pro-adipogenic signaling and decreased adipogenic
potential, leading to hypertrophic expansion of white adipose tissue and contributing to impairments in glucose
and lipid metabolism. Using a combination of molecular and cell biological techniques and mouse models, we
will define the adipogenic signaling defects governed by obesity-induced ciliary shortening and loss, as well as
the underlying mechanism. (Aim 2) Determine how human genetic mutations in ciliary genes lead to obesity and
diabetes. Two ciliopathies are linked to obesity in patients, but the mutations drive opposing effects with regard
to metabolic health. Both ciliopathy mutations alter the trafficking of ciliary cargo into and out of the primary
cilium. We propose that these alterations modulate the composition of ciliary signaling pathways, altering the
adipogenic potential of pre-adipocytes and how white adipose tissue expands. Together, experiments proposed
in the two aims will establish the functional importance of pre-adipocyte cilia to white adipose tissue expansion.
The proposed research constitutes a completely novel and innovative approach to identifying mechanisms
underlying the loss of adipogenic potential of obese pre-adipocytes that drives pathogenesis."
10878854,"Project Summary
Human obesity represents a serious world-wide health problem. One consequence of obesity is the
development of metabolic syndrome, characterized by insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, that can lead to b
cell dysfunction and type 2 diabetes. It is therefore important that we gain an understanding of the physiology
and pathophysiology of the development of obesity because this knowledge represents a basis for the design
of potential therapeutic interventions.
The cJun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway functions during stress responses, including metabolic
stress caused by feeding a high fat diet (HFD). Importantly, loss-of-function studies using mice demonstrate
that deficiency of JNK1 plus JNK2 in adipocytes prevents adipose tissue inflammation and the development of
systemic insulin resistance. However, the mechanisms that mediate the actions of JNK signaling in adipocytes
are unclear.
We will focus our studies on two questions:
a) What is the physiologically relevant form of JNK that drives adipose tissue inflammation and insulin
resistance? Adipocytes express two genes that encode JNK (Mapk8 & Mapk9 encode JNK1 & JNK2,
respectively) and transcripts of both genes are alternatively spliced by mutually exclusive inclusion of exons 7a
& 7b. These alternative exons encode a segment of the substrate binding site. The JNK17a & JNK27a exhibit
similar substrate specificities that differ from the similar substrate preferences of JNK17b & JNK27b. We will
determine which of these JNK spliceoforms mediates effects of JNK on adipose tissue inflammation and
systemic insulin resistance.
b) What mechanism mediates the actions of adipocyte JNK? It has been proposed that the effects of JNK on
inflammation may be mediated by increased adipocyte IL6 expression and that the effects of JNK on systemic
insulin resistance may be mediated by decreased FGF21 expression. A rigorous test of the sufficiency of
these JNK-mediated actions on adipokine expression is required to confirm the actions of these JNK-
responsive adipokines and to identify whether there are additional targets of JNK signaling.
The overall goal of this research program is to identify molecular mechanisms that account for JNK function in
adipocytes. Achievement of this goal will increase understanding of the molecular response to obesity. We
anticipate that the successful completion of this research program will lead to the identification of new
mechanisms that contribute to the obesity response. This knowledge may represent a basis for the design of
novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes."

10876651,"Project Summary/Abstract
Hearing loss is the third most common chronic health condition affecting 37 million Americans. Untreated
hearing loss is estimated to cost the United States two billion dollars in additional healthcare expenditure.
Hearing aids are the primary treatment option for hearing loss, however only 30% of individuals who could
benefit from a hearing aid use them. In an effort to improve the rates of hearing aid use, the Food and Drug
Administration approved the sale of Over-the-Counter (OTC) Hearing Aids in October 2022. There is great
expectation that OTC hearing aids will significantly improve the uptake of hearing aids among OTC hearing aid
target populations. Unfortunately, only 16% of over 1000 consumers surveyed by our lab would consider using
OTC hearing aids. One of the barriers that may hinder OTC hearing aid adoption is the inability to self-
determine candidacy. Presently, the product information label (PIL) for OTC hearing aids is the only consumer-
focused tool intended to help an individual self-determine if they an appropriate user. Unfortunately, preliminary
work from our lab has shown that consumers do not attend to the PIL in its entirety, and it is often only made
available to the consumer after purchase. Thus, we propose to supplement the PIL by developing an
interactive mobile (m)health decision aid (HearEase) that will help guide consumers through the self-candidacy
process for OTC hearing aids prior to their purchase. However, the development of HearEase will be critically
dependent on thoughtful design and implementation. Thus, we will work with key stakeholders (manufacturers
and retailers) to create an implementation plan that will ensure that HearEase will be adopted and
implemented by manufacturers and retailers. These overall goals will be achieved by the following aims. Aim 1:
To develop an interactive mHealth decision aid (HearEase) that will help potential consumers of OTC HA to
self-determine candidacy. Aim 2: To develop the implementation plan for HearEase."
10876658,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, disproportionately affecting rural areas of the US and driving up
a disproportionate cancer burden. Children living in these rural and underresourced communities commonly
experience multiple health disparities, including increased risks for skin cancer over time. This is due to more
frequent and intense outdoor exposures to harmful ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun, where the chances
of sunburn are substantially increased. Unfortunately, there are no evidence-based sun safety interventions with
durable effects on protecting children in these settings, and especially while playing outdoors. How to safely
promote young children's outdoor playtime while still adequately protecting them from harmful UVR exposure is
a vexing research challenge in rural cancer control, and one that requires a multilevel public health approach to
cancer prevention. In direct response to this need, we designed a multicomponent, multilevel sun safety
intervention for young children (ages 3-6) enrolled in recreational sports programs across 2 rural states (UT,
WV). Recreational sports programs are naturally-occurring opportunities for early cancer education and
protection in an adult-supervised setting. Grounded in an ecologically-valid theory of shaping children’s health
behavior, our intervention promotes recommended sun safety strategies and adaptations at the individual, social,
and environmental levels. In a preliminary trial, we delivered this intervention in 2 rural communities'
developmental baseball programs (among N=17 teams of female and male players). Intervention leagues,
teams, coaches, and players evidenced significant improvements in key outcomes, and greater than among
controls. Now, we propose a more stringent test of this intervention in a two-arm cluster-randomized trial in 16
counties in 2 rural states (UT, WV) matched for skin cancer burden and other community-level factors. The trial
will address 16 leagues, 64 teams, 128 coaches, and 640 players: primary outcomes include directly-observed
sun protection behaviors during recreational sports practices and games. Area-wide UVR and environmental
scan data will be obtained from geocoded locations and considered in explanatory models. Secondary endpoints
include parent-reported child sun protection and sunburn. Multilevel mechanisms, processes, and moderators of
the intervention’s impact on child sun protection will be included, as well as intervention delivery-related effects
to help guide future tailoring. This project has the potential to promote lasting changes in children's sun safety
behaviors during a sensitive biological stage. It will do so in rural and medically underrepresented communities
that are among the most in need of effective cancer control strategies, using approaches that can be scaled-up
statewide and to other regions of the country to help reduce cancer disparities."

This proposal represents a five-year research career development program focused on understanding intestinal
epithelial cell (IEC) barrier dysfunction in peanut allergy and on providing a strong foundation for the applicant,
Dr. Erin Steinbach, to build an independent basic and translational research career. The candidate is currently
a tenure track Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of North Carolina (UNC) School of Medicine in
the Division of Rheumatology, Allergy, and Immunology. She is a member of the Thurston Arthritis Research
Center and Center for Gastrointestinal Biology and Disease. The proposal builds on the candidate’s previous
mucosal immunology research and clinical allergy training by integrating five new realms of expertise
represented by her mentor team of Drs. Shehzad Sheikh and Wesley Burks and her advisors’ expertise in IEC
biology, gene regulation, metabolomics and integration of large datasets, and prospective human studies. This
work will add to the existing knowledge of a diverse group of diseases associated with increased IEC permeability
and will foster the development of novel therapies targeting the intestines for severe allergic reactions. Through
formal coursework, seminars, and guidance from her team, the candidate will develop the skills needed to run a
successful research program. She will develop a unique skillset for competing successfully for R01-level grants
that will support her transition to an independent physician scientist career.
Peanut is the most common cause of death from food-related anaphylaxis. Severity of a food allergic reaction is
partly determined by IEC barrier dysfunction, suggesting that peanut is adept at affecting the IEC barrier. No one
has worked out how or why people with peanut allergy have increased IEC barrier permeability. Our preliminary
data show that barrier permeability after the development of peanut allergy persists even in isolated, cultured
IECs. We will use a novel Collaborative Cross mouse model (CC027 strain) and primary human 2D “enteroids”
(primary human-derived IEC monolayers) to broaden the understanding of increased IEC permeability in peanut
allergy. CC027 mice develop peanut allergy through the oral route without adjuvant, which is normally needed
in animal models to establish peanut allergy. The CC027 peanut-allergic mouse develops increased intestinal
permeability. Peanut-allergic CC027 mouse-derived IECs have altered proliferation and cholesterol metabolism,
gut dysbiosis, and produce very high levels of Angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4). Serum ANGPTL4 levels are higher
in peanut-allergic, compared to non-allergic, pediatric patients. Alterations in the gut microbiota are present in
food allergy and affect the IEC barrier, but its effects in IEC barrier function in peanut allergy remain elusive. We
hypothesize that in established peanut allergy, more local IEC ANGPTL4 production and an altered microbial
metabolome disrupts intestinal epithelial stem cell metabolism and ultimately IEC barrier integrity."
10887134,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Breast cancer (BC) survivors are the largest cancer survivor group (~4 million in the US) given improvements
in screening and long-term BC survival. While BC progression is a concern in this group, many BC survivors
die of comorbid illness. Specifically, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a major comorbidity (prevalence 20%)
associated with increased morbidity and mortality in BC survivors. Thus, optimizing T2DM treatment can have
a major beneficial impact in clinical outcomes. However, data regarding the optimal T2DM treatment strategies
in BC survivors, particularly taking into account novel T2DM drugs, is limited. The harm/benefit ratio of different
T2DM treatment approaches is likely significantly different for BC survivors due to an increased risk of T2DM
complications (particularly cardiovascular disease [CVD] in setting of cardiotoxic BC treatments), unique harms
from T2DM treatments, higher competing risks of death from BC, and differences in baseline QOL. To address
this knowledge gap, I plan to develop and validate a simulation model to recapitulate the natural history,
management, and outcomes of T2DM in BC survivors (Aim 1). I then will determine the most effective T2DM
treatment strategy (according to age, stage, primary BC therapy, BC recurrence, CVD) in terms of glycemic
control intensity (intensive vs. moderate) and first-line drugs (metformin, SGTL2i, GLP1ra vs. SGTL2i/GLP1ra
combined) for Stage II-III BC survivors 2) (Aim 2). I am an endocrinologist and my career goal is to optimize
diabetes care for cancer survivors and other understudied populations with complex comorbidity using
innovative simulation modeling approaches. My proposed training plan focuses on the following domains: 1)
Advanced statistical and epidemiological methods (quality of life, longitudinal data, and missing data
imputation); 2) Simulation modeling and translation into practice; and 3) Leadership in research and career
development (scientific communication, grant writing, etc.). I have assembled an interdisciplinary experienced
mentorship team with expertise in diabetes, cancer survivorship epidemiology, biostatistics, and simulation
modeling. I will complete my training at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, a national leader in
research and one of the top 20 medical schools for research in the country. I have a mentorship team

10886190,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), is the most common chronic liver disease in the United States and a rapidly growing cause
of morbidity, mortality, and need for liver transplantation. Therefore, there is a critical need for effective
therapies for this increasingly common yet heterogeneous disease. An under-explored area in the field is the
role of the nuclear envelope and lamina, which together form a structural and functional link between the
cytoskeleton and genome in all nucleated cells, regulating chromatin accessibility, gene transcription, and
transport of RNA and proteins across the nuclear membrane to maintain cellular and organismal homeostasis.
As part of our NIDDK K08-funded work, we have identified a common coding variant in SUN1, encoding a
ubiquitously expressed inner nuclear membrane protein, that positively associates with hepatic steatosis,
histologic MASLD, and MASLD-related metabolic traits in multiple large cohorts. This variant, altering a
charged residue in the nucleoplasmic portion of the protein, increased SUN1 proteasomal degradation and led
to insulin resistance and increased lipid accumulation in transfected cells. Collectively, these findings suggest
that SUN1 plays a role in protecting against MASLD and metabolic disease and that SUN1 variants may
contribute to MASLD at a population level. In this proposal, we hypothesize that SUN1 protects against
MASLD and metabolic disease via effects in multiple cell and tissue types in vivo, with protective effects in both
hepatocytes and adipocytes, and that SUN1 H118Y – and other SUN1 variants – likely have deleterious
impacts in multiple cell and tissue types. Using stable SUN1-expressing cell lines that we are generating, and
biochemical techniques that we already have established, we aim to determine the cell types in which, and
mechanisms by which, SUN1 H118Y exerts MASLD-promoting metabolic effects (Aim 1). In parallel, we will
utilize newly available whole exome sequence data from UK Biobank to identify additional variants in SUN1
that associate with MASLD (Aim 2). Collectively, these studies will advance our understanding of nuclear
envelope-related metabolic disease and MASLD and the mechanisms by which SUN1, which is a potential
new therapeutic target in MASLD, protects against liver disease. Additionally, the studies proposed will build
toward an R01 application focused on the role of SUN1, and the effects of SUN1 H118Y, in MASLD-relevant
metabolic pathways in multiple tissue types in vivo."
10886191,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Childhood obesity and food insecurity are escalating and intersecting public health threats. Childhood obesity
prevalence has been rising in the U.S. and tracks into adulthood, increasing the risks of chronic diseases such
as type 2 diabetes. Food insecurity is associated with poorer dietary quality, including higher energy-dense
food intake, and a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes in adults; however, data are inconsistent and less
known regarding longitudinal health effects in children. Further, there is evidence that the neighborhood food
environment, including limited access to sources of healthy food, is associated with elevated body mass index
in children. Because food insecurity and childhood obesity tend to co-occur in Black, Hispanic, and lower-
income populations, there is an urgent need to examine the multilevel contributions of household food
insecurity and neighborhood food access to rising childhood obesity prevalence. Dr. Allison Wu, a pediatric
gastroenterology and nutrition specialist with advanced training in epidemiology and health services research,
is well-suited to address this need.
Dr. Wu seeks to expand on her research in the determinants, risks, and disparities in childhood obesity to
develop and test interventions to support food and nutrition security in children and families. Specifically, her
proposal aims to examine the extent to which household food insecurity and neighborhood food access
contribute to increasing childhood obesity prevalence (Aim 1), test a meal kit delivery intervention in families
and children with food insecurity and obesity (Aim 2), and explore the facilitators and barriers associated with
the intervention’s implementation (Aim 3). These are the critical next steps toward achieving her long-term goal
to develop evidence-based interventions and policies ensuring nutrition security for children and families.
This career development award will provide Dr. Wu with the necessary mentored training and research
opportunities to 1) develop expertise in multilevel and longitudinal analyses, 2) conduct a phase II clinical trial,
and 3) obtain a foundation in implementation science and training in qualitative methods to translate
interventions into routine practice. She is supported by outstanding mentorship provided by experts in obesity
epidemiology, health services, and health equity (Dr. Elsie Taveras), food insecurity and implementation
science (Dr. Lauren Fiechtner), social and behavioral epidemiology (Drs. Henning Tiemeier and Izzuddin Aris),
clinical trials in pediatric nutrition (Drs. Christopher Duggan and Enju Liu), and qualitative research in child
health (Dr. Karen Kuhlthau). Her training and research activities will be conducted in the unparalleled academic
environments at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, which are firmly committed to Dr.
Wu’s successful transition to independence as a physician-scientist."
10886317,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Sustainment of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) is a priority area for the field of implementation science.
However, there are notable gaps in the field’s understanding of how implementation strategies prepare
practitioners to sustain EBIs. Mothers and Babies (MB) is an EBI focused on prevention of perinatal depression
that is widely implemented across home visiting (HV) programs that serve pregnant and parenting individuals.
Specific implementation strategies have been developed and are being used to support MB sustainment in HV
programs, with state HV networks in New Mexico and Rhode Island transitioning from an initial implementation
(0-24 months) to sustainment (24-36 months) phase during the project period. The proposed R21 project will
leverage the research team’s partnership with these networks and has two specific aims. First, we will
determine how existing implementation strategies prepare HV programs to sustain MB. We will collect
administrative data to assess the extent to which MB is sustained at 24 months, inclusive of provider- and
client-level sustainment outcomes. We will also elicit perspectives from New Mexico and Rhode Island HV
mangers, staff, and clients on the extent to which sustainment predictors are associated with fidelity of
implementation strategies and the perceive usefulness of implementation strategies in promoting MB
sustainment. Analyses will also be conducted examining the relationship between sustainment predictors and
sustainment outcomes. Qualitative data will also be collected to assess how implementation strategies
influence sustainment predictors and sustainment outcomes, as well as multi-level contextual factors that affect
how implementation strategies enhance sustainment predictors and sustainment outcomes. Second, we will
develop and pilot test an implementation strategy “bundle” to support MB sustainment in HV. We will use a
human-centered design approach and work with HV managers and staff to finalize an implementation strategy
bundle that supports MB sustainment in HV, and pilot test the new implementation strategy bundle with two
new state HV networks to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of each strategy. These
activities will prepare us to conduct a R01 hybrid-effectiveness Type 2 trial testing the new implementation
strategy bundle as well as sustained MB implementation and effectiveness among HV programs receiving the
strategy bundle. Public health significance and innovation of this project is substantial. Perinatal depression is
the most common health complication associated with pregnancy, affecting one in five women. HV programs
provide services to pregnant and parenting individuals across all 50 states. By developing a sustainment model
for integrating MB into HV, this R21 will facilitate the sustained delivery of MB, which is consistent with NIMH’s
strategic objective to scale-up evidence-based practices and goal of PAR-22-109 to identify, develop, and/or
test strategies for overcoming barriers to the sustainability of EBIs. Our sustainment model will also serve as a
guide for other research teams seeking to integrate and sustain EBIs into HV."

10892691,"Abstract: Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy (CII)
The overarching mission of the Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy (CII) Program is to discover, validate
and implement new molecular and cellular immune agents and novel combination immunotherapies for the
immune-based treatment and prevention of human cancers. CII members work to realize the program mission
through three specific aims: (a) define the basic regulatory mechanisms that promote anti-tumor immunity or
facilitate tumor immune evasion; (b) dissect the epigenetic, transcriptional and cellular geography of the tumor
immune microenvironment to discover new immunotherapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers; and (c)
develop and translate novel laboratory research findings into more effective immunotherapies for cancer
treatment and prevention. Three themes holistically integrate research conducted under the these aims, and
include (1) immunoregulatory mechanisms in cancer, (2) modulators of the tumor immune microenvironment,
and (3) cancer immunotherapies. CII prioritizes translating immuno-oncology science developed at Hillman
Cancer Center (HCC) in early proof-of-concept trials, and works with the Cancer Therapeutics Program (CT) to
collaborate with the NCI-CTEP, CITN, other NCI cancer centers, cooperative groups, and biotech/industry
partners for clinical validation and late-stage testing.
Under the leadership of Leisha Emens, MD, PhD, Dario Vignali, PhD and Hassane Zarour, MD, CII has 43
members representing 10 academic departments and 1 school within the University of Pittsburgh. CII members
conduct cancer-focused research supported by $17.0M in total annual direct funding, of which $4.9M is NCI
funding (including R01, R21, P30, and T32 grants), $4.0M is other peer-reviewed and $8.1M is non-peer-
reviewed. From 2015-August 2019, CII members published 848 cancer-related publications representing 14%
intra-programmatic, 46% inter-programmatic, and 65% inter-institutional collaborations. HCC support greatly
facilitates and enhances CII research through the extensive use of HCC SR. CII research in immune
checkpoints for head and neck, lung, and breast cancer as well as melanoma directly addresses the burden of
cancer in the HCC catchment area related to tobacco use, obesity and sun exposure and have positively
changed clinical practice across the U.S. and the world. CII investigators have also developed a prophylactic
colon cancer vaccine that addresses unmet cancer control needs in the HCC catchment area. Together, these
efforts will ensure the translation of novel research findings in cancer immunology and immunotherapy to the
bedside, with the goal of improving clinical outcomes."
10892693,"Abstract: Community Outreach and Engagement
UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) works throughout western Pennsylvania to assess the cancer burden
and address, through community engagement and high-quality research, the cancer incidence and mortality in
its catchment area (CA). The HCC CA consists of 25 rural and 4 urban counties located in Appalachia, with the
majority of minority populations residing within the urban counties. The counties collectively are largely low
income with higher than U.S. rates for age-adjusted cancer incidence (breast, prostate, colorectal, lung,
thyroid) and mortality (lung, breast, and prostate), with racial disparity in Allegheny County for lung, breast, and
colo-rectal cancer mortality. CA risk behaviors include lower than national rates of cancer screening, poor
uptake of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and high rates of obesity and tobacco usage. Under the
leadership of Drs. Robertson (Community Engagement and Outreach) and Rosenzweig (Catchment Area
Research), the HCC’s Committee for Health Equity and Community Outreach & Engagement (CHECOE) uses
several data sources and strategies to define cancer incidence, mortality, screening behaviors, burdens, and
risks. Using these data, CHECOE, in close collaboration with the HCC research programs and the Community
Advisory Board and partners, directs the development and implementation of HCC CA initiatives and
evaluation of these efforts toward cancer burden reduction. These initiatives include a research portfolio with
contributions from each HCC program directed at identified CA burdens, and provision of evidence-based
community engagement to meet identified education, screening and support needs of CA populations. These
efforts include the successful navigation of patients from underserved areas to cancer screening and, if
necessary, through treatment. There is statewide collaboration for the increased uptake of HPV vaccine.
HCC’s program of CA research includes several initiatives focused on developing new agents directed at
specific CA high incidence and mortality malignancies; tobacco cessation; and better understanding and
mitigation of racial disparity in cancer treatment. Research also includes the long-standing Pittsburgh Lung
Screening Study (PLuSS), now used for developing risk biomarkers; identification of regionally unique cancer
threats and resilience; and several initiatives to ensure equitable cancer care, including novel delivery systems
in rural areas and improving minority recruitment to clinical trials. Future plans include the development of
infrastructure to better describe diverse populations in the community and across the cancer trajectory, an
ongoing CA health equity regional meeting, development of CA academic rigor, and focused initiatives to
increase recruitment of diverse populations into clinical trials."
10892695,"Abstract: Developmental Funds
Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) Developmental Funds provide discretionary support to help Hillman
Cancer Center (HCC) achieve the goals established during strategic planning and evaluation activities. During
the current period, HCC used these funds to make key faculty recruitments, launch innovative ideas, adopt
technical advances within our Shared Resources, and support Staff Investigators. The HCC Senior Leadership
Team (SLT) determines the priorities for the allocation of Developmental Funds and supplemental institutional
support, with input from the Research Executive Advisory Committee (REAC) and the External Advisory Board
(EAB), to ensure alignment with CCSG guidelines and the HCC strategic plan. CCSG Developmental Funds
supported 10 faculty recruits; 21 pilot projects that allowed members to pursue innovative, high-risk ideas or
work in high priority research areas; added new technologies and capabilities for re-configuration of HCC
Shared Resources; and supported 3 Staff Investigators who significantly contributed to research, clinical, and
educational efforts at HCC.
Developmental Funds leveraged institutional support and generated a significant return on investment, with
$948K CCSG funds allocated to 10 new faculty recruits over this grant period, generating a total of $19.5M in
external awards and clinical trials; a 20.5-fold return on investment (ROI). The $19.5M includes $7.5M million
in NCI funding, an ROI of 7.9-fold on the invested CCSG funds. Given the successful use of Developmental
Funds in the current project period, we request $534,736 per year to be used in the following categories: 1)
Recruit faculty in areas of strategic need to strengthen basic, clinical, translational, and population sciences
research; 2) Support pilot projects that allow HCC scientists to pursue innovative, high-risk ideas or work in
high priority research areas, including team science projects; 3) Develop new Shared Resources or
capabilities, such as the Microbiome Facility and Population Survey Facility; and, 4) Support CCSG Research,
Clinical, and Early-Stage Clinical Staff Investigators to drive collaboration, science, and clinical activity across
the HCC."
10900457,"PROJECT SUMMARY
ORC-13661 is a new chemical entity being developed to prevent hearing loss in patients exposed to
aminoglycoside antibiotics (AGs). AGs are an important class of broad spectrum antibiotics especially
effective against gram-negative bacteria and Mycobacteria. Unfortunately, as many as 20% of patients
administered parenteral AGs for over 5 days suffer permanent, measurable hearing loss, as do upwards of
60% of patients on long term therapy. Largely because of the ototoxic side effects, AGs are currently
administered only for life threatening situations or where they are the only effective treatment. At this time
there are no FDA approved drugs that have been shown to prevent any form of sensorineural hearing loss.
Preventing AG-induced hearing loss would be of enormous benefit patients currently being treated with AGs. It
would also allow this inexpensive and effective but underused class of antibiotics to be used more routinely.
Oral ORC-13661was developed from a small molecule screen aimed finding a way to mitigate AG-induced hair
cell toxicity. It is robustly effective at preventing hearing loss in rats treated with prolonged high dose AGs.
ORC-13661 has completed nonclinical evaluation and Phase 1 testing in normal healthy volunteers.
Pulmonary and disseminated non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM) infections are chronic infectious diseases
that develop progressively over time, and require prolonged parenteral AG therapy to achieve control or a cure.
Current guidelines recommend parenteral aminoglycoside (AG) therapy, usually a 90 day course of amikacin,
for patients with severe manifestations of the disease, particularly bronchiectasis.
We propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2 study of ORC-13661
administered orally in conjunction with intravenously administered amikacin to patients with severe NTM
infections. The goal of this to evaluate the efficacy of ORC-13661 for mitigation or prevention of ototoxicity.
Primary and secondary endpoints are changes in between baseline measures if hearing thresholds and
hearing in noise taken prior to drug treatment and after treatment is discontinued in groups of patients treated
with amikacin alone or with amikacin plus ORC-13661. Additional evaluations will changes in patient perceived
hearing and balance health and the safety and tolerability of ORC-13661 in patients with NTM as assessed by
AEs, clinical laboratory findings, vital signs, and electrocardiogram (ECG)."
10898105,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Racial disparities in adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth and low birth weight have persisted for
generations in the United States. In attempts to explain birth outcomes and disparities, researchers have
identified a mother’s own birth outcome as a strong predictor of her infant’s later birth outcome, yet the strength
of this intergenerational health association has been measured as stronger for Black women than White women
in the United States. This racial difference signals a potential etiology: since race is a social, not a biological,
construct, disparities must be attributable not to racial differences in inherited genetic predisposition, but instead
to racial differences in the persistence of social risk factors across generations. Understanding of this potential
mechanism requires adoption of a life course approach, which involves measurement of exposures across the
life course of a mother. One such measurement could be her change in socioeconomic position over time, which
can be conceptualized as social mobility. Social mobility is important to study because it may both be differentially
attainable but also differentially impactful on health for Black and White women because of structural racism, or
the systemic reinforcement of racial inequality. Few studies have adopted longitudinal exposures like social
mobility, instead focusing on the impact of exposures during pregnancy on birth outcomes. This proposal will
address knowledge gaps by leveraging a unique multigenerational dataset of maternally linked birth certificates
from 1989-2020 in South Carolina. Specifically, this proposal hypothesizes that racial disparities in social
mobility may explain measured racial disparities in the intergenerational association of birth outcomes.
Aim 1 will examine the intergenerational association between maternal and infant birth outcomes and differences
in the association by race. Aim 2 will evaluate differences in social mobility trajectories by race and determine
the association between social mobility and adverse birth outcomes, including differences by race. Aim 3 will
determine how accounting for social mobility trajectories, in addition to generation-specific risk factors, affects
racial disparities in the intergenerational association of birth outcomes. This fellowship will provide the PI with
mentorship and rigorous methodological and clinical training in social epidemiology, sociology, and obstetrics
and gynecology at a highly ranked and well supported institution. Long-term, this fellowship will prepare the PI
to investigate the structural and social etiologies of health inequities in her future career as an independent
physician-scientist."
10929507,"Project Summary/Abstract: The broad, long term objective is to identify host-protective mechanisms that
counter pathogen-initiated lung inflammation and injury. Many pathogens secrete proteases to cause direct
damage to the lung, but bacteria, fungi and viruses can also co-opt host proteases to increase pathogenicity
and promote lung injury. We have studied Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) as a model of infection-induced
injury to probe how a pathogen-encoded protease called Pseudomonas elastase LasB, a metalloprotease
released into the extracellular milieu by the PA type II secretion system, induces lung tissue damage and
secondary trigger of host-derived serine proteases such as neutrophil elastase (NE). We previously identified
thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), a matricellular protein secreted by a variety of cells following injury that disarms
both pathogen-encoded LasB and host protease NE, to limit lung injury and inflammation. Key questions that
have arisen from this work is how an unregulated proteolytic environment drives excessive inflammatory
response and dysregulated repair following injury, and what are the host factors that calibrate this response in
the lung. Our preliminary findings suggest that a feed-forward neutrophilic inflammatory response occurs in the
proteolytic environment of PA infection through N-terminal processing of IL-36γ that is exaggerated in the
absence of TSP-1. Moreover, platelet TSP-1 appears protective against PA-induced lung injury, but the precise
mechanism related to TSP-1's role at the alveolar-capillary interface remains unknown. Furthermore, we show
that PA elastase activity in clinical strains confer excessive inflammation and injury in mice and is associated
with worse clinical outcomes when compared with non-elastase producers. Based upon these findings, we
propose the following aims utilizing genetically deficient mice, cell-specific conditional knockout systems, and
PA clinical respiratory isolates obtained from the ICU to (1) elucidate the mechanisms by which TSP-1
counters the hyperinflammatory response mediated by proteolytic processing of the pro-inflammatory cytokine
IL-36γ; (2) examine the contribution of TSP-1 and platelet TSP-1 in protection against alveolar barrier
disruption and stabilization of the early provisional matrix following lung injury; (3) determine whether PA ICU
respiratory isolates with elastolytic properties drive unwarranted inflammation and persistent tissue injury in the
susceptible host. A better understanding of host biology during severe respiratory infection could prove useful
in the rational design of targeted therapeutics against pathogen-derived proteases and deregulated host
inflammation as adjuncts to current antimicrobial agents and supportive pulmonary and critical care
management."
10892813,"PROJECT SUMMARY
It is increasingly recognized that cerebrovascular dysfunction plays an important role in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) pathogenesis and cognitive decline, contributing to 70% of all dementias. Cerebral small vessel disease
(SVD) often occurs (up to 80%) in those with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the current markers of SVD risk
and progression are poor. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is a neuroimaging marker of vascular health which
indicates of the ability of the brain vessels to respond to neuronal demand or a vasoactive stimulus, such as
inhaled CO2. CVR shows promise as a marker of SVD and cognitive impairment, but some studies fail to see
an association between CVR and markers of abnormal brain aging. Increasing evidence suggests that the time
it takes for brain vessels to maximally respond to a stimulus, or CVRDELAY, may be a more sensitive of
cerebrovascular health than CVR. Further, due to technical and physiological factors, CVR is often only
quantified in the grey matter, and thus associations between white matter CVR and brain health are not well
characterized. Rather than traditional CVR processing which assumes uniformly timed reactivity to CO2 across
the entire brain parenchyma, we propose to use more novel time-delay processing to quantify CVR from
hypercapnic normoxic challenge blood-oxygen-level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging
(BOLD-fMRI) data. The purpose of this proposal is to better understand if time-delay processed CVR metrics
are associated with a faster longitudinal increase in SVD pathology and faster cognitive decline. In particular,
we will assess (1) if impaired CVR and elevated CVRDELAY in the cerebral white matter relate a faster increase
in white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) burden, and (2) if impaired
CVR and elevated CVRDELAY in grey matter lobar regions of interest are related to faster longitudinal cognitive
decline in specific cognitive domains. To fulfill the research aims of this F31 application, we will leverage
exceptional resources from the Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer’s Center, Vanderbilt Memory & Aging Project,
Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science, Vanderbilt Advanced Computing Center for Research and
Education, and the Vanderbilt Brain Institute. The candidate, Hudson Robb, will carry out the proposed
research with the support of an interdisciplinary mentorship team, including experts in the neurobiology of
Alzheimer’s disease and small vessel disease, geriatric neuropsychology, neuroscience, and brain MRI. The
parallel training plan will provide the candidate with the necessary knowledge and skillset to complete the
proposed research aims and develop into a successful neuroscientist working at the neurobiological
intersection of SVD, AD, and cognitive impairment. Results from this research will offer crucial insight into
associations between a relatively novel biomarker of vascular function and SVD and cognitive impairment."

Next generation sequencing is a central tool in the analysis of signaling pathways important in development and
disease. The Genome Sequencing Core (GSC) was established in Phase 1 of the CMADP to provide
researchers at the University of Kansas and the state of Kansas with next-generation sequencing technologies
as well as expertise in experimental design and analysis of sequence data. Projects in the GSC include whole
genome assembly, genome re-sequencing for identification of mutations important in development and disease,
transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), variant mapping and genotyping, and identification of transcription factor
interaction sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with DNA sequencing (ChIP seq). The GSC
houses Illumina MiSeq and NextSeq 550 sequencers with dedicated processor and storage space to run the
instruments. To keep the GSC on the cutting edge of technology, a NextSeq 2000 instrument will be installed in
the summer of 2021 to enhance and expand services.
Next generation sequencing is an enabling technology in that it has the power to allow investigators from many
different disciplines to ask new questions in their research areas of interest. The GSC enables genomics
research at the University of Kansas by eliminating the barriers of cost and communication involved with using
off-campus facilities. The GSC has been utilized by a broad user base at the University of Kansas, including
Molecular Biosciences, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the Natural History Museum, Engineering, Pharmacy,

the future sustainability of the GSC after Phase 3 as a University Core Research Laboratory."
10901904,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The hippocampus is composed of cytoarchitecturally-distinct subfields that support specific memory and learning
functions. Evidence suggests distinct developmental trajectories in hippocampal subfields throughout childhood
and adolescence, periods in which environmental factors exact strong influence on brain development. However,
evidence is largely from cross-sectional samples, is based on inconsistent practices for delineations of subfields,
and is limited by the power and diversity within single studies. Thus, developmental trajectories of hippocampal
subfields remain unclear, prohibiting the systematic study of the influence of environmental factors on
hippocampal development. Variations in total hippocampal volume across development have been linked to
socioeconomic status, a proxy for access to material resources, medical care, and quality education in one’s
environment. Low household socioeconomic status in childhood is associated with worse cognitive abilities later
in adulthood, and low neighborhood socioeconomic status (an additional index of social capital and
connectedness) further predicts poor behavioral outcomes beyond the household, especially in adolescence.
The proposed study examines differential vulnerability of hippocampal subfield structures to variations in
household and neighborhood socioeconomic across development. Understanding of normative developmental
changes in subfield structure and vulnerability to low socioeconomic environments can have significant
implications for individual and community interventions. However, testing these questions requires a large
sample size, adequate coverage of age, specialized ultra-high-resolution scans, and sufficient representation of
the diverse United States population. The proposed study will achieve this using integrative data analysis, an
advanced latent modeling approach that directly addresses differences in methodologies while allowing new
hypotheses to be tested in existing data. Hypotheses will be tested using a novel integrated longitudinal dataset
of 678 typically developing subjects covering the span of 4- to- 25-years from four geographically- and
demographically-diverse sites across the United States by pursuing these specific aims: Aim 1) Characterize
typical developmental trajectories of hippocampal subfields in a diverse multi-site study pediatric sample; and
Aim 2) Elucidate the link between variations in socioeconomic status and the development of hippocampal
subfields. The hippocampus is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as depression, schizophrenia,
and low SES also confers risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. Thus, obtaining accurate characterization of
hippocampal subfield development trajectories and identifying the effects of household and neighborhood SES
in a large sample will pave the way for early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders and targeted
intervention for specific factors associated with socioeconomic disparity. Further, the successful application of
integrative data analysis to neuroimaging data from multiple studies will demonstrate a means to leverage
existing data to answer critical questions otherwise not feasible in individual studies."
10899231,"Project Summary
 Stroke poses a major public health concern as a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. A known
cause of ischemic stroke is cervical carotid artery stenosis (CAS), where atherosclerotic plaque can rupture and
directly embolize to the brain. Although there exists an efficacious surgical intervention for primary prevention of
ischemic stroke secondary to CAS, a critical barrier to progress is the inability to predict which patient populations
may benefit from early surgery. This has necessitated a continued search for the etiology of CAS progression.
Although genetic studies have been leveraged to better understand similar atherosclerotic diseases, the genetic
exploration of CAS has been limited to poorly defined phenotypes and clinically insignificant CAS. This proposal
is designed to explore the genetic underpinnings of CAS and stratify high risk patients in need of early surgery.
 Comparing and contrasting the genetic architecture of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic CAS will
allow identification of novel loci associated with the transition from asymptomatic to symptomatic CAS.
Preliminary data shows adequate power for the two genome wide association studies (GWAS) proposed, as
diagnoses codes defined symptomatic CAS yields 7,300 patients to compare to healthy controls and
asymptomatic CAS yields 10,000 patients to compare to healthy controls (Aim 1b). Given diagnoses codes
related to asymptomatic CAS are particularly subject to error, the asymptomatic CAS phenotype will be further
improved with additional carotid ultrasound parameters to ensure presence of clinically significant CAS (Aim 1a).
The cohorts used, including Massachusetts General Biobank, Penn Medicine Biobank, United Kingdom Biobank,
the Million Veterans Program, and AllOfUs, all have available carotid ultrasound information. To further risk
stratify patients with CAS for surgery, the previously validated ischemic polygenic risk score (PRS) will be applied
to a population of clinically significant CAS and tested for accuracy in selecting patients with symptomatic CAS
(Aim 2a). A new multi-ancestry multi-trait PRS will be generated and tested in conjunction with clinical
characteristics for improvement in selection of symptomatic CAS (Aim 2b). CAS resulting in stroke is one of
many end-point atherosclerotic diseases that can be studied jointly to identify novel pleiotropic genetic
architecture common to all diseases. A multi-trait analysis of CAS, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery
disease, and ischemic stroke will facilitate discovery of loci that unify atherosclerosis across multiple vascular
beds, providing opportunities for prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis (Aim 3).
 Completion of this proposal will pave the way for tailored therapeutic interventions to prevent CAS
progression, generate risk stratification tools for preventative surgery selection, and provide a broader
understanding of the progression of atherosclerosis across different vascular beds. Through guidance from
skilled mentors, the skills acquired will position the PI well to become an independently funded investigator."
10902064,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 5% of adolescents (~3.5 million in the US alone) suffer from high impact chronic musculoskeletal (MSK)
pain, affecting all life domains and posing a significant economic burden. Current treatments for chronic MSK
pain are suboptimal and have been tied to the opioid crisis. Only ~50% of adolescents with chronic MSK pain
who present for multidisciplinary pain treatment recover, as measured by clinical endpoints of pain severity and
functional disability. Discovery of robust markers of the recovery vs. persistence of pain and disability is
essential to develop more resourceful and patient-specific treatment strategies and to conceive novel
approaches that benefit patients who are refractory. Given that chronic pain is a biopsychosocial process, the
discovery and validation of a prognostic and robust signature for pain recovery vs. persistence requires
measurements across multiple dimensions in the same patient cohort in combination with a suitable ‘big data’
computational analysis pipeline for the extraction of reliable and cross-validated results from a multilayered and
complex dataset. We are well positioned to execute the study aims with: (1) A highly skilled and experienced
team of scientists and clinicians from Stanford University, University of Toronto/Hospital for Sick Children, and
Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center; (2) A standardized specimen collection, processing, storage, and
distribution system, leveraging Stanford Biobank’s platform, BioCatalyst, to aggregate the sample inventory with
clinical annotations for an accessible, virtual biobank, within the Signature of Pain Recovery IN Teens (SPRINT)
Biobank and Analysis Core (SBAC); (3) Cutting-edge preliminary data implicating novel candidates for
neuroimaging, immune, quantitative sensory, and psychological markers for discovery; and (4) Expertise in
machine learning approaches to extract reliable and prognostic bio-signatures from a large and complex data
set. We expect that the results from this project will facilitate risk stratification in patients with chronic MSK, a
more resourceful selection of patients who are likely to respond for undergoing current multidisciplinary pain
treatment approaches, and new insight into biological and behavioral processes that may be exploited to develop
novel strategies profiting those who are refractory. For the R61/Discovery Phase Aim individuals will be
thoroughly characterized via biological (i.e. brain structure and function, immune, sensory profiles), psychological
state, and clinical endpoint (i.e., pain intensity, disability) data. Unbiased machine learning algorithms will identify
a multivariate model comprised of the most prognostic biological, psychological, and clinical endpoints. The
model will classify adolescents with and without resolving chronic MSK pain after a state-of-the art
multidisciplinary pain treatment intervention. R33/Validation Phase Aim will validate the biological signature
derived in the R61 study. This signature will be useful for a range of adolescent-based clinical trials in which
identification of the highest risk individuals is necessary, providing a clinically actionable intervention algorithm."
10891017,"Abstract
Advanced neuroimaging techniques have shown the impacts of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology
propagation and their structural repercussions in the brain. Recent studies show that unimpaired individuals
who have advanced amyloid and tau pathology in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) are more at risk for
developing mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These discoveries suggest the presence of vulnerable brain
regions that serve as an initial focal point for the spread of AD pathology. Recent developments in
connectomics and spatial transcriptomics now allow us to identify individual cell types within the MTL and
investigate the subcellular molecular changes that occur throughout AD progression. Identifying susceptible
cell types within MTL will reveal potential targets for early treatment intervention. Within the MTL, entorhinal
cortex (ENT) connections with CA1 in the hippocampus are particularly affected by AD and related to cognitive
impairment. From CA1, it is believed that amyloid and tau propagate through neural circuits to other brain
structures, leading to a neurodegenerative cascade as it extends to additional brain regions. Establishing and
characterizing distinct neuronal changes in CA1 projection neuron cell types, in the presence of amyloid, can
reveal novel targets with the aim of mitigating or even halting the progression of AD at its earliest stages. We
hypothesize that a neural circuit from entorhinal CA1 neurons that project to other memory-related brain
structures are specifically susceptibility points to AD. To unveil vulnerable CA1 neurons and understand
alterations in their morphological characteristics, we will used advanced viral tracing methods and cutting-edge
microscopy imaging to identify and reconstruct 3D ENT→CA1 cell-type specific circuits to analyze distinct
pathway changes in AD mouse models. After identifying susceptible cell types, we will use MERFISH spatial
transcriptomics to investigate the molecular changes to AD-relevant genes within CA1 neurons. Overall, this
study will establish cell type specific neural circuits that are susceptible to AD pathology and reveal the
subcellular response of these cell types throughout the progression of disease."

Neurons that control rhythmic movements like walking reside within the spinal cord in the central pattern
generator (CPG), and thus understanding this CPG has been a major focus of rehabilitation efforts after spinal
cord injury (SCI). However, the prerequisites for walking are steady postural tone and ability to stand, which
are permanently lost following spinal cord injury. While standing to reach or make wheelchair transfers is
arguably a more important function to restore than walking after SCI, little is known about the spinal circuits
that control posture. However, in the course of our recent survey of neurons that generate muscle spasms in
mice, we unexpectedly found that excitatory propriospinal commissural neurons (PSC neurons) that express
the Sim1 transcription factor (V3 neurons) produce robust standing when they are optogenetically, including in
mice that are otherwise paralysed after SCI. PSC neurons may be ideally suited to maintaining posture, as
they directly innervate extensor motoneurons throughout the limb and axial muscles, and are innervated
extensively by sensory and supraspinal inputs, seemingly bypassing the CPG, though we know little about
their control. Since PSC neurons (including V3) have unique anatomical and functional connections and
properties, they can be readily identified in mice and cats, and so we will start by recording the firing properties
of these neurons prior to injury in the decerebrate unanesthetized animals that spontaneously exhibit a
standing posture. We will test the hypothesis that prior to SCI, PSC neurons are driven tonically by supraspinal
inputs to maintain posture and phasically by sensory feedback to correct for disturbances, but this supraspinal
drive is lost with acute SCI. We also hypothesize that after chronic SCI increased excitability in these neurons
helps restore some phasic sensory-evoked postural tone that may be promoted by stimulating nerves that
innervate PSC neurons or by direct optogenetic V3 activation. This will be examined both in awake mice with
optogenetic activation or inhibition of V3 neurons where we will record limb kinematics and EMG, and in the
isolated whole adult in vitro spinal cord where we will making direct intracellular recordings from V3 neurons
and the motoneurons they innervate. Finally, we will examine whether the postural standing that can be
obtained by sensory evoked V3 neuron activation can be used as a basis for training mice to walk after SCI,
and explore whether the action of treatments like epidural spinal cord stimulation function by activating PSC
neurons. Overall, these experiments will shed light on how spinal postural motor circuits are controlled by
propriospinal neurons, and how these neurons can be harnessed to develop new treatments for SCI."

neuroblastoma (NB) is of particular relevance, since it is the most common solid cancer in children outside of
the skull and it still kills about 40% of patients diagnosed with the most aggressive forms. Therefore, there is a
clear need to improve the treatment for this deadly disease. Development of more potent immunotherapies could
improve outcome for these patients. PREMISE. Natural killer (NK) cells, especially when “activated” (aNK cells)
mediate direct cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). All cell types release
extracellular vesicles called exosomes that contain biologically active components (proteins, DNA, mRNA, and
non-coding RNAs including miRs) that can be delivered to recipient cells and influence their functions. Exosomes
released by aNK cells, could increase the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in NB. Little is known about human
aNK cell-derived exosomes, their therapeutic potential and role as biomarkers of response to
chemoimmunotherapy in NB. Our group was the first to show that microRNAs (miRs) in aNK-derived exosomes
are able to kill NB cells. OUR DATA. We can propagate and activate blood NK cells from normal donors and
patients with NB using K562-mbIL21 artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) plus IL-2. We discovered that
these aNK cells release large quantities of exosomes and that purified aNK exosomes are cytotoxic for NB cell
lines. We also have preliminary evidence that aNK-derived exosomes contain miRs that contribute to the
cytotoxic effect of aNK-exosomes. We also observed that children affected by NB responsive to
chemoimmunotherapy, present markers of aNK activation in their blood. We hypothesize that aNK-derived
exosomes kill NB cells through the exosomal transfer of MYCN-, AURKA-, TGFBR1- and TGFBR2-targeting
miRs, and that these miRs can be exploited to develop an anti-tumor effect and implement the efficacy of
chemoimmunotherapy for NB patients. We also hypothesize that specific circulating and exosomal miRs can be
exploited as biomarkers of response to chemoimmunotherapy in children affected by NB. These hypotheses will
be tested in the following Specific Aims: 1) To study cytotoxicity mechanisms and therapeutic efficacy of aNK-
derived exosomes alone and combined with chemoimmunotherapy in NB; 2) To assess association of NK-
exosomal miRs, circulating RNAs, and gene expression profiles with response in patients treated on
chemoimmunotherapy regimens. SUMMARY. We focus upon a completely new immunotherapeutic strategy
using human miR-enriched aNK exosomes. The results of this study will provide important information for
producing highly cytotoxic aNK exosomes which could potentiate efficacy of existing chemoimmunotherapy. This
study will also identify new exosomal RNA cargo able to stratify neuroblastoma patients for response to
chemoimmunotherapy."

The genomics of Alzheimer Disease is complex and evidence to date suggests that different ancestry groups
have distinct genetic factors that influence risk. In this project, we will perform multiple statistical analyses of
generated genetic data in African American, African, and Hispanic/Latinx populations to identify genetic factors
that are distinct within those groups. We will develop and apply new methods for identifying regulatory elements
and leveraging admixed chromosomes that are features of these populations. Finally, we will summarize results
through polygenic and pathway analyses to identify specific molecular mechanisms that harbor genetic variants
influence Alzheimer risk in each of these populations."

 In this proposal we will use the new NIDDK Institutional Network Award (U2C/TL1) to develop a training
program in kidney, urologic or hematologic (KUH) research that differs from the traditional approach of
specialization in one of these disciplines by creating a dynamic, interdisciplinary KUH training program. Our
overarching goal is to provide an educational environment that fosters the development of a new cadre of KUH
investigators with a broad-based, interdisciplinary understanding of KUH research.
 To achieve this goal, we propose the development of a “New York Consortium for Interdisciplinary
Training in Kidney, Urological and Hematological Research”, the “NYC Train KUHR”. This training program will
bring together investigators from four of the leading medical schools in the NYC metropolitan area; the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine, the Columbia University Irving Medical Center, the Icahn School of Medicine at
Mount Sinai and the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. The NYC Train KUHR will
include over 100 preceptors across the four institutions with varied and complementary research expertise,
thereby breaking down traditional silos that exist between the KUH disciplines and institutions. At full capacity
the consortium will train 9 pre-doctoral and 16 post-doctoral trainees. The training is supported by 4 Cores: the
Administrative, Professional Development, Networking and Training Cores. The Administrative Core will include
a 3 Core Leaders, a Director of Recruitment and Admissions, a Pilot Projects Program Coordinator, a Diversity
Officer, a Wellness Officer, a Program Evaluator and an administrator and administrative assistant to support
the missions of NYC Train KUHR. The Administrative Core will use frequent communication to achieve its goals
including facilitate monthly meetings of the Executive Committee and meetings of the other Committees.
 The Administrative Core’s Specific Aims are to (1) support the leadership team and missions of the NYC
Train KUHR Networking, Professional Development and Training Cores; (2) organize and support the meetings
and work of the committees supporting the missions of the NYC Train KUHR program; (3) maintain a robust
evaluation program that fosters the continuous improvement of the Cores; (4) organize and manage an
intramural NYC Train KUHR pilot project award program to incentivize interdisciplinary collaborations, and (5)
organize an annual meeting between all awardees across the United States that are funded by NIDDK U2C/TL1
awards, with the goal to further promote interdisciplinary interactions and networking among all KUH trainees.
The national meeting will include research presentations by trainees and multiple networking and professional
development opportunities. This Administrative Core will provide the support necessary for NYC Train KUHR to
provide outstanding and innovative interdisciplinary training in KUH research."
10892951,"Abstract
 The overall goal of the Professional Development Core is to develop and support activities and curricula
designed to enhance trainee competitiveness in research. We will use the new U2C/TL1 award mechanism to
transform the traditionally siloed training in kidney, urologic and hematologic research into a dynamic, interdisci-
plinary KUH training program. We will create an educational environment that fosters the development of a new
cadre of KUH investigators who will not only excel in their areas of expertise but will recognize the value of
interdisciplinary collaboration and be equipped to build on mutual expertise to advance knowledge in KUH dis-
eases. To achieve this goal, we will leverage the experience and excellence in research and training in Nephrol-
ogy, Urology, and Hematology from the NYC Train KUHR member programs at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and the Renais-
sance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. Each NYC Train KUHR institution contributes unique and
complementary strengths in research and training, including expertise in stem cell research, genomics, animal
models, epidemiology, bioengineering and clinical trials, thereby breaking down traditional silos that exist be-
tween the KUH disciplines and institutions. The program will utilize state of the art evidence-based practices in
adult education, including innovative training in communication skills, independent development plans, KUH-
specific mock study sections for trainee grants, monthly interdisciplinary works-in-progress and journal clubs,
pilot grant funds, and yearly scientific symposium to encourage interdisciplinary research.
 In Specific Aim 1, we will create a robust professional development program for trainees funded by the
NYC Train KUHR program. We will leverage existing institutional resources and create new professional devel-
opment programs to develop trainees into future leaders in academic medicine. Oral communication skills will
be cultivated through regularly scheduled journal clubs, work-in-progress presentations, Big Brother/ Big Sister
program, and workshops sponsored by the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science. Written communica-
tion skills will be enhanced through a grant writing course and subsequent mock study sections specific for pre-
and postdoctoral trainees. Finally, an interdisciplinary mentorship team will be established for each trainee,
stressing the importance of team science. In Specific Aim 2, we will create a robust professional development
program for Preceptors. This program will include training before starting mentorship activities, continuous pro-
fessional development as well as remediation for preceptors who may receive unsatisfactory evaluations from
trainees. The robust and innovative education and support for trainees and preceptors provided by the Profes-
sional Development Core will ensure that trainees supported by NYC Train KUHR will have the skills necessary
to become independent investigators conducting KUH-related research."

 The overall goal of the Networking Core is to provide the infrastructure to support communication and men-
toring for trainees supported directly through the TL1 training component of this award. In addition, the Net-
working Core will play a key role in facilitating the Administrative, the Professional Development and the Train-
ing Cores to implement their Specific Aims, and enable the development of interdisciplinary collaborations
across the four Institutions of the consortium (Albert Einstein College of Medicine “Einstein”, Columbia Univer-
sity Irving Medical Center “Columbia”, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai “Mount Sinai” and the Renais-
sance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University “Stony Brook”). Through newly established local and na-
tional outreach programs, we will develop awareness of the significant societal impact that KUH disease has
on a patients’ well-being and highlight the opportunities to perform KUH research at our consortium. This ap-
proach will ensure a pipeline of future investigators entering this rapidly expanding field. Furthermore, the Net-
working Core will efficiently disseminate new results and technologies, promote mentoring and foster collabo-
rations across the wider KUH research community, a critical imperative given the competitiveness of funding in
current times and issues with rigor and reproducibility.
 In order to achieve these goals, the Networking Core will have four Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1
will establish virtual platforms facilitating trainee education and interaction. This will primarily be accomplished
through an interactive website and use of social media platforms (such as Twitter). Specific Aim 2 will have as
a goal developing and promoting inter-departmental crosstalk and team science. In conjunction with the Train-
ing Core, established and novel educational tools will be harnessed to encourage interdisciplinary collabora-
tions across the four Institutions of the consortium. Specific Aim 3 has the goal of building awareness of the
opportunities to conduct KUH research and the training available at NYC Train KUHR to ensure a pipeline of
future investigators entering the field. It will also employ tools that ensure alumni of the program remain con-
nected to the program even after they leave. Specific Aim 4 will coordinate the dissemination of research re-
sults and technology to improve scientific rigor and reproducibility.
 In sum, the Networking Core will foster a community between the trainees and faculty involved in NYC
Train KUHR to increase knowledge, interdisciplinary interaction and familiarity with the various research pro-
grams offered at each institution creating synergy between the four Institutions and a myriad of interdisciplinary
collaborations of the consortium. These educational and networking activities will ensure that the four Institu-
tions work together synergistically, and come together as a consortium that is far greater than the sum of its
parts."

The Research Education Component (REC) will cultivate a dynamic
learning environment to advance substantive knowledge, methodological
skills, and the overall research experience of junior faculty and fellows
around aging and the primary care management of older adults with
multiple chronic conditions (MCC).
The REC will offer comprehensive, tailored research education activities to
leverage geriatrics principles and train a primary care workforce to meet the
nation's need to serve older Americans with MCC. With a significant shortage of
geriatricians, the struggle of primary care practices to deliver high quality, cost-
effective services to older Americans who are contending with MCC will worsen.
The REC directors, other affiliated faculty and community mentors will help implement the Core's goals. The
Pepper Scholars Program's (PSP) primary aim will be to: (1) Develop programs with robust mentoring teams
to assess educational needs of junior faculty `Pepper Scholars', and provide them with personalized educational
and career development opportunities for conducting research related to the care of older adults with MCC. Our
mentoring faculty bridge disciplines, centers, departments and schools across Northwestern University and
partner with an extensive set of healthcare system, other academic, community, government organizations and
industry partners to train future leaders in aging & geriatrics research. The PSP's secondary aims are to:
(2) Provide Northwestern OAIC trainees with hands-on experiences leading a funded research project that will
give them preliminary data in support of their larger research agenda. To do this, we have strategically paired
the REC with the Pilot/Exploratory Studies Core (PESC). Selected Pepper Scholars will receive R03 equivalent
funding and `in-kind' support from three innovative Research Cores (Design, Measurement, Analytics) that will
provide state-of-the-art methodological guidance; (3) Link Pepper Scholars and other trainees to a broad network
of academic, healthcare, community, government and industry partners to expand their professional connections
through the efforts of the Information Dissemination Core. REC and PESC faculty will coordinate the training and
pilot programs, tailor mentor teams, and track educational growth of trainees. Through a competitive process,
we have already selected the 1st wave of Pepper Scholars (Drs. Rowe, O'Brien, Kim, O'Conor, Rafferty).
Our REC includes a robust group of experienced faculty mentors with broad expertise, and a research
education infrastructure to exceptionally train the next generation of innovative aging research leaders."

University Clinical and Translational Sciences (NUCATS) Institute. An External Advisory Board will convene bi-
annually to review the progress of our new Pepper Center and provide objective feedback on how we might
further expand our impact. We have also intentionally linked the LAC + IDC. The LAC specific aims are to:
Aim 1 Establish the Northwestern Pepper Center and advance an innovative, applied research agenda
 focused on improving primary care for older adults with MCC.
Aim 2 Expand the Northwestern Pepper Center network of collaborators, and stimulate new research and
 education opportunities to address current issues related to primary care models for MCC.
Aim 3 Continually monitor and comprehensively evaluate Northwestern Pepper Center activities and its
 progress towards established goals.
The LAC will manage daily operations and external communications, and challenge Northwestern Pepper Center
faculty to consider how best to serve the national OAIC Network to uniquely contribute to the science related to
geriatrics-informed, primary care management of older adults with MCC to improve function and independence.
To do this, LAC faculty and staff will regularly encourage its Cores to collaborate with one another and find new,
innovative ways to leverage their expertise and functions in partnerships with the many involved, affiliated
external partners, other OAICs, and aging centers. Working with the IDC, the LAC will continually promote and
disseminate Center research and its available services, and be responsible for routinely monitoring and reporting
on Northwestern's OAIC progress towards clearly defined and measurable Pepper Center goals."

Heart disease is the leading cause of death for individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). DMD is
a devastating and progressive neuromuscular disease with no known cure. This X-linked genetic disorder
affects nearly 1 in 5000 boys and manifests as debilitating muscle weakness and progressive cardiomyopathy
(CM). While CM in some individuals with DMD progresses rapidly and fatally in their teenage years, others can
live relatively symptom-free into their thirties or forties. Early identification and treatment can improve quality
and length of life, but currently, there are no standard imaging biomarkers that can detect early onset or rapidly
progressing DMD CM. Additionally, research in this area has lagged due to small population study sizes and
limited standardized imaging data. To that end, this project will utilize the largest standardized imaging data
registry of DMD CM created through the collaboration of 6 of the largest medical institutions with DMD CM
expertise. Following the objective set up by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to
“develop and optimize novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to prevent, treat, and cure HLBS
diseases” we propose the following Aim: 1) Identify imaging biomarkers of DMD CM onset and progression
using novel image analysis. Utilizing recently developed methods of spatiotemporal analysis of 4D (3D plus
time) cardiac imaging data, we can evaluate localized kinematic parameters in the heart that may be sensitive
to subtle changes in disease physiology. With this project we also follow a second major objective set forth by
NHBLI to “Leverage emerging opportunities in data science to open new frontiers in HLBS research”
through another Aim: 2) Apply deep learning neural network to DMD registry to evaluate CM onset and
progression. Utilizing the large DMD CM imaging registry, we will apply deep learning techniques for
automated segmentation and analysis of cardiac parameters to evaluate patterns of early-onset and rapid
progression. These results will help to bridge a crucial gap in optimizing clinical treatment for a devastating
pediatric disease and pave the way for future research and innovation through the definition of robust imaging

This application seeks support to develop the next generation of the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) ecosystem, an open-source library spanning multiple software packages and programming languages that houses top-performing algorithms used worldwide by a large community of researchers. The core software library, ANTs, is built upon and contributes to the well-known NIH-funded Insight Toolkit (ITK), which has historically been a significant resource of open-source algorithmic and software innovation. Over the course of its decade-long development, ANTs has enabled hundreds of academic and industrial scientists to meet modern quantitative imaging needs with particular focus on issues in biomedical imaging-a broad range of applications and published research literature sample the study of organisms from small animals to humans as well as target organ systems such as respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous. Today, ANTs is a freely available, cross-platform toolkit for multiple modality image processing which continues to set the standard in the field. However, despite its success in meeting the real-world needs of a broad community of investigators, the rapidly growing use of imaging, and the associated need to solve ever more complex image registration problems, require a dynamic update of ANTs in order to meet current and emerging needs of the biomedical research community. This major update, representing the first ever application for dedicated funding support of ANTs development, will comprise of the four specific aims of this project: 1) to significantly broaden the range of multiple modality registration tasks able to benefit from AN Ts-based solutions; 2) to modernize and expand the tool's support of very large datasets and scalable computing platforms; 3) to provide reference registration protocols and validate their reliability in investigator-driven research studies; and 4) to enhance support and outreach to the user community. These developments will ensure the long-term viability of ANTs in the face of significant advancements in computing and imaging technologies, as well as enable an even broader research audience to leverage ANTs in their scientific output."

 Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) is a rapidly growing NTM causing skin and soft tissue infections
and pulmonary infections in patients with chronic lung damage. It stands apart as one of the most antibiotic
resistant microbial species, making its infections incredibly difficult to treat. A combination of an oral
macrolide and the aminoglycoside, amikacin, comprises the frontline treatment against Mab. Therapy is
prolonged and low cure rates are deplorable. The poor efficacies of these antibiotics result from various
mechanisms of intrinsic resistance induced in Mab upon exposure to drugs as well as the host
environment.
 Recently we showed that MabHflX, a conserved ribosome-associated GTPase, is required for
macrolide-lincosamide resistance (4). The absence of HflX in a DMs_hflX deletion strain results in an
increased population of 70S ribosomes suggesting that HflX is involved in dissociation of ribosomes stalled
in the presence of antibiotics. However, the detailed mechanism of HflX-mediated antibiotic resistance, as
well as the mechanisms by which antibiotic-bound ribosomal subunits are recycled remain unknown. In
another study we demonstrated a role for ARE-ABCF proteins in macrolide/lincosamide resistance. In Aim
1 of this proposal we will use a combination of genetic, biochemical and structural approaches to determine
the mechanisms of HflX and ABCF-mediated macrolide-lincosamide resistance.
 In another independent study, aminoglycoside resistance in zinc-starved M. smegmatis was found
to originate from ribosome hibernation, which involves binding of mycobacterial protein Y (MPY). We
hypothesize that a low-zinc host environment would similarly result in MPY-dependent ribosome
hibernation during Mab infection, and confer resistance to aminoglycosides including amikacin. In Aim 2
of this proposal, we will determine the role of MabMPY in aminoglycoside resistance of which could
potentially explain the observed discord between in vitro efficiency and in vivo efficacy of the current
treatments (Aim 2).
 The extreme innate antibiotic resistance of Mab presents a unique opportunity to study the
convergence of multiple resistance mechanisms in this pathogen. An in-depth understanding of these
various mechanisms is critical in the development of new therapeutic approaches towards treatment of
Mab infections."
10898910,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite substantial improvements in therapeutic strategies, generating robust anti-tumor immune responses in
human cancers with a lower somatic mutation burden remains a substantial challenge. Recent data indicate that
a critical player in this process, dendritic cells (DCs), fail to effectively elicit efficient and durable T cell responses
unless they have entered a unique state of hyperactivation. In this setting, DCs exhibit enhanced migration to
local lymph nodes (LNs) and sustained secretion of IL-1β, a cytokine critical for memory T cell formation. In
mouse tumor models, vaccination with whole tumor lysate plus an adjuvant consisting of the TLR 7/8 agonist
R848 (resiquimod) in combination with a unique isolated lysophosphatidylcholine (22:0 Lyso PC) promotes DC
hyperactivation, expansion of antigen specific CD8+ T cells, and robust rejection of tumors. While these findings
are encouraging and suggest that identification of specific neoantigens is not necessary to prime and expand a
pool of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs), validation and optimization of this approach necessitates the use of a model
system that more closely recapitulates human cancers with respect to immune landscape. As such, the purpose
of this proposal is to use spontaneous canine cancer, specifically osteosarcoma (OS), as a bridging
animal model to validate the utility of DC hyperactivation as a foundational element for generation of
robust anti-tumor immunity. The central hypothesis to be tested in this application is that combining
hyperactivation of DCs with WTL derived neoantigen will expand a diverse and tumor-specific population of CTLs
capable of eliminating residual microscopic metastatic OS tumor cells in dogs following primary tumor removal
(amputation). We further predict, that combining DC hyperactivation/WTL with a novel tumor microenvironment
(TME) conditioning regimen consisting of toceranib/losartan/ladarixin will enhance the objective response rate
in dogs that develop macroscopic lung metastasis. To accomplish this, we will conduct a prospective randomized
clinical trial in dogs with OS combining amputation and standard of care carboplatin chemotherapy with adjuvant
alone or adjuvant+WTL. Dogs that develop lung metastasis will then be treated with the TME conditioning
regimen in combination with adjuvant+WTL. A biobank of tissue samples and blood will be collected from dogs
enrolled in these trials including matched primary/metastatic tumors and associated LNs, whole blood, plasma,
PBMCs, cell-free DNA, and samples from the vaccine draining LNs. These will be used to perform a set of
complementary assays designed to characterize the immune microenvironment and tumor genome over the
course of relapse/resistance, credential a novel neoantigen prediction pipeline, and evaluate antigen specific T
cell responses. An outstanding team with complementary sets of expertise across clinical trials, translational
oncology, comparative genomics, and immuno-oncology has been assembled to ensure stated milestones are
achieved. This is bolstered by a dynamic collaboration with our industry partner, Corner Therapeutics, which is
committed to supporting this work to facilitate optimization and successful translation into human patients."

It is widely accepted that failure to restore pre-injury biomechanics after anterior cruciate ligament
reconstruction (ACL-R) surgery is one of the key contributing factors to the high prevalence of post-traumatic
osteoarthritis (PTOA). Precision rehabilitation, which refers to the delivery of the right feedback to the right
patient at the right time, is now a feasible approach for PTOA prevention given recent advances in wearable
sensing and computer vision technologies. Flexible and unobtrusive skin patches can objectively quantify
movement out of the clinic and deliver real-time haptic feedback, while simple videos from smartphones can
assess physical therapy quality and deliver corrective visual or auditory feedback. To effectively apply
emerging smart-health technologies toward PTOA prevention, the multi-modal and multivariate data produced
by these sensors must be distilled to identify digital biomarkers of PTOA that can be targeted with biofeedback
therapy in the future. Accordingly, the central objective of this proposed work is to determine if characteristics
of gait extracted from video and wearable sensors (digital biomarkers) can predict longitudinal changes in
cartilage microstructure (early PTOA) extracted from quantitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (qMRI). Our
central hypothesis is that future risk of PTOA can be predicted in the first few months after surgery using
passively collected data from wearable sensors and video. This hypothesis is supported by our previous work
on pre-arthritic subjects, where we demonstrated that wearable sensing data could predict detrimental changes
in cartilage microstructure that are indicative of OA risk. To accomplish the overall objective of this work,
physical therapy, natural environment ambulation, and cartilage health will be monitored longitudinally.
Exercise correctness during pre- and post-operative physical therapy will be quantified using computer vision
and machine learning algorithms. Out-of-lab movement will be monitored at baseline (3 weeks), 3, and 9
months after surgery with epidermal sensors placed on the thighs and shanks. Quantitative MRI data will be
collected at baseline (3 weeks), 3 and 18 months after the surgery. Specifically, we will determine (1) if gait
symmetry restoration measured by wearable sensors can predict qMRI changes up to 18 months post-surgery
and (2) if physical therapy quality, to the extent that is quantifiable with passive computer vision algorithms, can
predict gait symmetry restoration up to 9 months post-surgery. This work is innovative because it breaks with
the current norms of studying the role of biomechanics in PTOA in the laboratory. Instead, we will use
wearable sensing, computer vision, and machine learning to generate previously unavailable knowledge on the
role of natural environment biomechanics. If successful, this work could enable personalized, technology-
assisted rehabilitation—a paradigm shift in clinical care. Additionally, the discovery of new PTOA biomarkers
could improve the efficiency of clinical trials for new surgical techniques, while the proposed framework is also
extensible to the study and prevention of primary OA, and possibly other orthopaedic conditions."

Along with alcohol and tobacco, cannabis use amongst pregnant women is increasing in the United States.
Therefore, it is necessary to identify the persistent and transient effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on
neurobehavioral development and substance initiation during critical periods of development. Specifically,
developmental milestones and neurobehavioral disinhibition, independently serve as potential clinical markers
for later childhood behaviors and substance use. However, the roles of developmental milestones and
neurobehavioral disinhibition in the association between prenatal cannabis exposure and risk for
neurobehavioral dysregulation and adolescent substance initiation are largely unknown. Through the proposed
project we aim to (ia.) characterize gross motor developmental milestone attainment from ages 3 mths-2 yrs in
those exposed to prenatal cannabis to those unexposed; (ib.) evaluate milestone attainment as a mediator linking
prenatal cannabis exposure and neurobehavioral disinhibition; (iia.) evaluate the impact of prenatal cannabis
exposure on neurobehavioral disinhibition at age 9; and (iib.) examine the mediating role of neurobehavioral
disinhibition in the association between prenatal cannabis exposure and adolescent substance initiation (൑15
yrs). The proposed aims will be addressed using the nationally representative Adolescent Brain Cognitive
Development study data that includes measures of prenatal cannabis exposure, developmental milestones,
neurobehavioral disinhibition, and adolescent substance initiation. A propensity score will be used to control for
familial characteristics associated with the likelihood of being exposed to cannabis during pregnancy while
examining the direct effect of prenatal cannabis exposure on our proposed developmental outcomes. A
combination of path analysis and data reduction strategies will be employed to evaluate the direct and indirect
effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on early substance misuse. Overall, the proposed project will bridge the
gap in our current understanding of the impacts of prenatal cannabis exposure across development and how it
influences clinical markers that may aid in the early identification of children effected by prenatal cannabis
exposure as well as inform guidelines and interventions for expectant mothers."
10901949,"Project Summary
Identifying causal genes and cell types underlying disease etiologies are essential for designing targeted
diagnostic and treatment strategies. Genome-wide association study (GWAS), DNA-sequencing, and RNA-
sequencing studies have identified potentially causal genes in multiple human diseases. While these methods
provide disease-associated “gene lists”, they suffer from major shortcomings given the lack of cell-type
information. First, each tissue is composed of multiple cell types with diverse contributions to disease
phenotypes, and thus studies using bulk-tissue data alone result in the ambiguity of the causal cell populations.
Secondly, causal gene signals from rare cell types may be masked in bulk tissues. Finally, understanding
which genes are perturbed in which cell types is required for designing downstream functional studies. To
identify the gene-cell pairs driving human disease, systematic approaches to integrate patient-cohort data with
cell-type-specific data are urgently needed. My research program aims to identify causal genes and cell types
driving human diseases using multi-omics approaches. Our central hypothesis is that dysregulated genes
mapped to specific cell types drive disease etiologies. Previously, we developed algorithms that integrate
large-scale data of common and rare genomic variants, epigenomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes to identify
causal genes in tissue affecting specific cell types, providing strong biological and technical foundations for the
project. Further, the proposed approaches are empowered by rapidly-expanding cell-specific epigenomic and
transcriptomic data using sorted cell populations or single-cell profiling. In the next 5-year period, we will
specifically develop algorithms that integrate genomic findings from patient cohorts with cell-specific
transcriptomic data, addressing two major questions: (1) What are the gene-cell type pairs contributing to
disease etiologies? (2) How are expressions of disease-associated genes regulated at a single-cell
level? The proposed project will strongly impact the field by discovering gene-cell pairs associated with a wide
range of diseases for downstream investigation. The development will afford new methods to integrate purified
and single-cell transcriptome data to expand on findings from large-scale patient genomic cohorts. In the long
term, the successfully identified gene-cell pairs can be translated into diagnostic markers or treatment targets
of human disease."

morbidity among low-income minority children, gaps remain in our understanding of how best to translate and
scale up these efficacious interventions into sustainable, broad-based programs that reduce known asthma
health disparities. Head Start (HS) serves over one million low income children each year by focusing on early
learning, physical health, and family and is committed to implementing evidence based programs to promote
overall child wellbeing. It is unknown how to best scale up and implement these evidence based asthma
interventions into low resource community organizations that serve children at risk. Implementation strategies
are frequently developed atheoretically and may not be tailored to the setting. MD ABC Asthma is a multilevel
asthma program that includes both staff and family asthma education training as well an integrated care with
medical providers. The overall purpose of this project is to inform best practices of implementation of an asthma
education program by 1) systematically evaluating the use of intervention mapping to develop a tailored
implementation strategy in partnership with Head Start stakeholders, 2) examining both staff and organizational
level determinants associated with implementation of MD ABC Asthma, and 3) evaluating the success of tailored
implementation strategies on implementation outcomes and school absences and other health outcomes.. As
part of this implementation, we will conduct a multiphase sequential mixed methods study to inform and evaluate
the implementation process using the Consolidated Framework of Implementation Research (CFIR). Aim1 will
focus on a pre-implementation evaluation of Head Start staff and directors to inform a tailored implementation
strategy using intervention mapping. Aims 2 will be an ongoing evaluation and support of the implementation
process using a sequential mixed methods approach. Aim 3 will identify both staff and organizational
determinants of implementation outcomes to inform national scalability within Head Start. Results will identify
innovative methods for implementation and sustainability in low resource settings by partnering with existing
community and government agencies as well as evaluate the impact effectiveness of an integrated multilevel
asthma program, school absences, asthma control, and healthcare utilization. Successful implementation of
this effective intervention has the potential to be included in federal guidelines and integrated into
national guidelines on management of asthma nationally through the Office of Head Start."

Marciano’s primary mentor is Dr. Michael Snyder, a Professor and chair of the Genetics
department at Stanford University and his Co-mentor Dr. Marlene Rabinovitch is a clinical
professor in the pediatrics department and expert in PAH. Drs. Snyder and Rabinovitch have a
long standing collaboration and are excellent mentors with many former trainees now established
as independent investigators.
The K99 phase of Dr. Marciano’s studies will focus on supporting his investigation into the role of
BMPR2 in mediating the hypoxic cellular response and its dysfunction in PAH. Specifically, in AIM
1 of Dr. Marciano’s proposal he seeks to determine the therapeutic potential of BMPR2 enriched
extracellular vesicles (EV) in reversing disease progression. The therapeutic application of EV is
an emerging field that Dr. Marciano is being trained in as a future leader. In AIM 2 of Dr.
Marciano’s proposal he will investigate the effect of laminar shear-stress, the frictional force of
blood flow on EV signaling. He will apply live PET imaging to track the bioidistriubtion of EV and
the effect of different cellular perturbations on their targeting. In Aim 3 of the proposed studies,
Dr. Marciano will initiate studies towards the development of autologous ‘personalized’ EV derived
from a patient’s own stem cells as a strategy to reduce adverse immune reactions.
Dr. Marciano is uniquely positioned to leverage his background in translational medicine to extend
the exciting preliminary findings from which this proposal builds to identify new PAH therapies.
This work will also provide the foundation for future studies, which will be carried out by Dr.
Marciano as an independent investigator."

This project includes the continuation of studies currently conducted by NIDDK Gastroparesis
Clinical Research Consortium (GpCRC) and one new protocol proposed by this site that is to be
carried out by the Consortium. The mission of the GpCRC is to improve understanding of the
pathogenesis, etiology, and treatment of symptoms associated with GP. Improved precision in
diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are needed for patients with GP and for patients with GP-
like symptoms with normal gastric emptying, a disorder termed functional dyspepsia or FD in this
project. Thus, our aims are: 1) to continue the important studies that were begun in the third funding
period (Gastroparesis Registry 3 or GpR3); 2) to further define major subtypes of GP by measuring
gastric myoelectrical activity (GMA), gastric accommodation and sensitivity, antral – pyloro
contractility, and pyloric distensibility; and 3) to explore the efficacy of balloon dilation of the pylorus
in reducing symptoms in patients with GP and FD in a new protocol to be carried out by the
Consortium. Studies from GpR3 to be continued and completed in GpR4 include: The GP Registry,
Buspirone for Early Satiety and Symptoms of Gastroparesis: A Multicenter, Randomized, Placebo-
Controlled, Double-Masked Trial (BESST), Understanding the Pathological Basis of Gastroparesis
and Identification of the Molecular Factors Involved in its Pathogenesis (PBG) Study, and Pyloric
Sphincter Abnormalities in Patients with Gastroparesis Symptoms (PSAGS). Two subtypes of GP
and FD based on GMA in response to the water load satiety test have been identified: one with
normal 3 cpm (GMA) and the other with gastric dysrhythmias. Normal 3 cpm GMA controls normal
gastric peristaltic contractions and requires normal numbers of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs). ICCs
are severely depleted in GP and modestly depleted in FD. Loss of ICCs results in loss of 3 cpm
GMA and increased gastric dysrhythmias which are associated with delays in gastric emptying and
symptoms like nausea. Endoscopic pyloric therapies reduce symptoms in patients with GP and 3
cpm GMA, indicating antro-pyloro outflow dysfunction has a role in the genesis of symptoms. Our
hypothesis is that patients with GP and FD who have normal 3 cpm and poor pyloric distensibility
will have greater reduction in symptoms after balloon dilation of the pylorus compared with patients
with gastric dysrhythmias. Patients with GP (or FD) with 3 cpm GMA or gastric dysrhythmias and
poor pyloric distensibility will undergo balloon dilation of the pylorus in a single blind study.
Identifying subtypes of GP and FD based on GMA will help to provide a more rational approach for
selecting patients for pyloric therapy and improving treatment outcomes."

Chemotherapy is an extremely effective treatment for cancer; however, along with chemotherapy’s benefits
there are many undesirable consequences including chemotherapy-related cognitive impairments (CRCI) and
accelerated aging. Despite impacts on quality of life, these areas are relatively understudied and there are
currently no FDA approved treatments available. A sophisticated animal model to address this problem will be
extremely valuable, both to our understanding of the long-term consequences and to the development of
potential treatments. Currently, CRCI and chemotherapy-related accelerated aging is studied in rodents, but a
nonhuman primate model will significantly enhance the validity of studies addressing this still under-researched
phenomenon. In this proposed study, we aim to establish a baboon model of CRCI and accelerated aging. We
will further define healthy aging in a baboon sample, then investigate whether chemotherapy induces cognitive
decline and accelerates brain aging in baboons as it does in humans and test an intervention which has been
effective in mice. We will collect brain imaging, cognitive, and aging molecular biomarker data from baboons
prior to treatment with cisplatin only or cisplatin followed by an HDAC6 inhibitor. We will then collect further
brain, cognitive, and aging data post-treatment to examine changes related to the chemotherapy regimen and
whether the HDAC6 inhibitor reverses cognitive declines and neurodegeneration. These data will be used to
propose further studies as well as techniques to potentially mitigate these consequences of chemotherapy in
humans."

sites in both South Dakota and North Dakota. These retail meat and seafood samples will be
delivered to the Food Safety Microbiology (FSM) Laboratory in the Animal Disease Research and
Diagnostic Laboratory at South Dakota State University. All samples will be tested for the presence
of Salmonella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, Vibrio, E. coli, CPE and Enterococci using established
food safety analysis protocols. The microbes isolated from these food samples will be shipped to
FDA-CVM for analysis of antibiotic resistance profiles. Isolates of Campylobacter, Salmonella, and E.

10902092,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Neuronal ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) play key roles in mediating excitatory synaptic transmission in
the brain and in a wide range of brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease, schizophrenia,
epilepsy, autism spectrum, major depression, and mood disorders. Glutamatergic signaling is pivotal for synaptic
plasticity, learning, and memory formation. Kainate-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (KARs) are distributed
throughout the brain and regulate the release of neurotransmitters and mediate excitatory synaptic transmission.
KARs form homo- or hetero-tetramers composed of five homologous subunits of GluK1–5. Each subunit exhibits
unique structural, functional, and pharmacological properties and subcellular localization. Moreover, misguided
localization and dysfunction of KARs result in neuropathologies, therefore, KARs are a promising drug target.
However, KARs are the least well understood group of iGluRs, and their molecular mechanisms remain elusive.
The activities of neuronal KARs are regulated by pH, posttranslational modifications, lipid/cholesterol, and small
molecules. Additionally, KAR function and localization are further modified by their auxiliary and accessory
proteins. Thus, such brain lipids, modifications, and protein co-factors increase the diversity of KAR functional
properties. The neuropilin and tolloid-like (NETO) auxiliary proteins, NETO1 and NETO2, are auxiliary proteins
of KARs that are distantly homologous compared with auxiliary proteins associated with other iGluRs. How do
such ligands and protein co-factors determine the gating of KARs and regulate synaptic signaling? How are the
physiological brain lipid environment and posttranslational modifications contributing to receptor activities? To
answer these questions, this proposed research will employ structural and electrophysiological approaches to
develop our mechanistic understanding of the regulation of native postsynaptic GluK2/GluK5 KARs isolated from
rat brains. The program will move forward in two major directions: In one project, I will determine high-resolution
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of native GluK2/GluK5 KARs in an activated state, but also in
complex with ligands to capture multiple functional states. This will elucidate the conformational alternations of
GluK2/GluK5 KARs by their ligands, which have not been well-observed in previously determined structures.
Comparing our structures with other iGluRs will uncover how physiologically relevant heteromeric KARs are
structurally and functionally distinct from other iGluR subfamilies. In a second concurrent project, we will
elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of native KARs by NETO1 and NETO2 auxiliary proteins. Overall, our
studies will provide fundamental insights into how neuronal KAR complexes are controlled by their ligands and
auxiliary proteins, and how they mediate synaptic signaling, and thus neural activities. This information will
facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for treating brain diseases."

 Half of all Americans will develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) during their lifetime. Risk for progressive
CKD is particularly high among African Americans: an estimated 7-8% will eventually require kidney
replacement therapy, such as dialysis or transplant. Existing treatment for CKD is inadequate, and far greater
mechanistic insight is required to explain and address heterogeneity in disease progression. The proposed
study will use a combination of innovative methods and omics data to identify biomarkers and pathways that
are clinically relevant, linking blood protein and metabolite levels to kidney outcomes and kidney histology.
 The first phase of this grant focused on integrating genetic and metabolomic data in two cohorts of African
Americans, the African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension (AASK) and a subset of BioME,
an electronic medical record-linked biorepository. The initial grant period was highly productive, with more than
22 publications, and a focus on rigorous replication of findings in multiple research and clinical cohorts. The
renewal proposal requests funds for integrating novel proteomic data with existing metabolomic and genomic
data in AASK (proteomic profiling of 7,000 proteins at the baseline visit funded in year 5 of the initial grant
period) and expansion to the Boston Kidney Biopsy Cohort Study (BKBC), a clinical cohort with adjudicated
histological scores of CKD pathology. Our overarching hypothesis is that an integrated approach combining
genetics, proteomics, metabolomics, and histological correlates can yield novel insights into the pathogenesis
and prognosis of CKD. Additional investigation using data from genetics consortia and the Kidney Precision
Medicine Project will permit corroboration of potential causal roles in disease development and compartment-
specific expression of select markers highlighted by our BKBC analyses at single cell resolution, respectively.
 If successful, these studies should (a) identify key metabolites, proteins, and networks that provide
information about risk of CKD progression independent of GFR, albuminuria, and other confounders; (b)
identify blood metabolite and protein markers of specific renal histopathologic findings, including interstitial
fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), glomerular sclerosis, and arterial/arteriolar sclerosis; and (c) determine the
potential causal role of metabolite and protein markers in CKD pathogenesis. The data generated from this
grant would be largely unprecedented in scope, connecting histology and omics, and work in AASK greatly
increases the diversity of populations represented in omic investigations. Methods developed will have broad
applicability, and the investigators are well poised to extend and replicate findings in other cohorts. Finally, this
proposal will be executed by a team with a track record of collaboration and published expertise in each of the
methods outlined in the application, demonstrating a high level of feasibility."

Gliomas are the most common brain cancer. Whereas malignant gliomas predominate in adults, low-grade
gliomas (LGGs) comprise the majority of brain tumors in the pediatric population. While LGGs are not typically
fatal, young children with these neoplasms commonly have long-term medical morbidities, from either the tumor
itself or the neurotoxicity associated with conventional therapies. This is particularly true for individuals with the
Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) cancer predisposition syndrome, where nearly 20% of children will develop
LGGs involving the optic pathway (optic pathway gliomas; OPGs) that can lead to vision loss. Currently, therapies
for NF1-LGGs are focused on arresting the growth of the cancer cells using either genotoxic (e.g.,
carboplatin/vincristine) or molecularly targeted (e.g., MEK inhibitors) treatments, with variable durable effects.
Importantly, 30-50% of the cells in human NF1-LGGs are non-neoplastic cells, such as neurons, lymphocytes
(T cells) and monocytic cells (macrophages and microglia), which our laboratory has shown are required for both
tumor formation and growth in experimental murine models of Nf1-OPG. Using these Nf1-OPG mouse strains,
we have previously defined a “neuron-immune-cancer cell circuit” in which Nf1-mutant neurons activate T cells
to produce cytokines that stimulate microglia to support LGG formation and continued growth. Specifically, we
demonstrated that NF1-mutant human and murine neurons produce midkine, which activates T cells in vitro and
in vivo to secrete Ccl4, which then acts on microglia to induce Ccl5 expression, an essential growth factor for
Nf1-OPG formation and growth. Surprisingly, we found that CD8+ T cells predominate in both human and mouse
NF1-LGG, where high CD8, but not CD4, levels correlate with reduced overall survival in people with LGG.
Moreover, studies in our laboratory revealed that antibody-mediated CD8+ T cell depletion reduces mouse Nf1-
OPG growth in vivo. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that CD8+ T cells function in a neuron-
immune-cancer cell circuit as obligate modulators of LGG development and progression. To test this
hypothesis, we have designed a series of experiments we have designed a series of experiments that aim to (a)
define the immune composition of Nf1 optic gliomas in mice, (b) determine why CD8+ T cells are selectively
recruited in these murine brain tumors, and (c) elucidate how NF1 mutation in neurons modifies T cell-microglia
interactions. Collectively, these studies aim to mechanistically dissect the role of CD8+ T cells in neuron-immune-
cancer cell axis regulation of LGG formation and growth, relevant to the development of future
immunomodulatory therapeutic strategies.

affects over 20 million American adults. Disparities in adult asthma prevalence, severity, and death in the U.S.
are well known but few approaches have significantly decreased them. Studies of real-world populations such
as those derived from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are invaluable to guide the design of personalized care
strategies because they capture a large number of diverse and vulnerable people. Additionally, EHR data can
be leveraged to identify geospatial areas where people are at peak risk of a condition by studying the geographic
distribution of affected patients. We have identified individual- and area-level factors that are associated with
asthma using EHRs linked to rich and diverse sources of social, economic, and environmental variables, and we
have developed methods to appropriately extract information from EHR data that are heterogeneously available
across patients and reduce bias in the analysis of these imperfect data. This proposal will identify sub-groups of
adults with asthma who share common patterns of demographic, clinical, social, and environmental exposure
characteristics using EHR data augmented with data on social, economic, and environmental factors, which will
enable the design of effective precision strategies to reduce asthma exacerbations. Our aims are to: 1) develop
and validate natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to extract social, occupational and allergy information
from EHR notes; 2) determine geospatial areas that have increased asthma exacerbation risk using spatial
generalized linear mixed models and identify risk factors in these areas; and 3) use Bayesian hierarchical
clustering techniques to identify asthma sub-phenotypes that will form the basis of a clinical decision support tool
that offers precision care strategies. This project will result in the creation of a tool that can assist in the care of
adults with asthma based on actionable risk factors and motivate public health strategies to mitigate the burden of
asthma in specific regions. Our novel data integration approaches, sub-phenotyping methods, and software
developed will have broad applicability for the study of any condition using EHR or other real-world data."

This is an adminsitrative supplement request meant to expand the the scope of the parent award “Functional
Interrogation of a Novel SCGB3A2+/SFTPB+ Cell in the Human Airway” (R01 HL166139). In the parent award,
we describe the discovery of a new cell population, defined by a unique gene expression profile
(SCGB3A2HI/SFTPB HI/CFTRHI), lacking markers for other recognized cell types such as club cells
(SCGB1A1) and ionocytes (FOXI1). We termed these as Lower Airway Progenitor (LAP) cells due to their
location within the lung, and preliminary data suggesting that these cells can serve as a progenitor cell. Our
hypothesis, guided by preliminary data, suggested that LAP cells differentiate as early airway progenitor cells
distinct from TP63+ progenitor cells and give rise to a unique subset of airway cell types. The administrative
supplement aims to extend the scope of the project by identifying the transcription factors (TFs) necessary for
LAP cell differentiation and maintenance, using multimodal datasets and computational tools (Aim 1).
Following identification of LAP-enriched TFs, we aim to investigate the function of LAP cell-enriched TFs using
genetic loss-of-function via CRISPRi. The outcome of this project will provide foundational insights into the
regulation, function, and differentiation of this newly identified LAP cell population, contributing to the broader
understanding of human lung biology."

The Precision Neuropathology (NP) Core has been a valuable and frequently utilized resource for UW ADRC
in support of its vision of characterizing and understanding heterogeneity of Alzheimer's disease and related
dementias (ADRD). The NP Core has fostered development of innovative approaches to assess
neuropathology of ADRD, which are essential to more precisely measure neuropathologic change. We build on
this tradition of innovation in this proposal by applying novel, highly quantitative multiplexed immunoassays
developed in the NP Core to measure neuropathology that, combined with better methods of collecting and
storing tissue for state-of-the-art applications including single cell molecular profiling, expanded pathological
sampling informed by structural and functional imaging, ex vivo MRI-guided pathologic sampling in every brain,
and 3D image reconstruction, and quantitative analysis in both gross and microscopic samples, enable us to
deeply characterize the structural substrate for ADRD heterogeneity. We combine this comprehensive analysis
of human brains with a cell types and stem cell component composed of experts in their respective fields who
are committed to providing support for ADRD-related mechanistic studies, all while supporting every core of
the ADRC and local and national research. Thus, our Aims reflect our commitment to integrate traditional
diagnostic excellence and extensive tissue and data sharing with radiographically informed extensive sampling
and a battery of highly quantitative, molecularly specific tissue and in silico approaches to precisely measure
ADRD neuropathology. Our specific aims are to (i) build a highly accessible repository of brain tissue and fluid,
(ii) provide diagnostic expertise according to the latest guidelines, (iii) develop innovative approaches, (iv)
provide cell types and stem cell support for ADRD research, and (v) promote durable ADRD research through
support of ADRC Cores, development projects, and local and national research. All of our research activities
are focused on enhancing the research value of tissue and body fluid donations from cognitively healthy
individuals and those along the ADRD spectrum while ensuring proper safeguards."

Evaluating and addressing these disparities is urgent since non-Caucasian racial or ethnic groups will make up
45% of Americans ages 65+ by the year 2060. Ensuring recruitment of appropriately diverse research
participants is a formidable challenge, and ADRD studies often lag behind such goals. These shortfalls are
likely due to a confluence of barriers, including “research readiness” of target populations, lack of ADRD
knowledge, and associated stigma. In the Outreach Recruitment and Engagement (ORE) Core, we apply
innovative strategies to achieve three overarching goals centered on (1) recruiting and retaining a well-defined
cohort of research participants; (2) serving as the primary regional resource for consumable, accurate, and
culturally-informed information on ADRD diagnosis, management, and research opportunities; and (3)
increasing research readiness of underrepresented groups (URGs) through evidence- and experienced-based
outreach and education. We share ADRD educational information and resources via our website
(www.uwadrc.org), bi-annual magazine Dimensions, and monthly e-Newsletter. At the University of
Washington Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center, we have a special focus on American Indian / Alaska
Native (AI/AN) engagement, a historically gravely overlooked URG in ADRD research efforts. Through a highly
successful collaboration with Partnerships for Native Health (P4NH) at Washington State University, we will
continue to improve research readiness among AI/AN elders, with emphasis on promoting brain donation. We
will expand these efforts to other URGs in order to engage the local communities of color. We emphasize
respectful, bidirectional relationships with our community partners while conducting the most rigorous science
aligned with their priorities and comfort with research. We operate on the model of knowledge exchange, and
advocate a strength-based reframing perspective to counter stigma by emphasizing social and cognitive
functions that are spared in ADRD."

The Imaging and Biomarker (IB) Core will characterize participants in the Clinical Core through neuroimaging
and fluid biomarker analysis, in conformity with prevailing standards. A further focus is to rigorously describe
topographic phenotypes of the participants and to link this information to cognitive, fluid biomarker, genetic,
and neuropathologic data generated by the Center. The Core will also provide an information architecture and
consulting expertise to represent the imaging data to ADRC-affiliated studies and investigators.
 Many UW ADRC-affiliated studies require human subjects who are well-characterized with imaging and
fluid biomarkers. MRI imaging will be obtained on all normal cognition, MCI, and mild AD participants in the
Clinical and Native Research and Resource (NRRC) Cores. We will characterize our Clinical Core cohort with
A|T|N classification, primarily with CSF biomarkers (A, T) and MRI (N) imaging. The IB Core will coordinate
PET scans in ADRC affiliate projects or co-enroll affiliate subjects in the Clinical Core to ensure Clinical Core
subjects have PET scanning performed. We provide expertise in planning and analyzing PET molecular
imaging studies.
 Affiliated studies are investigating specific candidate mechanisms of AD, as well as whether, and why,
different pathological mechanisms inherent in AD have differing patterns of impact over the cerebral cortex. For
such studies, the brain space is a point of integration of the other biomarkers of AD. We have organized the IB
Core and its interactions with the Clinical and Neuropathology Cores such that topographical heterogeneity,
determined from imaging data, is incorporated as a phenotypic characteristic, along with cognitive domain, fluid
biomarker, and genetic data. We will measure cortical degeneration, as well as cortical sparing, across a set
of brain regions that represent the range and variability of involvement in AD. Another important aspect of
cognitive variability is the relationship of the degree of cognitive impairment that results from a given degree of
neurodegeneration (cognitive resilience). Thus we will also extract measures of cognitive resilience from
cognitive and anatomic data, as another phenotypic dimension. We will provide consulting expertise in
informatics/machine learning, image analysis and statistics for the description and analysis of these data.
 We have also structured the Core to support the same multidisciplinary phenotyping in decedents from
the Clinical cohort who come to autopsy. We will perform ex vivo MRI in all, and process structural measures
as in the in vivo studies. We will sample tissue from the same regions that we target with imaging in living
participants. We will calculate analogous resilience measures. Ex vivo MRI will also enable targeted sampling
of MRI-apparent abnormalities at autopsy and mapping neuropathologic data into standard anatomical space."

Many American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) view research with skepticism and mistrust, in part because
research has historically been done in or on communities rather than with them. As a result, partnerships with
Native communities are challenged by distrust of scientific research, misunderstandings, and competing priorities
between researchers and community members. We have shown that factors significantly increasing odds of
participation in research include conduct of the study by a tribal entity, involving the community in its design,
having an AI/AN project lead, offering compensation, focusing on problems important to the community, and
providing services. Inclusion of disparity populations in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD)
research has emerged as a priority for the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease. Yet, the Clinical Cores
(CC) of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers (ADRCs) have recruited only 248 (0.06%) AI/ANs over 30+
years; the University of Washington ADRC has enrolled only 3 AI/ANs during this time. CC participants are
evaluated according to a single protocol, which may hinder enrolling AI/ANs if the content, approach, and
compensation are not salient to, or aligned with, their experiences, expectations, or culture. Partnerships for
Native Health, one of the nation's largest groups conducting health research in Native communities, has
collaborated with the UW ADRC for the past 5 years. We are now poised to enroll AI/ANs into the Native
Research and Resource Core (NRRC) by conducting 2 complementary activities. In PY01-02, we will conduct
qualitative research with AI/AN stakeholders to review the standard UW CC protocol and identify facilitators and
barriers to participation. Next, the CC will help design alternative protocols for use in the NRRC. With the National
Congress on American Indians, the largest organization serving tribal governments, we will host 4 workshops
that assemble investigators and urban and tribal nation representatives to discuss tribal-academic research
partnerships, including possible strategies for data-sharing. In PY03-05, we will use the alternative protocols
developed in Phase 1 to recruit AI/ANs into NRRC. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Conduct focus groups and key
informant interviews with urban and rural AI/AN elders and other stakeholders to understand barriers to and
promoters of participation in the UW CC and create alternative NRRC protocols that retain essential CC
components; 2) Conduct workshops with stakeholders in tribal-academic partnerships to explore strategies that
might allow data collected from AI/AN participants in the NRRC to be shared with the National Alzheimer's
Coordinating Center; 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the alternative, culturally informed protocols for increasing
AI/AN recruitment into the NRRC; and 4) Work with ADRC Cores to promote NRRC participation, appraise
protocols, conduct examinations, perform neuroimaging, and assign UW identification codes to participants.
NRRC is a first step toward remedying the underrepresentation of AI/ANs in ADRD research, addressing
decades of neglect and recent calls for diversity. This effort could serve as a resource and a model for all ADRCs."

the vast array of expertise, data and resources available within the UW ADRC ecosystem. This support is
explicitly targeted to include young investigators whose developing research programs will form the pipeline for
research utilizing resources and data generated by the UW ADRC in the future. Last, the UW ADRC REC will
seek to fill a critical gap in training and expertise in the use of publicly available ADRD-related `big data'
throughout the national ADRD research community. Through its partnership with Seattle-based Sage
Bionetworks, it will establish and support an annual two-day ADRD Open Neuroscience Workshop that will
help ADRD-focused trainees and investigators develop proficiency with publicly-available datasets, their origins
and structures, their user interfaces, and statistical and computational approaches to their use. These
workshops will be open to individuals at the UW ADRC and other ADRCs nationally. Through ongoing
collaborations Sage Bionetworks, it will further support the seeding and support of mentored Open
Neuroscience working groups focused on developing new research projects based on these data. This will
include the progressive use of integrated clinical, neuropsychometric, imaging and biomarker, genetic and

ABSTRACT
The Human Consultation, Biosamples, Biomarkers (CBB) Core (Core C) will complement and integrate the
Projects of the P01 Strategies for Targeting Reactive Astrocytes in AD and ADRD. It is critical to validate
the translational relevance of mechanistic mouse models, and to extend those results toward further clinical
studies. Yet there are challenges when it comes to addressing the complex pathobiology of the dementia clinical
syndrome. Core C will bridge those critical gaps through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Optimize
clinically-relevant study design and manage ongoing data streams incorporating human biomarker and
autopsy data. This Aim will foster integration, organization, coherence, and documentation for Core C. The
multimodal data include molecular, metabolic, and network-wide domains in human endophenotypes, and
human preclinical and clinical endpoints. Aim 2: From existing autopsy material and data, generate a set
of human cases from the UK-ADRC that encompasses the AD/ADRD phenotypes studied in all 4
Projects (AD, VCID, LATE+HS, and controls) and provides a common basis for downstream biochemical
and neuropathological endpoint assessments relevant to the Projects. We will analyze a panel of 100
cases for this Aim. Aim 2a: Biochemistry. We will perform multi-level protein extracts and run immunoblots
with quantitative measurements on each sample with astrocytic proteins (e.g., AQP4, Kir4.1, GFAP, SLC1A2,
ABCC9/SUR2, Insulin receptor) being studied in the Projects. We will separately assess snap-frozen
hippocampal samples, as well as frontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9) white matter and gray matter seperately.
Aim 2b: Neuropathology. Neuropathologic endpoints will be characterized in a quantitative manner in the
same panel of 100 cases: Astrocytosis (GFAP+), Aβ plaques, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and Tau tangles. We
also will perform highly quantitative assessments of blood vessel morphology using CD34 (capillaries) and ?-
SMA (arteriole) markers. Double-label IFC will characterize IR and SUR2 proteins’ cellular distributions.
Samples will also be genotyped for ABCC9 risk alleles. Aim 3: From existing clinical outcome measures,
generate a set of biomarker (in vivo) data from human participants that represents a common basis for
downstream biofluids and neuroimaging endpoint assessments relevant to the projects. Aim 3A:
Neuroimaging. A 3D anatomical magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE),
cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), from existing human imaging on a 3T MRI scanner will be generated and

 The Data Management and Biostatistics (DMB) Core is an integral component of our team project,
“Strategies for Targeting Astrocyte Reactivity in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and AD related dementia (STAR-
ADRD)”. The goal of the DMB Core is to provide a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary resource for four STAR-
ADRD projects by constructing and maintaining a centralized data repository and drawing biostatistical expertise
for the completion of their research. A unique aspect of this Core is the design and utilization of a Structured
Query Language (SQL) server to store analytical data and metadata related to the four projects in a single
location for cross-project integration. The DMB Core will closely and regularly interact with other investigators to
ensure that all data are collected and deposited in alignment with the goal of generating rigorous and
reproducible data repository. Given that interdisciplinary research requires researchers to use methods and data
from a range of disciplines, the role of the DMB Core is vital to the success of the STAR-ADRD team. The DMB
Core will support these responsibilities through the following specific aims.
Aim 1: Maintain and expand an integrated data warehouse and suite of Browser-based data collection
applications and reporting platforms for the STAR-ADRD Cores and projects. Data management efforts will focus
on collecting, storing, and sharing high quality data according to the standard operating procedures.
Aim 2: Provide expertise on tailored and integrated statistical analyses. The DMB Core will provide statistical
analyses individually tailored to the STAR-ADRD projects and Cores’ needs. The DMB Core will actively interact
with STAR-ADRD investigators, examine their research hypotheses, plan and suggest appropriate statistical
analysis methods and models, build tailored analysis pipelines, interpret and discuss results, create graphs and
tables for presentations and manuscripts, and write the statistical analysis section in manuscripts. Further, the
DMB Core will develop and apply statistical methodology on data harmonized and integrated across the four
STAR-ADRD projects.
Aim 3: Host training in data management practices for the research team. The DMB Core will offer in-person (or
Zoom) data quality and management workshops with the entire STAR-ADRD team. The materials developed
and used for workshops will be documented and shared with STAR-ADRD team members.
 All four projects proposed in this P01 require data management and biostatistical expertise to ensure that
all data are reliable and statistically analytical. The DMB Core will play a key role in facilitating synergies across
the STAR-ADRD projects and Cores."

A major driver of the U.S. HIV epidemic is inadequate access to HIV prevention and care in the criminal legal
system. The End HIV Epidemic (EHE) Toolkit recommends that jails offer low-barrier access to HIV testing,
treatment, and prevention to people who inject opioids, but many justice-involved people with opioid use
disorder (OUD) do not know their HIV status and few access medications to prevent HIV (pre-exposure
prophylaxis, PrEP). Suffolk County, the only EHE-designated jurisdiction in Massachusetts (MA), had a recent
HIV outbreak, occurring in formerly incarcerated people with OUD, that disproportionately impacted three
geographically and racially distinct communities (Boston, Chelsea, Revere). Improvements were made to
increase carceral HIV prevention and care, but one year into implementation only about 10% were HIV tested
and few were initiated on PrEP. MA Medicaid now authorizes coverage of HIV care before, upon, and following
release from incarceration, but HIV care is not well-integrated with the jails’ existing medications for opioid use
disorder (MOUD) program and there are gaps between jails and community healthcare. The Massachusetts
HIV/Justice Research Network proposes to partner with the Suffolk jail system and community treatment
partners to conduct a formative evaluation and pilot (R61, Aim 1) and type 2 hybrid implementation-
effectiveness study (R33, Aims 2-4) of a multi-pronged intervention to increase HIV testing and PrEP linkage
called ID-TOUCH (ID Testing OUtreach in Carceral Hubs). We will (1) Perform a formative evaluation of HIV
care gaps and opportunities in Suffolk jails, using (1a) stakeholder engagement to co-design ID-TOUCH, (1b)
existing administrative data to identify touchpoints for HIV care, focusing on differential barriers among
incarcerated people who were and were not treated with MOUD, and (1c) a pilot-trial of ID-TOUCH, measuring
changes in HIV testing, feasibility and acceptability, and self-reported patient outcomes. (2) Conduct a
longitudinal treatment outcome study comparing outcomes of individuals released from Suffolk jails (a) during
ID-TOUCH implementation, (b) before implementation, and (c) in relation to a nearby comparable jail system
(contemporaneous control site) using the MA Public Health Data Warehouse, a collection of two dozen linked
state administrative data sets, to examine HIV testing and post-release linkage to PrEP or HIV treatment. (3)
Conduct an implementation study of ID-TOUCH to understand contextual factors that facilitate and impede
delivery of HIV care in jail and community care coordination, and best practice strategies that optimize HIV
care. (4) Estimate the cost of implementing and sustaining ID-TOUCH, and assess its economic value, relative
to usual care, from healthcare sector, state-policymaker, and societal perspectives. The Massachusetts
HIV/Justice Research Network, with the MA Department of Public Health, Suffolk jails, and community
treatment partners, has the experience and expertise to fulfill the study aims. This study’s insights will inform
the development of new treatment options to end the HIV epidemic in jail populations."

Sarcopenia is a leading cause of death and disability for the aging population and creates a societal burden
resulting in $18 billion in annual costs in the United States alone. While new treatments have shown promise to
improve functional outcomes, they have been hampered by the lack of non-invasive biomarkers sensitive to the
early stages of the disease. In particular, non-invasive assessment of muscle atrophy is a long-recognized but
unmet need in the sarcopenia community, and we propose to use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to address
this need.
This project develops a clinically feasible toolset to noninvasively image early atrophic changes in skeletal
muscle using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Our specific aims are (1) to develop new MRI techniques that
utilize a novel pulse sequence to quantify muscle cell size and changes thereof due to atrophy; (2) to validate
MR atrophy imaging with histological evaluation of muscle biopsies from young and older subjects, and correlate
with muscle strength; and (3) to apply MRI atrophy methods to study longitudinal changes in sarcopenic patients
and in pre-frail subjects, which are at high risk of developing sarcopenia.
The innovation of this work lies in the development of a novel imaging technique to quantify atrophy in muscle
tissue non-invasively. The outcome of this proposal is a validated and quantitative MRI tool to image muscle
quality, and its relationship to patient strength and functional status. The significance of this work is a robust
clinical MRI protocol to image early degenerative changes associated to sarcopenia that is transferrable to any
clinical site. The reproducible and robust tool will allow the sarcopenia imaging community to identify subject at
risk, and implement targeted and timely interventions that can stop or slow the progression of sarcopenia."

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have consistently linked mutations in CASS4 (Cas Scaffold
Protein Family Member 4) to an increased risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. Yet, very little is
currently known about the role of CASS4 in basic neurobiology or neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis.
What little is known about CASS4 predominantly comes from studies exploring its biology in cell lines and cancer.
These studies have helped to identify CASS4 as a member of the Crk-associated substrate (Cas) protein family.
All members of the Cas family lack enzymatic activity and instead act as scaffold proteins. Cas proteins are best
known for their central involvement in the regulation of focal adhesions, which are multiprotein signaling
complexes that control cytoskeleton dynamics, adhesion, cell migration, and phagocytosis. To bridge the gap in
our knowledge of the role of CASS4 in neurodegenerative disease progression, we recently generated both
germline and conditional CASS4-deficient mice and have begun crossing these mice onto various mouse models
of Alzheimer’s disease. In our preliminary studies, we have found that genetic ablation of CASS4 in the 5xFAD
mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease leads to decreased recruitment of microglia to amyloid beta (Ab) plaques
as well as defective compaction of Ab. Furthermore, we also observe markedly impaired cognitive flexibility and
increased numbers of dystrophic neurites in 5xFAD mice that lack CASS4. On the molecular level, we also detect
decreased focal adhesion signaling in CASS4-deficient macrophages. Based on our preliminary findings as well
as the fact that Cass4 appears to be selectively expressed by microglia in the brain, we hypothesize that CASS4
is a central regulator of focal adhesion signaling that functions in microglia to limit Alzheimer’s-related disease
progression. To test this working hypothesis, we will first explore how genetic ablation of CASS4 impacts
neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis in mouse models of both Ab amyloidosis and tauopathy (Aim 1). Next,
we will leverage our newly generated Cass4 conditional knockout mice to interrogate a microglia-specific role for
CASS4 in controlling Alzheimer’s-related disease pathology and neuroinflammation (Aim 2). In our third Aim, we
will explore how CASS4 affects focal adhesion signaling in microglia. Completion of the studies outlined in this
application will break new ground in our understanding of the role of CASS4 in Alzheimer’s disease progression
and microglial biology and will also help to establish new molecular players (i.e. CASS4) and pathways (i.e. focal
adhesion signaling) that can be targeted to treat Alzheimer’s disease."

The skin is a highly innervated organ and contains numerous sensory afferent neurons that
respond to a diverse array of stimuli including touch, pruritogens (inducing itch) and noxious
agents (inducing pain). There are also many skin-resident immune cells including dendritic cells
and mast cells that make direct contact with sensory neurons. It has very recently become
appreciated that cutaneous sensory neurons and skin-resident innate immune cells work
synergistically to initiate local inflammation and host defense. We have previously shown that
TRPV1+ neurons that sense pain are necessary and sufficient for cutaneous innate Type-17
inflammation and host defense against C. albicans. Thus, a neuron subset associated with
painful stimuli is necessary and sufficient to drive a Type-17 immune response which is the
optimal immune response against extracellular pathogens that can cause painful stimuli. We
now propose to test the immunologic potential of nonpeptidergic sensory neurons are that can
be divided based on single cell RNAseq into at least 3 subsets: NP1, NP2, and NP3. The
overall goal of this proposal is to understand the unique contribution of individual subsets of
nonpeptidergic sensory neurons to the modulation of skin immunity. Exploring this neuro-
immune interaction will better define the cellular circuits driving inflammation and allow for the
use of agonists/antagonists that target neuron subsets in order to modulate specific types of
cutaneous immune responses without global immunosuppression. Specifically, we hypothesize
that NP1 sensory nerves function to suppress mast cell activity. We further hypothesize that the
NP2 and NP3 subsets that communicate itch sensation in response to pruritogens also
participate in the development of Type-2 immune responses analogous to TRPV1+ neurons and
Type-17 immune responses. The potential to modulate Th2 and mast cell function makes these
pathways potential key for allergic disease pathogenesis."
10887561,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
T cells were first observed in postmortem brains of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients decades ago, yet very little
is known about their role in disease progression. AD is marked by oligomerization of specific proteins that can
accumulate into extracellular plaques, driving research to understand innate immune cells in AD due to their
potential for reacting to and clearing these plaques. More recent evidence suggests that adaptive immune cells
play a significant role in AD; numbers of CD8+ T cells are significantly increased in AD brains, and expansion of
a subset of memory CD8+ T cells in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients is negatively associated with cognition.
To date, T cell depletion and knock-out studies in mice have yielded conflicting data on the influence of T cells
in AD. However, a population of T cells that has long been overlooked due to their only recent discovery and the
historic view of the brain as immune privilege are tissue resident memory T cells (TRM), which reside in the brain
and are optimally positioned to exert local immune activation. As there is currently no defined T cell antigen in
Alzheimer’s disease, we will take an innovative approach to model TRM activation in the brain using a model
antigen. This will be the first study to examine TRM in context of Alzheimer’s disease and to examine the impact
of T cell activation in a defined manner on AD progression. The objectives of this proposal are to i) test the ability
of brain CD8+ TRM to trigger innate immune cell activation, including NK cells, microglia and macrophages, in a
mouse model of AD, ii) determine the impact of brain CD8+ TRM activation on Alzheimer’s disease progression
in mice, including cognition and pathology, and iii) determine the migration dynamics, abundance and clonality
of CD8+ TRM in mouse and human AD brain. These goals will be attained by complementing classical
immunologic techniques for studying TRM in mouse models with a continuing collaboration with onsite
neuropathologists to study T cells from human postmortem tissue from AD and non-neurologically involved brain
tissue at a single cell level. Collectively, these experiments will enhance our understanding of the role of CD8+
TRM in Alzheimer’s disease and has potential to provide insight into T cell functions in other neurological diseases,
reveal novel therapeutic targets, and overall build a foundational understanding of TRM functions in the brain."

The goal of our proposal is to develop a scalable platform for structure-based virtual screening of Giga- and Tera-
scale drug-like compound libraries, enabling streamlined discovery of high-quality drug candidates. Availability
of protein target structures and Giga-scale REAL Space libraries of virtual compounds (>10 billion) position
docking-based virtual screening as a key paradigm for drug discovery. However, the computational cost of Giga-
scale screening becomes a major bottleneck limiting further growth of the screening libraries. Recently, we have
introduced a highly scalable synthon-based technology, V-SYNTHES, which performs hierarchical structure-
based screening of REadily AvaiLable for synthesis (REAL) libraries (Sadybekov et al, Nature accepted).
By iteratively screening synthon-scaffold combinations, the V-SYNTHES approach makes possible rapid
detection of the best-scoring compounds in the Giga-scale chemical space while performing docking of only a
small fraction (~2 million) of the library. First tests of V-SYNTHES demonstrated strong enrichment in
computational benchmarks and significantly improved experimental hit rates on cannabinoid receptor CB2 and
ROCK1 kinase targets, while requiring 100 times less computational resources than standard virtual screenings.
Building upon these preliminary results, our proposal aims to: (1) Further develop a fully automated V-
SYNTHES algorithm, optimize its parameters and expand it to Tera-scale REAL libraries. (2) Apply and
experimentally validate the V-SYNTHES approach on a set of therapeutic targets of different classes, which
includes such challenging targets as nucleotide and lipid binding pockets, allosteric pockets, and orphan
receptors (3) Establish portability of the algorithm to an open-source docking platform to further facilitate V-
SYNTHES adoption in academic labs. The open-source algorithm will be distributed as a workflow for Linux
clusters and computing clouds. Successful completion of this project will establish V-SYNTHES as a robust
computational platform for structure-based ligand discovery in most classes of therapeutic targets, scaleable for
rapidly growing REAL modular libraries. Most importantly, it will help to make fast virtual screening of the
Giga-to-Tera-scale libraries broadly accessible for the whole research community with reasonable computational
resources."
10875655,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While nanoparticle-based platforms have become a leading drug delivery platform for treating
various diseases, several challenges remain in current nanomedicine, including toxicity, inefficient
endothelial barrier crossing, rapid elimination, and nonspecific accumulation in the body. Extra-
cellular vesicles (EVs) provide a natural delivery system that can transfer various cellular cargo
to adjacent and distant cells. EVs offer unique advantages for engineering while possessing in-
herent immune evasion capability and tissue penetrating characteristics. However, inefficient
therapeutic cargo packaging and insufficient EV production from cells limit the current EV-based
drug delivery approach.
 Chronic inflammatory disease (CID) imposes health and economic burdens on communi-
ties worldwide. Current therapy of CID is neither sufficient nor disease-modifying. Our ultimate
goal is to develop a safe and effective EV-based therapy for CID patients. The overall objectives
in this application are to (i) develop an ultrasound (US)-based platform termed EVEiR (Extracel-
lular Vesicle Engineering and induced Release) for delivering anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10,
and (ii) determine their therapeutic efficacy using an in vitro intestinal model. The central hypoth-
esis is that externally applied mechanical cues using US stimulation and the mechanical proper-
ties of the cell microenvironment may increase the production and function of engineered EVs
(eEVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in 3D cultures. We will test the central
hypothesis by pursuing two Specific Aims: 1) Develop US-assisted EVEiR for efficient production
of anti-inflammatory IL10-carrying eEVs (IL10+ eEVs); and 2) Demonstrate the feasibility of IL10+
eEVs derived from MSCs in 3D cultures for targeted delivery of therapeutics. Aim 1 will determine
the efficiency of IL10+ eEV production using the novel US-based techniques. Aim 2 will charac-
terize the properties of IL10+ eEVs and their anti-inflammatory effect using an in vitro intestinal
model. The innovation of this proposal is to utilize the synergy with the impact of non-viral intra-
cellular IL10 packaging in EVs, the unique concept of pulsed US stimulation of MSCs in 3D hy-
drogel constructs for efficient eEV production. In addition, an in vitro intestinal model allows for
efficient characterization of anti-inflammatory IL10+ eEVs in a physiologically relevant environ-
ment. The proposed research is significant because the successful completion of this project will
develop a rapid, cost-effective, and scalable platform to generate MSC-derived therapeutic EVs
for treating CID and facilitate the translation of MSC-derived EVs to the clinic."
10875457,"The goal of this research project proposal is to co-opt dysfunctional innate immune signaling in KRAS-
driven lung cancers as a therapeutic vulnerability. Specifically, my laboratory has focused for many years on
targeting TBK1 to inhibit the production of cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6 and CCL5 that are pro-
tumorigenic and immune suppressive. For example, TBK1 inhibition sensitizes tumors to MEK inhibition, as well
as PD-1 blockade. Over the past several years it has also become increasingly apparent that viral sensing
pathways, such as RIG-I/MAVS or cGAS/STING play a key role in re-directing TBK1 to activate IRF3/STAT1
and initiate a cytotoxic anti-viral response. How KRAS mutant lung cancers, especially those with STK11/LKB1
co-mutation, avoid this response and preferentially activate NF-κB/STAT3 survival signaling has remained
unclear.
While developing triple combination therapies to inhibit TBK1/MEK signaling and suppress adaptive
transcriptional feedback, we made the serendipitous observation that KRAS-LKB1 (KL) mutant lung cancers
epigenetically silence STING. Detailed studies in KL cells unveiled a mechanistic connection between enhanced
DNMT1 activity and the need to avoid detection of mitochondrial DNA, which accumulates due to damaged
mitochondria. Re-activating STING expression in KL cells results in cellular cytotoxicity and enhanced
immunogenicity, especially when combined with STING agonism. Thus, instead of inhibiting multiple signaling
pathways downstream KRAS, these studies uncover a straightforward vulnerability that could be more readily
co-opted therapeutically.
The broad, long term objective of this proposal is therefore to characterize the epigenetic mechanism of
STING silencing and to co-opt this state into a tumor vulnerability. Forcing cells to deal with the consequences
of STING re-expression, while driving its activity via DNA damage or direct STING agonism, has important
therapeutic potential for this major subset of KRAS-driven lung cancer. Given the unclear therapeutic window of
targeting three or more KRAS downstream pathways, which is required for long-term durable response in animal
models, this simpler strategy, which can also re-engage anti-tumor immunity, has significant potential. Moreover,
in addition to the in vivo studies we propose, our novel model system using patient-derived xenograft and direct
patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (XDOTS and PDOTS) provides rapid validation in actual explanted
tumors. Specific aims are to: 1) Optimize strategies to reverse epigenetic silencing of STING in KL tumors, 2)
Develop combination therapy strategies with specific agents that promote mitotic slippage, and 3) Utilize
immune-competent models to explore the direct role of STING priming on adaptive T cell responses. Through
these complementary studies, the goal is to rewire the cytokine circuitry of KRAS-driven lung cancer to engage
this cytotoxic anti-viral signaling machinery and ultimately to overcome intrinsic resistance to immune checkpoint
inhibitor therapy."
10875571,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte subset in humans. Current therapies targeting neutrophils are
limited to drugs that block their recruitment to tissues, leaving their functions mostly untouched. Our long-term
goal is to develop new knowledge on neutrophil biology and function in humans and derive from it innovative
treatments for conditions dominated by intractable neutrophil-driven inflammation, including cystic fibrosis (CF).
CF is the most frequent autosomal disease in people of European descent, caused by mutations in the CFTR
epithelial channel. Recent research has shown that CFTR dysfunction causes local mucus stasis obstruction,
followed by neutrophil recruitment, and paradoxically, opportunistic infections. This paradox stems from the
fact that most neutrophils recruited to CF airways in vivo undergo hyperactive granule release, and become
immunomodulatory and metabolically licensed, yet fail to kill microbes, in a functional fate we dubbed “GRIM”.
Using an organotypic model of human airway inflammation, we showed previously that naïve blood neutrophils
can be made to acquire the GRIM fate upon transepithelial migration in vitro into airway fluid from CF patients.
Further preliminary studies of GRIM adaptation presented here support an obligate upstream role for
extracellular vesicles (EVs) present in airway fluid carrying the long non-coding RNA MALAT-1, and the
downstream implication of transcriptional firing and mitochondrial rewrting, with histone deacetylase 11
(HDAC11) and cMyc as key modulators. Remarkably, we show that GRIM neutrophils produced in vitro
secrete secondary EVs that can in turn induce GRIM adaptation in a new wave of neutrophils. Also, we show
that siRNA against MALAT-1 and HDAC11 and inhibition of HDAC11 by the small molecule drug SIS17
normalize granule release and bacterial killing by GRIM neutrophils, as well as their release of secondary EVs.
Our objective is to fully characterize mechanisms of GRIM adaptation in CF airway neutrophils. Our central
hypothesis is that chronic CF airway inflammation is a feed-forward process in which resident GRIM
neutrophils release EVs that induce the GRIM fate in newly recruited neutrophils.
This study introduces a new and innovative basic paradigm of neutrophil-driven human lung inflammation with
key roles for EVs, MALAT-1, HDAC11 and cMyc, and innovative methods to deconstruct this paradigm (model
for mass production of lung-recruited neutrophils, optimized tools to characterize lung EVs, and drug- / RNA /
siRNA interventions targeted at neutrophils). We expect this study to yield transformative findings in our basic
understanding and ability to treat chronic neutrophilic inflammation and infection in CF and other diseases."

Over 5.8 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's dementia, a disease with no effective treatment and no
cure. Two-thirds of the caregivers for persons with dementia (PWD) are women (most often family) and a third
are themselves over 65. Dementia takes a significant toll on caregivers, often resulting in chronic stress,
depression, sleep disorders, poor health related quality of life (HRQOL), and early mortality due 24/7 care
responsibility for PWD. Research has shown significant barriers to dementia care for underserved populations,
including Latinos and Asian minorities. Underserved family caregivers for PWD tend to underutilize public
health services available, and do not seek treatment until the situation is unmanageable with current resources
reporting barriers that included language, time, and finances. Monitoring the caregiver's health and wellbeing is
important as well as their maintaining a positive interaction with the PWD. Thus, there is a need for an
innovative and feasible intervention to improve underserved caregiver's mental and physical health. Little
research is reported for dementia caregiver interventions in underserved minorities and one given at home by
community health workers (CHWs). The proposed intervention meets the needs of these family caregivers in
developing a positive relationship with the PWD by educating caregivers to better understand the PWD's
behaviors. Another component of the intervention is stress reduction techniques, including mindful deep
breathing and compassionate support/listening to reduce depression and improve family relationships making
the caregiving less burdensome. By monitoring the physiological responses of stress (i.e. heart rate variability),
sleep and activity, we can objectively measure changes as a result of the intervention. Using Wearable Internet
of Things (WIoT) technology, a combination of Watch/ring-Smartphone-Cloud, has proven to be a significant
method of monitoring behavioral and physiological measures providing evidence of change over time and
uniquely associated with this intervention. Our preliminary data show that the intervention with WIoT brought to
the caregiver by CHW home visitors was acceptable to ethnic caregivers (Latino, Vietnamese, and Korean)
and effective in reducing caregiver stress and burden over the short term. With the addition of non-Hispanic
Whites, the proposed caregiver-centered, culturally and language appropriate, CHW home-visit-based 3-month
intervention has 3 significant parts:1) stress reduction by mindful breathing and compassionate support/
listening to improve caregiver's health and well-being; 2) education on caregiving skills to improve responses
to the PWD and in turn their behaviors; 3) WIoT physiological and behavioral monitoring. This 6-month
randomized controlled trial will compare outcomes (burden, depression, HRQOL, PWD behaviors, caregiving
self-efficacy) between the intervention, attention control with use of the WIoT only, and usual care groups at
baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. This intervention using the CHW-model and WIOT technology has the
potential to lessen health disparities in dementia caregiving in ethnic and underserved family caregivers."
10875675,"The primary cardiac event in MI is cell death. Genetic studies in mice have established that most cardiomyocyte
death during reperfused MI (MI/R) occurs through regulated cell death programs. This suggests that it should be
possible in concept to limit cardiomyocyte death during MI/R to obtain the full benefit of reperfusion in maintaining
cardiac function. A significant obstacle in achieving this goal, however, is that cardiomyocyte death in MI/R is
mediated by several regulated apoptosis and necrosis programs, and the mechanisms that link these programs
to produce an integrated cell death response remain poorly understood. This gap in knowledge has been a
critical impediment for the rational design of therapies to limit cardiac damage during MI/R. Accordingly, a goal
of our lab has been to understand the molecular framework that connects cell death programs in MI/R. Our
preliminary studies have identified caspase-9 as an important link between apoptosis and necrosis programs
during MI/R. The canonical role of caspase-9 in apoptosis is to activate downstream procaspases-3 and -7.
However, we have identified a new pathway in which caspase-9 mediates cardiomyocyte necrosis during MI/R.
In contrast to caspase-9-mediated apoptosis, caspases-3/7 are dispensable for caspase-9-mediated necrosis
indicating the distinctness of the two pathways. However, as in apoptosis, caspase-9 enzymatic activity is
required. To further dissect the pathway, we performed a proteomics-based screen for procaspase-9 interacting
proteins in the heart during MI/R, which revealed proteins known to be involved in various aspects of necrosis.
Thus far, we have focused on one procaspase-9 interactor, SERCA2a, which we hypothesize functions
downstream of caspase-9 to mediate cell-intrinsic killing. Our data suggest that caspase-9 cleaves SERCA2a
during MI/R disabling its function consistent with prior genetic studies showing that SERCA2a loss exacerbates
cardiomyocyte necrosis and infarct size. We believe, however, that the relationship between procaspase-9 and
SERCA2a is more complex. In addition to caspase-9 inducing SERC2a loss, our data suggest that SERCA2a
loss may contribute to caspase-9 activation through Ca2+ overload. Thus, we hypothesize that a bidirectional
mutually-reinforcing relationship exists between caspase-9 and SERCA2a and contributes to cardiomyocyte
necrosis and infarct generation in MI/R. This project investigates critical aspects of the caspase-9-mediated
necrosis pathway including activation mechanisms, downstream signaling, the relationship of the pathway to cell
death programs thought to be involved in MI/R, and whether this pathway can be therapeutically inhibited to limit
infarct size. Aim 1. To genetically dissect the caspase-9 necrosis axis during MI/R in vivo. Aim 2. To delineate
the bidirectional regulation between caspase-9 and SERCA2A in cardiomyocyte necrosis during MI/R. Aim 3. To
assess the therapeutic benefit of specifically inhibiting procaspase-9 during MI/R using a cell permeable peptide
derived from an endogenous procaspase-9 inhibitor. These studies define a novel cell death pathway that
appears important in MI/R and may provide the basis for a new therapeutic approach to limit infarct size."

Due to an alarming rise in opioid use among the general population that is mirrored in pregnant women, Neonatal
Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) rates have increased in the US from 2004 to 2014. Most newborns experiencing
NAS require non-pharmacologic care, which entails, most importantly, maternal involvement with her newborn.
Facilitating postpartum maternal-newborn involvement is critical in preventing further adverse maternal-newborn
outcomes. To achieve positive maternal-newborn involvement, mothers need to learn effective caregiving NAS
strategies while they are pregnant. Surprisingly, current obstetrical practice standards for high risk pregnant
women do not address this pressing need, in part because no interventions exist to prepare future mothers for
the challenges of caring for their newborns at risk for NAS. To address this critical gap, I propose to adapt an
existing mobile NAS tool for clinician training and decision support, for high-risk pregnant women and assess its
usability, acceptability, and feasibility in a small randomized controlled analog trial. First, I will conduct semi-
structured interviews with a panel of neonatology experts, NAS care providers, and mothers with NAS-affected
babies to gather their recommendations on management of NAS and explore their perspectives on the care of
these newborns. Findings will guide the adaptation of the existing mobile NAS tool for high-risk pregnant women.
I will then test the usability, acceptability, and feasibility of the adapted mobile tool via surveys with 10 pregnant
women receiving opioid agonist therapy (OAT) at Spokane Regional Health District’s Opioid Treatment Program
and Evergreen Recovery Center. Finally, we will randomize 30 high-risk pregnant women seen at these facilities
to either receive the adapted mobile NAS caregiving tool or usual care. We will compare these mothers on
maternal drug relapse and OAT continuation, maternal-newborn bonding, length of newborn hospital stays,
readmissions rates, breastfeeding initiation and duration, and postpartum depression and anxiety at 4, 8, and 12
weeks postpartum. Findings will serve as pilot data for a subsequent large R01 randomized controlled analog
trial testing the efficacy of the adapted NAS caregiving tool in reducing poor outcomes for NAS-affected
newborns and their mothers. My proposed research plan integrates activities, formal training, and mentorship
from experts (Drs. Sterling McPherson, Hendree Jones, John Roll, Celestina Barbosa-Leiker, and Kim Johnson)
in development, testing and implementation of substance use disorder treatment for perinatal women, mobile
health interventions, and implementation of clinical trials in perinatal women with substance use disorders. This
Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will build upon my previous training and allow me to
pursue my long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator with an established program of
research focused on the development, implementation, and testing of interventions for substance using perinatal
women and reduction of poor health outcomes for substance using perinatal women and their newborns."

The lung’s lymphatic system plays a critical role in lung health by maintaining fluid homeostasis and by serving
as a conduit for immune cell trafficking. Despite the importance of this network however, there are significant
knowledge gaps in the basic biology of this system and its key cellular constituent, the lymphatic endothelial cell
(LEC). For one, very little is known regarding the origin and replacement of lung LECs in adult life and how
different origins and micro-anatomical locations of LECs might be associated with different roles, specifically in
immune responses. Indeed, whether lung LECs comprise a heterogeneously and functionally distinct set of cell
subtypes or a largely homogenous population is unknown. After instillation of flu into the mouse left lung lobe,
we observed a local and vigorous lymphangiogenic reaction manifested by early vessel dilation followed by
expansion of the lymphatic network itself. This is associated with a significant 1.5-2-fold increase of LECs at 7
days post-infection (dpi) and a significant 2-3-fold increase at 21 dpi, a time when the virus is cleared. Edu
labeling demonstrated that 20% of LECs are proliferating at 7 dpi vs. <1% in control mice. These data along
with observations suggesting 2 distinct sources of adult LECS, one fetal and from a venous origin, and one post-
natal and from a myeloid origin, underscore the potential for LEC heterogeneity both functionally and micro-
anatomically. This will be addressed in Aim 1 by evaluating the role and localization of these 2 sources of LECs
during adult lung homeostasis and viral-induced lymphangiogenesis by lineage tracing. These studies will be
supplemented by single nuclear RNA sequencing in Aim 2 to generate LEC specific genetic information that will
be key to understanding LEC heterogeneity and immune response to infection, along with derivation of LEC
subset tissue localization markers. We also found that the flu-infected lung is characterized by decreased LEC
nuclear localization of YAP and TAZ, which are the primary transcriptional effectors in the Hippo signaling
pathway. This highly conserved pathway is a central regulator of cell phenotype in many biological systems with
decreased nuclear YAP/TAZ signifying signal inhibition. Taken together, these findings suggest that the status
of Hippo signaling may be a key factor regulating LEC proliferation and phenotype. Lastly, we observed vigorous
LEC proliferation in the contralateral uninfected lung, suggesting the interesting possibility that LEC proliferation
is a systemic response to flu. These issues will be further studied in Aim 3 by the selective deletion of hippo
signaling in LECs and by examining lymphangiogenesis in liver and heart in our flu model. In sum, we posit that
the state-of-the art shows a pronounced need for basic information that can resolve fundamental questions in
the field of lung lymphatic biology. With strong background data and robust models, we believe that the studies
in this grant will help to resolve these basic questions, and as result will expand and deepen our understanding
of LEC origin, mechanism of expansion, heterogeneity, function, and phenotype regulation."

The immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide exert their therapeutic effects by
tailoring the substrate specificity of cereblon, a component of the ubiquitin proteasome system, resulting in
altered substrate recruitment, ubiquitylation, and degradation. However, the native substrate specificity and
biological functions of cereblon are elusive, despite the conservation of cereblon across species, its association
with neurological development, and the potential impact that therapeutic engagement of cereblon would have
on these substrates and pathways. To address the urgent need for better characterization of the native role
cereblon plays in biological regulation, we undertook a novel approach to discover the substrate recognition
mechanism of cereblon. We used a targeted protein degradation approach to systematically screen
physiologically relevant ligands for functional engagement of cereblon in cells and discovered that we could
replace thalidomide with peptides bearing a C-terminal glutarimide or aspartimide, which are post-translational
modifications derived from cyclization of glutamine or asparagine, respectively. Endogenously, these C-terminal
cyclic imides may act as molecular glues to recruit substrates to cereblon by tailoring substrate recognition,
analogous to thalidomide, or may be generated directly on the substrate during protein aging and damage
response or in response to signaling events. To address these two hypotheses, we will functionally characterize
the recognition of these C-terminal cyclic imides by cereblon in cells in the context of two models: as peptide-
based metabolites that alter substrate recognition or as part of a novel degron found at the C-terminus of proteins
after protein aging or during a signaling event. We will first fully evaluate the recognition of peptide-based ligands
in the context of bifunctional degraders for targeted protein degradation to characterize the scope and
ligandability of cereblon by peptides and evaluate their ability to act as molecular glues for substrate recruitment
in a manner analogous to thalidomide and lenalidomide. Next, we will assess whether C-terminal cyclic imides
act as degrons that promote substrate recognition directly on engineered and endogenous proteins in biological
systems. To facilitate the study of these modifications, we will develop orthogonal chemical labeling strategies
to detect and map where and when these modifications occur in cells. Finally, we will investigate the formation
of these modifications in cells to characterize the conditions, pathways, and “writers” that generate the C-terminal
cyclic imides recognized by cereblon. The definition of C-terminal glutarimide and aspartimide modifications as
the key recognition elements used to recruit endogenous substrates to cereblon and the associated studies
constitutes a significant advance that will open new investigations into the biological regulation of proteins
through these post-translational modifications and the effects on these pathways during cereblon engagement
by small molecules, which will inform the use and development of therapeutics that engage cereblon in the clinic."
10876345,"Project Summary
The goal of this project is to understand how gene expression during development shapes the delicate and
massively parallel cell biological processes that promote wiring of functional networks within the cerebral
cortex. This is an important area of basic research because neural dynamics within cortical networks are the
direct correlates of thought and behavior. These cognitive processes emerge as neural circuits form through
expression of genes over the course of development. Moreover, cognitive impairment, which defines
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), is thought to arise, at least in part, from impaired neural circuit
connectivity within the developing cortex. A revelation over the past decade is that NDDs can be caused by de
novo genetic loss-of-function SNVs within a single gene. Thus, in-depth study of natural functions of these
genes can reveal the neurobiological principles underlying the typically developing cortex and as well as
principles that contribute to abnormal cortical development associated with NDDs. In this project, we will
explore the hypothesis that expression of NDD-associated genes in the typically developing cortex promotes
the assembly of cortical circuits through cell-autonomous regulation of intrinsic membrane excitability. This
hypothesis is significant because it is known that neural activity shapes the assembly of developing cortical
circuits. However, it remains unknown how genes function at the cellular level to promote activity-dependent in
vivo development of cortical circuit motifs known to promote cognitive function and behavioral adaptations. Aim
1 will explore the causal relationships between genetic control of intrinsic membrane excitability (IME), activity-
dependent dendritic morphogenesis, and developmental assembly of cortical circuits. Aim 2 will explore causal
links between genetic control of IME, neuronal ensemble structure/function, and behavioral adaptations. We
will do this by regulating genetic control of IME in developing cortical neurons and then observing the effect of
this on cortical ensembles and behavioral adaptions. This research design is important because the brain
functions across multiple temporal and spatial scales – indeed, this project attempts to link gene function
across the major levels of brain function – gene>neuron>synapse>circuit>ensemble>behavior. The overall
impact of this proposed research is that it has the potential to reveal how gene expression shapes the activity-
dependent assembly of neural circuits that promote cognitive functions required for behavioral adaptations.
Because we focus on natural functions of an NDD gene, these basic insights are also directly relatable to the
etiology of cortical wiring impairments associated with childhood brain disorders."

Reactive Oxygen Species include molecules such as superoxide, peroxide and hydroxyl
radicals. High levels of these molecules have been shown to lead to diseases such as heart
disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases. The proposal aims to determine if the
reduction potential of the Rieske protein in Complex III can be a source of superoxide when the
reduction potential is not matched its redox partner. In order to study this hypothesis, a yeast
system where mutations can be made to Rieske has been produced, and a series of mutant
yeast strains have been made. The production of superoxide will be measured using confocal
microscopy and its effect on the yeast ascertained through growth assays. In addition, the
reduction potential of the isolated yeast Rieske protein will be measured. The protein will also
be thoroughly characterized, adding a new system that has not been explored previously to the
literature."
10877784,"One of the goals of systems neuroscience is to understand how sensory information is transformed into goal-
 directed behavior via diverse brain regions and circuits. To achieve this aim, it is critical to elucidate computations
  performed within specific layers of the cortex by specific cell classes and the communication dynamics between
  multiple brain regions. Two-photon microscopy has been used successfully to perform functional brain imaging
  at the single-cell level mice, but its penetration is limited by tissue scattering to the top layers of the cortex. I have
developed a 3-photon microscope to overcome this challenge. Today, the main drawback of 3-photon
 microscope is its relatively modest speed, limiting its use for multi-site imaging. Optimizing instrument design
 and imaging protocol to overcome this limitation is required for broad end-user acceptance. In this proposal, I
 will construct and optimize a combined 2-photon and 3-photon microscope for multi-site, superficial and deep
brain imaging at single-cell resolution. Specifically, I have first developed a custom-made 3-photon microscope
with optimized laser and microscope parameters (Aim 1a). Optimizing these parameters can improve imaging
speed and imaging depth while lowering the average laser power to avoid damage in the live mouse brain. The
microscope performance improvement has been validated by performing functional imaging in the primary visual
cortex of GCaMP6 mice to characterize visual responses of each cortical layer and subplate. In addition, I will
characterize the effective attenuation lengths (EAL) of higher visual areas in awake mice with label-free imaging
and laser-ablation methods. Then, I will demonstrate the microscope’s performance by examining cell-specific
differences within a layer 6 (L6) of V1. Since neuronal responses to visual stimuli are modulated by the cortical
state such as arousal, or reward expectation, I will image adjacent sets of neurons with distinct projections to the
lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and lateral posterior (LP) regions (e.g., cortico-cortical [CC] and cortico-thalamic
[CT] neurons in L6) in primary and higher visual areas to reveal circuit-based response types within a single
cortical layer using retrobead-based tracing methods (Aim 1b). Next, I have developed custom-made 2-photon
wide-field microscope to perform neuronal recordings and manipulations in the primary visual cortex and higher
visual areas (Aim 2a). I have improved imaging speed and field of view by implementing multifocal multiphoton
microscopy (MMM). Multiple foci two-photon excitation efficiency will be optimized by coupling a diffractive
element (DOE) with customized intermediate optics. High sensitivity single-photon counting detection will be
achieved using a novel avalanche photodiode array detector. To demonstrate microscope performance and
which brain regions are necessary for a well-established goal-directed behavioral paradigm, I will perform SLM-
based two-photon optogenetics while imaging expert animals (Aim 2b). In addition to imaging and stimulating
neuronal activity across superficial depths at single regions and at multiple regions, it is necessary to image and
optogenetically manipulate neuronal activity at multiple depths, at targeted locations, and for identified neurons,
in order to determine the causality of neuronal subpopulations in behavior. Here, I will design and implement
two- and three-photon MMM systems to extend the depth performance of MMM for multi-site neuronal recording
across multiple regions and multiple layers and integrate this system with the 2-photon optogenetics system
implemented in Aim 2a (Aim 3a). I will use this technology for modulating specific components of the cortico-
cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical projections of V1-V2-PPC-MC circuit (Aim 3b)."

 The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT,1983-1993) compared intensive therapy aimed at near-normal
glycemia versus conventional therapy with no specific glucose targets in 1441 subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) over
a mean follow-up of 6.5 years. Intensive therapy reduced the risks of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy by 35-76%.
The level of glycemia was the primary determinant of complications. We also described the adverse effects of intensive
therapy; assessed its effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, neurocognition and quality of life; and projected
the lifetime health-economic impact. After the primary DCCT results were reported in 1993, intensive therapy aiming for a
HbA1c <7% was adopted world-wide as standard-of-care for T1DM.
 The Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC, 1994-present) is the observational follow-up
study of the DCCT cohort. Micro- and cardio-vascular complications and a wide range of established and putative risk
factors, including genetic and epigenetic factors, have been measured with standardized methods, carefully documented and
events adjudicated. EDIC has notably shown that the early beneficial effects of intensive versus conventional therapy on
complications persisted for ~15 years despite the convergence of HbA1c levels in the two groups during EDIC, a novel
concept termed metabolic memory. Prior intensive therapy was also shown to reduce substantially the risk of CVD events
and mortality.
 The overarching goals for the next 5 years (2022-27) will be to study the occurrence and identify potentially modifiable
risk factors of the more advanced microvascular and cardiovascular complications and physical and cognitive dysfunction
that are occurring with increasing diabetes duration and age. With increasing longevity, the increased adiposity that has
affected patients with T1DM, including EDIC participants, has potential adverse consequences. Thus, the impact of diabetes
duration, aging and adiposity on morbidities and their underlying risk factors will be studied. The results will guide treatment
priorities as T1DM patients age.
 The specific aims for 2022-2027 are to: 1) determine the incidence of advanced microvascular complications,
investigate the order of their development and pattern of co-development, and identify glycemic and non-glycemic risk
factors; 2) quantify impairment in functional and myocardial performance that presages heart failure (HF) and identify the
risk factors for impairment in T1DM; 3) determine the prevalence of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and
steatohepatitis-associated fibrosis (NASH) and symptoms suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in this increasingly
overweight/obese T1DM study population and identify precedent risk factors and mechanisms; and 4) continue the
longitudinal assessment of aging-sensitive morbidities such as cognitive and physical dysfunction, frailty, and their risk
factors and their aggregate impact on quality of life, ability to self-manage T1DM, and health economic outcomes."

The magnitude of the overdose crisis has brought an increased focus to a well-known public health tool
referred to as harm reduction—a set of strategies or programs implemented to reduce the negative
consequences associated with the use of opioids and other substances while maintaining respect for the
individual. Recognizing the importance of harm reduction in addressing the ongoing opioid crisis and
substance use disorder more broadly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Helping to End
Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative, intends to launch a Harm Reduction Network (HRN) of nine research
projects and a Coordination Center (CC) to improve understanding of the effectiveness and outcomes of
implementation of harm reduction strategies. RTI proposes to serve as the CC for the HRN. In this capacity,
RTI will provide scientific, administrative, and logistical support for the HRN to facilitate network coordination
and communication (Aim 1). Recognizing the importance of data harmonization for harm reduction research,
RTI will facilitate a stakeholder-engaged process of developing common metrics and measures to support
HEAL data harmonization, data infrastructure and sharing, and provide methodology consultations (Aim 2).
Given the importance of involving stakeholder voices to adequately identify the problems faced by specific
populations and serve them with evidence-based solutions, RTI will facilitate a conceptually driven
engagement of stakeholders representing individuals and communities at highest risk for harms associated
with drug use (Aim 3). To accelerate the translation of research findings into practice, RTI will establish a
research infrastructure that facilitates the timely development and dissemination of translational products,
including effective dissemination strategies through user-centered design (Aim 4). Our CC team is led by
multiple Principal Investigators Drs. Emmanuel Oga and Jessica Cance, who are experienced leaders of the
largest existing NIH HEAL multisite efforts. The broader team of Core leaders, co-investigators, and scientific
advisors bring significant expertise in harm reduction, data harmonization, statistical methodology, data
infrastructure development and management, and implementation science. RTI has extensive experience
successfully running CCs and retains substantive collective expertise in substance use research, harm
reduction, and community engagement to implement a portfolio of scientific and support activities for the
network. The RTI CC will provide the needed robust central operation to coordinate a comprehensive
multiproject, multipronged research endeavor that demonstrates an understanding of the methodological
complexities of integrating evidence from multiple sources with diverse populations and outcomes."

There is increasing evidence that early intervention for psychosis in coordinated specialty care (CSC) services
improves outcomes and lives. The outcome of early course psychosis (EP) is heterogeneous, ranging from early
full recovery to treatment resistance and functional decline from the onset of illness. This heterogeneity limits
our ability to predict individual level outcomes needed for treatment planning and for tailoring the type, duration
and intensity of therapeutic interventions. Biomarkers as well as clinical and demographic features, early in the
illness can predict outcome, but taken individually, their prognostic value is limited. Our Bipolar- Schizophrenia
Network for Intermediate Phenotypes (BSNIP) consortium has recently developed, replicated and validated a
biomarker (EEG, eye movement testing, and neurocognition) based categorization (Biotypes 1, 2 and 3) in a
trans-diagnostic sample of cases with idiopathic psychosis (schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar
disorder with psychosis), ranging from 18-35 years of age. In this study, we will leverage this categorization,
along with clinical and biomarker data to predict illness trajectory and outcome during follow-up at 1, 6 and 12
months in 320 EP patients across CSC clinics at the five B-SNIP sites. First, we will characterize outcome
trajectories and Biotype structure in EP. Our available data indicate the Biotype structure will be the same in EP
as in our large sample. Second, we will investigate the predictive value of the nine bio-factors and the three
Biotypes identified by B-SNIP for symptomatic and functional outcome. We predict that the EP population will
manifest distinct outcome clinical trajectories (good, intermediate and poor) and will have a Biotype structure
similar to that seen in chronic psychosis subjects, i.e., Biotypes 1, 2 and 3) (hypothesis 1). Biotype-3, and
Biotye-2 cases, will have the best outcomes (defined both categorically, and dimensionally, using symptomatic,
cognitive and functional measures); Biotype-1 will have the worst outcomes to CSC treatment, across all target
time points (hypothesis 2). Notably, Biotype-1 and Biotype-2 cases will have the same level of cognition function
at baseline. Finally, we will investigate the predictive value of clinical (such as diagnosis, illness duration,
substance abuse, and treatment adherence), and biomarker (including neuroimaging) features in a multi-variate
model and will develop a feasible biomarker battery and predictive algorithm for application in community CSC
sites nation-wide. We will thus provide to the field a means for predicting success of EP cases in CSC treatment
to improve clinical practice and to enhance efficient use of available treatment resources."

The epidemiology of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) indicates a significant
relationship in the population for both close (first or second cousins) and distant (third cousins) relatives. Our
objective is to identify DNA differences that distinguish people with ME/CFS from healthy controls. We will use
a well-established, well-powered, genome-wide association study (GWAS) design that has a demonstrated
ability to identify genes, as well as novel molecular and cellular pathways, contributing to susceptibility for other
complex diseases. GWAS have shown that about 10-times more cases will be needed to be well-powered.
We will obtain saliva DNA from a minimum of 5,000 individuals meeting Institute of Medicine/National Academy
of Medicine (IOM/NAM) and/or Canadian Consensus Criteria (CCC) for ME/CFS. ME/CFS subjects will be
recruited via a questionnaire created by the Solve ME/CFS Initiative (Solve ME) and will utilize a smartphone
application designed by Care Evolution. Genotyping data from these US-based ME/CFS cases will be compared
to data from 400,000 healthy controls genotyped by the Kaiser Permanente Research Bank (KPRB) using the
Axiom Precision Medicine Diversity v2 Plus Array. Once data from US-based cases is obtained (Solve ME and
KPRB), it will be used in a US case-control GWAS, before being trans-ancestry meta-analyzed with UK cohort
data from the DecodeME Study and the UK Biobank (UKB).
The two cohorts are complementary by providing opportunities for replicating associated loci and for using
diverse genetic ancestries to enhance predictive power. We anticipate that genetic associations will provide the
evidence base necessary to improve the perception of ME/CFS among health care professionals and the general
public and yield insights into risk and pathogenesis that have the potential to result in interventions."
10877858,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Systemic immune activation in people living with HIV has been hypothesized to account for higher incidence of
chronic inflammatory diseases, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). Acute HIV infection
in the CNS is thought to initiate a cascade of pro-inflammatory events that result in inflammation-induced
neuronal injury and associated neurocognitive disorders that are evident even in the present combination
antiretroviral therapy (cART) era. The use of psychostimulants (such as cocaine and methamphetamine) and
alcohol has been shown to disrupt BBB integrity. Disrupted BBB may increase immune cell infiltrating into the
CNS and promote glial activation, increased inflammation and neurotoxicity. Interestingly, increased permeability
of BBB has been implicated in the progression of HIV neurological dysfunction. Thus, the combined effect of
cocaine usage and HIV infection can cause an additive effect on BBB disruption and further impact HIV-related
neurocognitive impairments. However, not much genome-wide molecular level study has been done in
understanding BBB integrity in substance use disorder and in HIV infection/HAND. The proposed study will
address this important question. Our central hypothesis is that cocaine misuse exacerbates HIV pathogenesis
in the CNS by disrupting blood-brain barrier and dysregulating the glial population in the brain. Our overall
objective is to exploit cell type specific transcriptomic information at the single nuclei level from patient brain
samples to characterize the effects of cocaine use disorder on CNS neuronal and glial cells, HIV infection and
HANDs. We will characterize single nuclei gene expression and identify dysregulated gene regulatory networks
in each of the neuronal and glial populations associated with cocaine misuse in HIV infected individuals and/or
with HANDs. We will also perform computational analysis to identify neuronal and glial cell regulatory networks
altered by cocaine misuse. In the validation and functional characterization component, we will characterize top
genes in 3D brain organoid model and will characterize with CRISPR knockout and overexpression of the gene.
Successful completion of these aims will have significant research and clinical impact by 1) elucidating how
cocaine misuse alters HIV/HAND pathogenesis in the CNS, and 2) discovering candidate molecules to regulate
HIV infection or persistence in the CNS in the context of cocaine misuse."
10877433,"Loss of hair-cell innervation by auditory-nerve fibers is a prevalent cochlear pathology in humans associated
with aging and sound overexposure, that does not impact audiometric thresholds in quiet. Called cochlear
synaptopathy, this inner-ear problem is widely expected to cause “hidden” hearing difficulties such as impaired
speech perception in noise. However, evidence that synaptopathy causes hidden hearing loss remains
controversial despite over a decade of intensifying research on the topic. Animal studies are well positioned to
advance this field because the approach allows direct induction of synaptopathy and targeted neural
recordings to identify underlying mechanisms. However, only a few studies have leveraged this approach. The
proposed study will clarify specific aspects of perception impacted by synaptopathy and underlying
mechanisms using animal behavioral experiments, auditory-nerve fiber recordings, and midbrain-neural
recordings in actively behaving animals. Experiments are conducted in budgerigars (parakeet) based on
adaptability of this species to operant-conditioning experiments and behavioral sensitivity similar to humans on
many simple and complex hearing tasks. Furthermore, accumulating evidence highlights conserved auditory
processing mechanisms between birds and mammals at peripheral and central levels. We test the novel
hypothesis that synaptopathy impairs perception of brief acoustic cues due to amplification of neural onset
responses, a nominal “gain of function” that we predict will degrade neural resolution of short signals due to
response saturation. This hypothesis is a significant departure from conventional theories based on low
spontaneous-rate fiber loss, which was not confirmed in a recent mouse study, and has direct relevance to
speech communication for which auditory analysis of short time periods is often critical. Furthermore, the
hypothesis is supported by recent auditory-nerve studies, and new preliminary data in budgerigars showing
that synaptopathy selectively degrades detection of tone bursts presented at the onset of a noise masker.
Synaptopathy is induced with kainic acid and validated histologically using established methodology. Additional
Aim-1 studies extend behavioral experiments into the critical realm of speech using synthesized consonants.
Aim-2 experiments use single-fiber auditory-nerve recordings to establish a firm baseline knowledge of how
synaptopathy impacts peripheral encoding and temporal dynamics. Aim 3 uses neural recordings from a key
midbrain processing center to determine the changes in central processing with synaptopathy; recordings from
actively behaving animals are analyzed with neural decision-variable correlations for maximum insight into
neural bases of normal and impaired perception. The detailed knowledge of specific perceptual deficits and
underlying changes in peripheral/central encoding provided by this work will help guide the development of
new public-health strategies to address cochlear synaptopathy. Ultimately, the proposed project holds promise
to expand and potentially redefine current thinking on synaptopathy and hidden hearing loss."

In the current post-Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic era, the scientific community is preparing
for the need for seasonal vaccination campaigns similar to annual influenza vaccination to slow transmission.
Uptake of COVID-19 vaccines for children has been lackluster, mirroring a trend observed for seasonal
influenza vaccines among pediatric patients. The low vaccination rates for both COVID-19 and influenza
among children are starkly contrasted with the relatively stable, high rates for non-seasonal, childhood
vaccines, including hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, and varicella vaccines. These data support
findings that parents are more hesitant to vaccinate their children against influenza when compared to non-
seasonal, childhood vaccines, and the slow uptake of COVID-19 vaccines among children suggests that a
similar trend has emerged for COVID-19. These overarching trends suggest that the determinants of parental
hesitancy for seasonal respiratory vaccines (SRVs) may fundamentally differ from those for non-seasonal
vaccines, though this phenomenon has not previously been explored. This gap has significant implications for
the development of interventions to address SRV hesitancy. If the underlying determinants of vaccine
hesitancy differ for seasonal versus non-seasonal vaccines, the evidence-based interventions employed to
overcome vaccine hesitancy may not be transferrable to SRVs in the post-pandemic era. My long-term career
goal is design and implement high-fidelity interventions for addressing pediatric vaccine hesitancy as an
independently-funded investigator. The proposed project’s overall objective is to identify factors influencing
parental SRV hesitancy in the post-pandemic era to inform a targeted communication strategies intervention
for pediatricians tailored to address SRV hesitancy. We will accomplish the project objective through a mixed-
methods study with the following aims: 1) Identify determinants of parental SRV hesitancy; 2) Identify
pediatricians’ perceived challenges and facilitators of vaccine communication; and 3) Develop and pilot a
communication strategies curriculum for pediatricians tailored to address parental SRV hesitancy. This pilot
study has the potential to generate contemporary, evidence-based communication tools to minimize physician
burnout around vaccine discussions, and ultimately to promote pediatric SRV uptake. In the process, I will
advance my training by developing 1) expertise in health communication and behavioral science, 2) advanced
techniques in mixed methods design, 3) expertise in health communication interventions and implementation
science, and 4) leadership and professional development skills to translate my findings into clinical practice. In
summary, this research will help develop my expertise in mixed methods and behavioral interventions,
enabling me to become an independent investigator capable of developing and translating novel vaccine
hesitancy interventions to real-world clinical settings, with the ultimate goal of promoting widespread vaccine
uptake among children."

This K24 renewal builds upon the successful clinical research and mentorship performed by the candidate,
Sylvia Becker-Dreps, MD, MPH. As a natural extension of Dr. Becker-Dreps’ previous work on human norovirus
(NoV), this proposal expands her research skillset to investigate maternal protection against NoV in early
childhood. Understanding how the maternal-child interface acts to protect against NoV can guide interventions
to reduce childhood NoV disease burden. In addition, she plans to purposefully integrate trainees into her
research. Candidate: Dr. Becker-Dreps is a physician-scientist dually appointed in Family Medicine and
Epidemiology. Her research focuses on the epidemiology and prevention of viral gastroenteritis in children. She
employs a multidisciplinary approach combining robust field epidemiology with state-of-the-art laboratory
methods. Her group contributed to understanding poor rotavirus vaccine performance in low-resource settings
and characterized the natural history, clinical characteristics, and risk factors for sapovirus gastroenteritis. During
the first K24 award period, she shifted her focus to NoV, and answered fundamental questions about the
development of NoV immunity to inform vaccine development. The proposed career development activities will
expand Dr. Becker-Dreps’ skillsets to allow her to characterize components of maternal protection against NoV
in early life. Research Plan: The proposed research builds on recent epidemiological findings showing that
maternal glycobiology is associated with protection against NoV. Specifically, her group found that children of
mothers who are “secretors” of fut-2-dependent fucosylated oligosaccharides have a lower risk of NoV. Using
existing data and biobanked samples from a Nicaraguan birth cohort including 419 breastfeeding mother-child
dyads, she plans to elucidate differences in breastmilk oligosaccharide composition and NoV-specific antibodies
in breastmilk and serum by maternal secretor status, and to understand their independent contributions to the
risk of NoV in early life. She will also determine whether differences in infant gut microbiome composition are
associated with the risk of NoV gastroenteritis. Mentoring Plan. Dr. Becker-Dreps has an established track
record of successfully mentoring trainees in patient-oriented research, and for attracting trainees from groups
underrepresented in science. Trainees will be offered access to existing data and samples from two large
maternal-child cohort studies and will be encouraged to identify independent research projects that they can take
ownership of. To complement her one-on-one project-based mentorship, she will leverage UNC’s extensive
resources, including from UNC’s CTSA, NIH-funded training programs, and through a new leadership role at the
UNC Office of Global Health Education. Without K24 funding, her available time for mentorship is limited. She
plans to use protected time afforded by the K24 renewal to provide high quality mentorship to early clinical
investigators with the goal of cultivating the next generation of global health infectious disease investigators."

Machine learning (ML)—i.e., the use of computer algorithms that can automatically learn from sampled data and
make predictions or decisions without explicit programming—is increasingly important in a wide array of
applications, from image and speech recognition to product recommendation systems. Meanwhile, synthetic
chemistry plays a central role in the development of medicines, agrochemicals, fine chemicals, and new
materials, but the field has traditionally shown a strong aversion to adopting ML tools.
A fundamental challenge in synthetic chemistry is to expedite access to high-value building blocks in a
predictable and efficient manner to accelerate discovery programs. However, the development and optimization
of new synthetic methodologies have traditionally relied on empirical methods. This trial-and-error approach
wastes crucial time and resources, limits the likelihood of unexpected discoveries, and fails to identify reactivity
cliffs or rationalize the role of additives. The goal of this proposed project is to integrate ML with synthetic
chemistry to provide solutions to these longstanding challenges, particularly in the contexts of med-chem library
preparation, process optimization, and rapid assembly of chiral bioactive structures. Two aims of this career
development application are: (a) Mentored phase (K99): My short-term goal is to learn ML and data science
tools, while developing ML workflows that reduce the number of experiments needed to obtain the desired
outcome of any chemical reactions (i.e., optimization). This will be realized by undertaking three distinct types
of optimization campaign, in the form of three case studies (A1, A2, and A3) that reflect those typically
encountered in chemistry settings. (b) Independent phase (Roo): Armed with a better understanding of ML and
data science, my long-term goal is to facilitate design and discovery of robust new asymmetric methods. This will
be achieved by engaging in three different case studies (B1, B2, and B3) where stereoselectivity is currently poor
or nonexistent. These projects will enable me to create my own niche in catalytic research.
Integration of my established expertise (asymmetric synthesis and comp chem) with that of the host lab (ML,
data science, and photoredox catalysis), together with enabling technologies from Merck and Genentech (HTE),
will collectively confer the capability to accomplish these overall goals. The excellent facilities of UCLA will be
augmented by close industry collaboration and the active support of the C-CAS consortium. Overall,
through this fellowship, I will gain critical mentored training in both academic and industry settings, build new

Human craniofacial development is a complex process and frequently goes awry to cause a major class of
birth defects, orofacial clefting, which affects approximately 1 in 700 live births. Proper facial development in
mouse and human requires three sets of paired facial prominences coming together by growth,
morphogenesis, and fusion. Embryonic facial development is strikingly similar in human and mouse, making
the mouse the best available model system for human. Previous studies have shown that the expression of
many thousands of genes changes across tissue layer, age, and/or prominence, as well as cell population
during early mouse facial development. However, we still only have a rudimentary understanding of how these
changes are regulated by the interaction of transcriptional modulators in the developing face. To understand
how genes are transcriptionally regulated during facial development, this research seeks to construct
transcriptional regulatory networks in a temporospatial manner by in silico analysis of publicly available multi-
omic datasets. Aim 1 will focus on the identification and verification of transcriptional regulatory networks
operating in facial mesenchyme with a focus on super-enhancers. Aim 2 will adopt a similar approach to study
the ectoderm which acts as a vital signaling center for the mesenchyme. Finally, in Aim 3 I will apply
knowledge from Aims 1 and 2 to build transcriptional regulatory networks at the single cell level. These aims
will take advantage of available RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, histone marker ChIP-seq, transcription factor ChIP-seq,
bulk and single cell RNA-seq data from wild-type or mutant mice, as well as facial enhancer expression
databases. Accomplishment of these studies will predict how genes are transcriptionally regulated in a
temporospatial manner during facial development and discover sets of core transcription factors and super-
enhancers controlling facial development. These transcriptional regulatory networks will be relevant to the
genetic and molecular underpinnings of human orofacial clefting, and will provide clear testable predictions
about transcription factor function and the consequences of aberrant expression. Performance and
accomplishment of these Aims will also act as a major component of my career development plan, in which my
goal is to obtain and independent tenure-track faculty position and serve as a mentor to the next generation of
scientists. A major aspect of my career development plan is to build on my growing strength in bioinformatics
by learning more advanced techniques in this specialty alongside new computational based approaches, such
as machine learning. In this respect, my Aims and career development plan are aligned with a Notice of
Special Interest (NOSI) of NIDCR in Supporting Dental, Oral, and Craniofacial Research Using Bioinformatic,
Computational, and Data Science Approaches (NOT-DE-20-006) for which this application is targeted. I have
recruited a mentorship team with specialties in craniofacial biology, bioinformatics, machine learning, and
career development to help me achieve these goals."
10889933,"Frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) is an understudied clinical neurodegenerative condition even
though it is the most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in people <65 years old. The
most common frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathology associated with FTD is TDP-43
proteinopathy known as FTLD-TDP with the other major class consisting of cases of FTLD-Tau. Moreover,
several autosomal dominant gene mutations and disease-associated genetic variants have been associated
with FTD. Aside from genetic mutations that are associated with specific subtypes of FTLD, there are no
known biomarkers for the vast majority of FTD patients with sporadic disease that can reliably distinguish
patients with FTLD-TDP histopathology from those with FTLD-Tau pathology, nor from patients who present
with clinical FTD but are atypical variants of pathological AD. The Neuropathology & Genetics Core will work
with other cores and projects to improve our understanding of the TDP-related degeneration of multilevel
neural networks examined in this Program Project Grant (PPG). This core will perform a comprehensive post-
mortem brain autopsy examination to provide a definitive autopsy diagnosis for cases followed in the clinical
core B and the neuroimaging core C. We will also perform a comprehensive genetic analysis of cases and
controls to identify disease causing and associated genetic changes. Additional activities will including banking
of tissues and nucleic acids, providing tissues, data and expertise to other investigators, and conducting RNA

Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly
understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors,
onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development,
and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes.
Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ-
cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray
radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of-
fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical
or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim-
ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip-
ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use.
We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map-
ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population
with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg-
mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of
reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech-
niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test,
which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA.
Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D
isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated
cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated
semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement
units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa-
tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures.
Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate
asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade.
Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and
left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL-
injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable
widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments."

Ting Therapeutics LLC is a pharmaceutical company developing drugs to prevent and treat hearing loss.
Cisplatin is one of the most widely used drugs to treat cancers. However, cisplatin therapy causes hearing loss
in 40-60% of the patients. To date, no drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for
protection from cisplatin-induced hearing loss (CIHL). Most candidate compounds currently in pre-clinical and
clinical trials are related to antioxidants, vitamins, and glutathione metabolism, many of which, such as sodium
thiosulfate, interfere with cisplatin’s ability to kill the tumor cells. We have performed unbiased in silico virtual
screens for otoprotectants against CIHL and identified 20 FDA-approved drugs including TT002, known as
niclosamide, an anthelmintic (gut worm) drug used in humans world-wide for nearly four decades. In vitro: TT002
showed a comparable level of protection against cisplatin damage in a cochlear cell line to kenpaullone, with an
IC50 of 0.17 μM, substantially (>10X) lower and better than four other benchmark otoprotectants. Moreover,
TT002 did not interfere with cisplatin anti-cancer activity in vitro. In vivo: TT002 attenuates hearing loss in adult
mice treated with cisplatin (30 mg/kg once) when delivered intraperitoneally (IP) at 10 mg/kg/day for 4
consecutive days. Interestingly, TT002 also protects against NIHL (100 dB SPL 8-16 kHz for 2 hrs) in adult FVB
mice when delivered IP at 10 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days. In this SBIR Phase II, we will perform
Investigational New Drug-enabling experiments to test TT002’s effect on cisplatin’s tumor killing efficacy in vivo
and to conduct efficacy studies to define an optimal dosing regimen and therapeutic index. The long-term goal
is for TT002 to become a standard otoprotective drug of cisplatin-based therapies. For this purpose, we will
demonstrate TT002’s efficacy in a mouse model of cisplatin ototoxicity that mimics the administration protocol in
cancer patients (Aim 1). We will determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles in blood and
perilymph, as well as efficacy, in a guinea pig model for cisplatin-induced hearing loss (Aim 2). This Aim will be
performed under contract with an independent and reputable Contract Research Organization, Turner Scientific
LLC. Finally, we will test drug-drug interactions in vitro and we will verify, in vivo, that TT002 does not interfere
with cisplatin’s anti-cancer activity in mouse model xenografts (Aim 3). By successfully completing these studies,
Ting Therapeutics will obtain critical data necessary for the initiation of Investigational New Drug enabling
complaint preclinical studies and subsequent clinical trials. Ting Therapeutics has filed a Patent Cooperation
Treaty (PCT) for both the US and international rights. The completion of this proposal will allow Ting Therapeutics
to initiate conversations with pharmaceutical companies and venture investments for the commercialization of
TT002."

Abstract
The Baylor Neurosurgery Residency has been in place for over 60 years, and has long been one of the
nation’s largest and most well respected neurosurgical training programs. The program has always had a
strong academic tradition, and graduates have served as faculty at many leading medical schools, but
historically there was a decidedly clinical emphasis. A decade ago, a strategic decision was made to focus on
research and research education by capitalizing on the extraordinary scientific resources at Baylor College of
Medicine and affiliated institutions in the Texas Medical Center. The residency was retooled to substantially
enhance its ability to train the next generation of academic neurosurgeons. In addition to developing a culture
that emphasizes evidence-based practice, clinical and basic research, and didactic training in basic
neuroscience underlying neurosurgical practice, the program was expanded by a full year in order to provide
residents with a deeper and more meaningful academic experience, and the program implemented the Baylor
Research Education Program in Neurosurgery funded by an NINDS R25 grant. The Baylor R25 Program
empowers an elite subset of trainees in the Baylor Neurosurgery Residency Program to develop into
academicians who effectively combine clinical neurosurgery practice with research that advances the field. We
select outstanding individual neurosurgery residents who have the background, talent, and motivation to
become successful physician-scientists, and then carefully integrate additional specialized research education
into their residency training. The R25 program mentors these residents through the entire research process,
from project conception to experimental design, data analysis and interpretation, to publication of results, and
finally to the development of an effective plan for beginning a career as a physician-scientist, with mentorship
extending beyond residency. While the early results of the program reveal clear success in producing
neurosurgeon-scientists, the structure and curriculum of the R25 program has been continually revised and
enhanced based on ongoing analysis of evaluations from participants and mentors, and an improved iteration
of the program has been developed for this renewal application. The hallmark of this program is a research
block during the 5th and 6th years of the residency, which has been expanded to 18-months. During this block,
the trainee engages in a mentored research project on a near full-time basis. This hands-on approach is the
most effective way to prepare young neurosurgeon-scientists for a productive research career by allowing
them to conduct research independently, but with enough support to avoid the common pitfalls experienced by
young researchers. In addition to carrying out a research project, residents selected for the research education
program will be trained in experimental design, scientific writing, oral presentation, and in the responsible
conduct of research. Furthermore, they will receive considerable oversight and career counseling from a team
of experts mentors with the intent of paving their way to success in obtaining a mentored career development
award and becoming a productive physician-scientist."

This application proposes the formation of the Michigan-Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) EDRN
Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC). This BCC represents a collaborative, multi-disciplinary team of
academic (University of Michigan (U-M) and VUMC) and industry (LynxDx) partners focused on discovering,
developing, and scaling clinical-grade assays for the early detection of aggressive prostate cancer. Through
previous EDRN efforts, our team characterized multiple important prostate cancer biomarkers, most notably the
TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusions. Through collaboration with an EDRN Clinical Validation Center (CVC; Dr. Sanda
PI), we developed, validated, and clinically implemented MyProstateScore (MPS), an early detection test
incorporating urine quantification of two prostate cancer-specific transcripts—the TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusion
and the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PCA3. Introduced in our CLIA laboratory, MPS informs shared decision
making after PSA testing based on individualized risk predictions of aggressive prostate cancer on biopsy. Here,
pairing the cancer-specific components of the MPS test with recent discovery of high-grade cancer-specific
biomarkers, we outline the development, optimization, and clinical validation of the next generation of diagnostic
tests – capable of reliably, selectively detecting potentially lethal cancers that stand to benefit from early curative
treatment. Our Biomarker Developmental Laboratory (BDL) will employ the experimental platform, MPS-SEQ,
for capture RNA-seq analysis of urine samples to detect aggressive prostate cancer transcripts, lncRNAs,
circular RNAs, fusion transcripts, mutations, indels, and splice variants. Our Biomarker Reference Laboratory
(BRL) will in parallel develop a clinical grade urine assay, MPS-50, for the multiplex QPCR analysis of up to 50
amplicons. While the first 50 amplicons of MPS-50 have already been nominated, future improvements of the
assay content and platform will be informed by work carried out in our BDL. To fuel these studies, our BCC has
identified urine biospecimen cohorts collected under rigorous standard operating procedures in compliance with
PRoBE criteria including the Michigan Prostate SPORE, Emory University, the Center for Prostate Disease
Research, University of Texas San Antonio Health, Eastern Virginia Medical School, and VUMC/Meharry
Medical College. The overall Aims of this BCC serve to develop, assess, and optimize MPS-SEQ and MPS-50
for identifying high-grade prostate cancer in diverse at-risk populations. Our BRL will also focus on standardizing
clinically-validated biomarker assays for consistent and reliable use in accordance with CLIA/CAP guidelines at
the U-M Center for Translational Pathology in order to facilitate network consortium studies and at LynxDx in
order to scale, commercialize, and obtain FDA approvals. As recognized by the EDRN, novel biomarkers specific
for aggressive prostate cancer are urgently needed. Importantly, our mission and efforts extend beyond our BCC
and prostate cancer, as we actively participate in the EDRN biomarker community and support continued
collaborative efforts with other BCCs and CVCs to advance the overall EDRN mission."

The overarching goal of the Cancer Therapeutics (CT) Program is to develop innovative approaches to
discover, design, develop, and validate novel anticancer agents and combination regimens for the treatment of
human cancers. To achieve this mission, the Program focuses on three main themes: (1) discover and develop
in a pre-clinical setting, novel targets and assays to complement the innovative approaches to drug discovery,
novel agents, and combination regimens; (2) investigate the mechanisms of action of new and existing
anticancer agents; and (3) conduct early-phase (I/II) clinical trials with a focus on translation of UPMC Hillman
Cancer Center (HCC) science and discoveries of novel agents, as well as in partnership with the National
Cancer Institute (NCI), NCI cancer centers, other academic centers, cooperative groups, and industry. The
strategy for successfully carrying out this mission requires the involvement of the entire continuum of basic,
preclinical, and clinical/translational research. Under the leadership of Adam Brufsky, MD, PhD, Edward
Chu, MD and Peter Wipf, PhD, CT has 58 members representing 16 academic departments and 5 schools
within the University of Pittsburgh. CT members conduct cancer-focused research supported by $14.9M in total
annual direct costs funding, of which $2.8M is NCI funding, $2.0M is other peer-reviewed, and $10.1M is non-
peer reviewed. From 2015-August 2019, CT members published 1,116 cancer-related publications
representing 26% intra-programmatic, 41% inter-programmatic and 64% inter-institutional collaborations. HCC
support, including Clinical Protocol and Data Management and all Shared Resources, greatly facilitate and

10892697,"Abstract: Leadership, Planning and Evaluation
UPMC Hillman Cancer Center’s (HCC) planning and evaluation activities are well-developed and provide
invaluable guidance to the HCC Senior Leadership Team (SLT): Director (Robert L. Ferris, MD, PhD), HCC
Deputy Director (Edward Chu, MD), Deputy Director for Research Administration (Chad A. Ellis, PhD) and the
Associate Directors for Basic Research (Shivendra Singh, PhD), Clinical Research (Antoinette Wozniak, MD),
Population Sciences (Jian-Min Yuan, MD, PhD), Training and Education (Christopher Bakkenist, PhD),
Catchment Area Research (Margaret Rosenzweig, PhD, CRNP-C, AOCN, FAAN), and Health Equity and
Community Outreach & Engagement (Linda Robertson, RN, MSN, DrPH). Individually accomplished, with
strong scientific and leadership achievements, they work collectively as the SLT HCC’s primary decision-
making body for setting the Center’s overall strategic direction. The SLT provides direction in issues relevant to
HCC operations, management, and policy, and oversees all research activities. This leadership team also sets
budgetary and fiscal priorities and reviews HCC membership.
In addition to the SLT, several key internal and external governance structures provide the primary means by
which the HCC conducts ongoing planning and evaluation: the Research Executive Advisory Committee
(REAC), Shared Resources Oversight Committee (SROC), Clinical Research Oversight Committee (CROC),
Committee for Health Equity and Community Outreach & Engagement (CHECOE), Committee for Excellence
in Cancer Education and Training (CECET), Facilities and Common Equipment Committee (FACE), and the
Internal and External Advisory Boards. The REAC includes the SLT, Program and Shared Resources
leadership, and key senior HCC members, and is an effective mechanism for information exchange among
HCC stakeholders and serves as the primary forum for strategic planning. The External Advisory Board (EAB),
comprising recognized leaders in basic, clinical, translational and population sciences, and cancer center
administration, meets at least annually to review all aspects of HCC operations and new initiatives. Since his
appointment, Dr. Ferris augmented EAB membership to better align with HCC scientific priorities and goals.
Additional planning input is provided by retreats, other Center advisory committees, surveys and ad hoc
external reviews.
With careful planning and critical input from the different advisory groups, HCC leadership initiated an
important strategic visioning and planning process, reorganized the research program structure, and created
new committees to continuously improve oversight and governance. These coordinated teams provide critical
advice and guidance, ensuring that the HCC effectively sets priorities and pursues objectives that promote its
mission."
10892698,"Abstract: Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM)
Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) at the UPMC Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) is supported by
the Department of Clinical Research Services (CRS). CRS facilitates the development, implementation,
coordination, internal data monitoring, and completion of both pediatric and adult oncology-focused trials. CRS
supports national, external peer-reviewed, institutional, and industry trials at all phases, involving all treatment
modalities, with 413 active trials in 2018, including 266 early phase (Pilot, Phase 1/2), 72 Investigator-Initiated
Trials (IITs) of which 43 are developed by HCC investigators, and 96 national trials (DT4). HCC accrued 1,843
patients on interventional trials of whom 745 were on therapeutic trials in CY 2018, and 12,752 Interventional
accruals of which 4,197 are therapeutic during the current reporting period. CPDM/CRS supports HCC
institutional (i.e., investigator-initiated), multi-center cooperative group/National Clinical Trial Network (NCTN),
consortium, and industry-sponsored trials. CPDM leadership was modified in 2018 with the appointment of
Antoinette Wozniak, MD, an experienced clinical investigator, as the Associate Director (AD) for Clinical
Research to oversee the development of the scientific strategy for HCC and the promotion of investigator-
initiated clinical research to take advantage of the strong basic and translational scientific programs at HCC.
Also new in 2018, Bhanu Pappu, PhD, MHA, joined as the AD for Clinical Research Operations and provides
day-to-day administrative oversight of CRS and executes the strategic plan. Since their arrival in 2018, they
have streamlined several processes, started new initiatives to decrease clinical trial activation times, increased
staff retention, allocated CPDM staff based on trial complexity, strengthened internal audit processes, and
enhanced collaborations with the expansive UPMC community oncology practices. Early trends indicate that
clinical trial activation times have decreased significantly and patient enrollment on therapeutic clinical trials
has increased by 30% in 2019 compared to 2018. Data and Safety Monitoring is an integral part of the CPDM
which is overseen by the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) and supported by the internal audit
team as well as the Education and Compliance Office of the University of Pittsburgh. An independent safety
team ensures that all disease or modality centers (DMC) across HCC follow the same SOPs for patient safety
reporting and submits its reports to the DSMC Chair. Participation of women continues to be high (67%
accruals in 2018 are women). Minority participation is stable (5.4%) and closer to the percentage of minority
patients seen at HCC, but HCC leadership recognized the need and opportunity to increase minority
enrollment, hence various strategies to enhance minority trial participation are outlined in Part III of CPDM. The
Pediatric Oncology Program at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh is integrated with HCC and recruited 60
patients on clinical trials out of 164 analytical cases in 2018 (37%)."
10892699,"Abstract: Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS)
Chaired by Leonard Appleman, MD, PhD, Hillman Cancer Center’s (HCC) Protocol Review Committee’s
(PRC) (Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRC/PRMS) goal is to promote the highest scientific caliber
clinical trials and ensure adequate internal oversight of the scientific aspects of cancer clinical trials with a
focus on scientific merit, priorities, and progress following these specific aims: 1) provide clinical protocol
scientific review before IRB submission, 2) monitor open clinical trials for ongoing scientific merit and
progress, and 3) close trials that fail to meet benchmarks for continued scientific merit and timely accrual.
The priority order of clinical trials for are as follows: external peer-reviewed investigator-initiated trials,
institutional (investigator-initiated) clinical trials, investigator-initiated industry-supported trials, national (ET-
CTN and NCTN) trials, and industry-sponsored trials. PRC/PRMS works in concert with Clinical Protocol and
Data Management (CPDM), and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) to ensure safe and
efficient conduct of clinical trials at HCC. The PRC/PRMS role is distinct from the DSMC responsibility of
ensuring protocol safety and data quality. The PRC/PRMS also works in conjunction with three other parts of
the clinical trials enterprise: the IRB, the UPMC HCC Biostatistics Facility and the UPMC HCC
Disease/Modality Center (DMC) teams. The PRC/PRMS has three committees (A, B, and C). Committees A
and B alternately review all oncology trials such that one of the Committees meets every 2 weeks to ensure
rapid review of studies and facilitate prompt progression of cancer protocols from the PRC/PRMS to the
responsible IRB. Committee C reviews biobehavioral, cancer epidemiology, cancer prevention and control,
and complementary medicine protocols on an ad hoc basis as required. The PRC/PRMS members are
appointed by the HCC Director Robert Ferris, MD, PhD, in consultation with Antoinette Wozniak, MD, HCC
Associate Director for Clinical Research. The PRC/PRMS committee consists of representative key
academic and clinical faculty from medical oncology, radiation oncology, surgical oncology, pediatric
oncology, and also includes biostatisticians, pharmacists, CPDM staff, clinical fellows and basic cancer
researchers. Pathologists who are members of our DMC teams may be assigned ad hoc as required. The
PRC/PRMS evaluates each protocol for study design, scientific quality, and availability of patient and
financial resources required to complete the proposed trial. PRC/PRMS approval of cancer clinical trials is
required prior to study submission to the Pitt IRB, NCI CIRB, or other accredited IRBs. Once a trial is
opened, the PRC/PRMS reviews its ongoing scientific merit and progress every 6 months. PRC/PRMS has
the authority to request explanations for slow accrual and plans to increase accrual from the study PI, allow
slow accruing trials to remain open with monitoring, or close studies for lack of scientific merit or progress or
safety reasons (upon DSMC recommendations)."
10899477,"Low back pain (LBP) is a complex condition that affects 65-85% of the population, and is the leading
musculoskeletal condition contributing to disability in the United States. Seventy-five percent of
individuals undergoing treatment for this condition experience suboptimal or poor outcomes in the form of
disability and deficits in functional capacity, including strength and endurance of the lumbar musculature.
The most common initial treatments for individuals with chronic LBP are exercise-based rehabilitation,
and pharmacological management in the form of analgesic medications. Although these two
conservative treatment modalities are often concurrently prescribed, the influence of analgesic
medications on the capacity of muscle to adapt in response to exercise is unknown. Importantly, in
healthy individuals, some of these medications have been shown to inhibit muscle protein synthesis,
metabolism, and stem cell function. The influence of medications may explain the variability in muscle-
specific and clinical outcomes associated with exercise-based rehabilitation in this population. To
address these current gaps in the literature, we propose to define medication usage patterns and clinical
outcomes across individuals with chronic low back pain who are participating an exercise-based
rehabilitation program. Specific Aim 1 will investigate the influence of symptom interference,
psychosocial factors, and diagnosis on analgesic medication use relative to exercise in individuals with
LBP. Specific Aim 2 will evaluate the influence of medication type, dose, and timing on exercise
performance. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will determine if medication type, dose, and timing influences the
magnitude of muscle hypertrophy and clinical outcomes after completion of a 12-week resistance
exercise program. Determining the impact of common analgesic medications on muscle hypertrophy,
exercise performance, and clinical outcomes is an important step in optimizing conservative
management in individuals with low back pain. This information will also be applicable to a variety of
musculoskeletal conditions for which similar treatment strategies are employed. This contribution is
significant because it is the first step in a precision medicine approach aimed at establishing appropriate
and targeted exercise and analgesic medication prescriptions for reversing muscle impairments that
obstruct patient recovery. This proposal is innovative because it aims to fill a large gap in knowledge
regarding the influence of analgesic medication on muscle adaptation in individuals with pain and
pathological muscle."

The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a national surveillance
system that monitors the susceptibility of enteric bacteria to medically relevant antimicrobials
in order to help assess the impact of veterinary antimicrobial use on human health. The NARMS
Retail Food Surveillance Program, a collaborative project between the Food and Drug
Administration Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA/CMV), the CDC, and state and local health
departments, supports this mission by improving detection of and surveillance for antimicrobial
resistance among enteric bacteria in raw retail meat commodities. To achieve this goal, we
propose to purchase and test raw meat, poultry, and seafood from randomly sampled retail
markets in San Francisco and San Jose, California. Raw meat will be delivered to the Contra
Costa Public Health Laboratory (CCPHL) where microbiologists will attempt to isolate
Salmonella from all meat samples; Campylobacter from poultry samples only; and
Enterococcus, Aeromonas, Vibrio and other lactose positive bacteria from seafood samples. All
isolates will be forwarded to FDA/CMV for antibiotic resistance testing. For each product
purchased, we will record the store name and location, brand name, sell-by date, purchase
date, packaging type, and the country of origin, when available. In addition to monitoring the
prevalence of bacteria and trends in antimicrobial resistance in raw meat, these data are vital
to foodborne outbreak investigations and help to inform parameters for antimicrobial use in
veterinary medicine. These data will be shared with relevant partners and can be used by public
health professionals to promote interventions to reduce resistance among foodborne bacteria."
10892833,"Specific Aims
A major challenge for individuals suffering from substance use disorders (SUDs) is the lack of effective
treatments that reduce relapse vulnerability. Drug predictive cues in the environment are powerful triggers for
relapse and understanding how these persistent associations are formed and maintained is a critical focus of
preclinical SUD research. In this proposal, we have built on our discovery that immediately after the end of
cocaine self administration (SA), an infusion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) into the prelimbic (PL)
prefrontal cortex prevents the cocaine SA-induced dephosphorylation of key glutamatergic-related plasticity-
related proteins (PRPs), including GluN2A, GluN2B, ERK MAP kinase, and CREB32,96. This early intervention
with BDNF also prevents prolonged cocaine-induced deficits in PL-NA core glutamatergic transmission that
promote subsequent cocaine seeking9. In contrast, by the end of the first week of abstinence, protein kinase A
(PKA)-dependent augmentation of GluA1 and CREB phosphorylation emerges. At that time, intra-PL BDNF
has no effect on relapse8 but intra-PL infusion of a PKA inhibitor, Rp-cAMPs, reverses the
hyperphosphorylation and decreases relapse70,92. More recently, we have shown that the biphasic changes in
GluA1 and pCREB within the first week of abstinence are associated with similar biphasic changes in the head
diameters (dH) of dendritic spines of PL–NA core neurons89. These data have spurred the overall hypothesis
that interventions to decrease drug seeking must be tailored to the dynamic changes in neuroadaptations that
emerge during different phases of the addiction cycle.
 In chemogenetic studies to investigate the contribution of specific pathways originating in PL cortex to drug
seeking, we discovered that PL-NA core and PL-posterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus (pPVT) pathways
oppose each others’ effects during early withdrawal. Selective cre-dependent DREADD inhibition of PL-NA
core neurons infected with a retrogradely transported cre-AAV immediately after cocaine SA has no effect by
itself, but reverses the suppressive effect of intra-PL BDNF on subsequent drug seeking31. In contrast,
selective inhibition of the PL-pPVT pathway immediately after cocaine SA decreases subsequent cocaine-
seeking, an effect that is prevented by intra-PL BDNF31. Interestingly, we also found that selective inhibition of
the PL-pPVT pathway reduces anxiety-related behavior in rats withdrawing from cocaine and inactivation of
pPVT decreases conditioned aversion to cocaine, suggesting that cocaine’s engagement of anxiety- and
aversion-related circuitry that contributes to drug seeking includes pPVT.
 Taken together, our new findings suggest the novel hypothesis that cocaine SA produces differential
regulation of PL-NA core and PL-pPVT pathways and that these two distinct circuits conspire to support future
drug seeking. In this proposal, we will use pathway-specific, combinatorial chemogenetic approaches, slice
electrophysiology, and state-of-the-art dendritic spine and PRP imaging in PL-NA core and PL-pPVT circuitry
to explore the time-dependent plasticity occurring in this network that influences cocaine seeking and aversion.
We will use these approaches in the following aims that will be performed in male and female rats.
Aim 1. BDNF regulation of PRPs and structural and synaptic plasticity in PL-NA core vs. PL-pPVT
neurons during early withdrawal. Using viral vector approaches, we will investigate the effects of intra-PL
BDNF infusion on (A) dendritic spine plasticity and PRP changes and (B) synaptic plasticity in PL-NA core vs.
PL-PVT neurons during early withdrawal.
Aim 2. PKA regulation of PRPs and structural and synaptic plasticity in PL-NA core vs. PL-pPVT
neurons after 7 and 30 days of abstinence. (A) We will investigate the effects of inhibiting cAMP/PKA
signaling on (A) dendritic spine plasticity and PRP changes and (B) synaptic plasticity in PL-NA core vs. PL-
PVT neurons after 7 or 30 days of abstinence with or without relapse testing.
Aim 3. The role of PL-NA core and PL-pPVT neurons in cocaine-induced anxiety and aversion in
relationship to cocaine seeking after abstinence. We will use a retro-Gi DREADD approach to test the
effects of inhibiting PL-NA core or PL-pPVT neurons (A) on withdrawal-induced anxiety immediately after the
end of cocaine SA and (B) on conditioned avoidance of cocaine in an operant runway task before or after
cocaine SA followed by cue-induced relapse testing.
Scientific Impact: These studies will expand our understanding of how to reverse critical neuroadaptations
underlying prefrontal dysfunctions during different phases of the addiction cycle that trigger relapse to drug-
seeking. By understanding temporally dynamic, differential neuroadaptations in the PL networks regulating
reward and aversion, we may be able to discover novel therapeutic targets to decrease drug-seeking."

 Combination therapy with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 mAbs has emerged as the most potent and
durable cancer immunotherapy. However, the autoimmune adverse effect associated with the combination
therapy is considerably more severe, with 50-90% of melanoma patients developing grade 3 and 4
immunotherapy-related adverse effect. A major challenge in cancer immunotherapy is how to reduce adverse
effects of the combination therapy without affecting therapeutic efficacy. This is in part related to the fact that
the mechanism by which combination therapy exacerbate irAE is not well understood. To address this issue,
we have developed a novel model in which combination therapy with anti-mouse PD-1 in conjunction with
either Ipilimumab or Tremelizumab recapitulates the severe irAE observed in clinic. Importantly, different anti-
human CTLA4 antibodies differ dramatically in irAE in this preclinical model. We have carried out extensive
preliminary studies to elucidate the molecular basis of irAE-prone vs non-prone antibodies and have shown the
antibody-mediated degradation of membrane-associated CTLA-4 as a major feature of irAE-prone antibodies.
Meanwhile, it has long been established that soluble CTLA-4 (sCTLA4) molecule is protective against
autoimmune diseases in the mice. We have obtained data that showed strong correlation between the levels
of sCTLA4 and irAE in the clinic. We further established a striking correlation between high binding to soluble
CTLA4 protein and the severity of irAE in human CTLA4KI mice. Based on these unexpected observations and
the strong therapeutic effect of CTLA4-Fc (Abatacept, marketed as Orencia) for autoimmune diseases
including irAE, we hypothesize that both cell surface and sCTLA-4 confers protection against irAE and that
sCTLA4 that evades clearance by irAE-inducing anti-CTLA-4 antibodies is a potential therapeutic for
prevention and treatment of irAE.
 Our proposal challenges the prevailing paradigm that autoimmunity and cancer immunity are based on
the same mechanism and thus intrinsically linked. More importantly, our work will have a transforming impact
in immune-oncology research, as it may offer prophylactic and treatment for irAEs associated with the most
effective immunotherapy in use in the clinic."
10892838,"Regulated protein synthesis, or translation, is essential for life, and allows the cell to flexibly respond to external
stimuli and stress. Conversely, dysregulated translation is a hallmark of diseases including cancer, viral infection,
and developmental disorders. Translation is regulated principally through its initiation phase, where a crucial
regulatory function of the initiation machinery is to ensure selection of the correct translation start site on
messenger RNA. Failure to do so compromises the proteome by permitting synthesis of elongated, truncated,
or nonsense proteins. In eukaryotes, start-site selection requires a directional search beginning at the 5’ end of
the message. This search must move the megadalton ribosomal pre-initiation complex (PIC) efficiently through
mRNA leader sequences that can span tens, hundreds, or even over a thousand nucleotides, and then halt this
motion at exactly the correct start site. A linear “scanning” mechanism was first proposed over 40 years ago for
this remarkable biophysical feat. However, fundamental properties of scanning have never been directly
validated experimentally, and alternative mechanisms have been proposed. The importance of motion through
the mRNA leader in translational control has also been brought into renewed sharp focus in recent years with
the discovery that many mRNAs contain upstream open reading frames in their leaders that control translation
of the main open reading frame; the scanning mechanism lies at the heart of how these are utilized. A critical
barrier to progress is the remarkable molecular complexity and dynamism of the scanning machinery, whose
numerous transient intermediates have made it challenging to characterize experimentally. Directly visualizing
scanning in real time would allow many key unsolved questions to be addressed. Single-molecule methods are
uniquely positioned to do this with the molecular resolution required to dissect mechanism. We have developed
a single-molecule fluorescence assay for scanning of a reconstituted yeast PIC on full-length mRNAs. Here we
will apply this assay to address the scanning mechanism. In Aim 1 we will directly determine the physical
mechanism of motion in scanning, establishing the contributions of mRNA sequence and structure to the
scanning rate. In Aim 2, we will elucidate how scanning directionality is established and maintained, focusing on
the central translational helicase, eIF4A. We will distinguish between proposed mechanisms for how eIF4A
transduces the chemical potential of ATP to bias scanning direction. In Aim 3, we will define the roles of pre-
initiation complex components in scanning, with experiments that isolate their contribution to scanning
specifically, rather than their aggregate functions throughout initiation. These studies will establish a physical-
mechanistic model for scanning that will deepen understanding of translational control in health, and inform
ongoing efforts to understand and reverse dysregulation in disease."

Racial biases are both evident and harmful in childhood. White children show especially robust and reliable racial
biases by age 5. Many have suggested that parents should play a role in addressing the negative effects of
children's racial biases, but research to date has focused primarily on how parents of color can take action in
this domain (e.g., to buffer effects of discrimination on their children, who are frequently the targets of
discrimination). Here we test whether White parents can be effective as bias interventionists with their White
children. The broad, long-term goal of the proposed research is to improve the health and wellbeing of children
of color. The key objectives for the proposed work are to test the effects of a novel racial bias intervention
program on White parents (Aim 1) and their 5–7-year-old children (Aim 2). Parent-child dyads will be randomly
assigned to the intervention condition or to one of two control conditions. Parents in the intervention program will
complete a training program informed by theory and previous empirical work. The program will teach parents
how to address race with their children, and then parents will be given additional materials and support to practice
what they learned in the training program with their children at home. To evaluate the effects of the intervention,
participants in all conditions will complete a pre-test and two post-test assessments (one immediate, one
delayed). Assessments for parents will focus on their awareness of, and concern about, children's racial biases,
as well as parents' motivation and perceived self-efficacy to address race with their children. Assessments for
children will focus on their racial attitudes, inclusion decisions, reactions to another person's biased behaviors in
the race domain, and beliefs about their parents' racial attitudes. A further goal (Aim 3) is to test for moderation
by parent-child relationship quality and the racial diversity of participants' environments. Results from the
proposed work will reveal whether, how, and in what contexts White parents can be effective as bias
interventionists with their children. By intervening early, we may be able to forestall the entrenchment of racial
biases and decrease the likelihood that children of color will experience the harmful effects of racial biases."
10892794,"The sales of agricultural insecticides have steadily risen in the last 20 years and the use of fungicides
have skyrocketed in the last decade. Unfortunately, direct assessments of children's developmental toxicity in
relation to commonly used fungicides such as Azoles or Quinone Outside Inhibitors (QoI) are unavailable
because methods for their quantification in bio-specimens have only recently been developed. In experimental
studies, exposures QoI fungicides, resulted in epigenetic changes related to neuro-inflammation, and higher
levels of free-radicals. Azoles, another heavily used fungicide class, have also been linked with liver
inflammation and toxicity in-vitro. Azole fungicides share the same structure as azole antifungals used in
clinical practice, which are associated with elevations of liver enzymes in up to 20% of patients.
 Cholinesterase inhibitor insecticide exposures have been associated with short- and long-lasting
neurobehavioral/cognitive delays in children associated. Whether continuing exposures to organophosphates
or other insecticides such as neonicotinoids or pyrethroids can affect cognition in adolescence is unclear.
 We propose to conduct a follow-up investigation of adolescent participants (ages 16-21 y, n=535) of the
Secondary Pesticide Exposure among Children and Adolescents (ESPINA) study in 2020. This NIH-funded
study has examined participants in Pedro Moncayo County, Ecuador since 2008. Pedro Moncayo has one of
the highest concentrations of flower plantations in the Americas. The production of flowers involves a
disproportionately high use of fungicides. We plan to assess the ongoing and long-term associations of
pesticide exposures with neurocognition, and inflammatory markers (systemic, neuro and liver). To our
knowledge, this will be the first epidemiologic study of children/adolescents to evaluate health outcomes in
relation to fungicide and neonicotinoid exposures. This prospective study capitalizes on existing blood
measurements of insecticides in 2016 and acetylcholinesterase in 2008 and 2016.
 The specific aims are to test the following hypotheses: Urinary metabolites of insecticides in 2016
and 2020 (organophosphates, neonicotinoids, pyrethroids) and fungicides (Azoles, QoI) in 2016 are associated
with: 1) higher subclinical markers of systemic and neuro inflammation (CRP, TNF, IL-6, sICAM-1, sVCAM-1,
MCP-1, sCD14, sCD163); 2) Pesticides, particularly azole fungicides are associated with subclinical increases in
liver inflammation markers: transaminases (AST and ALT) and cytokeratin 18. We will test concurrent and
prospective associations with all inflammation markers in 2016-2018; 3) lower neur0-cognitive performance
in adolescence. We will test longitudinal associations of fungicides and insecticides with neurocognitive
performance, and will contrast such findings across pesticides to evaluate neurotoxic potencies. 4) As an
exploratory aim: we will assess mediating or modifying effects of inflammation on pesticide-induced impaired
neurobehavioral performance."

Towards Single-molecule Protein Sequencing with Nanopores
Abstract:
This proposal concerns the development of a nascent single-molecule proteomics technology
based on nanopore sequencing. In recent work by Brinkerhoff et al., we demonstrated a first-of-
kind method for sequentially reading single peptide molecules with a biological nanopore,
detecting single-amino acid substitutions in individual molecules and showing that extremely high
fidelity may be reached through indefinitely many independent re-reads of individual proteins. This
method does not require chemical labeling of amino acids, can be carried out on commercially
available nanopore sequencing hardware, and retains the properties that enabled the success of
nanopore DNA sequencing: low overhead cost, physical rather than chemical sensitivity to small
changes in single molecules, and the flexibility to be re-engineered to target specific sequencing
applications. In this proposal to fund a collaboration of the Gundlach and Dekker laboratories,
both world leaders in nanopore technology development, we aim to develop this promising new
technology into a fully fledged single-molecule proteomics tool. This will involve characterizing
reads of a broad array of protein sequences, optimising core elements of the sequencing
methodology for protein analysis, preparing natural peptides for reading, and determining the
method's applicability to pressing proteomics problems such as post-translational modification
and splice variant detection. Achieving these aims will position the nanopore protein reader for
immediate application to proteomics problems in fundamental biology and clinical medicine."

The Synthetic Chemical Biology Core (SCB) was established in July 2016 from the merger of the Center for
Molecular Analysis of Disease Pathways (CMADP) Molecular Probes Core with the newly established Chemical
Biology of Infectious Disease (CBID) Medicinal Chemistry Core. The synthetic capabilities of the SCB will fulfill
the specific aims of both COBRE centers. The mission for the SCB in Phase 3 is to provide CMADP-affiliated
junior faculty, as well as other investigators in the state of Kansas, with novel molecular probes as
pharmacological tools for in vitro or in vivo elucidation of particular pathways. The SCB will also work towards
achieving self-sustainability beyond Phase 3. The Core will offer expert design and synthesis of small molecule
and peptide molecular probes, with an emphasis on the generation of fluorescent and other affinity tagged
molecules. The SCB will function synergistically with other CMADP-funded Core facilities, including the Genome
Sequencing Core, to identify genes that impact functions of probes in vivo, and the KU Nanofabrication Facility,
to develop devices for imaging and chemical analysis. This integration is designed to empower faculty to use
chemical biology approaches to investigate biological problems.
The specific aims that will be addressed by the SCB in Phase 3 are: (1) Provide enabling small molecules of
interest to COBRE investigators and other clients; (2) Provide synthesis of conventional and specialized peptides
to investigators; (3) Provide outreach, administrative, and fiscal support necessary to manage the above
activities both in the context of COBRE projects and to offer services to the larger Kansas research community
(4) To continue developing a critical mass of core lab users so that the facility becomes a self-sustaining, integral
part of the biomedical research infrastructure in the state of Kansas."
10901921,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
There is an increasing burden of HIV-associated noncommunicable diseases (HIVNCD) globally, which often
cluster among populations facing persistent social and economic inequalities. One such population is sexual
and gender minorities (SGM), for whom stress resulting from discrimination leads to poorer health outcomes.
Syndemic frameworks have been utilized to explain elevated HIV risk in SGM populations but have only
recently been applied to study HIVNCD. Being an SGM is associated with real and perceived discrimination
and stigmatization. As a result, SGM experience elevated levels of victimization including intimate partner
violence (IPV) and subsequently, stress, depression, polysubstance use, and material insecurity. These factors
are well-documented risk factors for disengagement in the continuum of care among SGM. There is a critical
knowledge gap for the development of modifiable intervention strategies, however, regarding how these
syndemic factors leads to disease clustering of HIVNCD and promotes further inequities and vulnerabilities in
low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) where both HIV prevalence and social/economic barriers to
accessing health care are remarkably high. In Nigeria, where the University of Maryland, the Johns Hopkins
University, and the U.S. Military HIV Research Program have worked with SGM since 2012, 70% of SGM in
the TRUST/RV368 study (84% men who have sex with men and 16% self-identified as women) experience a
moderate-to-severe level of stigma related to discriminatory policies, and social norms that leads to avoidance
of HIV care. Prior to this proposal, we conducted a cross-sectional preliminary analysis, which suggested that
stigma and depression are associated with clusters of cardiometabolic risk factors. The proposed work builds
on the TRUST/RV368 study, the largest cohort of SGM in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and brings together a
multidisciplinary team of researchers to: 1) Examine association between syndemic factors and HIVNCD
outcomes; 2) Assess whether and how community-level and structural-level factors exacerbate the syndemic;
and 3) Determine whether the syndemic characterized for HIVNCD prevalence and outcomes is associated
with risk of disengaging from HIVNCD care continua."

The objective of this proposal is to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of promising multi-component
interventions for implementing evidence-based tobacco treatment in Lebanon’s national system of safety net
primary healthcare centers, which serves more than 50% of the population. This objective is directly
responsive to NCI Notice of Special Interest (NOT-CA-20-025): Dissemination and Implementation Science for
Cancer Prevention and Control in Low Resource Environments. The tobacco use burden in Lebanon is
exceptionally high: 35% of adults are current cigarette smokers, 39% are waterpipe smokers, and 5% are dual
smokers. The WHO endorses three interventions as the standard of practice for population-level tobacco
dependence treatment: smoking cessation advice integrated into primary care settings; easily-accessible
phone-based counseling; and low-cost nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). However, the evidence for these
interventions comes primarily from high-income countries and they have rarely been evaluated in low- and
middle-income countries (LMICs). Further, recommended interventions are not integrated as a routine part of
primary care in Lebanon, as is the case in other low-resource settings. Addressing this evidence-to-practice
gap requires research on multilevel interventions and contextual factors for implementing integrated, scalable,
and sustainable cessation treatment within low-resource settings. We will conduct a group-randomized trial
comparing three arms: 1) Ask about tobacco use, advise to quit, assist with brief counseling (AAA) as standard
care; 2) Ask, advise, connect to phone-based counseling (AAC); and 3) AAC+NRT. Our central hypothesis is
that connecting patients to phone-based counseling with NRT is the most effective alternative. Our hybrid
design is informed by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework which
emphasizes key steps and multilevel factors to optimize implementation success. We will pursue the following
specific aims: 1) adapt and tailor an existing smoking cessation program to deliver phone-based counseling to
smokers in Lebanon; 2) test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a referral-based program that delivers
smoking cessation services to primary care patients; and 3) identify the multilevel determinants of
implementation and sustainability using mixed methods. The proposed project addresses the evidence-to-
practice gap in the provision of tobacco dependence treatment within low-resource settings by developing and
testing contextually-tailored multilevel interventions and optimizing implementation success and sustainability.
This research is significant for its potential to guide the large-scale adoption of cost-effective strategies for
implementing tobacco dependence treatment in low-resource settings thereby reducing tobacco-related
morbidity and mortality."

Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) degeneration is a painful and debilitating disease of the synovial joint,
affecting over 20 million people in the United States. Obesity, advancing age and mechanical loading are
greatest risk factor for many diseases including TMJ degeneration. TMJ degeneration significantly impair the
quality of life by causing acute and chronic pain, thus making this disease a global health issue and a financial
burden of epidemic proportion. The incidence of the TMJ degeneration is expected to rise substantially as the
prevalence of obesity has risen dramatically over the last two-decades. As there is no effective treatment for
the TMJ degeneration in an obese and aged individual, there is an unmet clinical need for an effective
approach to treat TMJ degeneration.
The current proposal seeks to address this unmet clinical challenge using a highly innovative approach of
targeting p21 high cells both genetically and therapeutically for the treatment of TMJ degeneration. Our
overarching hypothesis is that p21 high cells plays a central role in obesity, age-related and mechanical loading
induced TMJ degeneration and targeted elimination of the p21 high cells may alleviate TMJ degeneration. To
test this hypothesis, we will define: (1) the role of p21 high cells in osteochondral tissue in obesity and aging
induced TMJ degeneration. Using a novel inducible p21-cre ERT2 X td-Tomato mice we will examine the
effects of p21 high cells on the homeostasis of the osteochondral tissues of the TMJ in obesity and aging. (2)
the pathophysiological mechanism by which p21high cells causes TMJ degeneration. Using the novel mice
model (p21-cre ERT2 X td-Tomato X Rela flox/flox), we will examine the effect NF-κB pathway on the senescent
cells in TMJ degeneration. 3) To define the role of p21high cells in traumatic TMJ injury and repair. p21-cre
ERT2 X td-Tomato mice will be subjected to traumatic injury to TMJ and we will genetically clear the p21 high
cells after traumatic injury to see whether we can alleviate TMJ-OA or repair the damaged cartilage. A
combination of mechanical, immunohistochemical, molecular biology and histomorphometric techniques
coupled with novel genetic mice models will be used to study the proposed specific aims.
The proposed project has the immense potential to reveal new regulatory pathways that controls homeostasis
of the osteochondral tissues of the TMJ in an obese and aged individual and to open new insight on
understanding the disease mechanism and developing therapeutic interventions."

Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a severe and progressive disease with a high mortality rate of nearly
40% over 5 years. Pulmonary artery endothelial and smooth muscle cells (PAECs and PASMCs) undergo
intracellular signaling changes that promote a proliferative, apoptosis resistant phenotype that causes
occlusion of the pulmonary vasculature leading to increased resistance. There is a critical need to uncover the
mechanisms that promote vascular cell remodeling. Our long-term goal is to identify pathways or molecules to
target for therapeutic intervention in order to alleviate the vascular abnormalities that are central to PAH
development and progression. Sphk1 and sphingosine-1 phosphate are increased in the lungs and pulmonary
artery smooth muscle cells of PAH patients and in the lungs of rodent models of hypoxia mediated pulmonary
hypertension (HPH). Mitochondrial (mt) dysfunction also contributes to PAH via altered regulation of multiple
mt processes, which leads to impaired vasorelaxation and increased vascular cell proliferation. However, the
effect of the Sphk1/S1P signaling axis on mt function in the initiation or progression of PAH is not well
understood. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that S1P promotes activation of the UPRmt and regulates mt
dynamics in human PAECs and PASMCs. The specific objective of the proposed study is to determine the
role of UPRmt signaling mediators on vascular cell function. Our central hypothesis is that activation of the
Sphk1/S1P/S1PR signaling axis modulates the UPRmt pathway to promote vascular remodeling which leads to
PAH development. This hypothesis will be tested by investigating the following specific aims:
AIM 1: To investigate the role of the UPRmt in S1PRs/S1P/Sphk1 promotion of pulmonary vascular cell
proliferation and hypoxia induced PH (HPH) development. Our working hypothesis is that the Sphk1/S1P/
S1PR signaling axis modulates mitochondrial function, which is a central cause underlying the pathological
proliferation of PASMCs and PAECs to mediate PAH development.
AIM 2: To determine the effects of UPRmt inhibition on vascular remodeling and HPH development. Our
working hypothesis is that hypoxia induces activation of UPRmt in vivo resulting in vascular remodeling and
PAH.
AIM 3: Determine if coordinated signaling occurs between pulmonary vascular cells and mitochondrial
processes to regulate vascular remodeling and HPH. Our working hypothesis is that coordinated signaling
among the UPRmt, mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial respiration promote vascular remodeling."
10897907,"ABSTRACT
 Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great potential as novel biomarkers for minimally invasive detection of early
stage tumors, since tumors abundantly secrete EVs that accumulate in the circulation and these EVs can
transport factors that regulate tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. However, most current EV analysis
methods require pre-isolation of EVs prior to analysis and are low-throughput and impractical for clinical use. We
recently developed a rapid, robust, isolation-free and inexpensive assay that directly quantifies tumor-derived
EVs in small volumes (1~5 µL) of serum or plasma. In this assay, EVs that bind probes specific for two different
EV target proteins produce a distance-regulated nanoplasmon-enhanced scattering (nPES) effect that allows
sensitive detection of specific EVs. In a pilot study we used a nPES assay for a pancreatic cancer (PC)-
associated EV marker to distinguish PC cases from non-malignant controls (patients with pancreatitis and
healthy individuals) with high reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity. This assay also differentiated PC tumor
stages and tumor responses to neoadjuvant, outperforming CA19-9, a biomarker widely used for PC therapy
assessment. Our nPES assay platform has multiple features required for research and clinical translation: 1) It
is rapid, high-throughput, and inexpensive; 2) it does not employ EV isolation, avoiding a major source of EV
assay variation; 3) it robustly and reproducibly quantifies EV biomarkers from small volumes of serum, plasma
or urine, allowing its use in longitudinal analysis of mouse models of human disease; and 4) it can be readily
adapted to diagnose and monitor cancers that express other EV biomarkers. Based on the success of our pilot
study, we propose to develop and validate an automated and highly reproducible nPES EV assay to allow rapid
and accurate PC diagnosis in clinical settings. We hypothesize that a nPES-based digital EV reader will equal
or outperform the analytical performance of our current manual assay. We will build a diagnostic EV assay model
for early PC detection by examining the ability of proteins reported to be enriched on the surface of EVs derived
from PC stem cells or PC-initiating cells (e.g., CD44, CD133 and EpCAM) to diagnose patients with early stage
PC and to differentiate them from patients with pre-malignant pancreatic lesions, hereditary syndromes or family
history of PC, and individuals with normal pancreases. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Development and
fabrication of Chip-nPES platform to achieve single EV resolution; 2) automate and refine our nPES-based
digital EV reader to enhance assay reliability and reproducibility. We will also select and validate candidate
EV capture and detection antibodies for PC diagnosis; 3) establish and evaluate a diagnostic model that
integrates EV biomarkers with known cancer-associations; and 4) perform a pre-clinical validation of this assay
in a third-party laboratory. The successful results of this work would have a significant translational impact in
cancer management, through reliable and accessible screens for early detection of pancreatic cancer."

Aging is associated with dopamine system dysfunction and the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau.
Previous studies of cognitive aging have demonstrated the independent effects of dopamine dysregulation (e.g.
deficits in reward processing) and tau aggregation (e.g. memory deficits). We propose to study the joint effects
of dopamine and tau on cognition in aging using multimodal MR/PET neuroimaging. The central hypothesis is
that increased levels of dopamine protect against cognitive decline, and can stabilize memory performance in
the face of tau burden.
The proposed work will leverage a unique training opportunity and collaboration between interdisciplinary
researchers at the MGH Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging and Brandeis University. I will gain expertise in
cognitive aging as well as integrating fMRI and PET methodologies. Older adult participants from the ongoing
longitudinal Brandeis Aging Brain Study will be invited to undergo simultaneous MR/PET neuroimaging to
measure dopamine levels and neural activity during a reward memory task. Additionally, participants will return
for a tau-PET scanning session. Our specific aims will test the hypotheses 1) that increased endogenous
dopamine release is associated with better reward memory, especially in individuals with lower levels of tau, 2)
that increased dopamine release is associated with increased variability in hippocampal neural activity (leading
to improved reward memory), and 3) that individual baseline levels of dopamine and tau will be predictive of
memory improvements upon receiving a dopamine-enhancing pharmaceutical (methylphenidate).
Based on preliminary data, we expect to find that increased levels of dopamine will lead to more variable brain
activity in the hippocampus and better reward memory in older adults, but that these effects will be attenuated
by tau aggregation. We also predict that older adults with lower levels dopamine will show the greatest potential
for memory improvements following pharmaceutically-induced dopamine enhancement, despite baseline levels
of tau. Previously, the influences of dopamine and tau on cognitive aging have mostly been studied
independently. This work will begin to bridge these subfields by studying the joint influences tau and dopamine
on memory together in the same individuals. These experiments will contribute to an improved understanding of
how neurochemistry and protein pathology interact to affect memory in older adults, and may suggest a
mechanism by which cognitive function is preserved in the pre-clinical stages of age-related disease."
