10883723,"Machine Learning for Integrative Modeling of the Immune System in Clinical Settings
In response to an immunological challenge, immune cells act in concert forming complex and dense networks.
A deep understanding of these immune responses is often the first step in developing immune therapies and
diagnostic tests. Multivariate modeling algorithms can simultaneously consider all measured aspects of the
immune system but requires prohibitively larger cohort sizes as technological advancements increase the
number of measurements (a.k.a., “Curse of Dimensionality”). To address this, we propose a series of studies to
develop machine learning algorithms for comprehensive profiling of the immune system in clinical settings.
Particularly, for analysis of the immune system at a single-cell-level, we will leverage the stochastic nature of
clustering algorithms to produce a robust pipeline for prediction of clinical outcomes. Next, we introduce the
immunological Elastic-Net (iEN) algorithm, which addresses both the curse of dimensionality and reproducibility
by integrating prior immunological knowledge into the models.
 The cellular systems that govern immunity act through symbiotic interactions with multiple interconnected
biological systems. The simultaneous interrogation of these systems with suitable technologies can reveal
otherwise unrecognized crosstalk. In collaboration with several leading laboratories, we have produced
multiomics datasets (including analysis the genome, proteome, microbiome, and metabolome) in synchronized
groups of patients. Using these coordinated datasets, we will evaluate several algorithms for combining multiple
biological modalities while accounting for the intrinsic characteristics of each assay, to reveal biological cross-
talk across various systems and increase combined predictive power. Importantly, numerous population-
level factors (including medical history, environmental, and socioeconomic factors) significantly impact the
immune system and studies focused on homogenous patient populations often lack generalizability to other
populations. To address this, we will develop machine learning strategies to integrate population-level factors
directly into our immunological data. These models will objectively define subpopulations of patients and enable
flexibility in the coefficients of the models (and hence, the importance of the various biological measurements)
in each group.
 This research program will be executed using data from several biorepositories focused on various
diseases. This approach will ensure generalizability of our work to previously unseen datasets and increase the
long-term impact of our findings. Throughout the proposal, a major area of focus is the development of
visualization and model-reduction strategies that lay the foundation for interpretation of complex models. The
machine learning algorithms developed will be readily applicable to a broad range of multiomics and multicohort
studies and will be available as open-source software."

Autosomal recessive mutations in the TBCK gene cause intellectual disability of variable severity. I have
further characterized the neurologic phenotype of Puerto Rican children with a homozygous null mutation
(p.R126X) in TBCK, which we designated the Boricua mutation. The biological mechanism underlying the
genotype-phenotype correlations remain unclear. On one extreme, patients with the severe Boricua mutation
develop progressive brain, cerebellar and motor neuron atrophy, coarse facial features and epilepsy. We
named this severe syndrome TBCK-encephaloneuronopathy (TBCKE). On the other hand, other patients with
biallelic TBCK mutations have clinical diagnosis of autism and/or intellectual disability, without evidence of
neurodegeneration. The function of TBCK protein is unknown, but previous studies have shown absence of
TBCK leads to downregulation of mTORC1 signaling. The mTORC1 pathway regulates autophagy, including
the targeted degradation of mitochondria (mitophagy). I recently reported increased autophagic flux and
impaired glycoprotein degradation in TBCKE patients’ fibroblasts, which was rescued by activating mTORC1
signaling with L-leucine. Our fibroblasts studies suggests that TBCKE patients have mitochondrial dysfunction
and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion. Furthermore, the degree of mtDNA depletion predicts the
neurologic severity of TBCK disease. Therefore, I hypothesize that loss of function of TBCK in human neurons
leads to mtDNA depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction due to excessive autophagic clearance of
mitochondria. To test this hypothesis in more disease relevant models, I propose to generate TBCK-null
induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived neurons (iNeu) and tbck-/- zebrafish. The goal of this proposal is to
address whether loss of function of TBCK affects mitochondrial function in human neurons, and to
determine whether mtDNA depletion modulates the severity of neurodegeneration in TBCK disease.
Using novel disease models and unique tools to assay mitochondrial function, I propose to address the
following questions: (Aim 1) Do human neurons lacking TBCK protein have excessive mitophagy? (Aim2)
What is the function of TBCK? Can we define its protein-protein interactions in neurons? (Aim 3) Can TBCK-
null zebrafish model the variable severity of TBCK disease? Can mtDNA depletion modulate the severity of the
phenotype in vivo? The experiments outlined in this proposal will determine the role of mitochondria in TBCKE
and whether mtDNA depletion is sufficient to drive the neurodegenerative phenotype or merely an
epiphenomenon. This work will also provide training in novel techniques for assaying neuronal mitochondrial
function in disease models in situ. I will also learn to develop and characterize zebrafish models of
neurodevelopmental disease. Support from this K02 award will be instrumental in growing my independent
research program as a physician scientist in a superb institutional environment towards my long-term goal of
studying the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in pediatric neurodegenerative disorders."

Melanoma is a heterogeneous tumor, with a high degree of phenotypic plasticity that allows for rapid adaptation
to BRAF-MEK inhibitor therapy. Initial therapeutic responses are typically followed by a period of quiescence in
which signaling is rewired to evade therapy, followed by the emergence of a bona fide resistant state. Little is
known about how the initial persister cell state transitions to an irreversibly resistant state, the role of the immune
system in the emergence of these lineages, and whether this resistant state can be targeted. In preliminary
studies we identified the type I histone deacetylase HDAC8 as a master regulator of a lineage switch to a
resistance-associated melanoma cell state. Activation of HDAC8 alters the phenotype of melanoma cells with
loss of function of lineage identity genes such as MITF, increased activity of AP-1/TEAD transcription factors
and resistance to therapy. The resistant cell state persisted even after removal of targeted therapy, and was
associated with increased mutational load. HDAC8 overexpression also led to the reduced expression of
melanoma antigens, increased levels of the immune checkpoint proteins and reduced T cell infiltration. We
believe the stability of this state may be at least in part be epigenetic due to altered acetylation and function of
transcription factors, cofactors as well as altered function of the cohesin complex involved in chromatin looping,
and gene expression. We hypothesize that HDAC8 is a master regulator of a resistance-associated melanoma
cell state and represents a target for the prevention of lineage switching. In this proposal, we will use multi-omics
approaches (ATAC-Seq, scRNA-Seq, Hi-C, proteomics) to define the mechanisms by which HDAC8 reprograms
melanoma cells, and will determine if HDAC8 affects the cohesin complex, leading to fixed resistance-conferring
genetic or epigenetic changes. We will utilize a mouse model of BRAF/PTEN-HDAC8-driven melanoma and
single cell RNA-Seq to investigate how the HDAC8 modulates the immune microenvironment leading to the
emergence of drug resistant melanoma lineages. We will specifically determine whether HDAC8 drives a
transcriptional program associated with decreased MHC class I and antigen expression leading to decreased
tumor-T cell recognition. Further studies will define whether JUN-mediated transcription of IL-11 reprograms the
myeloid compartment leading to a suppressive melanoma immune environment that eradicates tumor-reactive
CD8 T cells. CRISPR screens will be performed to identify targets to prevent the emergence of drug resistant
lineages in mouse models. We will then evaluate these targets and HDAC8 inhibitors as strategies to improve
therapeutic responses to BRAF-MEK inhibitor and immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in syngeneic mouse
melanoma models. We expect that new insights into the mechanisms underpinning the emergence and
maintenance of drug resistant lineages in melanoma will lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies
to improve the depth and duration of responses to immunotherapy and targeted therapy in melanoma. Our
findings will have important implications across multiple cancer types and many different therapies."

Schistosome parasites infect 200 million people, resulting in significant morbidity and more than 200,000 deaths
annually. Schistosomiasis control strategies rely almost exclusively on chemotherapy, and tens of millions of
people are treated with the only available drug, praziquantel (PZQ). There are no new drugs in the clinical
pipeline. With projected levels of PZQ use, it is inevitable that PZQ-resistant parasites will evolve. Therefore, it
is imperative to find new drug targets and drugs for schistosomiasis treatment, our long-term objective. We
identified a highly promising drug target: the worm selenocysteine-containing enzyme thioredoxin glutathione
reductase (TGR). We established that TGR is a central and essential mediator of antioxidant defenses in the
worm. The antioxidant defenses of vertebrates are diversified to three enzymes, glutathione reductase,
thioredoxin reductase, and glutaredoxin, whereas schistosomes rely solely on TGR. TGR is a chokepoint and its
inhibition leads to rapid worm death in all developmental stages. In contrast, PZQ has poor activity against
juvenile worms, often resulting in partial cures. TGR is a defined molecular target, active as a recombinant
protein, and we have established biochemical assays amenable to rapid compound screening, SAR, and
optimization. We initiated several HTS of large compound libraries, which identified TGR inhibitors that have
been used to obtain both liganded and ligand-free crystal structures of TGR, allowing a structure-based approach
to hit optimization. These studies have elucidated an inhibitory mechanism that is completely novel for this family
of proteins, allowing the development of non-covalent inhibitors. We hypothesize that it will be possible to
optimize our novel TGR inhibitors for potency for TGR inhibition and selectivity against human glutathione
reductase and thioredoxin reductase enzymes in vitro and schistosomicidal efficacy in vivo, our short-term
objectives. Our aims are to optimize novel TGR inhibitors using cutting-edge structure- and ligand-based
computer-aided design and medicinal chemistry to improve potency, selectivity, solubility, toxicity, and
bioavailability. This will be complemented by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. Medicinal
chemistry will be informed by enzymatic analysis of TGR and orthologous human enzymes, metabolic stability,
in vitro cell toxicity, and activity against ex vivo worms. Finally, select compounds will be assessed for PK/PD
properties and efficacy against schistosome infections in mice. To accomplish these aims, we assembled a team
of experts in schistosome biochemistry and drug discovery, medicinal chemistry, computer-aided molecular
design, chemical and structural biology of TGR. The varied and synergistic expertise of the team will facilitate
overcoming critical barriers to development of schistosomicidal therapeutics. While additional preclinical studies
would be needed, discovery of TGR inhibitors with demonstrated activity in animal models is the first step in the
development of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of schistosomiasis."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in women in the United States, with profound
racial-ethnic disparities present. Mounting evidence suggests that pregnancy is a key window when
cardiovascular (CV) health is eroded, increasing future CVD risk. Further, the link between CV and lung health
is well-established, and the critical prenatal period may influence multiple future morbidities simultaneously.
Exposure to place-based structural racism may result in a pro-inflammatory state during pregnancy and impair
postpartum cardiopulmonary health (CV and lung health) setting the stage for future chronic disease risk. For
instance, evidence from our pregnancy cohort (Generation C) in NYC found that racial-economic segregation,
a measure of place-based structural racism, was associated with preterm birth which separately has been
linked to a life course two-fold risk of CVD and respiratory mortality. To better understand the effect of place-
based structural racism during pregnancy on future cardiopulmonary health, we propose Gen C Mamas, a
mixed-method longitudinal study of 440 underrepresented and understudied Black, Hispanic, and Asian
(Global Majority) women from the Generation C cohort, initially recruited during pregnancy in 2020-2022 in
New York City. We will use a framework that incorporates theories of structural racism, the life course model of
multimorbidity, resilience, and weathering in our proposed Gen C Mamas study. First, we will assess the
association between place-based structural racism and cardiopulmonary health (e.g., systolic and diastolic
blood pressure, lung function, and hemoglobin A1c) in 440 women measured at 3 and 5 years postpartum.
Then we will leverage previously collected data to examine how mid-pregnancy inflammation is associated with
place-based structural racism during pregnancy and cardiopulmonary health. Finally, we will select 30 women
from this subgroup and invite them to participate in Photovoice data collection. We will hold focus group
sessions where participants will narrate the stories of their photo choices, and these stories will be analyzed for
themes and then mapped to our theoretical framework. Our findings can be used to develop novel prevention
strategies that disrupt or mitigate structural racism during pregnancy. Because of the central role of
inflammation in health, our findings may provide a model that can be extended to additional chronic conditions
understudied in women."
10879698,"This S10 shared application request is being made to purchase a full capacity G4 Sequencing
Platform to service sequencing capabilities, to amplify research activity and biomedical capacity at
Florida A&M University, College of Pharmacy (CoPPs). Unmet Need: There is an urgent need to
replace a single source obsolete central piece of equipment at the U54 RCMI /National Institute on
Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Programs molecular genomics core (MGC) facility
at Florida Agriculture & Mechanical University, College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences
(FAMU-CoPPS), a multi-disciplinary center focusing on research that affects disadvantaged,
minority and under-served populations. The FAMU-CoPPS MGC is at an enormous disadvantage
due to rapidly evolving advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies concurrent to
expiration and retirement of the cores central piece of instrument (Affymetrix® GeneAtlas®
System). The GeneAtlas® was purchased in 2015, and in 2016 the Affymetrix Corporation was
acquired by Thermo Fischer Scientific , who in 2021 announced its permanent retirement and
notified its customers. This has crippled the MGC , which is now without equipment and greatly in
need of a state of the art NGS capacity platform. Furthermore, the phasing of out microarray
technology -in general-along with decade long advances in NGS, is necessitating the CoPPS to
acquire a high through put platform for affordable genome sequencing, genome analysis ,
phylogenetic analysis and a full range of metagnomics to elucidate microbiome complex
taxonomic profiles including fungi (ITS2) and prokaryotes (16S). Equipment Feature Justification:
The G4 Sequencing Platform offers the unique capability to run 1, 2, 3, or 4 flow cells at a time,
each with 4 fluidically independent lanes. This level of flexibility allows users to optimize their
workflows and maximize efficiency, while being cost beneficial and not available in any other
sequencing platforms on the market. Overall Benefit: To Students: All FAMU’s Graduate students
seeking the PhD and MS graduate students will receive training in outlined courses on this
instrumentation in an effort to broaden their skills and for incorporating use of equipment in their
research thesis and dissertation. Moreover, research training will be mentor-driven faculty/student
hypothesis-driven. To Faculty: A large number of faculty have indicated significant interest in
being able to carry out applications supported by the requested equipment. To Institutional and
Research Goals: FAMU is a public, historically black land grant university, founded in 1887
accredited to award baccalaureate, masters and doctoral degrees by the Commission on Colleges

which denotes higher research activity. To the College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences:
The FAMU (COPPS) was established in 1951 and was designated a ""Center of Excellence"" by the
former Florida Board of Regents. Acquisition of this instrument will fill a serious void in genomics
technologies within the CoPPS and propel existing research and/or education into this technology
which will contribute to the institution's long-range biomedical research goals. The component
goal of this program is to assist researchers, by acquired advanced instrumentation, established
cutting-edge biomedical research laboratories, funded research facilities, and other research
support. To Research Vision and Research Projects: The research vision of FAMU COPPS is to
conduct world-class research that emphasizes minority health and health disparities."
10883580,"Over the past decade, scientists have accelerated efforts to better understand Alzheimer’s
disease (AD). Much progress has been made in revealing the genetic architecture of AD and its
common antecedent, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Yet, some people who incur excessive
AD risk remain cognitively normal. Identifying risk factors for cognitive deterioration in dementia
can guide novel investigations into mechanisms underlying resilience to AD. The best-available
polygenic risk score for AD explains 1.7% of overall liability independent from the leading risk
gene, APOE (accounts for 17.4% of the variance in AD), indicating that a massive portion of
genetic liability remains unresolved. Genetic risk for cardiovascular disease contributes
additional risk for AD, thus a systems-level investigation into how cardiovascular dysfunction
interacts with neurobiological mechanisms of cognitive decline is warranted. Toward this end,
we developed a transcriptome-imputation method—the Brain Gene Expression and Network
Imputation Engine (BrainGENIE)—to measure the brain transcriptome in living individuals using
blood-based gene-expression profiles. BrainGENIE is fundamentally different from other
transcriptome-imputation methods, and captures a much larger proportion of the variance in the
brain transcriptome. BrainGENIE can predict 9–57% of the brain transcriptome, yielding an
approximate 1.8-fold increase in coverage relative to the prior “gold standard” method
PrediXcan, and which greatly improves our statistical power to detect genes and pathways
associated with disease. We have also generalized our BrainGENIE framework to impute
cardiac-specific transcriptome profiles (HeartGENIE), thereby allowing us to investigate brain-
and cardiac-specific transcriptome signatures associated with cognitive deterioration in
dementia. Our proposal contains three Specific Aims to improve our transcriptome-imputation
methods, reveal gene networks and biological pathways in brain and cardiac tissue underlying
cognitive impairment in dementia, and accurately predict an individual’s longitudinal cognitive
decline pave the way to precisely define individuals who are at risk for or resilient to AD. Aim 1:
Optimize our BrainGENIE and HeartGENIE algorithms to improve the accuracy of predicted
gene-expression levels for transcripts in the brain and cardiac tissue that are not currently well
predicted. Aim 2: Identify transcriptomic signatures of cognitive impairment in dementia with
BrainGENIE and HeartGENIE. Aim 3: Develop an neural network to accurately predict cognitive
decline longitudinally. This project will identify reveal multivariate risk factors potentially driving
cognitive decline, a critical step toward improving diagnosis, intervention, and prevention of AD."
10879839,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Over 15 million people participated in racial justice protests nationwide, following the murders of George Floyd
and Breonna Taylor, spotlighting activism as a collective tool against structural racism and discrimination
(SRD). SRD manifests as policies and practices (e.g., redlining, voter suppression, mass incarceration) that
produce hostile environments which contribute to psychological distress, elevated allostatic load, and an
elevated risk for chronic diseases and premature death, concentrated within Black and Latinx populations.
While the connection between SRD and health is well documented, few studies provide evidence on strategies
to reduce SRD and mitigate consequences on psychological and physiological outcomes. Thus, there is a
critical need to rigorously test interventions that address the root causes of SRD and reduce SRD’s influence
on the mental and physical health of Black and Latinx populations, beginning in adolescence. The specific
aims of the study are to 1) Determine whether a racial justice activism behavioral intervention prevents and
reduces depressive symptoms in Black and Latinx adolescents and young adults and 2) Determine whether a
racial justice activism behavioral intervention lowers allostatic load scores in Black and Latinx adolescents and
young adults. To accomplish these aims, the team will conduct a stage II group-based, multi-component, and
multilevel randomized behavioral clinical trial. We will collect psychological and physiological measures at
baseline, then at 6-month intervals for 2 years post racial justice activism intervention."
10879910,"There is more female hypertension-related mortality than male. Although women’s blood pressure is lower than
men’s in younger life, after menopause the reverse is true. A decrease in estrogen plays a role in women’s
midlife increase in blood pressure. However, factors that modify the extent of this increase in individuals are
not known.
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is crucial to blood pressure regulation, and it is also the
target of many antihypertensive medications. These different medications vary in their effects, depending on
where in the RAAS they act. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin-receptor
blockers (ARBs) do not reliably prevent the production of aldosterone, which can “break through” these
treatments, worsening outcomes.
We propose to study changes in serum aldosterone levels in 1,534 women participating in a large, longitudinal
study of women’s midlife health, the Study of Women’s Heath Across the Nation (SWAN). These
measurements will be made in sera collected 5±1 years prior to the final menstrual period (FMP), within a year
of the FMP, and 5±1 years after the FMP. In addition, since renin measurements can help provide context to
aldosterone measurements, we will also measure plasma renin concentration when matching plasma samples
are available.
The broad, long-term objective of the project is to improve cardiovascular health in midlife and older women.
The project has 3 Specific Aims.
Aim 1 is to identify the effect of the menopausal transition on the relationship between aldosterone and
changes in blood pressure. We will leverage the SWAN study to identify how high serum aldosterone
concentration is associated with time-averaged blood pressure during the menopausal transition.
Aim 2 is to identify the impact of aldosterone breakthrough on blood pressure outcomes across the
menopausal transition. We will identify women whose initial (FMP -5 years) aldosterone measurement is in the
absence of an ACEi or ARB and in whom a subsequent aldosterone measurement was under treatment with
one of these drugs. We will identify the impact of aldosterone breakthrough on systolic blood pressure.
Aim 3 is to identify the effect of changes in aldosterone during the menopausal transition on long-term renal
and cardiovascular outcomes. We will identify the relationship between serum aldosterone concentration and
subsequent incident cardiovascular events.
When our study is complete, we will disseminate for the first time an understanding of the changes in
aldosterone and renin during menopause, medication effects on these hormones, and the influence of these
hormones on cardiovascular outcomes."
10879716,"Project Summary
Coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and patients who survive a coronary artery
occlusion have a high risk for cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Spatial heterogeneity of
sympathetic innervation is a major contributor to post-infarct arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death after
myocardial infarction (MI), and sympathetic denervation (nerve loss) predicts arrhythmia risk in human studies.
Persistent denervation is caused by chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the scar acting on neuronal
Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Receptor Sigma (PTPσ). Targeting PTPσ with therapeutics or removing
sulfation from CSPG side chains promotes post-MI reinnervation of the borderzone and infarct, preventing
isoproterenol-induced arrhythmias and altering the cardiac immune response. Treatments that restore
innervation shift the cardiac immune response from pro-inflammatory to reparative, but the role of reinnervation
and neurotransmission in that process remains unknown. Several lines of evidence suggest that reinnervation
regulates inflammation, and that noradrenergic transmission is involved. We will test that hypothesis in Aim 1.
Conversely, preliminary data indicate that restoring sympathetic nerves prevents isoproterenol-induced
arrhythmias even if the nerves lack norepinephrine. This surprising result suggests that another aspect of
reinnervation, aside from noradrenergic transmission, is critical for normalizing cardiac β1AR signaling and
electrophysiology after MI. We will test the hypothesis that post-MI reinnervation prevents arrhythmias by
restoring a β1AR-SAP97 (β1 adrenergic receptor-synapse associated protein 97) signaling complex in cardiac
myocytes. We hypothesize that post-MI sympathetic reinnervation regulates cardiac inflammation and
electrophysiology via distinct mechanisms, and we have assembled an outstanding team of experts and
innovative experimental tools to identify the mechanisms involved."
10884240,"TRD2 Summary
Biomolecular NMR data computation is complex, requiring both semi-automated and manual processing steps.
The NMRbox platform provides easy access to the myriad software tools used during an individual investigation.
The efforts of TRD1 ensure that all of this software functions within the same operating system environment.
The goals of TRD2 are to provide information management solutions to promote software interoperability across
the NMRbox platform (TRD1) and with the analytics of TRD3; to foster reproducibility through the active curation
of scientific datasets and workflows; to facilitate the integration of experimental and derived data with information
from public databases to generate new knowledge, and to help aggregate this diverse panoply of experimental
data and metadata to create and facilitate richer depositions to the appropriate public data repositories. A key
component to enriching repository depositions is the collection of provenance metadata which reports on the
history or lineage of how computations were orchestrated and intermediate and final results obtained. Knowing
the pathway of how results were obtained is a critical component to reproducing and building upon scientific
claims.
The aims of this project period are fourfold. The CONNJUR data model and CONNJUR software integration
environments (integral components of NMRbox) will be extended to capture more metadata to support the
tracking of provenance (or data lineage), to foster reproducibility, to promote software interoperability both within
and without NMRbox, and to support a richer metadata set for depositions to the public data repositories. In
addition, the workflow management system will be extended to support high-throughput computational workflows
by connecting to powerful job management systems such as HTCondor and DAGMan. The data and process
logging capabilities of NMRbox will be used for automatic harvesting of whatever metadata can be gleaned by
these mechanisms. Finally, more direct access to BMRB resources will be provided through direct machine-to-
machine services."
10884244,"Community Engagement Summary
The overall goals of Community Engagement (CE) are to deliver the technologies developed within the Resource
to the broader scientific community, and to enlist the community in defining the direction of development efforts.
Community engagement will include the dissemination of technologies and methodologies developed by the
resource to the bioNMR and biomedical communities. This includes delivery of the Virtual Machines for
download, access to the cloud computing resources, access to data models, software and source code
developed by the resource, as well documentation of the overall approach to building the resource technologies.
Community engagement will also include extensive, hands-on training for the biomolecular NMR user
community, through workshops (both internal and external), interactive tutorials, and access to support staff for
assistance. An overarching goal is to make the resource sustainable by the bioNMR community as a whole. To
accomplish this goal, the community will be engaged to become active participants in the governance and future
development of the NMRbox resource. Efforts for this level of engagement include online, community code
repositories (such as GitHub), establishing additional NMRbox instances across the globe, and plans to
commercialize the core kernel of the technology so it can be self-sustaining in the future.
One facet is the concrete delivery of the technologies and methodologies developed as part of the resource to
the bio-NMR and related communities. This is covered in the Technology Dissemination portion of CE. A second
facet is delivery of training to the user communities on how to use the Center’s resources for cutting edge
applications in biomedical research. This is covered in the Technology Training portion of CE. Enlistment
involves interactive collaboration and service activities with external researchers, using active participation of the
collaborator to impact and guide technology development. This encompasses projects smaller in scope than a
DBP, frequently served by deploying existing technology in novel ways but in some cases involving modest
adaptations of existing technology, to serve the needs of a specific investigator or application. These interactions
encompass projects formerly described as Collaboration and Service, which now permeate the TRDs as well as
CE. The fourth facet is the eventual migration of Resource technologies out of the Center and into the hands of
the bio-NMR community. This is covered in the Sustainability of Technologies portion of CE."
10884318,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – CLINICAL INTERVENTION AND TRANSLATIONAL CORE
Clinical-Translational research is such a priority for the Colorado NORC that we have a scientific core
laboratory devoted to fostering clinical and translational research. The Clinical Intervention and Translation
(CIT) Core of the Colorado NORC began operation in August of 2010, year 16 of this grant. It was created
because of a growing need by many NORC users for help with a wide range of clinical research studies
involving modification of body weight, diet, and exercise to evaluate impact on a range of physiological and
behavioral outcomes. During the first 14 years of funding for the Colorado NORC, we experienced substantial
growth in the number of investigators in the user base interested in weight management and in assessing the
impact of diet and exercise interventions on health. This gave us the opportunity to create a center of
excellence in weight loss maintenance and behavioral interventions, that we believed could make substantial
contributions to the scientific underpinnings to the national agenda to address the problem of obesity. The CIT
Core takes advantage of the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center (AHWC), a 95,000 sq ft state-of-art center
for supporting lifestyle intervention studies, including in areas of nutrition, physical activity and mental
wellbeing.
The CIT Core offers consultations for NORC researchers interested in designing and implementing clinical or
translational research involving nutrition, physical activity, weight management and wellness. This includes
consultation on research design, target populations, outcome assessment, and study implementation. The CIT
Core has expertise in conducting research in traditional clinical settings and in schools, worksites and
communities. In addition, the CIT Core offers a number of different programs for producing and maintaining
weight loss including the Colorado Weigh, My New Weigh, The State of Slim, and others. NORC investigators
can use these programs in their research studies. Costs of the programs will be negotiated with individual
researchers and costs depend on the level of involvement of CIT Core staff. The CIT Core has worked to
support the development and implementation of exercise interventions for research projects as well. The
30,000 sq ft fitness facility at the AHWC has state of the art cardio and resistance training exercise equipment
(Technogym, Cesena Italy) that utilizes an “app” based system that provides sophisticated `supervision' and
monitoring of compliance with a prescribed exercise intervention. This technology allows accurate reporting of
the actual bouts of exercise performed by individual subjects participating in an exercise training program.
Over the next 5 years of funding, the CIT Core will increase its activities in support of nutrition needs in
collaboration with the CCTSI Nutrition Core as well as in areas of behavioral health and electronic information
systems to collect and access data."
10884320,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - ENERGY BALANCE ASSESSMENT CORE
The Energy Balance Assessment (EBA) Core has been an integral component of the University of Colorado
NORC since 1997. The EBA Core provides support for the measurement of components of energy balance
(e.g., energy expenditure and intake) and for the assessment of consequences of alterations in energy balance
(e.g., body composition, substrate oxidation). The Overarching Aim of the EBAC is to provide expertise and
support for obesity- and nutrition-related translational and transdisciplinary research for NORC investigators at
CU-AMC and its affiliates. Services of the EBAC have been and will continue to be essential for many NORC
investigators. Over the past 4 years (current award period), the EBA Core supported 168 research protocols
(up from 110 at the last competing renewal) and 97 principal investigators (up from 67); 58 protocols were
active at the time the competing renewal application was prepared. Of the 168 protocols that utilized EBA Core
services, 100 were supported by NIH awards and 41 were supported by NIDDK awards. The consolidation of
the instruments and techniques used by multiple investigators in the EBA Core enhances a) cost effectiveness,
by reducing the need to duplicate expensive instrumentation and specialized staffing, b) safety for both staff
and research participants, by overseeing the training required to safely operate instruments and conduct
procedures, and c) data quality, by conducting regular maintenance and standardized calibration and quality
assurance procedures. Specific Aims for the next period of award are to: 1) provide consultation on
experimental design, procedures, and data interpretation for energy balance-related research, and access to
and assistance with the use of state-of-the-art instrumentation and approaches for measuring various aspects
of energy balance; 2) oversee the maintenance, calibration, quality assurance, and scheduling of
instrumentation and the training of personnel who utilize the instrumentation; 3) leverage resources and
coordinate activities with other institutional programs that provide services that support energy balance
research, including the inpatient and outpatient Clinical and Translational Research Centers (CTRC), the
Nutrition Core, and the Center for Comparative Medicine; and 4) expand services based on the needs of
NORC investigators. Since 1997, the EBA Core has enhanced nutrition- and obesity-related research by
overseeing the measurement of components of energy balance and body composition with a degree of
accuracy and quality control that would have been difficult and more expensive for individual investigators to
achieve on their own."
10884321,"PROJECT SUMMARY – MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ANALYTICAL CORE
The overall theme of the Molecular and Cellular Analytical (MCA) core is to support investigation of human and

nucleus of expertise around which this core lab has been formed, including in obesity, type 2 diabetes,
lipidomics, and isotope tracer studies (Bergman), RNAseq analysis and interpretation (Shankar and Rudolph),
and mitochondrial function (Jackman). The lipidomic and mass spectrometry core provides quantitative
lipidomic analysis on plasma, cells, and tissues, as well as help with data interpretation, in addition to
determination of isotope enrichment and concentration of metabolites in blood and breath used in isotope

Age-related osteoporosis and low bone mass and sarcopenia present health risks,
decreased mobility, and increased fatality rates worldwide. Dietary and physical activity
recommendations for the prevention of osteoporosis and sarcopenia are more
acceptable due to safety and minimal or no side effects compared to pharmacological
therapies. Prevention through lifestyles that have a strong evidence base for
effectiveness and safety may be a better strategy for healthy aging, but prevention must
be seen as a lifelong commitment for optimal outcomes. The 11th edition of the
International Symposium for Nutritional Aspects of Musculoskeletal Health (ISNAMH) is
being planned for April 29-May 1, 2024 at Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California.
This is the first time this meeting will be held in the USA. It is the only meeting to focus
on the latest research on nutrition and exercise for bone and muscle. The conference
provides an intimate venue where all attendees are together for all presentations,
meals, and social activities. The specific objectives of the conference are: 1) to discuss
the latest science on prevention and muscular skeletal health, 2) to promote the
translation of basic and clinical research with the specific focus on nutrition and
exercise, and 3) to offer mentorship and training for junior scientists. This application is
to provide travel grants to early career and diverse investigators to attend the
symposium and to help defray conference costs. Exposure of early career investigators
to leading experts in prevention and musculoskeletal health and opportunities to present
their work and participate in discussions will enhance their career development."
10903960,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Despite progressive improvements in surgical techniques and peri-operative management approaches, the
prevalence of adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery remains high nationally. Unfortunately, to date, no
intervention has proven to be systematically effective in changing these outcomes. In two recent studies (Nature
2016, Nature Medicine 2018), we have identified endogenous pathways through which individuals may resist or
withstand end-organ injury. We have implicated a novel action of the canonical mitochondrial biogenesis regulator
PGC1α (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator-1-α) to defend renal levels of NAD+
(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) by increasing its biosynthesis. We have successfully translated these
findings into an early-stage “proof-of-concept” human clinical trial. We have shown that exogenous
augmentation of NAD+ through the oral administration of its precursor, nicotinamide (Nam), is not only safe and
well tolerated, but may have favorable clinical effects toward the reduction of postoperative myocardial injury
and acute kidney injury in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In this proposed NAD+ Augmentation in
Cardiac Surgery Associated Myocardial Injury (NACAM) trial, we will conduct a larger, Phase 2, randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral Nam for the prevention of peri-
operative myocardial injury in 304 patients. The primary endpoint in this study is the serum cardiac troponin T
Area Under the Curve (AUC) as a validated marker of peri-operative myocardial injury. Our secondary
endpoints include the incidence of acute kidney injury, and changes in urinary quinolinate/tryptophan (uQ:T)
ratio as mechanistic marker of de novo NAD+ biosynthesis to help further advance our understanding about the
pathomechanism of cardiac surgery associated ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). In addition, the study of
baseline uQ:T ratio as a marker of impaired NAD+ biosynthesis can help identify a high-risk subgroup for future
clinical trial enrichments and targeted interventions to alleviate cardiac surgery associated IRI. Additional
exploratory outcomes will include a composite of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, major
adverse kidney outcomes, and biomarkers of renal injury. Adverse events and additional information on
medical events of special interest, such as length of hospitalization, and peri-operative inotrope and
vasopressor use will also be ascertained. Overall, the proposed study will more definitively determine if
derangement of NAD+/Nam metabolism may be a pivotal effector of organ injury and risk stratifier, and whether
extrinsic augmentation may reduce stress-mediated organ injury. Successful pursuit of this project could unveil
a path toward a safe and inexpensive intervention to prevent cardiac surgery-induced myocardial and renal
injury which currently lacks any effective strategies."
10903964,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Significance. Circadian and sleep disruption, and sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, are highly
prevalent and associated with a host of adverse health outcomes including cardiovascular mortality and
morbidity. African-Americans are disproportionately affected by disrupted/misaligned circadian rhythms,
disrupted sleep and sleep apnea; which may be important, unique contributors to adverse CMB health in
African-Americans. Reducing the burden of adverse cardiometabolic health in African-Americans may involve
targeting both circadian rhythms and sleep. However, limited research exists on circadian rhythms in the
natural environment of AAs, and there are major gaps in knowledge about the determinants of circadian and
sleep disruption within African-Americans. We hypothesize that multilevel socio-environmental factors are
drivers of circadian misalignment (a mismatch between the internal circadian system and behavioral or
environmental cycles), which contribute to irregular sleep, and in turn disrupts physiologic processes such as
blood pressure and metabolism in a socioeconomically diverse cohort of AAs. It is plausible that the
hypothesized association differs by SES and individual resilience; thus, we will consider resilience as a
protective factor that may mitigate the adverse effects of the environment. Approach. Leveraging resources
from a well characterized cohort of African-Americans in Atlanta Georgia, we propose to use a repeated
measures design to test the cumulative effects of real-time household- and neighborhood-level factors (e.g.,
socioeconomic status, light at night, noise, air pollution) on psychosocial factors, rigorously assessed circadian
disruption/misalignment (including home dim light melatonin onset to measure internal endogenous biologic
rhythms), sleep regularity (14-day actigraphy, diary) and apnea (in-home polysomnography) and relatedly, the
impact of these measures on markers of CMB health in 400 AAs. To assess cardiometabolic health we will
measure 24-hour blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and biochemical markers of inflammation and metabolic
dysfunction. We will explore individual-level SES and resilience as effect modifiers of the hypothesized
associations. Impact. The overarching aim of this R01 is to elucidate the largely unexplained high burden of
adverse cardiometabolic health in African-Americans by specifically focusing on identifying the multilevel socio-
environmental determinants of circadian and sleep disruption, and determining the relative impact of circadian
and sleep disruption on markers of CMB health. This project will have a high impact, because it will identify
salient socio-environmental factors (risk and protective) that contribute to circadian and sleep health in AAs, to
inform culturally tailored multilevel interventions to reduce sleep and cardiovascular disparities."
10903965,"Project Summary/Abstract: A fundamental problem in biology is to understand how the compendium of
proteins in an organism (the ‘proteome’) cooperatively interact to create phenotype. Despite considerable
experimental and computational advances with respect to defining and inferring protein-protein interactions
(PPIs), no method currently exists to infer a hierarchy of protein interactions: that is, how proteins interact to
create complexes, pathways, and phenotype. This proposal uses bacteria as a model to develop a novel
statistical method that transforms a genome sequence into a hierarchy of protein interaction networks. Key to
this approach is the advance that components of variation typically discarded as noise (harboring < 0.01%
variance) in fact do contain biologically important information regarding PPIs. Preliminary results illustrate that
our statistical method may be an effective multi-scale framework to describe emergent biological function
arising from a ‘parts-list’ of proteins. We call our approach Spectral Correlation Analysis of Layered
Evolutionary Signals (SCALES); the main thrust of our proposal is testing the experimental validity and
robustness of our approach. With respect to validity, we will combine high-throughput molecular genetics with
computation to test whether SCALES can accurately infer functions of uncharacterized proteins using P.
aeruginosa as a model system. With respect to robustness, we will test whether our results are robust to the
genomic feature used for measuring co-variation.
 Looking to the future of the laboratory, SCALES may be generally useful for understanding hierarchical
architectures across different biological systems, spanning proteins to cells to ecosystems. Therefore, we
believe this proposal will serve as a critical launching point to explore important concepts central to the focus of
the post-genomic era, namely creating novel mathematical frameworks by which to convert the torrent of high-
content, complex data being collected into useful and actionable biological knowledge.
 For defining the vision of the laboratory, natural systems are products of a generative process that is
poorly understood—the evolutionary process. Though properly described as random variation and selection,
evolution generates remarkably ordered, low-entropy biological systems that execute high-performance
functions, are robust to perturbation, and have the capacity to adapt to new functions. It is therefore
conceivable that quantitatively understanding design architectures of evolved systems, and how they come to
be, may yield a new theoretical foundation of engineering for systems with natural-like properties; namely, the
ability to dynamically interact with the environment. The broad vision of the Raman Lab is to elucidate
organizational principles that govern the ability of evolved systems to work as well as maintain fitness. We
hope to address this problem in a variety of systems subject to component variation and environmental
selection. In doing so, our ultimate hope is to create rubrics for designing adaptive systems intelligently."

The World Health Organization estimates that soil transmitted helminths infect 1 in 4 people worldwide.
Protection or clearance of these parasitic worms requires the initiation of a type-2 immune response. Productive
type-2 immunity and worm clearance are dependent on three key cytokines: interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13.
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) represent an important source of type-2 cytokines. Specifically, ILC2 cells
sense damaged mucosa and act as early orchestrators anti-helminth immunity. Currently, much of our
understanding regarding the role of ILC2 cells in anti-helminth immunity stems from work focused on tissue-
resident ILC2 or natural ILC2 (nILC2) cells. However, we and others have recently described a second subset
of migratory ILC2s, termed inflammatory ILC2, (iILC2) cells. The distinct phenotype, timing, origin, and function
of these distinct ILC2 subsets suggests that iILC2 cells serve a unique role in anti-helminth immunity.
 The studies outlined herein will address the following critical gaps in our knowledge: 1) The origin(s) of
iILC2 cells, which remains in debate. 2) How iILC2 cells transit to the lung and the extent they enter the
parenchyma during infection is unknown. 3) The impact that iILC2 cells have on tissue-resident ILC2 population
remains unclear, and their role in long-term protection against helminths has not been explored. The aims below
will address these knowledge gaps by testing the central hypothesis that migratory iILC2 cells, originating from
small intestine or bone marrow precursors, acquire an nILC2 phenotype upon entry into the lung and contribute
significantly to barrier immunity after repeated helminth infection. Aim 1: Determine iILC2 origin and tissue
heterogeneity during helminth infection. Aim 2: Elucidate the mechanism of iILC2 migration and diapedesis into
the lung. Aim 3: Determine the extent that iILC2 cells contribute to the tissue-resident ILC2 pool after sequential
N. brasiliensis exposure. These aims are both innovative in concept (by challenging the current dogma
surrounding iILC2 cells) and approach (by using unique reporter mice and genomic systems to track the fate and
function of iILC2 cells). This proposal is significant because understanding of the origin of iILC2 cells, how
they egress and migrate to inflamed mucosa, and their contribution to the long-term tissue-resident ILC2
population in the lung significantly advances our understanding of ILC2 biology. Filling these key gaps in our
knowledge will establish the role of iILC2 cells as both critical first responders to helminth infection and also
identify the mechanisms contributing to their role in long-term barrier maintenance and integrity."

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common inherited retinal dystrophy, caused by >71 mutations that
primarily cause rod photoreceptor death. Cone death always follows rod
death and starts after the end of major
rod death phase regardless of the underlying rod specific gene mutations. Accumulation evidence have shown
that cone death in RP is due to glucose starvation. There is a knowledge gap in understanding cellular
metabolism in cone and “metabolic coupling” between cone and RPE in RP. Our long-term goal is to prevent
blindness in RP due to cone death. Our overall objective is to define how cones and RPE are metabolically
coupled and to test potential therapies for RP that are designed to restore this relationship. Our central
hypothesis is that reprogramming cone and RPE metabolism can promote cone survival in RP
independently of the underlying rod-specific gene mutations. To test this hypothesis, we propose three
specific aims. In Aim 1, we will use a cone-specific conditional allele to enhance glycolysis or OXPHOS in
cone cells and then determine the effects on cone survival and function in RP mouse models. In Aim 2, we will
use an RPE-specific conditional allele to enhance or suppress OXPHOS in RPE and determine the effects on
photoreceptor function in RP mouse models. The results from Aim 1 & 2 will elucidate the role of glycolysis
and OXPOHS in Cone and RPE cells in mouse model of RP. In Aim 3, we will use virus gene therapy to test
therapeutic value of reprogramming cone and RPE metabolisms in 2 preclinical models of RP. Impact: it will
address this knowledge gap in cone metabolism and the role of OXPHOS in RPE biology in degenerated
retina, which will greatly advance our understanding of the metabolic coupling between cones and the RPE
and may provide opportunities for preclinical gene-therapy interventions to prevent cone death or delay
photoreceptor degeneration through reprogramming of cellular metabolism. This proposal is innovative
because it: 1) will use innovative inducible cell-specific Cre drivers to address previously unanswered
questions that require precise control of timing of gene manipulation in cones and RPE; 2) will use innovative
conditional overexpress knock-in mouse ; 3)will be the first to test innovative hypothesis that reprogramming
cone and RPE metabolism can promote cone survival in RP independently of the underlying rod specific gene
mutations; 4) will use unique knock-in mouse model of RP; and 5) will test preclinical animal trial using
AAV::Cone specific CRISPR/Cas9 to target a gene to reprogram cellular metabolism."

Latino children have worse health than non-Latino White children across many common conditions, including
respiratory illnesses and obesity, laying a foundation for health disparities across the life course. Prior studies
demonstrate that attachment-based parenting interventions, those designed to foster sensitive parenting
behavior and secure infant-parent attachment, improve maternal sensitivity, attachment security, child
socioemotional development, and some aspects of child psychophysiological regulation. To date, there has not
been a large-scale trial testing the efficacy of an attachment-based intervention for supporting physical health
more broadly. This is a significant gap, especially with regard to Latino child health promotion, given (a) the
promise of attachment-based interventions, and (b) the early origins of health disparities that negatively impact
Latino children, the largest and fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. The proposed RCT will test
the impacts of an attachment-based intervention on emerging health outcomes in low-income Latino
children (N = 260). We will focus on low-income Latino families as a group at exceptionally high risk for health
problems. The manualized intervention, Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up (ABC), consists of 10
sessions provided by a trained parent coach to primary caregivers and their infants in their homes. We will
enroll families with 9-month-old infants and follow them longitudinally until age 2. In Aim 1, we will test the
effects of ABC on child health outcomes. We hypothesize positive intervention effects on common infant
and toddler illnesses (e.g., respiratory illnesses), low-grade inflammation, BMI, and sleep. In Aim 2, we will
test mediators of intervention effects. We hypothesize (a) positive intervention effects on sensitive
parenting behaviors and child stress regulation, and (b) that these factors will mediate intervention effects
on child health outcomes. In Aim 3, we will test sociocultural context as a moderator of intervention
effects. We hypothesize stronger intervention effects in higher-risk dyads (i.e., mothers who are more
acculturated, who have fewer supports, or who experience more discrimination) than in lower-risk dyads. Our
proposal is innovative in that the RCT design provides an unprecedented opportunity to test causal impacts of
an attachment-based intervention on a comprehensive set of early health outcomes known to track across the
life course. This proposal is significant in that it aligns directly with the NICHD priority of Understanding Social
Determinants of Health and Developmentally Informed Strategies to Mitigate Health Disparities. We will (a)
examine how attachment-based intervention supports a foundation for health and (b) identify subgroups to
prioritize in future efforts to optimize health in low-income Latino children."

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major public health crisis with no effective treatments. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)
has three major polymorphic alleles, denoted ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. Homozygosity for ApoE4 is the
strongest genetic risk factor for AD with an astonishing 12-fold increased risk of developing AD compared
with individuals who inherit ApoE3.1,2 ApoE4 differs from ApoE3 by a single amino acid, an arginine instead of
cysteine at position 112. This small change presumably alters the conformation of the protein, altering its
activity in many biological pathways resulting in both gain and loss of function.1,3 Given the dramatic impact of
ApoE4 on AD biology (including increased amyloid deposition, faster rate of progression, decreased synaptic
content), there have been attempts to identify a small molecule that binds to ApoE4 and makes it functionally
similar to ApoE3, a so called “corrector”. Yet this has been challenging: Generating purified ApoE4 protein has
proven to be difficult, as the protein is notoriously sticky and readily aggregates. Multiple mutations in the C-
terminal region are required to enable ApoE purification and structural determination.4 Biophysical analysis of
this purified but modified protein gives insight into the consequences of the single amino acid change,
suggesting that the thermal stability of ApoE4 is notably less than ApoE3.5 We now approach this challenge to
take advantage of an emerging technology to analyze thermal stability of proteins in the context of tissues,
intact cells and lysates called cellular thermal shift (CETSA).6 Analysis of lysates from the brains of humans or
humanized ApoE transgenic animals by CETSA showed that brain ApoE4 is less thermally stable
compared to ApoE3. We have reproduced this same phenotype in transfected human HEK cells and by
engineering a HiBiT tag on to the N-terminus of ApoE4, creating a split Nano-luciferase cellular thermal shift
assay (BiTSA)7,8 that is suitable for both identifying novel correctors, through a high throughput (HTP) screen,
and driving subsequent hit to lead efforts. Excitingly, we show that both a recently published ApoE4 corrector
(compound 8), discovered by scientists at AbbVie by an NMR fragment screen and structure guided chemistry
effort, and a previously published genetic “corrector” – the Arg61T mutation, fully restore the temperature
stability of ApoE4 such that it performed like ApoE3 in the BiTSA assay. Compound 8 has a KD <5 μM9. We
have already made a small library of analogues, reproducing the effect with some potential insight into
improvements. The aims of this application are to 1) leverage the ApoE BiTSA assay to identify novel
ApoE4 correctors, through an HTP screen, 2) drive medicinal chemistry optimization of compound 8 and
hits identified in the screen and 3) test the hypothesis that these correctors can ameliorate ApoE4
related Alzheimer phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo using cell and murine models that we and others
have developed. These efforts represent initial steps towards our overall long-term objective, discovering
first in class ApoE4 correctors as therapeutics to prevent AD."

In the mammalian neocortex, inhibitory neurons (INs) profoundly influence cortical computations and
dynamics, and their various functions are thought to be mediated by different IN types. While a large diversity
of INs exists, molecular markers in mouse cortex identify three major non-overlapping classes: parvalbumin-
(PV), somatostatin- (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide- (VIP) INs. Studies in mouse lines expressing
Cre-recombinase in each of these IN classes are rapidly revealing distinct patterns of connectivity, response
properties and in vivo function for each class. However, it remains unknown whether insights gained from
mouse cortex apply to cortical INs in primates and humans. IN dysfunction in humans has been implicated in
several disorders, such as epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety and autism, therefore it is important to understand
normal cortical IN connectivity and function in primates. The lack of viral tools to selectively access IN
subtypes, and the difficulty of performing genetic manipulations in primates have been major impediments to
studying INs in this animal model. Our goal is to leverage recent advances in the development of viral tools to
express transgenes in specific INs subtypes to investigate the connectivity, response properties, and
computational function of two major classes of INs, PV and SOM, in the superficial layers of the primate
primary visual cortex (V1). Using IN-type specific expression of Cre-recombinase combined with rabies-virus
monosynaptic circuit tracing, we will map local and brain-wide inputs to specific V1 IN classes (Aim1). Using
two-photon imaging of IN-type specific targeted calcium indicators, or optogenetic identification of
channelrhodopsin-tagged IN types, we will characterize the visual response properties of distinct V1 IN classes
(Aim2). Finally, we will use optogenetic inactivation of distinct IN-types expressing inhibitory opsins, to
understand the relative roles of IN classes in V1 computations (Aim3). We will test specific hypotheses derived
from available data in mouse, the specific geometry of PV and SOM cells in primate cortex, published
computational models of feature tuning and surround suppression in visual cortex, and our preliminary
results. Impact. The proposed studies will provide the first account of the connectivity, visual properties and
computational function of PV and SOM INs in primate cortex, paving the way for studies of IN function in this
order. They will also reveal conserved principles of IN function across species, as well as fundamental inter-
species differences, stressing the importance of studying cortical function in species that are evolutionarily
closer to humans."
10874459,"CIRCUIT MECHANISMS OF SOUND PROCESSING AND DETECTION IN THE AUDITORY PATHWAY
 Auditory perception relies on predicting statistics of incoming signals, be it identifying the speech of a
conversation partner in a crowded room or recognizing the sound of a bubbling brook in a forest. The human brain
detects statistical regularities in sounds as a fundamental aspect of prediction, evidenced by reduced responses to
repeated sound patterns and enhanced responses to unexpected sounds. Multiple studies demonstrate that the neuronal
responses to regular signals are reduced through adaptation, which can contribute to prediction. However, adaptation
alone is not sufficient to account for prediction and studies at cellular and neuronal population level in animals thus far
lend onto partial support to existing theories of predictive coding. As such, the circuit level mechanisms for the
prediction of statistical regularities beyond tone frequency in sounds, and their role in behavior, remain unknown. Our
goal is to close this gap in knowledge and to determine the circuits that predict signals and detect statistical regularity and
its violation in auditory behavior. To identify feedforward and feedback components of prediction of statistical
regularities in sounds in the auditory system, we combine optogenetic selective perturbation and large-scale imaging and
electrophysiology with behavioral methods in awake mice. First, we test whether and how excitatory-inhibitory
interactions within the auditory cortex (AC) establish predictive code for sound patterns, detect statistical regularities, and
contribute to enhanced responses for unexpected sounds. Second, we test whether and how detection of statistical
regularities at the neuronal level contributes to behavioral detection of change in sound regularity. Third, we test whether
and how feedback from higher cortical areas provides information about regularity and violation. Our results will identify
the neuronal circuits for encoding statistical regularity and its violation in sound and establish their role in auditory
behavior."

 Human norovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis globally causing up to 200,000 deaths per
year. However, there are no antiviral drugs or vaccines. We use the closely related mouse or murine norovirus
(MNV) as a model system to understand how human norovirus causes infection and disease. More broadly, we
also use MNV as a tool to uncover novel and fundamental aspects of how viruses interact with the host immune
system and other intestinal microbes including bacteria and worms.
 We recently discovered CD300lf as a receptor of MNV. We leveraged this finding to identify tuft cells as
a target cell of MNV in the mouse intestines. Tuft cells are rare epithelial cells that sense and initiate an immune
response against intestinal worms. Tuft cells are also important in regulating intestinal inflammation, wound
recovery, and several mucosal cancers.
 In preliminary data, we developed novel tuft cell deficient mice and both CD300lf conditional knockout
and knock-in mice to study the role of tuft cells during acute and chronic norovirus infection. W We also
developed an in vitro MNV tuft cell culture system that will enable us to dissect the complex interactions between
norovirus, tuft cells, and the immune system. The objectives of this proposal are to determine the role of
tuft cells in norovirus infection, to determine the immunological consequences of tuft cell infection, and
to discover how infected tuft cells evade CD8+ T cell killing.
 In Aim 1, we will determine if viral infection impairs tuft cell function. We will identify the role of tuft
cells in acute and persistent MNV infection. We will determine how MNV kills tuft cells during chronic infection,
how infection perturbs the tuft cell transcriptome, and whether virus infection of tuft cells impairs the ability of tuft
cells to protect the host against worm infection.
 In Aim 2, we will determine the mechanism by which tuft cells act as an immunoprivileged niche
for MNV. MNV-specific CD8+ T cells ignore infected tuft cells during chronic infection yet they remain functional
and able to detect antigen ex vivo. We will identify how tuft cell tropism enables resistance to CD8+ T cells by
combining novel mouse lines, viral genetics, tuft cell and T cell co-culture, and adoptive transfer of both tuft cell
and MNV-specific CD8+ T cells. In particular, we will determine if quiescent long-lived tuft cells, a tuft cell subtype,
are a novel immunoprivileged reservoir for chronic infection.
 We anticipate this work will generate a detailed understanding about the cell tropism regulating norovirus
transmission, the role of viral infection in type II immunity, and the mechanism by which norovirus evades immune
CD8+ T cells. This is critical to our long-term goal of deciphering mechanisms of human norovirus
pathogenesis and developing a successful human norovirus vaccine."

Annually, 2.5 million babies die within the first four weeks of life, nearly a quarter due to infectious causes.
Newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) are especially vulnerable, due to such factors as
prematurity, an immature immune system, and need for life-sustaining invasive procedures and devices. In low
and middle income countries (LMIC), an increasing number of NICUs care for premature and critically ill
newborns. Healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSI) in LMIC are more common due to inadequate
infection prevention and control (IPC) and more difficult to treat due to high rates of antimicrobial resistance
(AMR). Previous research in this setting focuses primarily on outbreak investigations and does not adequately
describe risk factors for HA-BSI. Healthcare facilities lack effective tools to assess maternal and neonatal IPC
and create improvement strategies. Preliminary data from the applicant's ongoing prospective cohort study that
has enrolled over 6600 neonates in three NICUs in Pune, India, reinforces the high incidence of HA-BSI in this
setting with a rate of 7.6 per 1000 patient-days, as well as high rates of AMR. Among Klebsiella pneumoniae
isolates, the most common BSI pathogen, 96% are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 38% to
carbapenems. Among neonates with BSI, mortality is 22%. Within the framework of this study, the following are
proposed: (1) To identify modifiable risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU; (2) To develop a model for predicting
infection with carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO); and (3) To develop and pilot a novel tool to assess IPC
practices in the NICU and Labor & Delivery. Identifying risk factors for HA-BSI in the NICU will promote
development of targeted IPC strategies. Creation of a prediction model using a decision tree algorithm will help
identify babies at highest risk of CRO infections. Such a model can support NICU clinicians in selecting the right
antibiotics when infection is suspected, reducing time to appropriate therapy and decreasing unnecessary use
of last resort antibiotics such as colistin. Development of an IPC assessment tool that incorporates human factors
engineering (HFE) principles will enable healthcare facilities to optimize IPC and reduce risk of hospital-acquired
infections and associated mortality. This mentored research will train the applicant in advanced epidemiologic
methods and application of IPC in LMIC. The applicant is a neonatologist at Johns Hopkins University committed
to patient-oriented research in resource-limited settings. Her long-term goals are to become a leader in neonatal
IPC in low resource settings and devise interventions to reduce global burden of HA-BSI and associated
mortality. This K23 will facilitate skill development in longitudinal data analysis, prediction models, survey
development, HFE, and qualitative data analysis. Training will include formal coursework, supervised data
analysis, and mentorship by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, IPC, biostatistics, epidemiology, patient
safety, and HFE. Collectively, the activities of this K23 will provide a pathway to an independent career as a
clinical investigator with expertise in healthcare epidemiology and IPC in low resource settings."
10874712,"About 1 in 7 pregnant individuals experience depression, with roughly the same number facing this devastating
illness after delivery. The downstream effects of perinatal depression adds to its toll with increased risk of
preterm birth; impairments in maternal-child attachment; adverse effects on infant development; and
decreased breastfeeding initiation/duration. The US Preventative Services Task Force finds that some major
depressive episodes (MDEs) can be averted with counseling strategies that employ principles from
interpersonal therapy (IPT) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). They also observe the value of peer
support, which can decrease perinatal depression. A possible shared mechanism for these interventions is
enhancement of self-efficacy, which is critical in the setting of stressful events such as pregnancy and
parenting. However, practical implementation of interventions to enhance self-efficacy and reduce depression
risk is challenging. Reproductive health providers have limited time and training to deliver depression
prevention programs. As well, perinatal individuals may not appreciate the need to participate in a prevention
program or have difficulty finding or affording providers of behavioral interventions. Technology can assist with
these challenges by providing education, support and therapeutic interventions to perinatal pregnant
individuals. Unlike web-based applications (apps), text messaging interventions (TMIs) can proactively deliver
health information and messages, even to those with limited motivation to engage in preventative interventions.
Mobile phone use has exploded with >95% of pregnant individuals (including >85% of the minority population)
reporting use of a mobile phone to communicate via short text messages. TMIs can also screen perinatal
individuals for depression outside the general medical setting and provide general peer support. With end-user
input throughout the process, we will build a multi-component TMI (called Text4Moms) that screens and
triages perinatal individuals for risk of a MDE. This system will draw content from both IPT and CBT; it will
send tailored text messages with links to relevant video content to perinatal individuals at risk for a
depressive episode. An on-demand secure chat function staffed by a peer navigator will complement the
text messages for enhanced support. The system will include pre-populated content for peers to cut and paste
into text messages for participants, which will support peers and decrease their training burden. This system
leverages some of the best components of an app (video, tailoring, chat) into a common and user-
friendly text messaging platform. After development, we will conduct a pilot randomized trial to test the
ability of the TMI to enhance the target of self-efficacy and decrease depressive symptoms and risk of a MDE.
We will query Research Domain Criteria (RDOC) constructs of “loss” and “threat,” and will evaluate preliminary
effectiveness and implementation (assessment of feasibility, acceptability, use and benefit of the peer chat
feature) through a pilot randomized clinical trial."

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is the loss of the functional copy of a tumor suppressor gene in
heterozygous individuals, leaving only the mutant copy, thereby contributing to cancer initiation
and progression. Understanding how LOH arises in healthy cells is a vital component of cancer
research, as it could lead to opportunities to prevent cancer in patients with increased early
screening for individuals with mutations putting them at high risk for LOH, or with identification
and targeting of cells that have undergone dangerous LOH. LOH can develop through deletions
of whole chromosome arms or smaller regions of the genome, nondisjunction incidents, or
homologous recombination events between homologous chromosomes (i.e., interhomolog
homologous recombination, IH-HR). Despite decades of research, a critical need remains to
identify the causes of LOH in normal or precancerous cells. Detecting these mechanisms in
already established tumors is often difficult due to high levels of aneuploidy, ongoing
chromosome instability, and DNA damage. We have recently developed a high throughput flow
cytometry-based system which is sensitive for detecting LOH in normal diploid cells. Our
objective is to exploit this system to identify and quantify mechanisms of LOH that arise from
DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and the factors that modulate these events. We hypothesize
that mechanisms of LOH which occur as a result of DSBs include copy number neutral LOH, as
from IH-HR or non-disjunction associated with chromosome duplication and furthermore, that
these events are modulated by the location of the DSB and DNA repair proteins, including
proteins that act on recombination intermediates. We will address this hypothesis through the
following specific aims: In Aim 1, we will investigate how proteins that act on recombination
intermediates impact LOH arising from IH-HR, utilizing our flow-cytometry based system. We
will assay the frequency of LOH that arises from IH-HR in the presence or absence of proteins
that both prevent and contribute to crossover events, which can lead to long-range LOH. In Aim
2, we will take an unbiased approach to explore additional mechanisms of LOH arising from a
DSB. We will determine how LOH mechanism is affected by the location of a DSB along a
chromosome and by loss of different DSB repair pathways. This work will allow us to identify the
factors that can contribute to or even prevent LOH, and give a better understanding of how
these initiating events in cancer occur."

Grant's Analyst, in coordination with the PI."
10900977,"ABSTRACT
 Cryptosporidium infections are a leading cause of diarrheal disease in young children for which no
vaccine or universally effective treatment is available. Apicomplexan parasites such as Cryptosporidium,
Toxoplasma, and Plasmodium actively invade their host cells and reside within a specialized membrane-bound
compartment, or parasitophorous vacuole (PV). To survive and replicate, intracellular parasites must evade
immune detection and extract nutrients from the host cytosol. Toxoplasma and Plasmodium secrete the contents
of specialized secretory organelles, such as dense granules, to the PV where they orchestrate vacuole
remodeling and immune evasion, while solute transporters at the parasite plasma membrane import small
molecules such as amino acids and sugars. In addition, a conserved Kelch13-containing complex in these
parasites is responsible for the formation of specialized membrane invaginations in the parasite plasma
membrane that facilitate nutrient extraction from the host by bulk endocytosis.
 Cryptosporidium resides in a unique intracellular but extra-cytoplasmic niche. Transmission electron
microscopy of intracellular Cryptosporidium revealed intricate ultrastructural features at the host-parasite
interface, including electron dense bands, tight junction-like rings, and a highly invaginated membrane termed
the feeder organelle. The three-dimensional architecture, composition, and function of these features are poorly
understood. Recent studies and preliminary data have identified a handful of proteins that localize to the C.
parvum host-parasite interface, including secreted effectors and solute transporters. The relationship between
these components to each other, to the host cytosol, and to the ultrastructural features observed at the interface
are unknown. In addition, the machinery responsible for shaping the membrane invaginations at the feeder
organelle has not been identified.
 I hypothesize that transporters and secreted effectors occupy separate compartments at the interface,
with transporters assembled in the parasite plasma membrane and effectors delivered to the PV membrane or
lumen. I will uncover the three-dimensional ultrastructure, molecular architecture, and composition of the host-
parasite interface at unprecedented resolution using cryogenic electron-microscopy-based volume imaging
techniques. I will also use high-resolution optical microscopy and fluorescence complementation to determine
whether transporters and dense granule effectors are trafficked to the same compartment. I also propose that
the feeder organelle is shaped by K13 complex-mediated endocytosis, and I will determine the localization of
these candidates in intracellular C. parvum parasites using light and electron microscopy. These studies will
leverage innovative structural and molecular parasitology approaches to reveal mechanisms of membrane
remodeling and nutrient acquisition fundamental to the biology of intracellular parasitism, yielding insights that
will aid the rational design of therapeutics to combat this important disease."

This proposal requests support for the 9th meeting of the biennial Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and
associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Thiol-Based Redox Regulation and Signaling to be held at the
Rey Don Jaime Grand Hotel, Castelldefels, Spain on July 13-14 (GRS) / 14-19 (GRC) 2024. Regulation of protein
function through the post-translational modification of specific cysteine residues (thiol oxidation) plays an
important role in the response and adaptation to local and global changes in the cellular levels of reactive
oxidants. A key challenge for the redox-signaling field is understanding how thiol-based signaling mechanisms
facilitate communication between molecules, organelles, cells, and organisms to initiate and coordinate different
biological responses to endogenous and environmental stimuli. The 2024 meeting will focus on the various
sources and targets of thiol modification. Specific attention will be placed on the consequences of dampening
(or upregulating) thiol-based redox signaling across species and disease pathologies. By providing a unique
opportunity for extensive interaction between chemists and biologists with expertise in biophysical methods,
bioinformatics, and animal and cellular model systems, with clinical researchers and physicians focused on
disease processes, this meeting is expected to significantly catalyze scientific progress. While the thematic area
of the conference is broad-based, its relevance to specialized NIH institutes is highly significant. Not only is redox
toxicity proposed as one of primary mechanisms of chemical-induced pathology in humans, but the broad
impacts of redox signaling on aging and age-associated disease are unmistakable. In keeping with the GRC
tradition, the 2024 meeting will select and encourage presentations that emphasize unpublished, novel findings,
creating a distinctive intellectual experience that adds significantly to the excitement of the meeting. Participants
will interact with one another during the invited presentations, the afternoon and evening poster sessions, and
at three daily meals. Investigators new to the meeting, junior investigators, trainees, and individuals historically
underrepresented in scientific research will be prevalent and welcomed. The associated GRS will provide a
small, relaxed forum in which graduate and postdoctoral students present their research and receive constructive
advice and encouragement from a few senior investigators who serve as mentors. We intend that together, the
GRS/GRC meetings will attract and increase retention of junior scientists in the field of redox biology. We
anticipate that the GRC will enhance the education of researchers at all career levels, generate new ideas and
collaborations aimed at understanding thiol-based redox regulation and dysfunction, and enable future progress
in the prevention, detection, and treatment of a wide-range of human diseases associated with a loss of redox
homeostasis."
10901677,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that results from loss-of-function mutations in a methyl-
reader protein known as methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2); however, despite nearly 20 years of research,
only minimal gains have been made in therapeutic development. While no “curative” intervention strategies exist,
seminal studies show that RTT can be reversed if MeCP2 levels are restored in mouse models. On the surface,
RTT appears to be an ideal candidate for gene therapy; however, MeCP2 is a dose-sensitive gene where even
a 1-fold increase in dosage over baseline could result in a related neurodevelopmental disorder known as MeCP2
duplication syndrome (MDS). The practical challenge created by these narrow dosage requirements is that not
only does MeCP2 delivery need to be efficient across the entire human brain, but each cell must receive the
same, relatively small amount.
The 3’untranslated region (UTR) is an essential site for post-transcriptional mRNA regulation where dozens of
microRNAs (miRNA) and RNA binding proteins additively contribute to fine-tuning gene expression. The impact
of each miRNA on protein levels is generally modest, making strategies that disrupt miRNA regulation of the
3’UTR potentially valuable tools for disorders where the therapeutic window of the target gene is narrow. The
repressive role of miRNAs on MeCP2 expression has been reproducibly shown at multiple sites and when
overexpressed and this strategy can reverse MDS symptoms in mice; however, the therapeutic potential in RTT
remains understudied.
Here we developed a novel strategy that uses a series of locked nucleic acid (LNA) site-blocking antisense
oligonucleotides (sbASOs) designed to “out-compete” endogenous miRNAs for 3’UTR binding and increase /
de-repress MeCP2 expression in a manner that is capped at sub-toxic levels. We anticipate that this strategy
could be a viable intervention strategy for patients with missense and late-truncating MeCP2 mutations, where
the partial loss of function can be offset by increased abundance. In Aim 1, we will conduct dose-response
studies using patient fibroblasts and iPSC-derived neurons with common MeCP2 mutations to determine which
subpopulations are responsive. In Aim 2, we will optimize sbASO delivery in vivo to female Mecp2T158M/+ mice to
establish their capacity to 1) reverse RTT-like symptoms and 2) avoid MDS-like adverse effects. These
experiments will establish proof of concept for the use of site-blocking ASOs in RTT and thereby provide a
foundation to support formal development campaigns. This proposal will provide training in RNA therapeutics,
iPSC modeling of disease, and mouse genetics, which represent three research focus areas that I have identified
as critical for my career development. My mentors and I have developed a training plan composed of didactic
and technical training to prepare me for an independent career in academic research."
10904778,"Diverse racial and ethnic groups, as well as individuals with disabilities and/or having socially, economically, or educationally disadvantaged backgrounds are underrepresented in neuroscience. Hunter College of the City University of New York (CUNY) and New York University (NYU) recognize that increasing the number of highly qualified neuroscientists from these underrepresented populations is integral to our future as academic and research institutions. Hunter College and NYU aim to increase the number of well-trained, diverse neuroscientists. BP-ENDURE at Hunter and NYU proposes to capitalize on and expand on the objectives and success of our first 5 years of BP-ENDURE funding, which has produced 43 program graduates in the program’s first 8 years who have applied to and been offered admission to graduate school. Importantly, 100% of BP-ENDURE graduates from Hunter and NYU who applied to doctoral programs were accepted to some of the best doctoral programs in the country, including Brown, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, UC Berkeley, UPenn, UCSF, Stanford, NYU, the University of Michigan, and Yale. Six of our graduates have been awarded NSF Graduate Research Fellowships. The overall goal of this application is to continue to develop and refine a neuroscience training program at Hunter that will encourage and prepare students from diverse backgrounds to enter into and succeed in neuroscience PhD programs. To achieve this goal, Hunter College has developed a research-educational partnership with five outstanding T32-awarded universities—New York University, Brown, the University of Michigan, Vanderbilt, and Yale. This partnership will expose 12 BP-ENDURE students from Hunter College and NYU per year to a research-intensive curriculum and an environment of excellence and active research. Moreover, because of the diversity of the proposed mentors, students will be exposed to a broad spectrum of researchers, including basic neuroscientists interested in central nervous system (CNS) issues and more applied neuroscientists from the areas clinical and cognitive neuroscience. During this funding period, five developmental activities are proposed: (1) To recruit and develop an outstanding group of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds who are dedicated to neuroscience research; (2) To provide scientific skills and research experiences to our trainees through research placement with actively funded neuroscientists; (3) To implement academic development and curriculum enhancement activities rooted in the student’s research activities; (4) To facilitate effective mentoring by program faculty; and (5) To maintain an effective Administrative Core to support our students’ needs and development. Our measurable objectives during the requested funding period include: (1) attaining 85 to 90% acceptance of trainees to graduate school programs in neuroscience; (2) improving our students’ quantitative skills and academic achievement, and (3) improving our students’ scientific writing and oral presentation skills."
10904970,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s disease is the second most common cause of age-related neurodegeneration in the U.S. In
Parkinson’s disease, mitochondrial dysfunction in midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra induces
oxidative stress and cell death. In turn, this neurodegeneration leads to dopamine depletion, which underlies the
motor dysfunction and dementia that are hallmarks of this disease. Current therapies raise dopamine levels to
relieve motor symptoms, but do not prevent neurodegeneration, disease progression, or death. Thus, there is
an essential unmet need to develop novel therapeutic strategies that protect dopaminergic neurons from
degeneration to prevent and treat Parkinson’s disease. Guanylyl cyclase C (GUCY2C) is the intestinal receptor
for the hormone uroguanylin produced in intestine, with a canonical role in fluid and electrolyte balance. In
intestine, this paracrine axis supports mitochondrial structure and function, and its disruption, universally
reflecting hormone loss, is central to the pathophysiology of cancer; inflammation and autoimmunity; and toxic
injury. Recently, uroguanylin emerged as the afferent limb of endocrine axes controlling two discrete circuits in
brain. GUCY2C in neurons in the hypothalamic ventral premamillary nucleus controls leptin signaling regulating
satiety and body weight. Disrupting this gut-brain endocrine axis contributes to hyperphagia underlying obesity.
Further, GUCY2C is expressed by dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, although its
(patho)physiological function remains undefined. Our preliminary studies reveal that silencing GUCY2C
increases the vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in mice to degeneration induced by
MPTP, a mitochondrial toxin that selectively kills dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in rodents,
primates, and humans. Moreover, GUCY2C signaling supports the mitochondrial transcriptome central to
preventing Parkinson’s disease, and silencing GUCY2C causes a significant loss of mitochondrial protein within
the substantia nigra. These preliminary studies suggest a model in which the GUCY2C-uroguanylin gut-brain
endocrine axis controls midbrain vulnerability to toxic insults by maintaining mitochondrial integrity to protect
dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Thus, studies here explore the novel Physiological Hypothesis
that uroguanylin secreted by intestine and GUCY2C expressed in the midbrain form a novel endocrine gut-brain
axis that protects dopaminergic neurons, opposing toxic degeneration. The Mechanistic Hypothesis suggests
that GUCY2C protects the integrity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons by supporting mitochondrial structure and
function. The Therapeutic Hypothesis suggests that exogenous GUCY2C ligands protect midbrain
dopaminergic neurons from toxic insults, potentially opposing the development and progression of Parkinson’s
disease. The possibility of translating these studies into new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat
Parkinson’s disease can be appreciated by considering that the GUCY2C ligands linaclotide (Linzess™) and
plecanatide (Trulance™) are FDA-approved to treat chronic constipation syndromes."

 In its second installment, the Neural Mechanisms of Acoustic Communication (NMAC) Gordon
Research Conference, which this year will also include an associated Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), will
convene on May 18-24, 2024, at the Jordan River hotel in Sunday River, Maine to discuss and debate new
findings in communication research and related fields. The NMAC GRC will enable investigators of all ranks
with wide-ranging expertise and from a variety of sub-fields and backgrounds to interact, leveraging the
intimate size and extended discussion time of the traditional GRC format to enable fertile scientific discourse.
This meeting fulfills a unique niche within the landscape of existing conferences through its focus on
comparative and mechanistic approaches to the study of neural circuits that mediate interactive acoustic
behavior across taxa that represent 800 million years of evolution. The interactive ability to exchange
information is a central and defining feature of all communication systems and helps organize social behavior.
As such, a comparative approach to the study of the neural mechanisms underlying acoustic communication
lends insight into general mechanisms of neural function, leads to the development of novel analytical and
experimental techniques and paves the way to novel treatments of dysfunction in human communication
systems.
 The 2024 NMAC has three specific aims: 1) To advance acoustic communication research by offering
an environment that encourages questions and discussion, challenges current thinking, and provides
opportunities for new collaborations; 2) to create a unique forum for interaction for researchers from a diversity
of communication systems and break down boundaries between communities focused on different model
systems, brain regions, research approaches; and 3) to educate new and early career investigators. To provide
greater opportunities for impactful junior scientists, we are introducing the “next generation talks” series where
the chairs will pick 4 graduate students or postdocs from the GRS to present at one of the sessions of the GRC
meeting. In addition, one talk per session will be selected from submitted abstracts with the aim to include
speakers from less represented backgrounds. Mentorship opportunities will include themed lunches where 1-3
scientists informally discuss topics of interest with graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, such as
securing a postdoctoral or faculty job, starting a laboratory, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.
 Taken together, NMAC aims to create conversations that will achieve a mechanistic and unifying
understanding of the neural underpinnings of acoustic communication by uncovering broadly relevant
algorithms. These exchanges will advance acoustic communication research by encouraging new ideas and
collaborations, highlighting diversity in the field, and inspiring the next generation of scientists to accelerate the
pace of discovery and translation to the clinic, consistent with the mission of NIH."
10906111,"The overarching goal of the Resource Core is to make high quality data and expertise accessible to a broad
community of investigators interested in musculoskeletal research. To that end, we have two main aims: 1) to
provide access to data needed for musculoskeletal research, as well as the methodologic expertise and tools
to address the research questions at hand, and 2) to ensure that the data, services, and research products
maintained by the Resource Core are used by a broad range of investigators and the NIAMS research
community. The Resource Core supports access to a number of existing robust, ready-to-use musculoskeletal
research databases. It also will facilitate access to databases not specifically designed for musculoskeletal
research, to be harnessed for musculoskeletal research, such as MarketScan Claims data and Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid services data (CMS). These datasets provide a wide variety of data relevant to the
NIAMS mission of musculoskeletal research including imaging data, clinical data, and patient reported
outcomes. Further, the Resource Core will conduct analyses within the Center using these databases to
provide a pathway for CCCR investigators to conduct replication or external validation studies. The Resource
Core will actively promote the novel methodologic and biostatistical tools and “products” developed by the
Methodologic Core and Image Processing Group as well. The Resource Core will continue to (1) actively
engage researcher and clinician stakeholders to promote the use of data resources and services, and (2)
disseminate the research products developed by the Methodologic Core through channels that reach
researcher and clinician stakeholders. We will track the Core’s success using metrics that reflect the use of
Resource Core data, services, and research products, including the number of grants submitted and funded,
publications, and current projects. The Resource Core will also contribute to an Enrichment Program, led by
the Administrative Core, that includes Pilot and Feasibility awards for researchers likely to be NIAMS-funded in
the future, scientific webinars related to the Center’s resources and focus areas, and an annual Visiting
Scientist Program organized by the Methodologic Core."

Oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and HPV-associated papillomas and cancers continue to rise,
especially in people living with HIV (PLWH). Specifically, rates of HPV-associated oral and oropharyngeal
cancer are increasing at an alarming rate. Using large population-based longitudinal studies, our work
indicated an increased risk of oral lesions and head and neck cancers with not only HPV16, but unexpectedly
cutaneous beta and gamma HPVs as well. Studying risk factors, we identified an interaction between smoking
and HIV serostatus with increased prevalence of oral high-risk alpha and beta-HPV detection. In addition to
oral HPV, HIV affects the composition of the oral microbiome, which has also been associated with increased
susceptibility to oral HPV infection, persistence, and progression to HPV-driven cancer. Taken together, these
findings indicate a continuing public health concern of HPV-related oral diseases for PLWH. The proposed
study will leverage repeat oral saliva samples collected from N=2046 male and female PLWH, and N=1334
HIV[-] individuals enrolled in the MACS-WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCSS). Specifically, we will
investigate the associations between the oral microbiome and mycobiome and risk of acquisition and
persistence of high-risk alpha, beta, and gamma oral HPV. The scientific premise of the study is that
alterations in the oral microbiome / mycobiome resulting from HIV and smoking influence oral HPV natural
history. We will use novel sequencing methods developed by our team, including next generation sequencing
and metagenomics, to profile the HPV virome (alpha, beta, and gamma HPV), oral bacterial (16S rRNA) and
fungal communities (using a recently developed ITS1 assay with increased sensitivity for Candida developed in
the Burk lab), functional gene capacity (determined from shotgun metagenomic sequencing), and cytokine
profiles (derived from oral saliva protein analyses). Differences in the oral microbiome / mycobiome between
PLWH and HIV[-] individuals will be assessed, as well as markers of HIV disease and smoking, with respect to
oral HPV persistence. Taking advantage of serial samples collected in MWCCS participants, we will
characterize oral microbiome / mycobiome changes over time in response to CD4 count and HIV RNA level,
smoking, and the oral microbiome / mycobiome to address the following specific aims: 1) Determine the
combined effects of HIV and smoking on risk of oral HPV persistence; 2) Study the associations between the
oral microbiome / mycobiome and risk of oral HPV persistence; 3) Characterize the microbial function and oral
inflammation/immune pathways associated with risk of oral HPV persistence. We hypothesize that the oral
microbiome and mycobiome influenced by HIV and smoking exhibit significantly higher proportions of virulence
factors, which in turn dysregulate the oral barrier immunity and integrity, facilitating persistence of oral high-risk
HPV types associated with increased risks for oral and oropharyngeal cancer."
10902998,"Project Summary/Abstract
Nearly all US adolescents use social media (SM), and nearly half report almost constant use. Adolescence is
marked by emotional intensity, difficulties regulating emotions, and increased risk for psychopathologies like
depression. Despite this, due to mixed findings in the literature, little is known about the effects of SM use (SMU)
on healthy adolescent emotional development. One reason for inconclusive results could be failure to account
for different ways adolescents engage in SMU, which could lead to varied outcomes. Additionally, no studies
have examined SMU effects on emotion in both controlled lab settings and real-life contexts, nor have they
considered objective indicators like physiological reactivity. This lack of nuance hinders understanding of how
specific SMU activities impact adolescent emotions generally (when effects are experimentally manipulated) and
during daily life. The proposed investigation aims to untangle the positive and negative emotional effects of SMU
in adolescents using a multimethod approach. Specifically, it seeks to examine how distinct SMU types identified
in my prior research affect adolescents in the moment, how they are used for emotion regulation, and their
association with depressive symptoms. With funds from a parent grant, participants aged 13-17 (N=145) will be
recruited from the community. Participants will first undergo a lab-based SMU experiment, engaging in one of
four SMU types at a time: Belief- (e.g., sharing negative opinions), comparison- (e.g., body comparison), image
(e.g., monitoring ""likes""), and consumption-based (e.g., watching videos) SMU. Physiological indicators of
emotion will be recorded alongside self-report measures of emotion. These findings will provide insight into how
each SMU type makes adolescents feel, both objectively (physiological indicators of stress or regulation) and
subjectively. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) will be used in the week following the experiment, where
participants will report their emotions, extent of engagement in each SMU type, and to what extent they engaged
in each type to feel better or worse. This approach will elucidate how SMU types predict adolescent emotions
and are used to influence their emotions in daily life. Furthermore, self-report measures will be employed to
examine the association between weekly engagement in each SMU type and depressive symptoms, revealing
how habitual SMU affects adolescent emotional wellbeing. By taking a nuanced approach to measuring the
emotional effects of specific SMU types, this study holds promise to inform novel interventions that encourage
healthy adolescent SMU habits. The research aims to achieve several training goals, including expertise in
physiological assessment, honing EMA methodological and analytic skills, applying digital emotion regulation
theory in adolescents, and advancing knowledge in adolescent mental health. The training team assembled to
assist in achieving these goals has substantial expertise in emotion and mental health, EMA assessment,
adolescent emotional development, and physiological assessment. With their support, I will develop the skills
needed to foster my research program and career ambitions to become a NIH-funded academic researcher."

Babson Life Sciences Entrepreneurial Product Development Immersion for New
Technologies and Solutions (Babson L-SPRINT) Program
Commercialized innovations and new ventures that address certain conditions, including
ventures that address the causes, consequences, and treatment of substance use disorders
(SUDs) to improve individual and public health, are still underrepresented amongst recent
startups. Commercialization and technology-based start-ups can be challenging in an academic
environment due to varying reward structures, organizational structures and organizational
cultures. Many promising scientists are reluctant to pursue intellectual property (IP) protection
and investigate commercialization opportunities, even for unique research findings, due to a lack
of understanding of the mechanics towards productizing and commercialization.
To address these misperceptions and challenges while amplifying the potential impact that
academic scientists can make to address SUDs, the Babson Life Sciences Entrepreneurial
Product Development Immersion for New Technologies and Solutions (Babson L-SPRINT)
Program will reach scientists interested in product development and commercialization as well as
to train participants in entrepreneurial thinking that can also increase decision making, improve
their organizations and labs from within, especially since product development in the biomedical
industry is highly uncertain. The Babson L-SPRINT Program includes two aims:
Aim 1: Curriculum Development--The Babson L-SPRINT program will develop a specialized
curriculum highlighting Babson’s signature Entrepreneurial Thought & Action ® offering coupled
with customized healthcare and biomedical entrepreneurship content on addressing market
segmentation and uncertainty, commercializing emerging technologies, scaling for growth, and
biomedical community experiences. The program will use live cases, panels, and other
experiential learning techniques.
Aim 2: Courses for Skills Development--We will also develop a recruitment and outreach
strategy using an innovative omnichannel approach including direct marketing utilizing email,
relevant conferences, and via NIH NIDA newsletters and other media as available."
10874691,"Project Summary/Abstract
A central aspect of parasitic nematode success and prevalence is their ability to modify host biology, including
evade and/or subvert the host’s immune response. In some cases, humans can host thousands of nematode
parasites with little to no pathology, yet our understanding of this incredible evasion or suppression of the immune
system remains limited. Modulation of host biology and the pathology they cause is largely effected through the
release of proteins and small molecules that interact with host cells and tissues. There are hundreds of proteins
released in nematode spit during an infection and only a few have been studied in any detail. My lab is focused
on understanding host-parasite interactions, with an emphasis on elucidating the molecules that parasites
release into the host, characterizing their interaction with host signaling pathways to modulate host biology, and
learning from the evolution of the parasite arsenal how to manipulate the immune system. Over the next five
years my lab will identify key genetic pathways in lipid-mediated immune signaling and identify molecular host-
parasite interactions. Our specific focus will be to 1) establish experimental pipelines for identifying novel
parasite-derived proteins and small molecules that modulate host biology, 2) determine the effects of the
molecules we identify, beginning with members of the fatty acid- and retinol-binding (FAR) protein family, 3)
elucidate molecular interactions between parasite molecules and host pathways, and 4) characterize eicosanoid
signaling in Drosophila melanogaster, a genetic model of immunity. A major strategy of my lab's research is to
combine in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experimental approaches with an established infection model that leverages
our deep understanding of fruit fly biology and its powerful genetics, to reveal not only the binding targets of
parasite proteins and molecules in an active infection, but also to define their effect on infection outcomes. Our
overall goal is to understand how nematode parasites modify host biology in order to successfully infect them.
This includes parasites’ ability to evade and/or suppress host immunity, which is important to human health in at
least two ways. First, nematode infections continue to be a major source of global morbidity and mortality,
affecting more than 25% of the world’s population. Increasing drug resistance and recurring infections compound
this problem. And second, there is mounting evidence that the immunomodulatory effects of nematode infections
can dampen or even eliminate the pathologies that define autoimmune disorders such as Crohn’s disease,
inflammatory bowel disease, and Celiac disease. Understanding how nematodes suppress the immune system
will lead to new treatment and vaccination strategies against nematode infection, and may reveal new avenues
for treating autoimmune disorders. We will employ a powerful model system to probe immune modulation by
nematodes to identify specific secreted proteins and small molecules as well as the signaling pathways they
target to effectively manipulate host immunity."
10874692,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pain affects approximately two thirds of patients with advanced incurable cancers. Cognitive Behavioral
Therapy for pain (pain-CBT) is an effective treatment for chronic pain from cancer. Unfortunately, pain-CBT in
its traditional format (60-minute, in-person sessions) is often unrealistic for patients with advanced cancer.
Behavioral treatments require substantial adaptation to meet advanced cancer patients’ real-life needs, and
should ideally integrate with their pharmacotherapy (e.g. opioid) plans. Mobile health (mHealth) technology is a
promising strategy to deliver and ultimately disseminate brief pain-CBT interventions to cancer patients.
The goal of Dr. Azizoddin’s K08 proposal is to develop a novel mHealth application that integrates brief pain-
CBT into an existing mHealth application designed to optimize opioid management for patients with chronic
pain from advanced incurable cancers. Leveraging co-mentor’s app (R21-funded), Smartphone Technology to
Alleviate Malignant Pain (STAMP) is a patient-facing smartphone app that facilitates daily symptom and opioid
monitoring and delivers tailored pain education and advice. Following the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral
Intervention Development (Stage:1A&1B), Dr. Azizoddin will create STAMP+CBT, a novel intervention that
harmonizes psychological and medical support for advanced cancer pain. In AIM 1: the PI will develop and
refine STAMP+CBT by adapting pain-CBT for brief mHealth delivery through a series of iterative qualitative
interviews, and wireframe and user acceptability testing (AIM 1A). STAMP+CBT will be programmed and
tested in a small pre-pilot with the target population to inform app refinements (AIM 1B). In AIM 2: 60 patients
with chronic pain related to advanced cancer will be randomized to the app or usual care + digital cancer pain
education for 6 weeks. Feasibility of the study will be determined by examining recruitment/retention rates and
completion rates of app-delivered pain-CBT content. A subset of patients will complete qualitative debriefing
interviews to inform final app refinements. Measures will explore anticipated primary (pain interference) and
secondary pain outcomes to inform the design of a future (R01) efficacy trial of STAMP+CBT. Dr. Azizoddin’s
research activities will be mentored by an interdisciplinary team of expert investigators in pain psychology
(Robert Edwards, PhD), palliative care clinical trials (Andrea Enzinger, MD & James Tulsky, MD), cancer pain
(Christine Miaskowski, PhD), and mobile health (Michael Businelle, PhD & Daniel Gundersen, PhD). This K08
proposal will allow Dr. Azizoddin to acquire training in: 1) adapting psychological pain interventions for cancer
populations, 2) learning rigorous methods to develop/refine behavioral mHealth interventions, 3) conducting
randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions, and 4) conducting longitudinal analysis of momentary
pain/psychological mHealth data. This training program and structured mentorship under the guidance of
esteemed research faculty will provide Dr. Azizoddin with the support necessary to become a successful,
independent investigator, specializing in effective and scalable behavioral treatments to improve cancer pain."
10899535,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Nontyphoidal Salmonella infections are frequently associated with diarrhea in healthy people. Some
serovars such as Typhimurium are also common causes of bacteremia in HIV-infected people, and life-
threatening disseminated complications in immunocompromised individuals with defects in neutrophils,
macrophages or CD4 T cells. Sensor kinases and their cognate response regulators in two-component
systems orchestrate many virulence programs in Salmonella and many other pathogenic bacteria. In the
canonical activation of two-component systems, the sensor kinase is phosphorylated in response to cues
encountered during colonization and infection of the mammalian host. The transfer of the phosphoryl group
from the sensor kinase to the receiver domain of its cognate response regulator turns on virulence programs
essential for bacterial pathogenesis. We have made the unexpected discovery that two-component response
regulators are controlled by previously unknown allosteric interactions with thioredoxin. Our research has
shown that thioredoxin post-translationally controls several response regulators such as OmpR, PhoP and
SsrB, all of which govern key aspects of Salmonella pathogenesis. Strikingly, the post-translational control
exerted by thioredoxin on two-component signaling does not rely on the universally conserved thiol-disulfide
oxidoreductase enzymatic activity of this ancestral protein, but is contingent upon a hitherto uncharacterized
hydrophobic interfacial surface that has been preserved throughout the evolution of thioredoxin in bacteria,
archaea and eukaryotes. Our investigations indicate that most contributions of thioredoxin to Salmonella
pathogenesis are independent of its oxidoreductase activity but are carried out by this newly discovered
interfacial surface. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that thioredoxin leverages the binding
attributes of a conserved hydrophobic patch to establish protein-protein interactions with multiple response
regulators, thereby exerting broad post-translational control of two-component signaling. Specifically, we will
identify the interfacial residues that mediate oxidoreductase-independent functions of thioredoxin, and will
quantify the extent that the novel thioredoxin-binding face enables response regulators to activate Salmonella
virulence programs. Our research will elucidate previously unappreciated elements in the regulation of two-
component signaling, and will ascertain unprecedented, oxidoreductase-independent functions of thioredoxin.
The knowledge gained on the novel function of thioredoxin will not only shed light on key aspects of
Salmonella pathogenesis, but may ultimately broaden our understanding of a primordial function of
universally-expressed thioredoxin proteins. Our work will also provide far reaching insight into the regulation
of two-component systems, which represent a dominant signaling pathway in bacteria. Drugs that specifically
inhibit interactions between thioredoxin and response regulators may inform the rational development of the
next generation of antibiotics."
10899552,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Humans are not aware that their eyes are always in motion. Even when attending to a single point, ﬁxational
eye movements (FEM) continually shift the stimulus on the retina in ways that would be immediately visible had
the motion originated from objects in the scene rather than oculomotor activity. It is now clear that FEM are
vital for visual sensitivity, ﬁne pattern vision, and acuity. Furthermore, a considerable body of evidence, in part
from our NIH-funded research, indicates that this behavior embodies a sensorimotor strategy by which the visual
system processes spatial information in the temporal domain. While much has been learned about the monoc-
ular functions of FEM, little is known about their consequences for binocular vision. Ocular drifts—the incessant
inter-saccadic movements—differ considerably in the two eyes. How does the visual system combine continually
changing inputs from independently jittering eyes? Here we focus on FEM consequences for 3D spatial repre-
sentations, speciﬁcally their role in stereopsis (Aim 1), their decoding mechanisms (Aim 2), and their binocular
control (Aim 3). The research strategy consists of assessing FEM effects on the binocular visual input and ex-
amining the resulting implications for neural coding, perception, and control. Our driving hypothesis is that the
active space-time encoding strategy that emerged in the monocular processing of luminance also applies to pro-
cessing binocularly-derived features at later stages of the visual stream. Since this theory yields counter-intuitive
hypotheses, each aim builds on a supporting preparatory study that sets the stage for the proposed experiments.
Aim 1 builds on the surprising observation that stereopsis is impaired when ﬁxational disparity modulations are
selectively eliminated from the visual ﬂow, even in the presence of otherwise normal luminance modulations on
the retina. We will explore the causes for this impairment and elucidate FEM contributions. Aim 2 focuses on the
mechanisms by which the ﬁxational visual ﬂow is interpreted. Contrary to traditional assumptions, our prelimi-
nary evidence indicates that the visual system has access to extraretinal knowledge of ocular drift and uses it to
infer spatial relations at high spatiotemporal resolution. Aim 3 examines these ideas in the context of oculomotor
control. We provide the ﬁrst comprehensive high-resolution measurements of head-free binocular FEM in natural
real-world tasks and test the hypothesis that eye drifts are actively controlled to encode task-relevant features
(e.g., disparity, spatial contrast, etc.). The experiments rely on the combination of (a) binocular measurements
of human eye movements with unprecedented accuracy; and (b) highly ﬂexible, binocularly synchronized, gaze-
contingent control of retinal stimulation, an approach made possible by our recent instrumentation developments.
All experiments are theoretically grounded and all hypotheses supported by new preliminary data. They are, to
our knowledge, entirely novel, and conﬁrmation of any of them will have broad implications for understanding
the functional principles of the visual system, the computational mechanisms of perception, possible oculomotor
contributions to neuro-ophthalmologic disorders, and the development of rehabilitative strategies and prostheses."

The goal of the COllaboration for EQuity in Uterine Leiomyomas (COEQUaL) Project 3 is to develop
innovative technology to identify women with uterine fibroids early for intervention/prevention and to predict
the re-intervention rate after therapeutic options, while ensuring the implementation of such technology is
acceptable to women with UF. The specific aims of Project 3 are: 1) to develop, validate, and assess the
portability of EHR risk prediction models for incident symptomatic fibroids, 2) to characterize patients for whom
genetic information improves upon an EHR-based fibroid prediction risk model. 3) to identify factors associated
with hysterectomy and the effect of uterine-conserving therapies that allow for the prevention of hysterectomy.
Stakeholder input will be sought throughout the project to assess the acceptability of implementation of EHR-
based technology including genetic data and risk prediction models. Given the major health and healthcare
disparities seen in women with fibroids, and especially Black/African American women with fibroids, the
evaluation and decision-making for therapy should be standardized, equitable, and accessible to all women.
The findings of this COEQUaL project will change the clinical paradigm for clinical care by creating tools for
healthcare providers systems to empower personalized and evidence-based decision making for women with
fibroids."
10906084,"The mammalian genome folds into tens of thousands of long-range looping interactions. A
critical unknown is whether and how chromatin loops control gene expression, and a major
unresolved question is how the temporal progression of loops relates to transcription dynamics.
One major barrier to answering this question is that loops change on a range of timescales,
necessitating the use of tools and model systems amenable to tracking and engineering loops
longitudinally and in real time on both short and long timing. Here, we propose to develop and
apply new engineering and imaging tools to measure, induce, and perturb loops with precise
temporal control in three different biological systems spanning minutes, hours, and weeks. At
the shortest timescale (minutes, Aim 1), we will examine loop dynamics in human induced
pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons in response to electrical stimulation, revealing how
interaction frequency is functionally connected to transcriptional bursting of immediate early and
secondary response genes. On the timescale of hours (Aim 3), we will elucidate how the
architectural protein YY1 connects enhancer-promoter loops that re-assemble upon the exit
from mitosis by erythroid cells. On the timescale of weeks (Aim 2), we will use a cellular “Time
Machine” to longitudinally track the rare cells that undergo cellular reprogramming, allowing us
to dissect the functionality of loop formation and dissolution with single-cell and subcellular
resolution during the reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency and transition of melanoma
cancer cells to a resistant phenotype. Our team consists of a highly productive and collaborative
set of junior and senior investigators with complementary expertise and overlapping interests,
including Dr. Gerd Blobel (epigenetics, mitosis, loop engineering), Dr. Eric Joyce (Oligopaints
imaging), Dr. Bomyi Lim (nascent transcript live cell imaging), Dr. Jennifer Phillips-Cremins
(chromatin architecture, loop engineering, neurobiology), Dr. Stanley Qi (CRISPR genome
engineering, live cell imaging), and Dr. Arjun Raj (single cell genomics, RNA imaging,
reprogramming). We will develop and apply live and fixed cell imaging techniques for chromatin
contacts, and in the same cells image nascent transcription. We will build a cadre of synthetic
architectural proteins to engineer loops in a time-dependent inducible manner. Successful
application of our engineering and imaging tools across biological systems will yield a
comprehensive and rigorous assessment of the cause-and-effect relationship between loops
and distinct biological phenotypes across timescales."

Autoimmune diseases are complex diseases arising from both genetic and environmental factors. The
pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes (T1D) is not mediated by a single cell type of the
immune system. The role of noncoding variants in these diseases are largely understudied, but suggest that
changes in three-dimensional chromatin architecture could be altered. Early work largely focused on the role of
CD4+T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells, followed by T regulatory cells (Tregs). More recently, T
memory stem cells (Tscm) were identified and their role in autoimmunity is just beginning to be investigated.
These cells possess stem-like properties of self-renewal and differentiation. Unlike memory cells (Tmem),
these cells are long-lived, providing a source of prolonged immune memory. Because of their stem cell state
and ability to provide long-term memory, these cells have important implications for autoimmunity, cancer
immunity and immune therapies, and reconstitution of the immune system. In the context of autoimmunity that
means these cells also provide a reservoir of autoreactive and inflammatory cells that can continue disrupt
immune function and contribute to chronic disease. Our own data indicate that these cells are enriched in T1D
donors compared to healthy control subjects, which may be associated with disease risk alleles. The overall
goal of this proposal is to identify two- and three-dimensional chromatin architecture changes that distinguish
CD4+ Tscm cells from their naïve progenitor and derived cell fates and determine how changes specific T1D
contribute to disease pathogenesis by profiling pure populations of cell from healthy control and T1D subjects.
We will determine if T1D-associated change are prevalent in other autoimmune diseases by also profiling
Tscms from RA donors. We will determine what role noncoding disease-associated variants at cis-regulatory
elements (CREs) might play in this process. We proposed to integrate 2D and 3D chromatin architecture
across a large cohort to precisely determine target genes and mechanisms of cell- and disease-specific gene
regulation. Specifically, we will identify cell-type specific chromatin architecture in pure populations of CD4+
subtypes related to stem cell memory by employing capture HiC to map regulatory loops across three key cell
types in a cohort of 50 healthy control subjects. To determine if these regulatory loops are altered in a
diseased state, we will identify T1D-specific chromatin architecture to determine the role of Tscm cells in
prolonged inflammation and autoreactivity. Lastly, we will identify chromatin architecture changes common in
autoimmune Tscm cells by profiling an addition 50 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis. The proposed study will
use innovative approaches to conduct large-scale assessment of 2D and 3D genome architecture to determine
cell- and disease-specific gene regulatory mechanisms using a well-defined human cohort. The proposed
study will advance our understanding of the role of memory stem cells in autoimmunity and the effects of
noncoding variants on chromatin architecture in a disease-specific manner."

Stigma is a main driver of HIV disparities among Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM), negatively affecting
non-injection substance use (e.g. methamphetamine) and PrEP uptake. Addressing factors that influence PrEP
cascade progression, such as intersectional stigma and methamphetamine use, are essential to ending the HIV
epidemic. Intersectional stigma is a complex social phenomenon experienced across various stigma sources
(i.e. family, friends, others), mechanisms (i.e. anticipated, enacted), and types (i.e. race/ethnicity, sexuality,
masculinity), which intersect to produce and exacerbate deleterious health outcomes among LMSM. Social
network analysis techniques can be leveraged to examine how LMSM interact with and are affected by network
members and inform targets for meaningful interventions focused on which network members (1) stigmatize
LMSM and (2) provide social support to buffer against the effects of intersectional stigma on methamphetamine
use risk and PrEP cascade progression.
This K01 will provide the candidate, Dr. Algarin, with skills to conduct complex longitudinal multi-level structural
equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects between intersectional stigma and
methamphetamine use risk and PrEP cascade progression through coping, resistance, and resilience (AIM 1)
and how sources of social network intersectional stigma moderate these pathways (AIM 2) leveraging data from
500 LMSM enrolled in NEXUS: a novel social network approach to study the effects of intersectional stigma on
HIV prevention among Latino MSM (NEXUS; R01MH123282; PI: Smith). Using a community-engaged
approach, Dr. Algarin will draw from these analyses to adapt a multi-level intervention to address intersectional
stigma through coping, resistance, and resilience to decrease methamphetamine use risk and improve PrEP
cascade progression (AIM 3).
As an emerging gay Latino scholar, Dr. Algarin will leverage the UCSD training infrastructure to build his
professional independence and skills to promote HIV prevention interventions in medically marginalized groups,
positioning him as the next generation of under-represented minority scholars to end the HIV epidemic among
MSM of color disproportionately burdened by HIV in the US. Specifically, Dr. Algarin seeks training to advance
his statistical capacities (T1), gain proficiency multi-level intervention theories and concepts (T2) and multi-level
intervention development and adaptation (T3), gain additional training in the ethical conduct of research (T4),
and build skills for his professional development (T5). This K01 will provide Dr. Algarin with the necessary training
and data to forge his research independence and produce a competitive future R34 to test the community-
engaged, multi-level intervention he adapts as part of this study."

10902778,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Excess body weight is a significant contributor to mortality rates in the United States,
with class 2+ obesity increasing the risk of mortality by up to 91%. Physical activity plays
a crucial role in managing prevalent diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease. Recently, exercise-stimulated myokines have been found to
play a crucial role in inter-tissue signaling, promoting metabolic health and
cardioprotection. However, the mechanism by which myokine expression is activated is
poorly understood. Furthermore, therapeutically effective myokines are yet to be
identified. Mitochondrial Precursor Overaccumulation Stress (mPOS) is a novel
mediator of mitochondria-induced stress signaling, triggered by mitochondrial protein
import stress and the accumulation of unimported mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol.
In our preliminary study, we found the drastic activation of candidate myokines in a
newly established mouse model of mPOS. This is accompanied with a strong lean
phenotype and increased cardiac ejection fraction. These observations invited the
hypothesis that mPOS may mediate myokine signaling, which ultimately promotes
metabolic and cardiac health. In this predoctoral fellowship application, we will test the
hypothesis that mitochondrial protein import stress can specifically induce myokine
signaling by specific transcriptional factors in a bioenergetic-independent manner
(Specific Aim 1). We will also test the hypothesis that mPOS-induced myokine release
mediates fat loss and the improvement of cardiac health during aging (Specific Aim 2).
Success of the proposed research represents a significant advancement in
understanding mitochondria-induced myokine signaling and its potential implications for
metabolic and cardiovascular health. Utilizing the murine and cell-based models, this
study will uncover the mechanisms underlying myokine signaling and its impact on inter-
tissue communication. These findings may lead to the discovery of novel health-
promoting myokines and identification of therapeutic targets for metabolic and
cardiovascular diseases, offering potential interventions to improve overall health,
especially for aging populations and individuals unable to engage in physical exercise."
10903473,"RESEARCH SUMMARY
Respiratory infections, including those caused by influenza A virus (IAV), significantly contribute to worldwide
mortality and morbidity. Vulnerable populations, such as individuals with obesity, have been found to have
increased susceptibility to respiratory infections. The prevalence of obesity, defined as a Body Mass Index
(BMI) greater than 30, has been steadily increasing over the past decades. Obesity is known to be associated
with elevated inflammation and dysregulated immunity, but the specific mechanisms through which innate
immunity contributes to the increased risk of infection remain unknown. Natural killer (NK) cells are critical to
the innate immune response against viral infections, including IAV. NK cells play a crucial role in early viral
clearance by detecting and eliminating viral-infected respiratory epithelial cells (RECs) and producing antiviral
IFN-γ cytokines. Previous studies have shown that obesity can interfere with NK cell function in the context of
cancer and other diseases. However, the impact of obesity on NK cell antiviral responses, particularly during
IAV infection, remains to be investigated. Based on the existing knowledge gaps, I hypothesize that NK cells
from obese individuals exhibit blunted function during IAV infection, leading to a disruption in NK cell-epithelial
cell crosstalk. This disruption may contribute to increased susceptibility and severity of infection in obese
individuals. The primary objective of this research is to identify the specific contribution of NK cells to the
increased susceptibility and disease severity observed in obesity. Specific Aim 1 will assess the impact of
obesity on NK cell populations and function in response to IAV infection in both systemic and mucosal
compartments. This will be achieved by comprehensively analyzing NK cell phenotypic and functional
characteristics using advanced flow cytometry and transcriptomic profiling of nasal wash samples. Specific
Aim 2 will investigate the crosstalk between NK cells and RECs during IAV infection in the context of obesity.
The goal is to determine if NK cell dysfunction and epithelial cell susceptibility to infection contribute to
increased viral replication and decreased NK cell cytotoxicity. Additionally, the potential therapeutic effect of
metformin, a drug commonly used for diabetes and weight loss, on reversing the impairment of NK-epithelial
cell crosstalk in obesity will be evaluated. By employing a multidisciplinary approach involving advanced
techniques such as RNA transcriptomics, complex flow cytometry, and primary cell coculture systems, I will
enhance my understanding of NK cell antiviral responses in the context of obesity. The findings from these
studies will contribute to our understanding of how obesity affects innate immune responses in high-risk
populations and their susceptibility to respiratory infections. The collaborative environment and resources at St.
Jude provide an ideal setting for conducting this research and facilitating the researcher's career development
in mucosal immunity."
10903539,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The cardiovascular system is an essential organ key for development. This highly efficient network of
vasculature structures constantly undergoes expansion and trimming to maintain vessel homeostasis.
Angiogenesis – the budding of new vasculature structures from preexisting vessel systems, is one of the
primary processes contributing to network expansion. Multiple cellular receptors function together to ensure
successful proliferation and motility of endothelial cells for angiogenesis. One of these receptors is Tie2, a
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expressed exclusively on the endothelial cell surface. Tie2's primary role, upon
binding to angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), is to initiate and maintain tight cell-cell junctions across the endothelial
monolayer. Like other RTKs, Tie2's proposed activation pathway involves the dimerization of the receptors to
propagate a signal across the cell membrane to phosphorylate downstream targets. While the role of Tie2 in
angiogenesis is clear, little is known about the structural changes that Tie2 undergoes that allow for
dimerization. The Ang-1 binding site is distant from the proposed dimerization site. Therefore, information must
travel across multiple domains, and there is currently no mechanism for this transduction. In addition, our
understanding of cell signaling pathways has been described as most straightforward possible, often rendering
them as exclusively linear with a single ligand and receptor. However, within the cellular context, proteins and
ligands are constantly engaging with other signaling pathways in addition to their own. Integrins, a membrane
receptor that has a role in cellular adhesion and motility, have been observed to engage with Tie2 on the
cellular level. But the molecular details remain elusive. Therefore, a structural investigation into Tie2's
activation and modulation with angiopoietin and integrin would contribute to a more complete picture of Tie2
biology. To this end, I will combine cutting-edge structural biology techniques with traditional cellular biology to
dissect these structural changes in Tie2. My goals are to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Tie2
dimerization and the receptor cross-talk that occurs with integrin α5β1. I have designed experiments with
two specific aims to understand how Tie2 is structurally impacted by angiopoietin-1 and integrin α5β1. Aim 1
will examine and describe the impact of Ang-1 binding on the full-length Tie2 receptor using cryogenic electron
microscopy (cryoEM) and cell-based assays. The results from this aim will push the limits of our understanding
of Tie2's structural architecture and ligand-induced dimerization of RTKs. Aim 2 will determine the structural
role of integrin α5β1 in modulating Tie2's signaling axis. I will use a combination of cryoEM and Förster
resonance energy transfer to identify the key residues of this receptor-crosstalk. Results from this aim will shed
light on the functional importance of receptor cross-talk and how structures of the receptors can influence
communication across signaling pathways. By studying Tie2, we can better understand its structure and
potentially develop new therapies targeting this receptor."
10902514,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The increasing number of young women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer has awakened the urgency to
define why they are more likely to suffer from aggressive breast cancers and have an increased risk of developing
life-threatening brain metastasis (BM). While this has been explained by the increased frequency of aggressive
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in younger women, young age is a predictor of BM risk independent of
tumor subtypes. Evidence has emerged from our lab that the main pre-menopausal hormone, estradiol (E2), is
a key driver of BM via influencing E2-sensitive cells in the brain niche; and that endocrine therapies targeting the
ER+ tumor microenvironment decrease progression of outgrowing BM only when used in combination with
radiotherapy (RT) and in immunocompetent models. The scientific premise of this proposal is that E2 that
endocrine therapies synergize with RT to promote effective anti-tumoral immune responses. Our long-term goal
is to define how endocrine therapies and RT synergize to decrease BM to guide the translation of FDA-approved
endocrine therapies to the management of TNBC BM. Our pilot data shows that endocrine therapy upregulates
IRF-
increases recruitment of cells to the brain. Th
upregulate IRF-
brain RT increases cancer-cell antigen presentation synergizing with endocrine therapy to decrease BMs (Aim
1). Our preliminary data also shows that E2 acting on ER+ astrocytes promotes upregulation of S100A4 in cancer
cells, and this was blocked by endocrine therapy. While S100A4 is an extracellularly released factor that
modulate myeloid cells to acquire pro-tumorigenic properties, increased expression of S100A4 has been
associated with intracraneal progression and radioresistance, and high expression of S100A4 predicts
radioresistance of BC cells in vitro. Thus, we propose that endocrine therapies will increase radiosensitivity of
BM through blockage of E2-induced S100A4 (Aim 2). Importantly, defining how different endocrine therapies
(selective-estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), selective ER degraders (SERDs) and clinically relevant RT
schedules impact anti-tumoral response and radioresistance is needed to guide future clinical trials (Aim 3). Our
central hypothesis is that endocrine therapies and RT synergize by 1) upregulating IRF-
astrocytes and microglia to block microglia activation and promote recruitment of T cells to the brain; and 2) by
blocking S100A4 upregulation in cancer cells thus promoting radiosensitivity. Therefore, the combination of
endocrine therapies with RT is essential to eliminate BMs. These studies are significant as they provide a
mechanistic explanation for the increased risk of BM in young women with potential to change clinical practice.
Our studies are innovative as they challenge the current dogma of how E2 contributes to tumor metastases and
utilize novel transgenic models to assess the role of E2 and ERs in immune modulation in the brain."

In the United States, about 90% of those living with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are women and rates
of SLE are 2-4 times higher among Black individuals relative to the general population. Additionally, Black women
bear a substantial burden of disease through inequities in outcomes such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), a
significant comorbidity of interest in SLE. Behavioral mechanisms underlying these inequities are underexplored,
particularly in the specific socio-cultural context of Black women. To address these gaps, the trainee (Mr. Leung)
will leverage previously collected data from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort to explicate
multi-level mechanisms underlying CVD inequities among Black women living with SLE through behavioral
pathways (coping behaviors, self-efficacy) and investigate the modifying role of area-level context on these
behavioral pathways. This proposal hinges on the Superwoman Schema (SWS), a multi-dimensional instrument
that captures particular ways in which Black women report and experience stress. The specific aims of the
study are to (1) quantitatively examine the relationship of SWS endorsement with self-efficacy, hypertension,
and angina mediated by coping behaviors among Black or African American women in GOAL and (2) assess
the impact of social and economic environments on cardiovascular risk among Black women with SLE in the
GOAL cohort in the context of individual-level superwoman schema. The expected outcome will be an actionable
understanding of sources of individual and neighborhood contextual determinants of macro-social processes
and role in widely known SLE health inequities. This knowledge can inform development of chronic disease
management interventions aimed at increasing resilience to disease related stressors among Black women with
SLE. Additionally, this work will support the training of Mr. Leung who is committed to becoming a NIH-funded
independent investigator focused on health equity, social determinants of health, and chronic disease
management. Mr. Leung’s three-year training plan includes: (1) strengthen content expertise with regard to
intersectionality and approaches of applying intersectionality in quantitative methods through the lens of
Superwoman Schema (SWS), (2) increase capacity in advanced quantitative methods in behavioral sciences
with an emphasis on longitudinal data analysis, multi-level modeling, structural equation modeling, and
psychometrics and (3) develop an understanding of the range of geospatial analysis and linkages between
macro-level data linkages. The team of mentors, Dr. Escoffery (primary co-sponsor), Dr. Lim (primary co-
sponsor), Dr. Lewis (co-sponsor), and Dr. Haardörfer (collaborator) will provide oversight, guidance, and
mentorship throughout the fellowship period across the topics of chronic disease self-management, SLE,
psychosocial stressors, and advanced quantitative methods for behavioral sciences. Mr. Leung will leverage
resources within the doctoral program, Rollins School of Public Health, and Emory University. The candidate,
mentorship team, and the environment are well suited to achieve the proposed research and training aims."

Both currently expressed transcription factors and inherited epigenetic states contribute to cell identity.
However, the causal relationships between transcription factor action and changes in strongly acting chromatin
states remain a central question in genomics of development. Despite much correlative data, it is poorly
understood how to predict at what sites a chromatin state will prohibit transcription factor action, and under
what conditions a transcription factor’s action will alter chromatin states, either transiently or long-term.
This proposal takes advantage of Runx family transcription factors as illuminating tools to probe the rules
underlying this relationship. The early stages of T cell development can be a particularly useful framework to
do this. Runx family factors, especially Runx1 and Runx3, are vital for T cell development from the initiation of
the T-lineage gene expression program. The proposed work is based on our recent evidence that despite
nearly constant sustained levels of Runx activity across several stages of early T-cell development, the
deployment of Runx factors to specific targets changes sharply at the specific transition of T cell development
when the cells undergo lineage commitment. Either chromatin changes or changing partner factors could be
responsible. Our latest results also indicate that Runx protein expression levels play a strong role in the timing
of entry into the T-cell program, as higher levels promote access to key genomic sites prematurely, raising the
hypothesis that Runx binding biophysics play a role in developmental timing. At some Runx-activated loci the
appearance of new Runx binding sites is linked with major transformations in chromatin 3D interaction patterns
of chromatin. The early T-cell development system is highly accessible through in vitro differentiation systems,
well characterized as matched to in vivo development, and there is a rich body of data about the programmed
expression and deployment of other transcription factors that may be potential Runx interaction partners,
making this an ideal system to dissect cause-effect relationships between Runx factors and the epigenome.
We propose to discover the rules through which Runx factors choose stage-specific target sites, by comparing
Runx actions in cells as they go through successive transitions of early T cell development. In the first aim, we
will develop a fine-scale, genome-wide temporal atlas for the binding of Runx factors relative to epigenetic
states, both under normal conditions and under conditions when Runx levels are experimentally raised or
lowered. This will characterize the epigenetic conditions that are most restrictive for Runx action and the
conditions under which Runx can alter them. In the second aim, we will define the reciprocal impacts of Runx
and transcription factors representing its candidate stage-specific interaction partners, examining how each
affects the binding of the other and how different partners may compete for limited Runx. The third aim will
focus on experimentally dissecting cis-elements needed for Runx control of Bcl11b and Ets1, where
developmental regulation reflects large-scale chromatin as well as local factor binding changes."

High doses of intensive rehabilitation therapy improve functional outcomes after stroke, but most patients do not receive this, for reasons that include limited access, difficulty traveling, and low motivation. Telehealth can address these obstacles. A recent StrokeNet trial found that a 6-week course of intensive home-based daily arm motor telerehabilitation significantly improved arm function as well as global function in patients averaging 4 months post-stroke, with efficacy comparable to dose-matched therapy delivered in-clinic. A definitive trial that compares telerehabilitation with usual and customary care is now needed.  This issue will be addressed in the “Telerehabilitation In The Home After Stroke: A Randomized, Controlled, Assessor-Blind Clinical Trial (The TR-2 Trial),” a controlled, assessor-blind, randomized, phase III superiority trial that will recruit 202 patients with substantial arm motor deficits 4 months after stroke onset and randomize them to [1] a 6-week course of intensive daily arm motor rehabilitation therapy or [2] usual care.  Aim 1 of the TR-2 Trial hypothesizes that adding a 6-week course of intensive arm motor telerehabilitation to usual care results in superior functional outcomes compared to usual care alone. The primary outcome measures arm function (Action Research Arm Test); the secondary outcome measures global function (modified Rankin Scale). Aim 2 will examine the predictive power of an imaging biomarker. Selecting the right patients is challenging in stroke clinical practice and trials due to the enormous heterogeneity of this disease. Clinical measures incompletely predict therapy gains, but studies from many labs have found that the extent of injury to the corticospinal tract predicts arm motor gains after stroke. The biological model underlying intensive arm motor telerehabilitation is that therapy activates multiple brain motor circuits, with the corticospinal tract being the final efferent pathway by which treatment gains are expressed, and so an intact corticospinal tract is needed to benefit from therapy. The specific hypothesis is that any benefit of telerehabilitation over usual care is a function of the extent to which the corticospinal tract is preserved. Aim 3 will evaluate the health economic impacts of the two treatment groups, with a focus on patient health-related quality of life, as the effects of telerehabilitation therapy must be considered in the broader context of healthcare utilization.  Stroke remains a major cause of disability, and motor deficits are a major contributor. Rehabilitation therapy after stroke is generally provided at a very low dose, can be hard to access, and is often not very motivating. Our telerehabilitation program overcomes these barriers, was efficacious in phase I and phase II multisite trials, and will now be examined in comparison to usual care. The TR-2 trial is expected to generate definitive evidence that rehab therapy helps post-stroke at a time when many medical systems stop providing rehab care and so stands to change clinical practice worldwide."
10904033,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Opportunistic human fungal pathogens cause serious diseases. As resistance to the current arsenal of antifun-
gals increases, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutics. The goals of this application are to elucidate
how EntV, a peptide secreted by Enterococcus faecalis that shows promising efficacy in several animal models,
inhibits fungal pathogenicity and to develop derivatives with improved stability and activity. The central hypothe-
sis is that the hydrophobic nature of one alpha helix of EntV enables binding to a target associated with fungal
extracellular vesicles (EVs), interfering with the export of material associated with virulence. The rationale for
this research is that identification of the mechanism by which EntV inhibits the virulence of fungal pathogens will
lead to new treatment strategies, which are desperately needed. Aim #1 is to identify the characteristics of EntV
associated with antifungal activity. Based on recently published data showing that the seventh helix of EntV is
the source of antifungal efficacy, it is hypothesized that the hydrophobic nature of this helix is important, and that
antifungal efficacy can be improved by changes that increase hydrophobicity and stability. In this aim, a7 will be
modified using both random and rational design strategies and tested for antifungal efficacy, initially in biofilm
and C. elegans infection models. Promising candidates will be further tested in murine oropharyngeal candidiasis
(OPC), murine systemic bloodstream candidiasis, and rat venous catheter infection models. Aim #2 will elucidate
the mechanism(s) by which EntV inhibits fungal pathogenesis. Based on preliminary data showing EntV binding
to EVs, the working hypothesis for this aim is that EntV disrupts/interferes with the transport of material that
promotes fungal virulence. Goals for this aim include characterizing EntV-induced changes in EV number, dis-
tribution, and components, identifying the cell envelope component(s) to which EntV binds, and identifying and
characterizing strains and mutants that are no longer susceptible to EntV. Because of the serious and growing
morbidity, mortality and antimicrobial resistance associated with fungal infections, the investigation will signifi-
cantly and positively contribute to human health by providing new avenues for anti-fungal development. Addi-
tionally, the study will broadly impact knowledge in the fields of antimicrobial peptides, fungal pathogenesis, EVs,
and interkingdom microbial interactions. Finally, an antimicrobial mechanism of action that targets EVs and re-
sults in loss of virulence represents a conceptual innovation."
10898496,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a signaling molecule that regulates energy metabolism and influences a range of
physiological processes in the cardiovascular, central nervous and gastrointestinal systems. Low H2S stimulates
respiration as a substrate for the electron transport chain (ETC), supplying electrons at the level of coenzyme Q
via sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR). High H2S inhibits respiration by targeting the copper and heme a3
sites in complex IV in the ETC. While complex IV inhibition has been studied in vitro, the mechanism of its long-
term inhibition and metabolic consequences in vivo are unknown. Sustained inhibition of complex IV is especially
relevant in intestinal epithelial cells, which are routinely exposed to high H2S (0.2-2.4 mM) derived from gut
microbial metabolism. Preliminary data from our laboratory indicate that chronic sulfide exposure elicits profound
changes in copper metabolism in colon adenocarcinoma cells, modulates expression of copper-binding proteins,
and increases whole cell and mitochondrial copper concentrations. Furthermore, chronic sulfide exposure leads
to a marked reduction in the copper-containing complex IV subunits, MT-CO1 and MT-CO2, but does not affect
cell viability. These studies reveal a previously unknown intersection between sulfide and copper homeostasis
and inform the hypothesis that sulfide leaches copper from complex IV subunits, destabilizes MT-CO1 and MT-
CO2, and triggers reorganization of subcellular copper stores, leading to long-term inhibition of respiration and
metabolic reprogramming. I will test this hypothesis by addressing the following specific aims: (i) I will
characterize sulfide-responsive copper metabolism across a range of primary and transformed cell lines
cultivated in a growth chamber with 25-500 ppm H2S in the atmosphere and measure whole cell and organellar
copper levels as well as complex IV protein levels. I will monitor copper distribution via X-ray fluorescence
microscopy and localize copper transporters by immunofluorescence microscopy, respectively. I will assess how
sulfide clearance influences copper metabolism in SQOR-deficient intestinal cells as well as in colon derived
from Villin-Cre SQORfl/fl mice. (ii) I will evaluate whether complex IV poses a unique vulnerability among
cuproenzymes to chronic sulfide exposure by determining whether protein levels and activities of other
cuproenzymes (e.g., superoxide dismutase and lysyl oxidase) are impacted by sulfide exposure in cell lines and
in intestinal tissue from Villin-Cre SQORfl/fl mice. I will compare the effects of sulfide with other ETC inhibitors
(e.g., cyanide and antimycin A). Finally, copper oxidation and sulfur coordination states will be analyzed by X-
ray absorption spectrometry, to determine whether insoluble copper sulfide is formed upon chronic sulfide
exposure. The successful completion of these aims will provide fundamentally new insights into the regulation
of energy metabolism via sulfide-mediated changes in copper metabolism and simultaneously provide me with
critical research training and career development opportunities."

Lung transplantation aims to extend survival, relieve disability, and improve health-related quality of life (HRQL).
Although many do well, perioperative complications have increased, one third of patients die within the first three
post-transplant years and 20-40% of survivors do not report improvements in patient-reported outcomes (PROs)
such as functioning and HRQL. Reasons for this lack of improvement are generally unknown. As a result, RFA-
022-002 highlights body composition and PROs as key priority areas for further investigation and intervention.
In earlier work using BMI, CT scans, and DXA, our group showed that obesity and sarcopenia are prevalent in lung
transplant candidates and are risk factors for frailty, primary graft dysfunction (PGD), and mortality. We also
highlighted, the challenges to more widely implementing these modalities and introduced bioelectrical impedance
(BIA) as a method of advanced body composition quantification that overcomes these challenges. We
demonstrated that obesity and sarcopenia by BIA are risk factors for PGD, and wait-list death. Our preliminary
data suggests that sarcopenic obesity may be a novel phenotype at heightened risk for perioperative
complications. After transplant, PGD and other perioperative complications contribute to disability, poor HRQL,
and death after transplant. Despite the clinical primacy of PROs, the only empirical data on the impact of
perioperative complications on PROs comes from our single-center work. Data on which PROs are responsive to
perioperative complications is lacking, hindering informed selection of PROs for use in future research. Finally,
defining the factors and events from before through early after transplant that impact PROs can identify and
prioritize targets for intervention and improve clinical trial efficiency through prognostic enrichment. To address
these problems, we will enroll 803 lung transplant candidates and, in Aim 1, will define the impact of sarcopenic
obesity, sarcopenia, and adiposity on peri-operative and PROs at 6-months. We hypothesize that sarcopenic
obesity will confer heightened risk for perioperative complications, including PGD, even in patients with normal
BMI. In Aim 2, we will define the responsiveness of PRO measures to PGD and other perioperative
complications. Aim 2 will provide the foundational empirical data needed to inform appropriate PRO selection for
future observational and interventional studies. Aim 3, will develop landmark prediction models accounting for
pre-, peri- and early post-operative factors to identify groups with worse post-operative PROs at 6-months and time
to graft failure up to 3-years after transplant. Developing new modeling of peri- and early post-operative outcomes
to predict which individuals are at risk for poor outcomes will inform the prognostic enrichment strategies needed
to improve clinical trial efficiency in lung transplant. In sum, we address key priorities in RFA HL-22-022 by
examining body composition in an innovative and scalable manner; identifying high yield PROs for future studies
and generating foundational knowledge to inform future studies and trials in lung transplantation."

Advances in single cell assays have enabled the genome-wide measurement of DNA sequence, RNA
expression, chromatin accessibility and protein abundance for tens-of-thousands of cells isolated from
a single tissue sample. Methods that capture or infer spatial or temporal information provide additional
contextual information to create a detailed, cell-level picture of gene activity and function. These meth-
ods give researchers a powerful tool for identifying the cell types in the analyzed tissue, the phenotype
of those cells and the network of cell-cell interactions that control tissue structure and function. Although
these techniques have revolutionized the study of complex tissues, the significant sparsity and noise
of single cell measurements means that statistical analysis is typically performed at the level of large
groups or clusters of cells. Although a cluster-based analysis can mitigate sparsity and noise, the re-
sults reflect the state of the average cell in the cluster, which may be quite dissimilar from many cells
in heterogeneous populations. To fully realize the potential of single cell profiling, bioinformatics meth-
ods are needed that can accurately characterize individual cells rather than cell groups. One promising
approach for generating cell-level estimates is gene set testing or pathway analysis, which can more
effectively capture the state of individual cells by combining the measurements for all genes in a biolog-
ical pathway. Unfortunately, statistical and biological differences between single cell and bulk genomic
data make it challenging to use existing gene set testing methods, that were developed for bulk tissue,
on single cell data. To address this limitation, we will create innovative algorithms for cell-level gene set
testing and will use these techniques to support the estimation of cell type, phenotype and interaction
potential. The translational application of these methods to study immune cell signaling within the tu-
mor microenvironment will help validate our approach and provide important insights into the immune
response to cancer."
10899829,"Buffalo, New York, the second largest city in New York State (population 278,349), has a diverse population,
including 37% African American and 14% Latinx. One of the most pressing problems in metropolitan Buffalo is
race-based health inequities, a condition shared with many American metropolitan areas. The life expectancy of
African American residents of Buffalo is 10 to 12 years shorter compared to White residents of Buffalo. African
Americans are 300% more likely to have chronic, often preventable, diseases than Whites who live in Buffalo. In
response to this crisis, in 2014, a group of visionary community leaders created the African American Health
Equity Task Force, which includes leaders and stakeholders from multiple sectors of the Buffalo community,
including faith leaders, community non-profits, healthcare providers, payers, University at Buffalo (UB) faculty
and more. The Task Force has met monthly since 2015 and led to the formation of three new organizations,
including the UB Community Health Equity Research Institute (2019), the community-based Buffalo Center for
Health Equity (2019) and the Erie County Office of Health Equity (2021). Leaders of these three organizations
continue to meet monthly as part of the Task Force. This community-university-government partnership has
enormous reach and influence throughout the community, positioning us to disseminate research findings and
work with policy makers and community stakeholders to promote sustainable community- and system-level
change. The mission of our NIMHD Center of Excellence in Investigator Development and Community
Engagement is to train and develop the next generation of health disparities investigators to perform
innovative research in minority health and health disparities in partnership with our community and to
the benefit of the community. The Center of Excellence will be embedded in the UB Community Health Equity
Research Institute, which includes faculty from all 12 UB schools, creating a transdisciplinary framework that
cuts across scientific and organizational silos to integrate disciplines to address the full range of social
determinants of health and to mentor early-career investigators in research in health disparities. Our Center of
Excellence will inspire, train, and mentor a new generation of scientists from diverse backgrounds and disciplines
to perform innovative research in health disparities and advance their careers (Aim 1). We will nurture our
enduring community-university partnerships to perform transdisciplinary research to develop and test innovative
solutions to end race-based health inequities in Buffalo (Aim 2). Finally, we will advance equitable collaborations
with community partners to translate our research into sustainable, community and system-level changes toward
eliminating race-based health inequities in Buffalo (Aim 3). Our enduring community-university-government

Increases in life expectancy together with demographic trends have fueled a rapid increase in America’s
elderly population. As the number of older Americans has grown, so has the prevalence of aging-associated
diseases, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and other related dementias (ADRD). An estimated 5.4 Million
Americans had AD in 2012, and that number is expected to double by 2030. It is estimated that most of these
patients (70%) live at home where they receive 75% of their care from informal caregivers who are unpaid
individuals such as family members, friends, and neighbors. The natural progression of the disease and its
burdensome behaviors cause significant stress for caregivers who frequently have close relationships to the
patient. Among caregivers of dementia patients, wandering behavior is one of the most stress-provoking
symptoms. Wandering is a common symptom that encompasses various walking behaviors that can result in
the patient becoming lost or disoriented leading to the risk of serious injury or death for the patient and stress
and reduced independence for the caregiver. Family caregivers often cannot leave patients home alone, and
instead must bring them on errands to large and complex indoor environments which present additional risk for
an AD patient to wander. Koronis Biomedical Technologies will develop a tracking solution that will give peace
of mind to caregivers in both stationary and mobile scenarios, alerting the caregiver to wandering behavior and
allowing them to quickly locate their loved one. It will consist of a monitoring system that features geo-fencing
and wireless tether modes for both indoor and outdoor use. Efficacy of the proposed system will be assessed
by family caregivers through a pilot clinical study, as well as through engineering evaluations."

Tuberculosis (TB) is a dangerous disease that, prior to the advent of COVID-19, was the leading cause of death
from an infectious agent. M. tuberculosis resistance to anti-TB drugs worsens clinical outcomes and poses a
serious threat to global TB control. Resistance to isoniazid, the first-line drug with the most potent early
bactericidal activity, is the most common form of resistant TB and reduces the efficacy of standard 6-month
treatment. Based on a meta-analysis of observational reports, the WHO, the US CDC, and several scientific
societies, have recommended an alternative regimen for isoniazid-mono-resistant TB that substitutes
levofloxacin for isoniazid and includes a 6-month course of levofloxacin along with rifampicin, ethambutol, and
pyrazinamide (6Lfx-REZ regimen). To date, this is a weak recommendation because it is based on evidence
rated as very low quality. It is also acknowledged that the prolonged administration of pyrazinamide entails a
considerable risk of liver toxicity, and it may be necessary to increase the dose of rifampicin and levofloxacin to
boost efficacy, within sufficient safety criteria, because it lacks the bactericidal action of isoniazid. The prevalence
of isoniazid-mono-resistant TB in Peru is significant; in Lima, 20% of TB cases are isoniazid-resistant but half of
them are still sensitive to rifampicin.
Additionally, the 6Lfx-REZ regimen is being applied across the nation following new national TB guidelines. Here,
we propose a study to fill in some of the gaps in the evidence supporting the safety, tolerability, effectiveness,
and drug dosages of this regimen. We will recruit patients in primary health care centers throughout metropolitan
Lima and use rapid molecular and phenotypic tests to identify 218 isoniazid-resistant and rifampicin-sensitive
TB participants who receive the 6Lfx-REZ regimen. Through active pharmacovigilance of these patients with
phone calls every two weeks and periodic medical examinations with laboratory tests, we will assess the safety
and tolerability of the regimen. We will measure sustained effectiveness up to 12 months post-enrollment with
periodic sputum cultures and assess the acquisition of additional resistance in individuals who fail treatment or
relapse. We will also determine pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters of levofloxacin
and rifampicin at week 8 in a subset of participants, oversampling those who fail to convert their culture to
negative to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations of both drugs in baseline isolates. We believe that
this study will offer useful information about the regimen used to treat the most prevalent type of drug-resistant
TB. The data will be transferable to environments with a high prevalence of resistant TB. Finally, we believe that
this prospective cohort design will provide high-quality evidence promptly while also strengthening the clinical
research capabilities of the participating Peruvian institutions."
10903057,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
β-cell dysfunction is one of the hallmark determinants of Type II Diabetes (T2D) which is characterized by
impaired insulin secretion and subsequent hyperglycemia. Identifying mechanisms to preserve and enhance
β-cell function is therefore crucial to ameliorate T2D pathogenesis. Data from knockout animals has
established that the MAF bZIP transcription factor A (MafA) is a critical regulator of β-cell functional capacity to
adapt to insulin resistance. MafA directly activates insulin transcription, but also regulates a wide array of
genes necessary for glucose sensing and insulin secretion. Commensurately, MafA is downregulated in islets
of people and mice with T2D. Preserving MafA expression in islets from diabetic animals restores proper
glucose regulation, suggesting that finding mechanisms to protect and enhance MafA expression may mitigate
βcell dysfunction in T2D.
MafA binds lysine acetyltransferases, Kat2b and CBP, leading to increased transactivation of MafA target
genes, but the underlying mechanism is not known. Testing the hypothesis that Kat2b/CBP may acetylate
MafA , I performed a LC/MS-MS screen that revealed MafA acetylation at lysines 32, 33 and 255. Based on
this result, I mutated these lysines to glutamine (3KQ) and arginine (3KR) to mimic constitutively acetylated
and deacetylated MafA, respectively. Using these mimetics, I found that 3KQ MafA has significantly increased
transactivation ability at the insulin promoter. As a first step to understanding mechanism of this increased
transactivation ability, I observed that MafA acetylation prompts hyperphosphorylation at serine 14 and
competes with SUMOylation at lysine 32. These data suggest a novel form of PTM crosstalk between MafA
acetylation, phosphorylation and SUMOylation.
In Aim 1, I use my recently generated 3KQ and 3KR knock-in mice, and human beta cell lines, to determine
whether MafA acetylation may affect GSIS and improve the β-cell response to obesity-induced insulin
resistance. In Aim 2, I explore the complex relationship between MafA PTMs, and test whether acetylation-
induced hyperphosphorylation is necessary for activity (Aim 2a) and whether a SUMOylation-acetylation switch
occurs in response to rising glucose levels (Aim 2b)."

The lymphatic vascular system controls tissue fluid homeostasis and intestinal lipid uptake. Proper lymphatic
function positively correlates with favorable outcomes for patients with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders,
which accentuates the importance of this system in maintaining systemic homeostasis. Our long-term goal is to
uncover molecular mechanisms and critical regulators that govern lymphatic function in health and disease,
with the hope of offering new therapeutic targets to combat cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. In the
previous funding period, we discovered that the Forkhead Box C2 (Foxc2) transcription factor antagonizes
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) signaling by inducing the expression of epsins;
endocytic adaptor proteins critical for VEGFR3 degradation and vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C)
signal attenuation in lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). We also discovered that the Forkhead Box C2
transcription factor (Foxc2) was an important regulator of obesity and that restoration of lymphatic function was
a potential strategy to treat metabolic diseases. As a result, in this renewal application, we sought to identify
and study additional regulatory molecules of lymphatic function. We determined that the micro-ribonucleic acid
miR-22 regulates lymphatic function in normal and diseased conditions. Despite its prominence in governing
lymphatic pathophysiology, little is known about the role that miR-22 plays in regulating the function of this
vascular system. Consequently, we generated novel, inducible lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC)-specific miR-22
loss-of-function mice and discovered that the deficiency of this molecule dramatically increased developmental
lymphangiogenesis and increased the expression of the master regulator of lymphatic differentiation and fate
determination Prox1 as well as fortifying VEGF-C/VEGFR3 signaling and increasing the expression of
metabolic regulatory genes. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that lymphatic miR-22 represses Prox1,
constrains VEGFR3 signaling, and stymies energy production by suppressing metabolic programming.
Conversely, loss of lymphatic miR-22 elevates Prox1 expression, VEGFR-3 signaling, and metabolic
bioenergetics; thereby, mending impaired lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic function in cardiovascular and
metabolic disorders. To test our hypothesis and determine how miR-22 inhibition exerts a pro-lymphangiogenic
stimulus to ameliorate cardiovascular and metabolic disease, we propose the following related, but
independent, Specific Aims: 1) to determine the role of miR-22 in governing metabolic programming and
VEGFR3 signaling, 2) to determine molecular mechanisms by which miR-22 governs lymphatic function in the
adult, and 3) to determine the therapeutic potential of targeting miR-22 and epsins in lymphatic systems. Our
findings will identify novel molecular mechanisms underlying metabolic regulation and signaling to drive
reparative and regenerative lymphangiogenesis. We anticipate that therapies targeting miR-22 or epsins may
be valuable for restoring the injured lymphatic vasculature to treat cardiovascular and metabolic diseases."

This application seeks renewal of the Prevention Science Research Training Program (PSRTP). The
PSRTP was established in 2004 as a collaborative effort of the Prevention Research Center (PRC) of
the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation and the School of Public Health of the University of
California Berkeley. The PSRTP is designed to prepare early career researchers to apply prevention
science to the reduction of alcohol misuse, dependence, and problems. The PSRTP takes a trans-
disciplinary approach that emphasizes the professional development of early career researchers by
providing training that leads to greater (1) knowledge of the nature, etiology and consequences of
alcohol misuse, dependence and problems; (2) understanding of the spectrum of prevention
strategies and the science underlying these strategies; (3) knowledge of the methodologies and
analytic strategies relevant to the study of prevention; and (4) sophistication in techniques associated
with the implementation and evaluation of prevention programs. The overarching goal of the PSRTP
is to provide early career scientists with the knowledge and skills necessary to succeed in the highly
competitive research and academic environments that characterize prevention research. The PSRTP
has the following specific aims: (1) to deliver a core curriculum to build expertise in prevention
science as it relates to alcohol studies through a series of structured courses that address alcohol use
and misuse, etiology, methodology, responsible conduct of research, and protection of human
subjects; (2) to provide training within a trans-disciplinary environment through informal seminars
structured around content and methodological areas and through participation in research in areas
outside the trainees’ primary areas of expertise; and (3) to facilitate each post-doctoral trainee’s
development as a researcher through intensive mentorship, undertaking an independent research
project, participating in a grant writing practicum, publishing, and engaging in professional
development activities. The PSRTP achieves these aims through: (1) formal seminars; (2) intensive
individual mentoring by senior faculty; (3) development and execution of yearly Individual
Development Plans; (4) integration into an ongoing funded research program; (5) completion of an
independent research project resulting in at least two sole or senior authored papers; (6) specialized
training in qualitative and quantitative research methods and data analysis through guided study
groups, formal coursework at the University of California Berkeley, and workshops and seminars at
other institutions; (7) attending regular presentations on current research methods, topics, and
findings at seminars and roundtables at PRC that are independent of the PSRTP seminars, and (8)
participating in professional development activities."

With 494 billion data points and 62 million map polygons, IPUMS National Historical Geographic Information
System (NHGIS) is the world’s largest publicly accessible population database and is an essential component
of the shared data infrastructure for population and health research. NHGIS gathers area-level U.S. census data
from diverse sources, formats them consistently, develops comprehensive standardized machine-processable
metadata, and creates high-precision GIS boundary files describing the spatial units. To eliminate major
obstacles for studies of small-area population change, NHGIS distributes geographic time series that link
comparable data across multiple census years. The data are broadly accessible to health researchers through
powerful dissemination tools that make it easy to navigate the intricacies of the U.S. statistical system, enabling
rigorous and reproducible population health research. NHGIS reduces costs for population and health
researchers by minimizing redundant effort, simplifying data access, and improving data reliability. NHGIS
currently disseminates 12 terabytes of data per year to 81,900 investigators, with a new citation of NHGIS
appearing in Google Scholar once every 14 hours. To meet the demands of a rapidly increasing user base and
ever-expanding requests for more and improved data, this project has five major goals: 1. Add to core census
datasets. The proposed project will incorporate new releases of American Community Survey (ACS) summary
data with corresponding boundary files and broaden the coverage of existing NHGIS datasets with 1980 block
boundary data for all metropolitan areas, Puerto Rico data from the 1980–2000 censuses, and ACS tables for
detailed race/ethnicity/tribe/ancestry groups. 2. Add resources to support analysis of noisy 2020 census data.
To protect privacy, the Census Bureau is adding noise to 2020 census data, causing some data to be unreliable
in ways that are difficult to predict. This project will add three key resources to NHGIS to help researchers
understand and account for the added noise: confidence intervals, Noisy Measurement Files, and data for
optimized block groups. 3. Extend integrated spatiotemporal datasets. To broaden research opportunities, this
project will extend NHGIS geographic crosswalks to cover more levels and years, extend time series tables to
cover more years and subjects, and extend annual estimates of tract-level populations through 2027. 4. Improve
data access. The project will give data users new options for code-based access to NHGIS data and metadata
via our Application Programming Interface (API) and a Python package. 5. Expand and support the research
community. The project will invest in extensive user support, training, and outreach, leveraging two new data
user networks built with recent NSF and NIA funding to reach new, underrepresented, and early-career scholars.
The project team will also develop new guides to key concepts in U.S. census data."

The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has enabled the use of clinical data for clinical
research and healthcare delivery. Many institutions have established clinical data warehouses (CDWs) in
conjunction with cohort discovery tools (e.g., i2b2) to support the use of clinical data for clinical research
including retrospective clinical studies as well as feasibility assessment or patient recruitment for clinical trials.
However, a significant portion of relevant patient information is embedded in clinical narratives and natural
language processing (NLP) techniques such as information extraction are critical when using EHR data for
clinical research. Many clinical NLP systems have been developed to extract information from text for various
downstream applications but have had unsatisfactory performance and portability issues. Information retrieval
(IR), a technique used in search engines for storing, retrieving, and ranking documents from a large collection of
text documents based on users’ queries, can provide an alternative approach to leverage clinical narratives for
cohort discovery as it is less dependent on semantics. In order to accomplish this, additional work is needed
since current IR approaches are generally document-based and the formulation of cohort discovery as an IR
task requires the development of innovative IR approaches to handle complex EHR data and cohort criteria with
contextual (e.g., spatial or temporal) constraints.
Our long-term goal is to develop informatics solutions to accelerate the use of EHR data for clinical research.
The main goal of this proposal is to develop innovative IR methods, which formulate cohort discovery from EHR
data as an IR task, aiming to accelerate the identification of patient cohorts for cohort studies or the recruitment
of eligible patients for clinical trials. In our current R01-supported study (R01LM011934), we introduced novel
language models to enable the reuse of NLP-produced artifacts for IR-based cohort retrieval and developed
parallel resources for IR evaluation at two institutions (Mayo Clinic and OHSU). We hypothesize that, given
complex cohort criteria with contextual constraints, an IR framework with tailored architecture components (e.g.,
indexing, ranking, evaluation, and query processing) for storing and querying EHR data has an advantage over
traditional cohort discovery tools for querying unstructured EHR data as well as an advantage over text-based
search engines for querying both structured and unstructured EHR data. For the proposed renewal, we plan to
i) adopt common data models (CDMs) and deploy the framework at one additional site to assess the
generalizability of methods, ii) extend the IR framework to incorporate contextual information, and iii)
incorporate deep semantic representations into the IR framework. If successful, the proposed project will
advance informatics research on cohort discovery and identification, which impacts many applications based on
EHR data such as learning healthcare systems, predictive modeling, or AI in healthcare."
10880063,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 Age-related macular degeneration and several other diseases can cause rod and cone photoreceptors to
die. This results in permanent visual impairment because the human retina does not regenerate itself. One
potential way to restore vision is by replacing the lost photoreceptors. Audacious strategies to restore vision
include reprogramming the diseased retina to regenerate its own photoreceptors and directly replacing the lost
photoreceptors from stem cell sources. Implementing these strategies requires specific and efficient methods of
programming cells to become rods and cones. However, we face a major barrier to achieving these therapeutic
strategies due to our limited understanding of the mechanisms that govern how photoreceptors normally develop.
 Most of the undifferentiated progenitor cells of the retina will activate the transcription factor Otx2 and acquire
the potential (or competence) to become photoreceptors and bipolar cell interneurons. These competent Otx2+
cells then choose between rod, cone, and bipolar cell types. This fate decision is controlled in part by the
transcription factors Prdm1 and Vsx2. Loss of Prdm1 profoundly increases bipolar cells at the expense of
photoreceptors. Conversely, Vsx2 mutants lack bipolar cells. Neither photoreceptors nor bipolar cells are
generated when Otx2 is mutated. Therefore, the gene regulatory networks responsible for Otx2, Prdm1, and
Vsx2 expression determine the cell type composition of the retina and its ability to function normally. Our goal is
to decipher how this gene regulatory network functions to control cell fate decisions during retinal development.
 Our first objective is to determine how Otx2 expression, which is necessary for photoreceptor and bipolar
cell competence, is regulated during mouse retinal development. We have identified three non-coding DNA
regulatory elements (enhancers) that are essential for Otx2 expression at different times in development.
Perturbing enhancer function also suggests that they dynamically interact in a tight three-dimensional structure
that allows them to substitute for one another. We will test how these enhancers cooperate and substitute for
each other in normal and perturbed conditions using high-resolution chromosome conformation capture and
other genetic approaches. Our second objective is to understand how Otx2+ cells choose between photoreceptor
and bipolar cell types. We found that deleting the bipolar-specific enhancer of Vsx2 prevented bipolar cell
formation. Our results from mutating this enhancer along with Prdm1 suggested that transient Vsx2 expression
permanently drives bipolar formation. Using a combination of mouse mutants, mutagenesis, misexpression, and
CRISPR inhibition tools, we will determine how Vsx2 and the Vsx2 bipolar enhancer control bipolar fate choice.
 Our experiments will unravel the gene regulatory network that controls photoreceptor and bipolar cell
competence and fate choice. Gaining this knowledge is important because it will help us create regenerative
strategies to replace lost photoreceptors and restore vision in millions of people suffering from blinding diseases."
10883651,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are aggressive neoplasms derived from the Schwann cell
lineage that occur commonly in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) as well as sporadically in the
general population. The prognosis for patients with an MPNST is grim, as current radio- and chemo-
therapeutic regimens are ineffective. Ras hyperactivation, which results from loss of functional NF1, typically in
combination with other tumor suppressor mutations (CDKN2A, TP53, or SUZ12), is characteristic of MPNSTs.
This suggests that inhibiting Ras signaling would be an effective means of treating MPNSTs. However, Ras
has proven to be difficult to directly target therapeutically and drugs targeting Ras effector pathways have not
been effective in patients with MPNSTs. This led us to investigate the effectiveness of therapeutically targeting
key upstream activators of Ras, such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in MPNSTs. We examined the role
of all 58 RTKs in sporadic and NF1-associated MPNST cell lines using both pharmacologic and genome-scale
shRNA screens coupled with comprehensive genomic analyses. Our RTK-based pharmacologic screens
established that the broad-spectrum ERBB inhibitor canertinib and the IGF1 receptor (IGF1R) inhibitor
picropodophyllin effectively inhibited MPNST growth and Ras activation. In keeping with these results, our
genome-scale shRNA screens established ERBB3 and IGF1R as essential for the growth of MPNST cells.
Based on these findings, we hypothesize that MPNST growth in vivo is dependent on the action of
ERBB3 and IGF1R and that therapeutic regimens simultaneously targeting these key RTKs will
effectively treat MPNSTs. We will rigorously test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we
will test the hypothesis that combinatorial therapies targeting ERBB receptors and IGF1R will effectively inhibit
MPNST xenograft growth in vivo. We will also determine if other RTKs are reproducibly activated to promote
resistance to ERBB and IGF1R inhibitors and tumor recurrence. In Specific Aim 2, we will test the in vivo role
of ERBB3 in tumor initiation and drug sensitivity using xenografts and a genetically engineered mouse model
(GEMM). In Specific Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that drug relapse is mediated by “secondary” RTKs that
compensate for ERBB and IGF1R inhibition to drive key cytoplasmic signaling pathways. This experimental
plan will thus allow us to logically develop effective therapies for a currently untreatable type of sarcoma. As
NF1 mutations and Ras hyperactivation are increasingly recognized in other sporadic tumor types, our
approach has broader application to many other types of human cancers.!"
10883655,"Cellular signaling by estrogens plays a critical role in the development, physiology, and pathology of a wide variety of tissues, including the reproductive organs, mammary glands, bone, heart, vasculature, adipose, liver, and central nervous system, as well as common diseases of the same tissues. The molecular actions of estrogens are mediated through estrogen receptor proteins (e.g., ERα), which function as transcription factors that drive cell type-specific patterns of gene expression by promoting the coordinated assembly of transcriptional enhancers at ERα binding sites. Studies over the past decade have led to the discovery of short noncoding RNAs that are transcribed by from active enhancers. The functions of these enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are not well understood, but emerging evidence suggests that eRNAs may contribute to enhancer assembly and function, and target gene expression. These observations have led to a growing interest in the mechanisms and functions of signal-regulated eRNAs, but many questions remain. We still do not know what fraction of eRNAs is functional. In addition, we do not know how eRNAs (1) cooperate with signal-regulated transcription factors, like ERα, and coregulators to regulate enhancer activity, (2) regulate the kinetics of enhancer assembly and disassembly, (3) drive enhancer-promoter looping and the activation of target genes, and (4) regulate mammalian enhancers and gene expression in vivo.
The long-term objective of these studies is to better understand the molecular mechanisms of estrogen signaling and gene regulation. Specifically, this proposal focuses on the mechanisms by which eRNAs transcribed from estrogen-regulated enhancers cooperate with liganded ERα to regulate global patterns of gene expression and control biological outcomes. Our broad hypothesis is that eRNAs cooperate with ligand- and DNA-bound ERα to build a scaffold for the assembly of a multi-protein enhancer complex that drives looping to estrogen-regulated target genes, whose expression determines estrogen-dependent biological responses. We propose to explore the mechanisms of eRNA-mediated ER? enhancer assembly and activity, as well as the biological roles of eRNAs in vivo, using an integrated set of experimental approaches. Our specific aims are to: (1) Explore the functional links between estrogen-regulated eRNAs and target gene expression (Aim 1); (2) Determine the molecular mechanisms by which functional estrogen- regulated eRNAs promote enhancer activity (Aim 2); and (3) Identify estrogen-regulated eRNAs in mouse uterus in vivo and perform an initial analysis of their roles in enhancer assembly and function (Aim 3).
Our integrative studies on the molecular mechanisms and functions of eRNAs acting at ERα enhancers
will elaborate a facet of the estrogen signaling pathway that remains largely unexplored. This knowledge of the molecular actions of estrogens will suggest new ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat estrogen-related diseases. In addition, these studies will shed light on gene regulation by related transcription factors."
10883658,"Abstract:
How skeletal stem cells are activated to expand, migrate to the injury site, and become osteoblast cells to
restore damaged bone are central questions in skeletal regeneration, which is key for the maintenance of a
functional skeletal system. Craniofacial bones mainly form through intramembranous ossification with limited
bone marrow space and skeletal stem cells that reside in the suture, a special fibrous joint that connects
calvarial bones of the skull together, have been identified as a major cell population that are required for
craniofacial bone homeostasis and injury repair. Numerous studies in both human and mice have highlighted
the importance of stem cell niche, a microenvironment where stem cells reside and also regulate stem cell
behaviors. As the craniofacial skeleton encases the brain and protects it, calvarial bone defects in the skull, if
failed to heal with bony tissue and consequently fibrous non-unions occur, are associated with high morbidity
and mortality. Therefore, reconstruction and regeneration of calvarial defects, in particular critical-size defects,
continuously poses as an unmet therapeutic challenge. The G protein stimulatory α-subunit (Gas), encoded by
GNAS gene, transduces signals from G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and has emerged as a critical
regulator of osteoblast differentiation by inhibiting Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Studies in both mouse models
and human genetic diseases supports the critical roles of both Gas and Hh signaling in regulating skeletal stem
cells in multiple contexts. Having showed that activation of Hh signaling by loss of Gas is a common pathway
that critically regulates intramembranous ossification in calvarial bone formation as in heterotopic ossification
(HO), we have also made novel findings in unpublished preliminary studies in an calvarial bone injury model
that directed suture stem cells (SuSCs) migration to the injury site correlates with upregulated expression of
chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (Cxcl12) and Sonic Hedgehog (Shh), to a less extent Indian Hedgehog
(Ihh), in SuSC niche. Further, inhibition of the Cxcl12 cognate receptor Cxcr4, which is coupled to Gai that
counteracts Gas signaling, severely impaired calvarial bone regeneration. Loss of Gas enhanced Shh
expression, which induced osteoblast differentiation. We therefore hypothesize that Cxcl12 and Shh are critical
niche factors that are induced by calvarial injury and coordinately promote SuSC migration, expansion and
osteoblast differentiation, all of which are essential for calvarial bone injury repair. This hypothesis will be
tested in three specific aims: 1) To better define SuSCs and determine the roles of Cxcl12 and Gai/Gas
signaling in directing SuSC migration to the injury site during calvarial bone regeneration; 2) To determine the
roles of Gai/Gas and Shh signaling in SuSC expansion and osteoblast differentiation during calvarial bone
regeneration; 3) To determine the interaction of Cxcl12 and Shh signaling during bone regeneration after
calvarial injury. We expect to identify novel interactive Cxcl12 and Shh signaling to harness intrinsic regulatory
circuitry between niche and SuSCs to promote calvarial bone regeneration and treat calvarial defects."

10903731,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall goal of this application is to elucidate the mechanism of Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination of
extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK1 and ERK2, and to determine the contribution of this novel post-translational
modification to tumorigenesis. ERK1 and ERK2, which share high structural and functional
similarities, are downstream effectors of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade that dictates
cellular behavior and cell fate decisions in response to a wide range of intracellular signals. The ERK signaling
pathway is the primary mitogenic pathway in mammalian cells. It is aberrantly upregulated in a large fraction of
human tumors due to prevalence of mutations in the upstream signaling components, and reactivation of ERK
is also the most common mechanism for resistance to drugs that target these upstream components. Developing
a therapy that is applicable for the wide range of tumors driven by a hyperactive ERK pathway and that can
circumvent drug resistance remains a major challenge in cancer research. To contend with this challenge
requires a comprehensive understanding of how ERK is specifically and efficiently activated within the MAPK
cascade. The current knowledge of ERK activation is largely limited to their phosphorylation by the upstream
kinase MEK. In our preliminary studies, we have found that ERK is conjugated to K63-linked polyubiquitin chains,
and that this post-translational modification correlates with ERK activation. Furthermore, we have identified the
tripartite-motif protein TRIM15 as a ubiquitin ligase, and the tumor suppressor CYLD as a deubiquitinating
enzyme (DUB), that may dynamically regulate ERK ubiquitination. Here we will test the central hypothesis that
K63 ubiquitination of ERK is critical for the specific and efficient activation of these kinases and that dysregulation
of this post-translational modification contributes to the pathogenesis and therapeutic resistance of tumors. We
propose three specific aims. First, we will characterize the role of TRIM15 and CYLD in K63 ubiquitination of
ERK and define how their interactions with ERK are regulated by mitogenic stimuli. Second, we will elucidate
the function and mechanism of K63 ubiquitination in the activation of ERK. Third, we will determine the role of
TRIM15 and CYLD in tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance. Collectively, these aims will address
fundamental issues in ERK biology and oncogenic signaling, and will provide valuable information for the
development of effective therapies for the plethora of human tumors that are driven by a hyperactive ERK
signaling pathway."

10900058,"Summary/Abstract
All motor commands flow through motoneurons (MNs), which are probably the most thoroughly studied of all
spinal neurons. Perhaps the most striking result to emerge from the many studies of MNs is that
neuromodulatory input from the brainstem exerts an enormous impact on motoneuron excitability, via
monosynaptic synapses releasing either serotonin (5HT) or norepinephrine (NE). However, the primary focus
of studies of this fundamental transformation has been on slowly varying synaptic inputs. Consequently,
neuromodulatory actions on inputs with fast temporal dynamics remain poorly understood. This uncertainty at
the foundation of motor output is a major limitation. Rapid movements are obviously essential for normal motor
behavior. Furthermore, transient inputs, such as H-reflexes and transcranial magnetic stimuli, are fundamental
for understanding circuitry of sensorimotor systems in humans and other animals in both normal and
pathological states. Our overall goal is to determine how integration of dynamic synaptic inputs in MNs is
impacted by brainstem neuromodulatory input. The previous focus on slow/steady inputs likely occurred
because a primary target for the brainstem neuromodulatory systems is a persistent inward current (PIC) that
activates very slowly and, once fully active, is highly resistant to inactivation. Thus neuromodulatory facilitation
of PICs generates input amplification up to 5-fold and input prolongation up to 10 seconds or more, depending
on the level of 5HT or NE released by brainstem axons. The PIC however has two main components, one
mediated by Ca channels (CaPIC) and the other by Na channels (Na PIC). The CaPIC provides the slow, non-
inactivating behavior whereas the NaPIC is much faster activating and much less resistant to inactivation. 5HT
and NE also lower motoneuron recruitment thresholds (via actions on the spike voltage threshold) and greatly
alter the driving forces for excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (because the CaPIC strongly
depolarizes the dendrites). Together, the NaPIC, threshold reduction and driving force alteration mean that
dynamic inputs may be nearly as sensitive to neuromodulation as slow inputs. We will investigate these
neuromodulatory effects on MNs across the full range of temporal dynamics of input, from transient to steady.
We will deploy array electrode recordings on muscles to assess population firing patterns in Aim 1, in situ
voltage clamp techniques to elucidate cellular mechanisms in Aim 2. The transformation of cellular to
population behaviors will be investigated by realistic MN models implemented on a supercomputer in Aim 3.
Large differences in integration of slow versus fast inputs are likely to be fundamental for understanding normal
behavior and for interpretation of the strength of synaptic connections based on transient stimulation in
humans (H reflexes, TMS, etc) in both normal behaviors and neurological diseases and injuries."

 During mouse embryonic development, approximately 40 cells in the post-implantation epiblast are
designated as Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and destined to become sperm or egg. PGCs undergo global
epigenetic remodeling, which is not seen in the surrounding somatic cells. The repressive histone modification
H3K9me2 is depleted during PGC specification. In parallel, DNA is demethylated in two waves: a global erasure
followed by a loci specific depletion. The only locations to escape this first wave of global erasure are a few germ
cell specifying genes, imprinted loci, and transposable elements. How these loci are protected from the first
phase of DNA demethylation is still unknown. Previous data from my thesis lab has shown that in somatic cell
reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells, there is coordinated removal of the same repressive epigenetic
marks of H3K9me2 and DNA methylation. I propose that H3K9me2 demethylases KDM3A and KDM3B have
important roles in PGC development which I will investigate using an in vitro PGC-like cell differentiation model
and Next-generation sequencing experiments. This research will elucidate the importance of removal of
repressive modifications to prevent transgenerational epigenetic inheritance which could be disruptive to
embryonic development, germ cell specification, and fertility."

Louisiana's children are some of the most vulnerable in the country and are disproportionately affected by a
number of health disparities. Enhancing the ability to implement high quality clinical trials directed toward the
five focus areas of the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Program (pre-, peri-, and
postnatal outcomes; obesity; upper and lower airways; neurodevelopment; and positive health) has the unique
potential to improve health outcomes for all children in Louisiana and across the United States. With the
establishment of the IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN) in 2016, the Louisiana site
consisting of researchers from Pennington Biomedical Research Center (PBRC) in Baton Rouge and Tulane
University in New Orleans successfully enhanced pediatric research capacity and infrastructure to conduct
clinical trials, trained new pediatric researchers, and participated in clinical trials implemented by the Network in
the first cycle. This renewal will allow our Louisiana site to expand the reach of the ECHO ISPCTN to additional
sites across the state (Children's Hospital New Orleans and Our Lady of the Lake Children's Hospital), to train
additional pediatric researchers, and to conduct additional important clinical trials. Moreover, continuing to work
with the established infrastructure and modeling the processes of inter-institutional collaboration created by the
Louisiana Clinical and Translational Science Center (LA CaTS) Center (PI: John Kirwan; U54 GM104940; IDeA
CTR) will allow for further dissemination and conduct of clinical trials across Louisiana. The ECHO ISPCTN with
the assistance of NIH Project Scientists will identify research protocols of high priority appropriate to the
Network's goals and objectives. Our local study team will ensure that study protocols proceed efficiently through
regulatory and budgeting processes, are implemented effectively, and meet recruitment goals and timelines. We
will ensure mentoring of our two junior faculty and appropriate training of our research staff. Moreover, the Senior
Faculty Development Leader will work with the entire research team to implement a clinical research skills
development program. By building and expanding the research infrastructure in Louisiana, developing uniform
study protocols, and synergizing with other ECHO ISPCTN sites across the United States, the Louisiana ECHO
ISPCTN site will continue to bring new discoveries to the children of Louisiana while addressing the health
disparities that disproportionately affect the State."

strategies to real-world social determinants of health scenarios and work-based simulation strategies with
real clinical data and samples. A teacher professional development program focused on integration of NGSS

learning acquisition for CLS and PHIT concepts, thereby allowing us to uniquely tailor our experiences to
different community and cultural settings. Through high school and community partnerships, online, and

10894916,"ABSTRACT
 Low-grade glioma is the most common brain tumor in children and often involves one or more structures of
the anterior visual pathway (i.e., optic nerves, chiasm and tracts). Nearly 20% of children with
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) will develop a low-grade glioma of the anterior visual pathway, which are called
optic pathway gliomas (OPGs). NF1-OPGs are not amenable to surgical resection and can cause permanent
vision loss ranging from a mild decline in visual acuity to complete blindness. Children with NF1-OPGs typically
experience vision loss between 1 and 8 years of age and are monitored with brain magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) to assess disease progression. However, traditional two-dimensional (2D) measures of tumor
size are not appropriate to assess change over time and how NF1-OPGs are responding to treatment.
 Our proposal addresses the lack of robust and standardized quantitative imaging (QI) tools and methods
needed for NF1-OPG clinical trials. We will develop and validate a novel three-dimensional (3D) MRI-based QI
application for automated and comprehensive quantification of these unique pediatric tumors. We will use
machine learning algorithms to accommodate MRI sequences from different manufacturers and protocols. We
hypothesize that the novel QI application will accurately assess treatment response in clinical trials. In this
project, we will validate our QI software and machine learning methods to make accurate and automated
measures of tumor volume and shape using data from a phase 3 clinical trial of NF1-OPGs. From these
measures, we will create methods to assess response to therapy that will enable physicians to make informed
and objective treatment decisions.
 Our specific aims are: 1) Develop a comprehensive QI application to perform accurate automated
quantification of NF1-OPGs; 2) Determine and predict treatment response using our 3D QI measures of tumor
volume; and 3) Validate our 3D QI measures using visual acuity outcomes.
 Upon study completion, our QI application could transform clinical care for NF1-OPG by identifying the
earliest time to determine a favorable versus unfavorable treatment response. The QI application's ability to
accurately measure treatment response, along with harmonizing data across MRI manufacturers and
protocols, will standardize imaging assessments essential to NF1-OPG clinical trials."
10894919,"Discovering potential drugs and treatments of many diseases heavily depends on identifying differentially
expressed (DE) genes in disease conditions within individual cell types. While it is possible to
experimentally sort out cells of individual cell types for DE analysis, computationally leveraging bulk tissue
data has the advantage of greater availability, lower expenses, and less human handling. A critical step
toward this research is to (completely) deconvolute gene expressions in specific cell types from the
heterogeneous bulk tissues. Complete deconvolution can be viewed as a nonnegative matrix factorization
(NMF) problem, however, NMF is strongly ill-posed, and its non-separable solutions give great challenges
in data interpretability. These challenges vary in different applications, so if no special treatment is taken,
results from complete deconvolution of gene expression data will make accurate DE analysis almost
impossible. In this proposal, a mathematical model and associated computational algorithms will be
established for the fundamental research of bulk tissue RNAseq analysis, for better data interpretability,
reliability, and efficiency. To tackle this challenge, the geometric structure of the given bulk tissue data set
will be explored first to identify marker genes for the constituent cell types. Then the model is established
by (1) enforcing the weak solvability condition (because of noises) of NMF and (2) performing geometrical
constraints on the data space of knowns. This work is motivated by the common characteristics of many
biological data, in which expression levels across sample tissues exhibit strong correlations among certain
genes. For massive amount of biological data, stochastic fast computational algorithms will be developed.
After validation and benchmarking, the proposed model will be applied to DE analysis for various datasets.
This proposed new model is important to decipher cellular transcriptional alterations in many diseases. In
modeling strategies, this research provides a new perspective of observing topological/geometric
structures of data, enforcing the corresponding constraints to enhance problem solvability and data
interpretability. In computation, this research develops nonlinear graph Laplacian regularized optimization
associated with stochastic compression algorithms, which can process massive data with low storage.

Error-free DNA repair initiated at the sites of replication fork stalling is critical for the prevention of genomic
instability in cycling cells. Defects in stalled fork repair have been directly implicated in cancer predisposition
and other human diseases. The clinical burden associated with failed stalled fork repair may include hereditary
breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) predisposition, in light of the involvement of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in repair of
stalled replication forks, and Fanconi Anemia (FA)—a rare, autosomal recessive (or X-linked) disease caused
by inactivation of any one of several FA genes. Our work previously established roles for BRCA1 and BRCA2
in regulating HR at both double strand breaks (DSBs) and in stalled fork repair. We developed innovative tools
for quantifying homologous recombination (HR) and other repair outcomes at stalled mammalian replication
forks and, more recently, at broken replication forks. A major goal of this proposal is to define the fundamental
mechanisms of repair of stalled forks. We have developed an array of cutting-edge tools to support this study,
including unique, sophisticated HR reporters that can distinguish between error-free “short tract” HR and error-
prone “long tract” HR—a replicative response analogous to break-induced replication in yeast. One unusual
aberrant replicative response that we observe at stalled forks specifically in BRCA1 mutant cells is the
formation of <10 kb non-homologous tandem duplications (TDs). In a paradigm-shifting discovery, we found
that these highly specific forms of structural variation are also abundant in the human BRCA1-linked breast
and ovarian cancer genome. A major goal of this proposal is to define the genetic regulation and full
mechanism of TD formation at stalled forks in BRCA1 mutant cells. Success in this project will reveal in
unprecedented detail the mechanisms that regulate mammalian stalled (or broken) fork repair and their
relationship to cancer predisposition. In support of this, we will develop new techniques for analyzing DNA
structural intermediates, chromatin responses to fork stalling and protein composition of the stalled mammalian
replication fork. These analytical studies may also identify new molecular targets for therapy of breast and
ovarian cancer. Indeed, our recent work on the mechanisms underlying formation of BRCA1-linked TDs led us
to discover a synthetic lethal interaction between BRCA1 and FANCM loss-of-function mutations. FANCM is a
motor protein and, hence, an ATPase. We find that ablation of FANCM ATPase activity alone (leaving the rest
of the protein intact and stable within the cell) is sufficient to confer lethality on BRCA1 mutant cells. Thus,
FANCM may be a “druggable” target for therapy in BRCA1-linked cancer. In work proposed herein, we will
define the therapeutic potential of this discovery. During the funding period, we expect to make important
discoveries in this field and to open the door to new therapies in HBOC and perhaps other forms of cancer."

Committee of esteemed scientists will provide advice and assess progress. An overarching goal of the ME-
INBRE is to increase collaboration between scientists and students from diverse disciplines, perspectives, and
institutions, using data science as a collaborative platform. To that end, the Data Science Core will develop a
statewide Community of Practice in data science, involving a working group of scientists from each network
institution, and will offer data science training through workshops, courses, and mentored research experiences.
A new Collaborative Research Resources Core will provide crucial core technologies as well as resources for
collaboration and connecting researchers with IDeA-funded core facilities, including core facility access awards.
The Developmental Research Project Program will support the research and career development of exceptional,
diverse faculty. Competitively selected Research Project Leaders will devote 50% of their effort to a Research
Project, and Pilot Project Leaders from PUIs will devote 25% effort to projects that provide research experiences
for undergraduate students. Collaborations with Maine COBREs, CTR, and regional IDeA programs will leverage
core resources, increase diversity, and engage students and faculty in basic, translational, and clinical research
opportunities that will complement and extend ME-INBRE's programs. The Administrative Core will manage and
coordinate all activities, including the ME-INBRE Student Research Program and a new Community Outreach
initiative, in accordance with a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives, and will implement internal formative
evaluation of all ME-INBRE programs and activities to maximize their effectiveness."

10875861,"DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH PROJECTS PROGRAM PROJECT SUMMARY
The Developmental Research Project Program (DRPP) of the Maine INBRE (ME-INBRE) aims to support
innovative biomedical research and pilot projects led by outstanding faculty researchers at ME-INBRE partner
institutions. The program has three specific aims. 1) Funding: The DRPP will provide competitive funding for
Research Projects (RPs), Pilot Projects (PPs), and Collaborative Pilot Projects (CPPs) that involve students in
innovative biomedical research. RP Leaders, who are newly appointed or early-career faculty, will dedicate 50%
of their effort to their projects. PP Leaders can be faculty members at any career stage from Primarily
Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), devoting 25% effort. CPP Leaders will form multi-disciplinary teams involving
scientists from different INBRE network institutions. Funding duration varies, with RPs spanning two years and
PPs funded for one year, with the possibility of one competitive renewal contingent on progress. 2) Mentoring:
Project Leaders will be partnered with and receive guidance from experienced mentors. RPs will have both an
internal mentor from their institution and an external mentor in their research field. PPs will typically have a single
mentor. Project Leaders will also participate in workshops on data science, grant writing, lab management, and
other relevant topics, fostering their career development. 3) Evaluation: The DRPP will undergo rigorous
evaluation to ensure its effectiveness. Project Leaders will submit progress reports, and the DRPP Director and
the Evaluation Team will assess project progress toward publications, major grant proposals, and mentoring
effectiveness using a prescribed evaluation matrix. The External Advisory Committee will conduct semiannual
evaluations and provide personalized feedback to the Project Leaders and their mentors, ensuring their
continued success. The ME-INBRE DRPP prioritizes innovative projects, particularly those with data science
components, engaging undergraduate students and leveraging core resources from ME-INBRE and other IDeA
programs in Maine and the region like the Maine COBREs and Northern New England CTR. The DRPP will also
follow the ME-INBRE Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP). The program's impact will be to increase
the amount of and capacity for high-quality biomedical research in Maine that is inclusive of diverse perspectives.
It will do so by supporting innovative investigator-initiated research and pilot projects, both standalone and
collaborative, and through effective mentorship and research oversight. The program will also promote
collaborations across ME-INBRE network institutions."
10875862,"DATA SCIENCE CORE PROJECT SUMMARY
The Data Science Core (DSC) of the Maine IDeA Network for Biomedical Research Excellence (ME-INBRE)
will support biomedical research by providing essential training and consulting in all facets of Data Science,
while also creating and supporting a collaborative network of biomedical data science activity that spans all
ME-INBRE institutions. Biomedical research increasingly utilizes high throughput technologies that generate
vast amounts and diverse kinds of data. The DSC will provide the specialized expertise needed for managing,
analyzing, and interpreting those large data sets. DSC staff will advise and/or collaborate with ME-INBRE
researchers in the application of best practices in experimental design, data management, and state-of-the-art
workflows for data analysis, emphasizing rigor and reproducibility. The DSC will work to build data science
proficiency among biomedical researchers across the ME-INBRE, via two Specific Aims. The first is to build a
community of practice in data science, consisting of a network of scientists from each network institution who
work collaboratively to promote and advance the development and application of data management, analysis,
and visualization methods. The second specific aim is to provide training and support to data science across
the ME-INBRE network. To that end the DSC will build upon its established training courses and workshops
that address audiences ranging from the undergraduate level to faculty investigators. The DSC will support the
Data Science Scholars Program, which engages undergraduate students at ME-INBRE network institutions in
biomedical data science research, and The University of Maine’s Professional Master’s in Bioinformatics
program. Core personnel will also work with ME-INBRE Project Leaders to develop rigorous Data Management
and Sharing Plans for their projects and provide access to and expertise in the use of appropriate
cyberinfrastructure spanning local, regional, and Cloud computing resources. The DSC will work closely with
each of the other ME-INBRE components (Administrative Core, Developmental Research Projects Program,
and Collaborative Research Resources Core) to implement all programmatic activities involving data science,
including the Student Research Program, Evaluation Plan, and collaborative team science. The DSC will
leverage regional collaborations and cyberinfrastructure through the Northeast Cyberinfrastructure Consortium
(NECC) that ME-INBRE cofounded with four other IDeA states to expand regional cyberinfrastructure and
conduct collaborative cyber-enabled research. Through the Northeast Data Science Collaborative (NEDSC),
the Core will work with INBRE Data Science Core staff in Delaware, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and
Vermont to support Maine faculty and collaborate on delivering Data Science training to faculty and students.
Regional cyberinfrastructure will be used for intensive computation and centralized data storage, sharing and
backup. In summary, the DSC will provide the intellectual and technical expertise and training in Data Science
that ME-INBRE scientists need to accomplish their research goals."
10875399,"Project summary/Abstract
In recent years, a massive increase in the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria has been
observed in clinical settings. Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most widespread pathogens that
cause these alarming infections. This bacterium is characterized by its extreme genome plasticity,
facilitated by horizontal genetic transfer (HGT) processes. These characteristics are the cause of A.
baumannii's remarkable ability to acquire antibiotic-resistance genes. Despite the relevance of foreign
DNA acquisition to the pathobiology of A. baumannii, efforts to elucidate the mechanism/s involved in
natural transformation have been scarce. We have recently demonstrated that the presence of human
serum albumin (HSA) in extracellular host fluids correlates with an increase in A. baumannii natural
transformation. We have also observed that the expression of the A. baumannii transcriptional
regulator H-NS drops in response to HSA and that competence-associated gene expression increases
in the h-ns mutant strains. This observation suggests that changes in cell's H-NS levels may play a
central role in natural transformation. Hence, we hypothesize that the interaction of HSA with bacterial
surface components triggers a regulatory signaling cascade that decreases H-NS expression,
resulting in enhanced expression of genes involved in natural competence. To test this hypothesis, we
will examine the interaction of HSA with A. baumannii cell surface proteins using the receptor activity-
directed affinity tagging (re-tagging) technique (aim 1). To better understand the transcriptional
response cascade responsible for HSA-mediated increase in transformation efficiency, we will
determine the H-NS regulated genes associated with competence using complementary RNA-seq and
ChIP-seq analyses in wild-type or h-ns mutants (aim 2). The studies proposed in this application will
shed light on host adaptation processes leading to antibiotic resistance in this challenging pathogen of
increasing relevance worldwide. We will provide new insights into bacterial components acting at the
top of the HSA signaling cascade and H-NS's role in HSA-mediated transcriptional responses, leading
to an increase in DNA-uptake. Future studies can then use these findings to develop novel
approaches to treat severe Acinetobacter human infections, particularly those caused by emerging
multidrug-resistant isolates."
10875400,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
There is a dramatic decline in the US on environmental health education and this is particularly noticeable in the
training of health professionals. This MIT program in collaboration with peer P30 centers at NYU and UNM, will
address health professionals’ need for training in genomics and environmental health with a one-week Short
Course on gene-environment interactions. Two Short Courses will be taught each summer over the grant cycle
with rural Tribal Colleges, serving the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes (CRST) in South Dakota, and the Nursing
Students at Ramapo College serving the Ramapough Lenape Tribe in New Jersey. Also, an online evening
course will be piloted for working nurses in the Dakotas. Providing such learning opportunities for nurses that
work primarily with Indigenous populations and/or environmental justice communities will significantly contribute
to building community public health in vulnerable populations. Teaching gene-environment interactions requires
foundational familiarity with molecular biology and instructing the course participants on how to communicate
this fundamental knowledge is an important skill learned in this short course. The participants will start each day
with a lecture/discussion on a pre-selected, community-relevant environmental health topic. Lectures will be
followed by a unique hands-on program using MIT-patented DNA and Protein models and pre- and post- tests
will be used to measure participant learning gains. Each topical lecture will reinforce the hands-on molecular
biology sessions, demonstrating specific applications for Environmental Justice Communities. Importantly, the
skills of communicating gene-environmental concepts learned from the MIT Edgerton Center DNA Kit and
Protein Kit to colleagues and community members will be practiced using different skill sets and critiqued during
the short course. Training from these Short Courses will help participants communicate difficult topics including
environmental exposures that cause genetic changes and protein responses. Short Course participants will
develop an expanded skill set to understand and practice gene-environment interactions through examples, and
will generate a health messaging product on a topic of their own choosing in environmental health to demonstrate
skills gained in communication. A follow up study (3 months later) will be conducted to collect feedback on how
participants have utilized their new knowledge about gene-environment interactions and communication skills.
The proposed courses will fill a much-needed gap in health care professional training that has the potential to
bring awareness and enhance quality of life to communities who need it the most."
10883761,"PROJECT SUMMARY – M&I CORE
The Microscopy and Imaging Analysis (M&I) core is the major component of the vision research
core at UCLA, with 18 research laboratories projecting moderate or extensive usage. The M&I
core facilities have been revamped in terms of both new laboratories and new equipment. The
core is now housed in dedicated core space that was completely renovated. Over the past two
years, a new JEOL JEM 1400plus electron microscope, a new Deltavision OMX super
resolution microscope, and a new Nikon spinning disk confocal microscope were purchased,
and are now all up and running, providing users with state-of-the-art imaging.
The M&I core is equipped with facilities and equipment for: 1) sample preparation, including the
preservation of tissue to be studied in a fixed state, sectioning (from thick to ultrathin), and the
preparation of live tissues for live-cell imaging; 2) many different forms of imaging capabilities,
from light to super resolution to EM; 3) image analysis, with a software suite, including Imaris.
Thus, together with technical support in all aspects, the core provides users facilities,
assistance, and training in sample preparation, imaging and image acquisition, and image
analysis.
The M&I core thus facilitates basic and preclinical research supported by NIH/NEI on UCLA
campus by providing access to facilities, equipment, and technical skills that cannot be found in
individual laboratories."
10901167,"Project Abstract:
 The 3D organization of the genome is important in controlling neuronal cell lineage commitment. As an
extension of the CNS, the retina is an excellent model for studying neuronal development. One issue in
studying the mouse retina is that it is dominated by rod photoreceptors, leading to bulk studies that overlook
less abundant cell types. The Blackshaw Lab and others have used single cell technologies to develop
transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) and epigenomic (scATAC-seq) atlases of mouse retinogenesis. These studies
have revealed cell-type-specific patterns of transcription factor (TF) mediated remodeling of chromatin that
occurs during developmental cell state transcriptions and are predicted to influence the 3D chromatin
architecture; however, the direct link has not been established. Previous studies on genome-wide chromatin
interactions using Hi-C have been conducted at the bulk level, are sparse, or focused only on rod
photoreceptors. A higher-resolution single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) study is needed to understand changes in
chromatin organization associated with the specification of different retinal cell types.
 Through the integration of multi-omic data at single cell resolution, I aim to identify how transcription
factors manipulate genomic structure to control cell fate specification. During retinal development, expression
of the NFI family of TFs (NFIA/B/X) controls the competence of late-stage RPCs and drives specification of
late-born retinal cell types (late-born rods, bipolar cells, and Muller glia). The Blackshaw lab’s previous scRNA-
seq and scATAC-seq studies have found many thousands of genes and cis-regulatory-elements that are
differentially regulated upon Nfia/b/x loss-of-function, which suggests that the NFI family TFs affect chromatin
state. Other studies have also found that the NFI family TFs affect chromatin compartmentalization and
promote the formation of super-enhancers. However, little is known about whether the NFI family TFs directly
regulate chromatin structure to activate downstream genes.
 In this proposed research, I will capture the 3D chromatin interactions of mouse retinal cells at the
single-cell level and at key developmental stages, using droplet microfluidic scHi-C (Aim 1). ScHi-C will be
adapted for the 10x Genomics droplet single-cell system and applied to the mouse retina at key developmental
stages. I will then use scHi-C to capture changes in chromatin organization associated with retinal progenitor-
specific loss-of-function of Nfia/b/x (Aim 2). To do this, I will first combine scHi-C with the Blackshaw Lab’s
previously obtained scATAC-seq, scRNA-seq, and Nfia/b/x ChIP-seq datasets to form a multiomic dataset of
retinal cells. I will then use the dataset to identify chromatin interactions associated with NFIA/B/X that drive
specification of late-stage RPCs. The droplet microfluidic scHi-C protocol will provide a generalizable method
that can be used for other genomic studies. The single-cell multi-omic dataset of retinal development will allow
improved construction of retinal gene regulatory networks and novel targets for treating retinal disorders."
10901169,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Erythropoiesis is a finely orchestrated process that involves generating a ~2.5 million red blood
cells per second to maintain homeostasis and prevent anemia. During terminal maturation, erythroid
precursors upregulate erythroid-specific genes while silencing non-erythroid genes in the setting of a cell
that is rapidly dividing and a nucleus that is condensing in preparation for enucleation. Our group has
shown that regulation of RNAPII activity is an essential determinant of erythroid cell function. During
terminal erythroid maturation, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) levels decline dramatically, becoming a
scarce resource allocated to erythroid genes, such as alpha and beta globin. The mechanism(s) by which
RNAPII is removed from genes unnecessary to erythroid differentiation and shunted to produce mRNA
essential for red blood cell function is unknown. The Integrator Complex (INT) is a multi-subunit
machinery that associates with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and functions as a critical transcription
regulator. It is a broad negative regulator of promoter-proximally paused RNAPII. Integrator subunit 11
(INTS11) houses the RNA endonuclease domain vital for Integrator to cleave nascent transcripts at all
RNAPII loci, which is an important activity for transcriptional repression and the processing of eRNA.
 Although INT is highly expressed in maturing erythroid cells, little is known about its function in
erythropoiesis. Further, the role of promoter-proximal transcriptional termination in regulating erythroid
gene expression has been almost completely unexplored. Our preliminary data reveal that disruption of
INT impairs the proliferation and maturation of primary human erythroid cells. Our CUT&RUN analyses
in primary erythroid cells uncover that INT is present at genes containing stably paused RNAPII that is
subsequently lost before enucleation. Finally, we find that INT binds to erythroid enhancers, including the
beta-globin LCR, in a manner correlating with increased transcription. Altogether, these data support a
hypothesis where INT enforces RNAPII pausing and termination at non-erythroid genes to maintain
RNAPII availability while enhancing the transcription of erythroid genes through eRNA processing. To
test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims: Specific Aim1. Determine the function of the Integrator
Complex during terminal erythroid maturation. Specific Aim 2. Delineate mechanisms by which Integrator
regulates erythroid gene expression."
10902353,"TH17 cells are a subset of CD4+ T cells that are important for immune responses to extracellular pathogens and fungi,
however, they can become dysregulated and lead to autoimmunity and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). TH17 cells secrete a myriad of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-17A, IL-
17F, IL-21, and IL-22, which give them a dynamic range of pathogenic potential. This could explain why IL-17A/IL-
17R-neutralizing antibodies have had limited success in treating IBD, while targeting cell-intrinsic factors that
broadly regulate the TH17 cell phenotype may be more effective. Modulating the development of TH17 cells through
intracellular transcription factors (TFs) like NRs provides an approach to lessen multiple components of the
inflammatory response responsible for IBD, avoiding some of the pitfalls of current therapies.
Our preliminary data is consistent with previously published literature describing the orphan nuclear receptor NR2F6
as a negative regulator of pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in IBD, including IL-17A and TNF. Genetic
experiments have demonstrated loss of NR2F6 enhances T cell effector responses, leading to increased sensitivity
to autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, making it an attractive target for therapy. NRs act as ligand
regulated TFs that can activate or repress transcription of target genes through recruitment of various co-factor
molecules. Additionally, these co-factors can recruit chromatin remodelers, adding another layer of transcriptional
regulation. Little is known about NR2F6’s transcriptional and ligand-regulated function at the molecular level.
The overarching goal of this project is to elucidate NR2F6’s mechanism of transcriptional regulation in TH17 cells and
determine how this may influence TH17-mediated diseases, including IBD. My first aim is to enumerate NR2F6’s
transcriptional function in TH17 cells. This will be done through integration of NR2F6 overexpression models using
CUT&RUN footprint analysis and RNAseq to identify genes potentially modulated by NR2F6; RNAseq and ATACseq
of NR2F6 knockout TH17 cells will be used to identify NR2F6 target genes and its capacity to remodel chromatin at
these gene loci. Co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) studies will determine the co-factors NR2F6 recruits to regulate
transcription. Integration of this Multi-OMICS data will provide a comprehensive mechanism for NR2F6’s
transcriptional activity. My second aim is to define how small molecules affect NR2F6 transcriptional activity and
function in TH17 cells. Previous efforts by our lab have identified a synthetic NR2F6 ligand. RNAseq and multi-
parametric flow cytometry will be used to characterize and validate the effects of treatment with this ligand.
Additionally, Co-IP proteomic studies will identify ligand-dependent changes in NR2F6 co-factor recruitment that may
lead to changes in function. We hypothesize that NR2F6 serves as a critical negative regulator of TH17 cell effector
responses and NR2F6 small molecule ligands can be used to further explore its biology."
10902527,"Project Summary
Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized as an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use, leading to
compulsive intake, trouble limiting intake, and the occurrence of a negative affective state during alcohol
withdrawal. Many negative symptoms arise during alcohol withdrawal, including heightened sensitivity to
painful stimuli. Nearly 75% of individuals with AUD report experiencing pain as a result of their alcohol use, and
many of those individuals will use alcohol to try to cope with their pain. In addition, chronic alcohol exposure
contributes to the development of hyperalgesia and chronic pain in mice and rats during withdrawal. A better
understanding of the mechanisms that lead to the development and maintenance of pain in AUD patients is
needed. The parabrachial nucleus (PBN) projects to multiple brain areas involved in physiological processing,
including the central amygdala, and this pathway is considered to be a hub for pain and aversion.
Glutamatergic PBN neurons express neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor 1 (Y1), and chronic alcohol exposure can
reduce CNS Y1 expression. Additionally, our preliminary work illustrates PBN Y1 neurons project to the CeA.
Y1s work to inhibit neuronal functioning and our laboratory has found that activation of Y1 receptors on PBN
neurons reduces neuropathic pain-like behavior in mice.
My central hypothesis is that chronic alcohol exposure increases the activity of PBN Y1 neurons, leading to
sensory and affective components of chronic alcohol withdrawal induced pain (CAWIP). I predict PBN Y1
neuron activity is increased during alcohol withdrawal, and that inhibiting PBN Y1 neurons will attenuate pain
associated with alcohol withdrawal. Specific Aim 1 will determine activity of PBN Y1 neurons in alcohol
withdrawn mice during nociception. Specific Aim 2 will inhibit PBN Y1 neurons and pharmacologically activate
PBN Y1 receptors to attenuate hypersensitivity associated with alcohol withdrawal. Conducting these
experiments will elucidate the PBN Y1 circuitry that underlies CAWIP."

Malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which
bears the second largest burden of malaria and accounted for 13% of global malaria deaths in 2021. Effective
treatment is an essential component of malaria case management. Artemisinin-based combination therapies
(ACTs) are the current first-line and most effective antimalarial treatment. Reports of resistance to ACTs in
neighboring Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda raise concerns about the future of malaria control in the DRC and
across sub-Saharan Africa. Moreover, few studies have investigated the role of overtreatment of individuals with
false-positive rapid diagnostic test results and how it modifies the selective pressure of artesunate-amodiaquine
(ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL), two first-line ACTs in the DRC. Improved understanding of the extent
and drivers of drug resistance and of the influence of malaria misdiagnosis on selective drug pressure is
imperative to inform ongoing malaria control efforts in the DRC and similar high-burden countries.
This proposal uses data and samples collected during a 2015-2022 malaria longitudinal cohort study of children
and adults in areas of varying endemicities in Kinshasa Province, DRC. Leveraging this well-characterized cohort
as well as the two-decade of strong research collaboration between the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill and partner institutions in Kinshasa, this proposal will focus on the following specific aims: 1) determine
genetic markers and factors associated with antimalarial drug resistance, and 2) Identify predictors of
overtreatment and explore the effect of recent treatment on ASAQ and AL resistance.
Through this research proposal and tailored training plan, the trainee will achieve the following fellowship goals:
1) acquire advanced skills in epidemiological and statistical methods, molecular and spatial epidemiology applied
to infectious diseases; 2) pursue clinical training at the intersection of infectious diseases and other areas of
medicine to inform my choice of residency; and 3) hone the professional skills needed to succeed as a physician-
scientist and navigate international collaborations."
10903199,"Project Summary/Abstract
Neural circuits can change their properties under changes in activity. Hebbian plasticity acts as a positive
regulator to increase or decrease synaptic strength and neuronal excitability. These destabilizing challenges
are counterbalanced by homeostatic plasticity which maintains synaptic strength and neuronal excitability
within an optimal range, stabilizing circuit function. One way to regulate these two processes is by alternative
splicing of ion channel genes, which changes channel properties to alter neuronal properties. Studies show
that defects in alternative splicing of ion channels can impair circuit activity underlying neuropsychiatric
disorders. Evidence suggests that low and high neuronal activity regulates distinct patterns of alternative
splicing of ion channel genes, supporting Hebbian or homeostatic plasticity, or both. However, the mechanism
underlying these splicing patterns is unknown. My central hypothesis is that activity regulates alternative
splicing of ion channels through subcellular signaling mechanisms tailored to specific cell types. My
proposal will focus on (1) how activity generally changes alternative splicing, (2) how these changes occur in
different cell types, and (3) how cellular mechanisms control alternative splicing. I will assess these changes
under activity perturbation using tetrodotoxin (TTX) to chronically silence neurons and high potassium (40mM
K+) to chronically depolarize neurons. In vitro investigations will determine the cellular mechanisms while ex
vivo and in vivo investigations will determine the circuit mechanisms across cell types. Screening, assaying,
and manipulating alternatively spliced ion channels will be done using cutting-edge multiplexed methods. Aim
1 will identify examples of different patterns of alternative splicing in ion channels. Through an RNAseq
screen and qPCR validation, this aim will characterize the prevalence of different alternative splicing patterns. I
predict I will characterize splicing patterns across multiple families of ion channels. Aim 2 will investigate how
activity regulates alternative splicing in diverse excitatory and inhibitory cell types. I will combine
neuroanatomical techniques with ex vivo organotypic slice cultures and after perturbations in vivo, to study
chronic silencing and depolarization in cell types in intact circuits and within a native environment in the animal.
I predict that activity-dependent alternative splicing occurs in a cell type-specific manner. Aim 3 will determine
how signaling from the soma or dendrites regulate alternative splicing. I will use an engineered somatic
Ca2+ blocking method and pharmacological agents to manipulate subcellular signaling in neuron cultures. I
predict that somatic and dendritic signaling controls two distinct patterns of alternative splicing. The results of
this study will clarify the regulation of activity-dependent alternative splicing from subcellular mechanisms and
from cell type-specific mechanisms, providing a multi-level understanding of how dysregulation of neuronal
activity contributes to overall activity of the circuit."

 2 experiences (ACEs) are linked to poor adult mental and physical health. Positive childhood
 3 experiences (PCEs) can mitigate the effects of ACEs and toxic stress. The HOPE framework
 4 groups PCEs into four fundamental building blocks: relationships with adults and other children;
 5 safe, stable and equitable environments to live, learn and play; social/civic engagement; and
 6 opportunities for social/emotional development. Implementation of the HOPE framework
 7 promotes a relationship-based approach which transforms interactions between providers and
 8 parents, focuses on a family’s assets and strengths, and upholds family agency and expertise,
 9 leading to an alignment of the family’s and practitioner’s goals. Launched in 2019, the HOPE
10 National Resource Center (NRC) supports national adoption of the HOPE framework in clinical
11 and community-based settings through training, technical assistance, translational research,
12 and evaluation. Dissemination has been successful, exceeding our internal targets. Our annual
13 summit strategies power the diffusion of innovation model. Our 2021 national summit, focused
14 on increasing awareness and understanding of the HOPE framework. Our second summit,
15 supported by an R13 award from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
16 (NICHD), centered on Growing HOPE, and highlighted community resilience. The 2023 NICHD
17 supported Summit, Practicing HOPE, focused on early adopters of HOPE-informed care.
18 Evaluation feedback from the 2023 Summit indicated a desire for more opportunities for
19 networking, and for in-person meetings. With NICHD support we will work with partner
20 organizations in Massachusetts, California and Tennessee to hold three, local in-person satellite
21 meetings in April, May and June of 2024 following our 2024 Summit. These tailored satellite
22 meetings will focus on HOPE organizational transformation. Applying the Consolidated
23 Framework for Advancing Implementation (CFIR) model, our previous summits have focused on
24 the inner setting, reaching out to individuals involved in direct service and in local decision-
25 making. This proposal will focus on the outer setting domain of the CFIR to promote the
26 widespread implementation of the HOPE framework in an organizational setting, by supporting
27 satellite meetings to foster the emerging implementation climate with discussions that identify
28 and address specific implementation barriers and facilitators. The goal of the HOPE Satellite
29 Meetings is to catalyze and support organizational transformation and adoption of HOPE."

Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) maintain male fertility, but not all SSCs are created equal. Here, I propose to
lineage trace the contributions of individual SSCs to sperm production across the fertile lifespan of an animal.
My central hypothesis is that SSCs compete for dominance and that Paternal Age Effect (PAE) mutations in the
RAS-MAPK pathway can confer autonomous advantage to SSCs at the cost of offspring health. In Aim 1, I will
identify the contributions of individually labeled SSC clones to spermatogenesis throughout zebrafish adulthood
using serial sperm sampling of male zebrafish from sexual maturity through the “elderly stage” when fertility
begins to decline. In Aim 2, I will investigate whether PAE mutations drive the selection of individual SSCs. I will
overexpress mutated PAE genes in a subset of SSC clones within the zebrafish testis and determine the
consequences to clonal dynamics, measuring non-neutral clonal competition in a living animal. In Aim 3, I will
determine the potentially “selfish” influence of PAE-containing clonal dominance by measuring mutation
transmission and consequences for the next generation. Together, this proposal will illuminate developmental
mechanisms that underlie male reproductive aging and may aid future efforts to design male-oriented
reproductive interventions that improve birth outcomes.
My interdisciplinary team of mentors will provide training in stem cell population analysis, genetic engineering,
and modeling human disease in animals, complemented by clinical mentorship and shadowing in pediatrics and
reproductive endocrinology. The training plan was developed in collaboration with my Sponsors to complete the
central goals of conducting independent, collaborative research; advancing communication and grant-writing
skills; learning how to effectively mentor and teach trainees in a supportive environment; and honing clinical skills
in preparation for the return to medical school. This training is ideal for a future physician-scientist with the goal
of improving patient care at the intersection of basic research and clinical reproductive interventions."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally. The root cause of CVD is a chronic
inflammatory disease of the arterial wall called atherosclerosis. A critical determinant of atherosclerosis is
macrophage inflammatory phenotype. Within atherosclerosis, anti-inflammatory pathways are dysfunctional,
which results in pro-inflammatory stimuli driving macrophage phenotype. We have identified Paired
immunoglobulin-like receptor B (PirB) as a novel inhibitor of macrophage-mediated inflammation by facilitating
apoptotic cell digestion and promoting mitochondrial function. The aims of this proposal will determine the
mechanisms by which PirB inhibits inflammation through phagosomal and mitochondrial signaling pathways. We
will use macrophages containing a lysosomal reporter to track phagosome maturation and cargo fate.
Additionally, we will dissect the molecular mechanism by which PirB regulates mitochondrial metabolic function
and signaling."

Depression is one of the most common perinatal complications, with 1 in 7 mothers qualifying for a diagnosis of
postpartum depression (PPD) and even higher rates for those who identify as Hispanic/Latine, Black or African
American, American Indian, or Alaska Native, or by multiple races or ethnicities. This project addresses this
major gap in services to prevent PPD, particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged and minoritized
groups. It tests the benefit of a virtual perinatal preventive intervention in English and Spanish to increase access,
scalability and address the mental health needs of underserved populations. This project will test the virtual
verison against the in-person version of a service-ready efficacious preventive intervention in a randomized
controlled trial (RCT). Consistent with the third priority from RFA-MH-21-240, this effectiveness trial will provide
a test of a preventive intervention with a strong evidence base that is scalable and can be delivered with fidelity
by service providers in settings where obstetric care is received. In this project, pregnant women will be
randomized to receive an evidence-based group prevention program (Reach Out, Stay Strong, Essentials for
New Moms; ROSE) designed for perinatal populations either a) in person, delivered at the hospital where they
are receiving prenatal care or b) virtually, delivered by the same staff via video conferencing, both offered in
English and Spanish. This project will test the following aims: 1: Test effectiveness of a virtual group preventive
intervention program on reducing postpartum depression compared to in-person delivery. 2: Identify mechanisms
of change for the intervention and characteristics that predict who receives the greatest benefit. 3: Provide
implementation recommendations for transporting and sustaining programs in other women’s healthcare
settings. The discoveries generated by this project will establish a preventive intervention model that can be
implemented at scale in diverse healthcare and community settings as a low-cost, high reach means of
preventing postpartum depression."

Uncontrolled disease fluctuations in a subset of joints, referred to as flares, can be a common experience in
autoimmune arthropathies even in the context of overall good disease control with disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Standard-of-care non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or corticosteroids can
provide temporary symptomatic relief, but these are ineffective at preventing recurrence and flare-mediated joint
damage. An unmet need exists for durable flare control agents that potentially complement standard-of-care
DMARDs. The objective of the fellowship application is to develop and test a nanoparticle-based
immunomodulatory agent for enhancing local flare control while avoiding generalized immunosuppression. The
agent is delivered to the lymph nodes proximal to the inflamed joint where pre-existing antigen presenting cells,
widely recognized as key activators of autoreactive cells, are harnessed to promote flare protection. Aim 1 will
optimize the agent and measure local and systemic concentrations to identify the safe dose range for achieving
modulation of antigen presenting cells and durable flare control. Aim 2 will identify potential biomarkers for agent
responsiveness and assess flare control in combination with a standard-of-care DMARD. The results of this
project will assess feasibility of promoting immunomodulatory antigen presenting cells to improve flare
control in a well-established mouse model of autoimmune arthritis. If successful, in the longer term, the project
will pave the way for a new approach to treat flares and advance the NIAMS mission of developing new
treatments for unmet needs in arthritis. The training program will enrich the applicant's knowledge and skills in
immunoengineering, drug delivery and autoimmune disease. Gaining expertise and scientific competency in the
subject matter through the project will prepare the applicant for a career in rheumatic disease research."
10903595,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The applicant proposes two years of fellowship support to complete their Ph.D. training in developmental biology.
Research and training will focus on learning and using computational and quantitative imaging approaches to
understand mechanisms of cell state transitions underlying organ size control during zebrafish fin regeneration.
Adult zebrafish fins, including their bony ray skeletons, regenerate to the original size and shape irrespective of
the extent or type of injury. Injury activates intra-ray fibroblasts that migrate distally to form the blastemal
mesenchyme. The distal mesenchyme, or “niche” cells, then upregulates the transcription factor Dachshund
(Dach) and Wnts that promote regenerative outgrowth. Niche cells gradually deplete over the course of
regeneration, slowing outgrowth. Outgrowth stops as niche cells deplete below a critical level, coincident as the
fin regains its initial size and shape. Size restoration is thus dependent on the number of fibroblasts activated
upon injury, which may simply reflect the volumetric capacity of tapering bony rays. Long-finned zebrafish models
show that fibroblast-lineage bioelectric signaling regulates niche depletion by an unknown mechanism. Dynamic
Dach and Snail mesenchymal marker expression, single cell transcriptomics, and photoconvertible lineage
tracing suggest that niche cells transition back to a mature fibroblast state to repopulate the intra-ray space.
However, epithelial marker expression and proliferation studies suggest there may be distinct proliferative and
non-proliferative niche populations. This observation indicates that quiescent distal niche cells may transition
through a transit-amplifying state and then finally to a mature fibroblast state. The applicant will (1) use existing
single cell RNA-sequencing data to identify fibroblast-lineage cell states, (2) use mathematical modeling to
determine whether membrane voltage acts as a bioelectric signal to control proliferation of transit amplifying
cells, and (3) probe whether quiescent cells transition into transit-amplifying cells through cell labeling and
progeny analysis. The applicant will pursue these studies as a member of the Stankunas laboratory at the
University of Oregon, a leading center for developmental biology and zebrafish research. A leading external
expert will facilitate rigorous mathematical modeling and training. Specialized advanced coursework, formal
research presentations, participation within the Developmental Biology Training Program, remote and in-person
interactions with expert mathematical modelers, and targeted conference attendance will complement research-
based training. These combined efforts will support the applicant’s transition to a postdoctoral position
integrating computational and wet lab approaches to developmental biology questions. Long term, this training
will support the applicant’s career goal of becoming an independent researcher while facilitating the inclusion of
disabled persons in research."

10898174,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Despite effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV resides in infected cells as integrated proviruses and persists
lifelong. While ART suppresses plasma viral load to clinically undetectable levels, ART does not kill the existing
HIV-infected cells. HIV-induced chronic immune activation accelerates aging, increases risks of premature
cardiovascular diseases, and increases cancer risks. It was believed that HIV latently infected cells, as opposed
to transcriptionally active HIV-infected cells, are the major barrier to cure. Transcriptionally active HIV-infected
cells should presumably die of viral cytopathic effects or immune clearance and therefore were not the major
focus of research. However, recent studies revealed that transcriptionally active HIV-infected cells can survive
viral cytopathic effect, escape immune clearance, persist, and proliferate despite suppressive ART. This is
because although ART inhibits viral enzyme function, ART does not inhibit HIV LTR promoter activity. Despite
suppressive ART, HIV LTR promoter fires bursts of viral protein expression in people living with HIV under
suppressive ART and induce immune activation. Our central hypothesis is that transcriptionally active HIV-
infected CD4+ T cells drive chronic immune activation in tissues. Our goal is to examine HIV-induced immune
activation at the single-cell level. Identifying HIV-infected cells for mechanistic understanding is extremely
challenging because of the rarity and heterogeneity of HIV-infected cells. First, only 1 in a million CD4+ T cells
harbor infectious HIV provirus, while around 1000 per million CD4+ T cells harbor defective HIV provirus. The
remaining 99.9% of CD4+ T cells are uninfected. Therefore, bulk transcriptomic approaches measure the 99.9%
of uninfected cells and do not reflect the cellular states of HIV-infected cells. Second, CD4+ T cells are extremely
heterogeneous because of distinct T cell differentiation (such as naïve, central memory, and effector memory),
polarization (such as Th1, Th1, Th17, TFH, Treg), immune programs (such as activation, exhaustion, and
cytokine responses). Therefore, single-cell multi-omic profiling is needed to identify the rare and heterogeneous
HIV-infected cells. Third, there is no cellular markers that can specifically distinguish HIV-infected cells from
uninfected cells. Therefore, understanding HIV persistence in vivo has been a major barrier in the field. To resolve
the rarity and heterogeneity of HIV reservoir, our approach is to use single-cell multiomic approaches to profile
the rare HIV-infected cells at the single cell level and examine the heterogeneous infected cells. We pioneered
singlecell multi-omic profiling to advance our understanding of HIV reservoir. Using single-cell ECCITEseq, we
used HIV RNA expression as a surrogate to identify transcriptionally active HIV-infected cells and their single-
cell transcriptome landscape. Using single-cell DOGMAseq, we identified latent (HIV DNA+ RNA–) and
transcriptionally active (HIV RNA+) HIV-infected cells and their epigenetic regulators, transcriptional landscape,
and surface protein expression. In Aim 1, we will examine the immune activation programs in HIV-infected cells.
In Aim 2, we will examine whether HIV infection induces immune activation in uninfected immune cells."
10899832,"The Community Engagement and Dissemination Core (CEDC) will facilitate equitable collaborative and
sustainable relationships with community partners and other stakeholders. Universities have long considered
community engagement as a social responsibility. A more comprehensive approach to working with communities
is required to shift the narrative from viewing communities as groups of people who have needs to recognizing
them as assets. Engaged communities can show institutional leaders and researchers how to better understand
and address social determinants of health and increase the impact of research discoveries. This is the approach
that our NIMHD Center of Excellence in Investigator Development and Community Engagement will take. Our
activities will be undertaken in collaboration with our community-university-government partnership, a
collaboration established in 2014 involving multiple sectors of the community. The active participation of
community and elected leaders will be particularly impactful in translating the results of our research into
measurable impact in health disparities in Buffalo. The CEDC will aid investigators and community co-
investigators during the planning and conduct of research to build community-based participatory research
capacity (Aim 1). Working with the Investigator Development Core the CEDC will work with each pilot study
awardee to 1) provide training in working with the community, 2) link scholars with key community partners in
the planning stages of their project, 3) develop a dissemination plan for their project to be implemented during
the project and after it is completed, and 4) plan and implement an approach for their work to lead to actual
benefit to the community. This often involves the planning of a larger project facilitated by the pilot study, which
in many cases provides key preliminary data for the larger project. The CEDC will work with research teams in
sharing results of research for diverse audiences, including non-scientific community members, policy makers
and community-based stakeholders in translating research findings to promote sustainable community- and
system-level change (Aim 2). We will work closely with the community-based Buffalo Center for Health Equity
who have an extensive communications network with broad reach into the community. The CEDC will offer small
Community Partnership Grants to African American led community-based organizations to support
neighborhood projects designed to mitigate health inequities (Aim 3). This initiative arose from planning
discussions with community members who expressed a clear interest in working with the Center of Excellence
to build capacity and develop critical infrastructure in community-based organizations and bring immediate visible
benefit to community members. Our five-year vision is that the Center of Excellence will catalyze a transformation
of community-based research by expanding our research workforce, training future leaders in the field, and
creating a culture change by influencing UB researchers to design research to address root causes of health
inequities and work toward translating findings into sustainable, system-level changes."
10904118,"SUMMARY
There is an imminent need for effective medications for the treatment of chronic pain, as most available drugs
show low efficacy and tolerability, and in the case of opioids they lead to physic dependence and addiction. This
proposal aims to investigate a promising candidate target for pain treatment: the intracellular protein named
regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4). RGS4 plays a prominent role in signal transduction by controlling the
availability of G protein α and βγ subunits to their effectors and possibly by additional mechanisms. Thus, RGS4
may potently modulate ability of GPCRs to activate their effectors by competing for Gα subunit binding, and may
also control the activation of Gβγ targets, including ion channels, kinases and transcription factors. Our earlier
work demonstrated that knockout of RGS4 does not affect acute nociceptive responses, or the induction of
sensory hypersensitivity in response to peripheral nerve injury (PNI) or inflammation. However, downregulation
of RGS4 leads to recovery from sensory hypersensitivity, suggesting that RGS4-controlled pathways are critical
for synaptic adaptations that promote the maintenance of chronic pain. Our preliminary data using the spared
nerve injury (SNI) and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy (CIPN) models also reveal that long-term PNI in mice
regulates the expression of RGS4 in the thalamus and in lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Here, we will focus
on the study of the functional role of RGS4 in the mouse DRG in sensory and affective manifestations of PNI
and we will determine neuronal type-specific mechanisms of RGS4 action (with a focus on Mrgprd+ cells in which
RGS4 is primarily expressed). We will use mouse genetic tools to determine how interventions in the expression
of the RGS4 gene before or after the induction of nerve injury affect sensory, emotional and biochemical
manifestations of neuropathic pain states. We will use tissue biochemistry and biosensors in DRG cultures to
investigate the role of RGS4 in G protein signaling with emphasis on the competition between RGS4 and the
Gα-subunit interacting protein named GINIP (Gai interacting protein). For these studies, we will combine in vitro
biosensor assays, with biochemical and behavioral studies with genetically modified mice lacking GINIP globally
or in selective nociceptive circuitry. To further investigate the mechanism of RGS4 action under chronic pain, we
will use information from recent single nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-Seq) and we will identify and validate
cell-type specific gene expression adaptations in lumbar DRGs under prolonger PNI states, with emphasis on
cell populations affected by RGS4/GINIP activity. We will continue the analysis and we will test additional genes
that are uniquely affected by RGS4 knockout under PNI for their role in the maintenance of sensory
hypersensitivity. Understanding the impact of RGS4 and regulated pathways in PNI will help develop novel and
efficacious interventions for the management of neuropathic pain."
10902343,"ABSTRACT:
Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in the devastating loss of motor, sensory, and autonomic function below the level
of the lesion. Importantly, most SCIs occur in the cervical and thoracic levels, leaving the locomotor circuits in
the lumbar segments, and sensory afferents below the injury, relatively intact. While these circuits may not be
directly affected by the injury, the loss of descending control can lead to changes in excitability, afferent sprouting,
and other compensatory changes. Regaining proper control of locomotor circuits after injury is crucial for
restoration of efficient locomotion, yet many of the specific circuit rearrangements induced by SCI remain
unknown. Inhibitory interneurons (INs) in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord finely tune incoming sensory afferent
input, and are a possible target for modulating afferent transmission to locomotor circuits after injury. Specifically,
INs regulating proprioceptive afferents are of great interest due to the importance of proprioception on locomotor
recovery after SCI. Locomotor circuits are comprised of spinal INs that control the pattern and rhythm of
locomotion, one population of which expresses the transcription factor Shox2. We have evidence that sensory
afferent pathways to Shox2 INs are a point of plasticity after SCI and treatment with epidural stimulation.
Specifically, the loss of the inhibitory sensory pathway to Shox2 INs after SCI suggests that inhibitory INs
interposed between sensory afferents and Shox2 INs are a potential novel target for improving locomotion after
SCI. Understanding the function of this population, and the mechanisms behind the plasticity of inhibitory sensory
pathways to locomotor circuits may then allow for proper modulation after injury to restore proper control of
locomotor circuits. The proposed experiments will test the overall hypothesis that medial laminae V/VI glycinergic
INs are required for skilled locomotion, and an SCI-induced disruption of proprioceptive afferent input to them is
responsible for the observed dysregulation of afferent pathways to Shox2 INs after SCI. Using a combination of
whole-cell patch clamp, pharmacology, and histology we will identify known deep dorsal inhibitory populations
that overlap with glycinergic INs interposed between sensory afferents and Shox2 INs. Then we will
chemogenetically silence this population of glycinergic INs during skilled locomotor tasks. Together, these
experiments will allow us to functionally identify medial lamina V/VI glycinergic INs. Next, we will use a
combinatorial approach to investigate the mechanism underlying the loss of inhibitory sensory afferent pathways
to Shox2 INs after SCI. Electrophysiology, neural tracing, and immunohistochemistry will be used to evaluate
the proprioceptive afferent input to medial laminae V/VI glycinergic INs and, Shox2 INs after SCI. The findings
from this proposal will provide insight into the role of a specific population of inhibitory INs, and the mechanistic
underpinnings of plasticity within inhibitory sensory pathways to locomotor circuits. This knowledge will be vital
to identify novel therapeutic targets, and guide strategies to restore locomotion after SCI."
10902851,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The objective of this project is to elucidate mechanisms underlying HMGA1 proteins in leukemogenesis
and therapy resistance in KMT2A-rearranged (KMT2A-r) acute myeloid leukemia (AML). KMT2A-r AML is
an aggressive form of leukemia that is resistant to current therapies and therefore highly lethal. KMT2A-r
leukemia is caused by rearrangements of the KMT2A gene (formerly MLL1), which encode abnormal fusion
proteins that drive pro-leukemogenic gene expression, including HOX genes (HOXA9, HOXA10, MEIS1).
Despite advances in our knowledge of the fusion partners and proteins that form complexes with KMT2A-r
proteins, inhibitors developed to target these fusion proteins or their complexes show only modest efficacy in
clinical trials thus far. Moreover, mechanisms underlying KMT2A-r leukemogenesis remain incompletely
understood. Thus, there is a dire need for further research and new therapeutic strategies. Here, I propose a
novel approach by focusing on the High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) chromatin regulator as a
fundamental molecular switch required for leukemogenesis and therapy resistance in KMT2A-r AML.
Our scientific premise that HMGA1 drives leukemogenesis and therapy resistance in KMT2A-r AML is based
on the following preliminary results: 1) HMGA1 is upregulated in KMT2A-r AML with the highest levels after
blasts become resistant to therapy, 2) HMGA1 is required for proliferation and clonogenicity in KMT2A-r AML
cell lines, 3) HMGA1 binds to the promoter regions and induces expression of leukemogenic HOX genes in
KMT2A-r AML cell lines, 4) HMGA1 drives proliferation and represses the CDKN1A tumor suppressor locus in
KMT2A-r AML. 5) A recent publication identified CDKN1A repression as a driver of chemoresistance in KMT2A-
r AML, although mechanisms underlying its repression were unknown, 6) Prior studies show that treating
refractory AML patients with a cyclin-CDK inhibitor (flavopiridol/alvocidib) represses HMGA1 and downstream
genes in the patient blasts, suggesting it could target HMGA1 pathways in KMT2A-r AML.
Based on these exciting preliminary data, we hypothesize that: 1) HMGA1 drives leukemogenesis and
chemoresistance in KMT2A-r AML by directly inducing HOX genes and repressing CDKN1A, and, 2) Targeting
HMGA1 will enhance responses to cytotoxic therapy. To test this, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1)
To define the role HMGA1 in KMT2A-r leukemogenesis and chemoresistance, and, 2) To determine how HMGA1
induces HOX genes and represses CDKN1A in KMT2A-r AML.
Impact: This study will shed light on mechanisms underlying leukemogenesis in KMT2A-r AML and
could lead to novel therapeutic strategies. The JHU School of Medicine provides an excellent environment
for the PI, Bailey West, to complete the proposed studies. Ms. West will learn cutting-edge techniques, produce
first-author manuscripts, and present her work; this training will rigorously prepare her for an academic career."

More than 22,000 people each year die of alcoholic liver disease in the US alone with estimates as high as 3.3
million deaths each year globally (5.9% of all global deaths). So clearly, alcoholic liver disease is a major
biomedical health concern world-wide. Because the liver is the major site of ethanol metabolism, it is the most
susceptible organ to alcohol-induced injury. Although the progression of alcoholic liver disease is well-described
clinically, the molecular basis for alcohol-induced liver injury is not understood. This proposal expands on our
findings that microtubules are more highly acetylated and more stable in ethanol-treated WIF-B cells, liver slices,
livers from ethanol-fed rats/mice - and from our preliminary data - also in human liver tissue. We have further
shown that microtubule hyperacetylation directly explains alcohol-induced defects in protein trafficking and lipid
droplet dynamics. In this proposal, we will test the broad hypothesis that ethanol-induced protein modification
differentially disrupts microtubule-based protein/organelle motility that leads to peroxisome dysfunction
and promotes alcoholic steatosis. We will also test the hypothesis that supplementation with caloric
restriction mimetics protects against injury. Our findings that both microtubule acetylation and acetaldehyde
adduction impair protein trafficking to similar extents suggest both modifications contribute to the impaired
motility observed in ethanol-treated cells. We will examine how microtubule modifications (and modifications on
other proteins) differentially impact protein and organelle dynamics in Aim 1. In Aim 2, we expand our studies
on altered organelle motility to peroxisome dynamics. Despite their known role in regulating oxidative stress and
fatty acid metabolism, peroxisomes are under-studied in their contribution to the progression of alcohol-induced
steatosis. Emerging evidence indicates that microtubules and associated motors are important regulators of
peroxisomal dynamics, and by extension, their function – a relationship we will explore in the context of alcohol-
induced steatosis. Aim 3 takes us in an exciting direction where we expand on our studies with spermidine on
its hepatoprotective effects against fibrosis. Spermidine and hydroxycitrate (caloric restriction mimetics) induce
protein deacetylation (including microtubule deacetylation) by different mechanisms. Thus, in Aim 3 we propose
that this enhanced protein deacetylation will counteract alcohol-induced global protein acetylation (and alcohol-
induced microtubule-dependent protein trafficking) to confer hepatoprotection. We further propose that
spermidine promotes cytoprotective autophagy thereby decreasing the levels of accumulated lipid droplets and
dysfunctional mitochondria and peroxisomes. In general, studies will be initiated in polarized, hepatic WIF-B
cells, confirmed in livers from ethanol/high fat diet-fed mice, and where possible, confirmed in human tissue. We
have garnered the support of several others to provide their expertise to the project. We have continued access
to the Imaging Facility located at nearby Johns Hopkins Institute of Basic Biomedical Studies and are members
of the Hopkins GI Center allowing us access to many services and resources. The expansive expertise of our
collaborators, the access to high-end resources coupled with our considerable expertise in hepatic cell biology
situate us perfectly to perform these important mechanistic and translational studies."
10880656,"The rate of mortality by suicide is approximately twenty times higher in psychiatric disorders as compared to
the general population. Among psychiatric disorders, bipolar disorder (BD) has the highest rate of attempts
(~40%), which is 2-3 times higher than in major depressive disorder (MDD). While neural circuits underlying
suicidal behavior have been proposed, these have emerged largely based on studies of MDD and exclude the
cerebellum. Work from our group and others have implicated the cerebellum in suicidal behavior, impulsivity,
and bipolar disorder suggesting that it may play a key role in suicidal behavior. In this study, we propose to
study a putative suicide risk circuit (SRC) that includes the cerebellum to prospectively evaluate the
connectome of this neural circuit and metabolism in the nodes of the proposed SRC. To assess the SRC, brain
imaging coupled with measurements of suicidal behavior, psychiatric symptoms, and personality traits will be
acquired in a sample of 300 subjects with a psychiatric disorder (BD I and MDD) with 75 having a prior suicide
attempt and 75 without a prior attempt for each psychiatric diagnosis. Seventy-five matched controls will also
be acquired. Brain imaging will include multi-modal MR imaging to study anatomy (T1, T2), functional (task
based fMRI), connectome (resting state fMRI and diffusion imaging) and metabolism (MRS and T1ρ). This data
will be used to answer the following aims: Aim 1) Does the SRC differentiate suicide attempter from non-
attempter in BD? and Aim 2) Does the SRC differentiate suicide attempter / non-attempter in MDD in the same
way as BD? This work will increase our understanding of the brain circuits implicated in suicidal behavior, how
the cerebellum may be involved in these circuits, and what metabolic differences are associated with suicidal
behavior. In addition, the study will reveal if the same neural circuit (i.e. the SRC) plays a significant role in
suicidal behavior across disorders or if there are different neural circuits involved across disorders. The goal of
this project is to better undertand the neurobiology of suicidality to help identify those at risk for a future suicide
attempt. We anticipate that this study will reveal new targets for treating subjects at risk for suicidal behavior.

Epilepsy is a debilitating neurological disorder characterized not only by spontaneous recurrent seizures, but
also severe cognitive deficits that present a significant detriment to quality of life. Changes in synchrony within
and across brain regions have been implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), but it is unclear how these
changes contribute to memory deficits. Electrophysiological recordings from the Shuman lab have shown that
coherence between the hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is disrupted in a mouse model of
TLE. This synchronization between hippocampus and MEC has been theorized to be important for spatial
memory by allowing efficient information transfer at distinct phases of theta. However, there have been few
causal studies on the impact of synchronization due in part to limited technical methods to manipulate the
timing of inputs in behaving mice. Thus, investigating the causal nature of altered synchrony in cognitive
dysfunction requires the application of novel tools to precisely manipulate the timing neural activity. To address
this gap, I have developed a closed-loop optogenetic system that can stimulate neural populations at distinct
phases of endogenous theta oscillations. In this proposal, I will use this system to test the hypothesis that the
timing of MECII and MECIII inputs relative to endogenous theta oscillations controls memory performance in
both healthy and epileptic mice. I will employ a head-fixed virtual reality task to test the effect of altered input
timing on spatial memory performance and will investigate the role of this timing on other measures of
synchrony including interregional coherence. I hypothesize that mistiming MEC inputs in healthy mice will
impair memory performance and disrupt coherence, while restoring proper timing in epileptic mice will improve
performance and increase coherence. Furthermore, I will use a layer specific viral approach to restrict
optogenetic stimulation to afferents arriving to the hippocampus from MEC layer II or layer III and determine
the distinct role of each of these inputs into hippocampus. Together, the results of these experiments will
determine how the timing of inputs into the hippocampus impacts spatial processing in both health and disease
and will pave the way for future therapeutic targets in epilepsy."
10892128,"SUMMARY: Photoreceptor cell death is the ultimate cause of vision loss in many retinal disorders, and there is
an unmet need for neuroprotective therapies to improve their survival. The bioenergetic requirements of
photoreceptors rival that of neoplastic tissue. To meet this demand, photoreceptors have unique metabolic
adaptations to budget their bioenergetic needs. One such adaptation is the utilization of aerobic glycolysis, so
glucose metabolism has been central in the study of photoreceptor physiology. Even so, fuels other than
glucose may be used to meet the needs of photoreceptors, especially during times of bioenergetic stress.
Given their crowded, nutrient-limited environment, photoreceptors may have evolved to remove any rigid
constraints on fuel sources. This proposal will provide fundamental insight into the contribution of a potential
alternative fuel source to photoreceptor metabolism, function, and survival, while providing the substrate for
critical skills in career development. The long-term goal of this work is to develop the skills needed to pursue
novel therapies that prevent vision loss in photoreceptor degenerations as an independent clinician-scientist.
 The scientific objective of this K08 proposal is to test the hypothesis that glutamine is a key fuel
source to maintain photoreceptor biomass, regulate redox balance, and boost photoreceptor survival during
periods of nutrient deprivation. We propose to assess the metabolic fate of glutamine in vitro and in vivo using
stable-isotope metabolic flux analysis and its contribution to photoreceptor redox balance, function, and
survival by disrupting glutamine catabolism in a photoreceptor-specific, glutaminase (Gls) conditional knockout
mouse. Two focused specific aims will be utilized to investigate our hypothesis: 1) Determine how glutamine
contributes to components of photoreceptor biomass and regulates redox homeostasis.; 2) Determine how
photoreceptors utilize glutamine as an alternative fuel source to promote survival during outer retinal stress.
 The career development objective is to cultivate the skills and mentorship required to develop
expertise in the application, acquisition, and analysis of metabolomics data, and to achieve scientific
independence. The coursework, seminars, and mentorship will complement the research. The multi-
disciplinary team of mentors, each with a complementary skill set, is deeply committed to the principal
investigator’s success. The Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and the University of Michigan
has world-class faculty and facilities, and the research proposed fits exceptionally well with the internationally
recognized expertise in metabolism and metabolomics at the University of Michigan and within the mentoring
team. The institutional environment, mentoring, and career development plan maximize the success of the
research aims and the ability of the principal investigator to become an independent clinician-scientist studying
the interface of photoreceptor metabolism and survival to develop novel therapeutic paradigms that prevent
vision loss in retinal disorders."
10892169,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The overall scope of the problem is that as the US population lives longer, kidney disease becomes more
abundant. In particular, elderly patients face worse disease outcomes, and they are now the largest group to
undergo first-time dialysis. The goal of this proposal is to prove that aged podocytes are central to the many
glomerular changes with aging. Changes to and loss of podocytes remain the best predictors of age-related
glomerulosclerosis and reduced GFR. Major unmet needs are understanding the mechanisms of podocyte
aging and the crosstalk between aged podocytes and neighboring parietal epithelial cells (PECs). To close
these knowledge gaps, we performed a transcriptome analysis comparing podocytes from aged vs. young
mice. Much to our surprise, transcripts for immune response processes such as inflammasome components,
inflammatory factors (e.g. TNFα, interferons, interleukins and chemokines) and SASPs were significantly
enriched. Importantly, similar changes were confirmed in human kidney biopsies.
 Based on these preliminary data, we propose a novel paradigm that aged podocytes secrete inflammatory
signals and SASPs that in autocrine loops directly impact podocytes themselves. Specific Aim #1 will prove
that this newly discovered inflammatory aged podocyte phenotype directly shortens the podocyte's lifespan
and reduces their health-span. We will test the hypotheses that in aged podocytes: (1) Inflammasome-induced
de novo intracellular inflammation reduces podocyte lifespan; (2) The PD1 signaling pathway acts downstream
of the NLRP3 inflammasome; (3) A specific subset of secreted inflammatory mediators accelerates the
podocyte aging phenotype through autocrine loops.
 We also propose a second novel paradigm in which aged podocytes play a paracrine role in accelerating
PEC aging. This is based on the facts that (i) podocyte aging temporally precedes PEC aging; (ii) PEC aging is
typically only present in individual glomeruli in which podocytes exhibit an aged phenotype; (iii) inhibition of the
inflammasome or PD1 pathways in aged podocytes reduces PEC aging. In Specific Aim #2 we propose that
SASPs and inflammatory cytokines derived from aged podocytes accelerate the PEC aging phenotype through
paracrine loops. We will test the hypotheses that: (1) The inflammatory podocyte phenotypes in aged mice
precedes and accelerates PEC aging. (2) A distinct subset of SASPs and inflammatory cytokines derived from
aged podocytes accelerates the PEC aging phenotype.
 These studies are based on many innovative experimental approaches including aging studies in transgenic
mice, primary human podocytes and PECs, Design-of-Experiment methodology and novel co-culture models.
Finally, the focus of our study is significant for its short-term translational impact by intersecting our mouse
data with a large transcriptomic data set on aged human kidneys and its long-term impact in developing
therapeutic strategies that will counter the age-dependent demise of kidney function."

The University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW) is a vibrant research institution that seeks to establish a one-year
Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (UW-PREP) to develop skills for underrepresented minority
(URM) students to be successful in gaining leadership roles in the biomedical workforce. The goals of this
program are to prepare students to apply, matriculate, and then graduate from outstanding doctoral (Ph.D.)
programs from the UW and throughout the country. While the UW hosts a wide range of URM STEM initiatives
ranging from high school through undergraduate, graduate, postdoctoral and faculty programs, the establishment
of UW-PREP will address a gap in our programming. The mission of the UW-PREP is threefold: 1) to provide
opportunities and evidence-based platforms for participants to learn how to design and conduct impactful,
rigorous and reproducible scientific research; 2) to foster the growth of participants in areas of professional
development that promote self-awareness and advocacy, build science communication skills, and reinforce an
identity as a scientist; and 3) to advance an inclusive culture of mentoring, research integrity, and life-long
learning. The UW-PREP will be established with a primary focus on a mentored research experience in which
participants will be immersed in developing skills needed to design and conduct rigorous, ethical research. The
UW has outstanding resources and infrastructure in place to support innovative and impactful research. PREP
Research Education Activities will be designed on recent UW-developed and published Entering Research
curricula, a collection of evidence-based active learning activities. Activities will reinforce the importance of rigor
and reproducibility and foundations of responsible conduct of research that will also be inherent to their mentored
laboratory experience. They are also designed to help students devise their Individual Development Plan (IDP)
and will incorporate Professional Development activities to build STEM-specific social capital to navigate the
hidden curriculum of academic research spaces in a large research institution. Faculty advisors and benchside
mentors will participate in evidence-based Mentor Training curricula designed around six core competencies:
Align Expectations, Communicate Effectively, Assess Understanding, Address Equity and Inclusion, Foster
Independence, and Promote Professional Development. PREP Leadership and funded, diverse faculty enjoy
outstanding institutional support and coordination of evidence-based curricula to build a PREP that will help to
launch exceptionally trained and confident URM scholars into the biomedical workforce."

DNA is frequently damaged by exogenous sources ranging from exposure to UV light to toxic chemicals in the
environment. To fix the damage caused by these agents and maintain genomic stability, cells have multiple
efficient DNA repair mechanisms. Some damage, though, will inevitably escape repair if the burden of damage
is too high. Unrepaired DNA damage can block DNA synthesis and have serious consequences for the cell
and for human health. A study by Brown et al. used azidothymidine (AZT) as a tool to block replication in E.
coli to discover essential genes for resolving stalled replication forks. AZT is a thymidine analog that can be
incorporated during synthesis and prevents primer extension, causing replication to stall and single-strand
DNA gaps to form. Two genes, yoaA and holC, were discovered to be vital for resolving stalled DNA replication
in AZT treated E. coli cells. The yoaA gene encodes for an XPD/Rad3-like helicase. The four human XPD/Rad-
3 like helicases (FANCJ, XPD, RTEL1, and CHLR1) contribute to genomic stability and if compromised, can
cause various genetic diseases and an increased risk of cancer. The holC gene encodes for chi, which is a
part of two different complexes. Chi is an accessory subunit of the DNA polymerase III clamp loader and forms
a complex with the holoenzyme. Chi also binds YoaA to create a functional YoaA-chi helicase. Chi is known to
bind single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB) and this interaction is necessary for resolving lesions that stall
replication. SSB is an essential protein found in all domains of life, coats single-stranded (ss) DNA, and
interacts with over a dozen DNA repair and replication proteins. How YoaA, chi, and SSB work together to
resolve damage that halts replication is unknown. Therefore, this fellowship aims to characterize SSB
interactions with YoaA-chi with biochemical techniques to understand this novel repair pathway. It is
hypothesized SSB regulates the ability of YoaA-chi to unwind double-stranded DNA to resolve lesions at the
replication fork based on preliminary data which shows that the helicase activity of YoaA-chi is decreased in
the presence of SSB. How SSB binds YoaA-chi will be elucidated, be it either by the known location on chi or
by a new interaction possibly on YoaA (aim 1). Because SSB regulates a variety of DNA-binding proteins
through various mechanisms, several facets of YoaA-chi that SSB could regulate will be investigated. It will be
determined if SSB changes the substrate affinity of YoaA-chi (aim 2) or the helicase activity of YoaA-chi (aim
3). This will be the first study into how SSB regulates YoaA-chi and the contribution these proteins have in a
novel DNA repair mechanism. This research will also provide significant contributions in my training to become
an independent biochemist and the environment at the University of Florida will allow me to be successful."
10892200,"Although there is increasing recognition that the cerebellum is involved in cognition as well as motor function,
the manner in which the cerebellum contributes to cognition is uncertain. The cerebellar sequencing
hypothesis posits that the cerebellum acquires sequence information, makes sequence predictions, and
detects sequence violations via a forward model. Sequencing requirements are prominent in both verbal
working memory (VWM) and language acquisition. Although cerebellar activation has been observed in many
VWM and language investigations, the brainstem/cerebellar neural correlates of sequencing in cognition, and
the influence of cerebellar sequence predictions on neocortical targets, are poorly understood. In Aim 1, we will
investigate the cerebellar sequencing hypothesis in VWM. Our preliminary data indicate inferior olive (IO)
involvement in sequence acquisition, whereas sequence violations are characterized by large increases in
cerebro-cerebellar functional connectivity (FC). We hypothesize that cerebellar ataxia patients, who exhibit
gray and white matter degeneration, should exhibit neural and behavioral abnormalities in sequencing-
dependent VWM performance. Using fMRI, we hypothesize group differences in IO activation during sequence
acquisition and FC between cerebellum and known critical forebrain regions (CFRs) for VWM (left inferior
frontal gyrus [LIFG], supplementary motor area, and left temporal/parietal cortex) during sequence violation.
Using structural neuroimaging, we predict group differences in cerebellar gray matter and peduncle integrity,
as well as in structural connectivity between cerebellum and CFRs. We will correlate these structural and
functional measures with task performance to infer brain-behavior relationships. In Aim 2, we will test the
generalization of cerebellar sequencing in a statistical learning/language acquisition paradigm. Ataxia and
control subjects will receive fMRI during a learning phase in which they listen to a pseudo language to learn
transition probabilities of sequences of phonemes, and a test phase in which they will detect phoneme
sequence violations. We hypothesize that ataxia patients will be impaired in detecting incorrect sequences or
novel transitions of syllables. As in Aim 1, we hypothesize group differences in IO activation during sequence
acquisition and changes in FC between cerebellum and known CFRs during sequence violation, but for
statistical learning those CFRs are left superior temporal gyrus, striatum, and LIFG. Finally, the cerebellum is
hypothesized to provide its sequence prediction computation to neocortical targets, and in Aim 3, using
cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with concurrent functional MRI, we will test the hypothesis
that TMS disruption during a sequencing task will produce greater changes in neocortical activation relative to
an analogous control task that does not have the predictive component. These investigations will improve our
understanding of cerebellar involvement in cognitive function as well as cognitive abnormalities in patients with
cerebellar damage, or with diseases linked to the cerebellum."

Timiya S. Nolan is an Assistant Professor in the College of nursing at The Ohio State University. Dr. Nolan is
responding to PAR-18-336 to obtain the skills, knowledge and mentored research experience that are essential
for a career as a nurse scientist focusing on cancer survivorship health disparities research. Her long-term goal
is to build an independent program of research that identifies contextual factors of quality of life (QOL) among
young (18-44) breast cancer survivors from underrepresented minority groups and translates findings to the
development, implementation, and dissemination/translation of multi-level QOL interventions and policy
changes. The short-term goals for the award period include developing expertise in biobehavioral and
environmental contributors to cancer and health outcomes (particularly QOL), scientific processes in the
conduct of longitudinal intervention and observational trials, advanced quantitative methods, manuscripts
writing and grantsmanship toward building a presence in her respective field among young and African
American (AA) breast cancer survivors. Young AA survivors report poorer quality of life (QOL), and face more
negative social determinants of health (e.g., low socioeconomic status, limited access to care, discrimination)
than young White survivors. Yet, there are no published interventions that comprehensively address QOL (i.e.,
physical, psychological, social and spiritual well-being) in young AA survivors. This proposal is aimed at
evaluating processes and preliminary outcomes of a targeted QOL intervention vs. control in young AA
survivors in treatment for early (I-II) & late (III) stage breast cancer. Dr. Nolan adapted this Y-AMBIENT
intervention from an existing evidence-based intervention using input from young AA survivors and healthcare
providers. We will conduct a two-arm, pilot randomized controlled trial to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and
preliminary health-related outcomes of Y-AMBIENT (themed education, written materials, and videos) vs. an
attention control (enhanced usual care). We will recruit 40 young AA survivors who have completed primary
breast cancer treatment (n=20 per group and equal representation of those with a history of early and late
stage breast cancer within). We will measure feasibility via study recruitment and retention (i.e., study
enrollment and study contact completion) and protocol acceptability with satisfaction, usefulness, use of
strategies via our Topical Concern and Strategy Sheet. We will triangulate qualitative and quantitative
responses from each study contact to (a) identify participants’ perceptions of its acceptability, (b) willingness to
participate in aspects of the protocol (participant burden), and (c) use of self-management strategies. At
baseline, two-, and five-months, we will examine health-related outcomes (i.e., QOL, spiritual well-being, self-
efficacy, and social support) within and between groups using descriptive and multiple-effects modeling
techniques. Mentored research accomplished during the award period will lay the foundation for a large
efficacy trial of Y-AMBIENT and future identification of other modifiable factors to address with interventions."
10906236,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This proposal will address the critical need for new and modifiable targets to enhance mobility and restore
independence to those in our rapidly aging population. Due to reduced ankle push-off power, older adults walk
slower and with higher metabolic energy cost than younger adults. As our central premise, we contend that
hallmark age-associated deficits in push-off intensity during walking have been far too often mistakenly
attributed solely to the plantarflexor muscles, and instead originate interdependently with those in the active,
passive, and structural regulation of foot mechanical power. This premise paves the way for translational
opportunities to augment foot structure and function to enhance independence and quality of life. This study
combines the research agendas of two highly productive investigators and leverages the research infrastructure
of two peer institutions. Aim 1 will be the first to study mechanical power interactions between the human foot
and ankle in governing reduced push-off intensity and walking economy in older adults across a wide variety of
everyday walking tasks. By combining metabolic measurements with state-of-the-art biomechanical and
bioenergetic modeling, we will test the hypothesis that older adults exhibit higher mechanical energy losses via
foot structures than young adults – aging effects that: (i) are larger for walking tasks that increase foot demand,
(ii) misappropriate ankle moment and power during push-off, and thereby (iii) correlate with shorter 6 min walk
distance and increased metabolic energy cost compared to young adults. Aim 2 will provide mechanistic insight
into aging effects on the active, passive, and structural regulation of foot-ankle mechanical power interactions
during walking. Using a series of controlled loading paradigms on a dynamometer combined with advanced in
vivo ultrasound imaging and novel electromyographic biofeedback, we will test the hypotheses that older adults
exhibit: (i) reduced foot and plantarflexor muscle strength and (ii) lower structural stiffness of and (iii) reduced
structural connectivity between series elastic tissues spanning the foot and ankle – changes that require elevated
plantar intrinsic muscle activation to maintain requisite foot stiffness and associate with reduced ankle moment
and power output during push-off in walking. Finally, as a translational benchmark, Aim 3 will show that shoe-
stiffness modifications that act in parallel with the plantar aponeurosis and intrinsic muscles can mitigate age-
associated deficits in push-off function during walking. Supported by promising pilot data, we will test the
hypotheses that older adults walking with increased shoe insole stiffness will exhibit: (i) smaller mechanical
energy losses at the foot, (ii) more favorable plantarflexor muscle contractile dynamics, (iii) greater peak ankle
moment and power output, and thus (iv) longer 6 min walk distance and reduced whole-body metabolic energy
cost. Ultimately, this work will establish a paradigm shift in our biomechanical understanding and clinical
management of age-related mobility impairment toward feasible and cost-effective devices to modify foot-ankle
function – an outcome with significant potential to enhance independence and quality of life for millions."
10913635,"Project Summary
DNA recording is a recently developed technology that allows cellular signaling events of interest to be followed
over time without removing cells from their physiological context. During a DNA recording experiment, genetically
engineered cells expressing the DNA recorder acquire mutations at a “recording locus” as the result of transient
cellular events, without perturbing their normal phenotype. At the end of the experiment, once their eventual
phenotype is known, cells can be collected and their histories determined by sequencing the recording locus.
The work proposed here will lead to a DNA recorder that is not limited, as current technology is, to recording one
or two cellular events per experiment, but can record dozens of events in parallel, allowing an unbiased
examination of cell history in any context compatible with genetically engineered cells. In this project, the new
DNA recorder will be used to study long-term effects for a cell of experiencing significant spontaneous DNA
damage. Although DNA damage is very well-studied, it has not previously been possible to follow the rare cells
that experience significant spontaneous damage, especially in an in vivo mammalian context. The new DNA
recorder will be developed in stages: First, intracellular recording machinery, based on a pre-existing recorder,
will be created for a small number of cellular events associated with the DNA damage response. Next, the fidelity
of this new recording machinery will be extensively validated in cultured cells and cancer xenografts. Finally, a
new recording architecture will be developed and validated, before being introduced into a transgenic mouse to
identify how spontaneous DNA damage affects cell fate determination during normal development."

Sixty percent of older adults who start osteoporosis drug therapy (ODT) with an oral bisphosphonate (BP) have
long-term exposure (3 or more years with 80% or higher adherence). Although a minimum of 6 to 12 months of
BP treatment is required to reduce fracture risk, BPs have extended half-lives and can provide benefits long
after discontinuation. Clinical trials have identified little difference in fracture risk for women who stopped
versus continued BP after 3 to 5 years. Further, prolonged BP use has been linked to adverse events like
atypical femoral fracture (AFF). Thus, guidelines recommend a drug holiday (pause in therapy) for most
patients after 3 to 5 years of BP use. Patients at high fracture risk are recommended to continue BP or switch
to another ODT, like denosumab, teriparatide, abaloparatide, or raloxifene. Several critical gaps in knowledge
exist about the risks and benefits of long-term BP use, drug holidays, ODT switching on clinical outcomes and
adverse events, particularly in groups with limited representation in trials like men and nursing home (NH)
residents. This proposal has three specific aims: (1) Among community-dwelling older adults with at least 3
years of BP use, examine the effects of BP drug holidays and ODT switching on fractures, fracture sequelae
(e.g., death, entry into NH), and AFF. (2) Among NH residents with at least 3 years of ODT, compare the
effects of discontinuing versus continuing ODT on fractures/sequelae and patient-centered outcomes (e.g.,
functioning, pain); and (3) Develop and validate clinical prediction algorithms for osteoporotic fracture and AFF
to guide clinicians making decisions on whether to initiate a drug holiday. Our central hypothesis is that the
effects of long-term ODT strategies will be dependent on treatment length, type, and patient characteristics.
The rigorous studies we propose will use multinational linked administrative and clinical datasets. The study
population will comprise older adults aged 66 years or older in the US and Ontario, Canada who have at least
3 years of long-term ODT. Data for this study will come from 1) Linked, universal healthcare and medication
claims data for all people (community-dwelling and NH) aged ≥65 years in Ontario; 2) U.S. Medicare claims on
community-dwelling older adults; and 3) Electronic health record (EHR) data for up to 10,000 NHs linked to
Medicare claims. We will implement a validated data cleaning algorithm for osteoporosis medication claims
and novel rolling window method to capture long-term ODT. Time-varying propensity score approaches and
novel causal inference methods like target trial emulation will be employed. This project will generate critical,
generalizable evidence to guide long-term ODT, prevent fractures, and minimize AFF among older adults. This
research will directly address RFA-AG-22-018, the Appropriate Use of Drug Therapies for Osteoporotic
Fracture Prevention Pathways to Prevention Workshop Panel Recommendations 1 and 4, and Strategic Goal
C of the National Institute on Aging. Additionally, the project will create an international data partnership to
leverage EHR and universal healthcare data to answer emerging research questions on ODT."
10899744,"~30 million people in the US have chronic kidney disease (CKD) and are at significantly increased risk of
cardiovascular (CV) disease and mortality. One major mechanism contributing to increased CV risk in this
patient population is chronic over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). SNS overactivity in
CKD leads to difficult-to-control blood pressure (BP), and an abnormal circadian rhythm of BP characterized by
failure to decrease BP at night (i.e. nondipping), that is independently associated with increased CV risk.
Current strategies to combat SNS overactivation, however, are limited to sympatholytic medications that are
often poorly tolerated with adverse side effects. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop novel, safe, and
well-tolerated strategies for reducing SNS activity to improve clinical CV outcomes in this highly prevalent and
growing population of CKD patients. One such novel approach at improving hemodynamics and autonomic
function in CKD is mindfulness meditation (MM). Multiple prior studies have shown that MM, and specifically
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), significantly reduces BP in a variety of patient populations.
However, the mechanisms underlying the BP-lowering effect of MM are unclear. Small studies using indirect
measures have suggested that MM may modulate the autonomic nervous system; however, no prior studies
have used direct, gold-standard methods to interrogate the sustained effects of MM-based interventions on
SNS. We performed the first studies using direct, intraneural measurements of muscle sympathetic nerve
activity (MSNA) that demonstrate that MM acutely reduces BP and MSNA in CKD. In Aim1 (R61), we will test
the hypothesis that 8 weeks of MBSR leads to sustained reductions in MSNA that are linked to improvements
in daytime BP, and improved nocturnal dipping of BP in CKD. Following these studies, we will determine if
transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS), a simple, noninvasive, self-administered adjunctive therapy,
enhances the sympatho-inhibitory effects of MM in CKD. The vagus nerve, the major effector of the
parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), is comprised of afferent nerve fibers that connect to the nucleus
tractus solitarii (NTS) and other brainstem regions that influence central SNS output and baroreflexes, and
efferent nerve fibers that activate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Both experimental and human
studies have demonstrated that tVNS reduces SNS activity, improves baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), and lowers
inflammation, and our preliminary data demonstrate that tVNS reduces MSNA and improves BRS in CKD. In
Aim 2 (R33), we will test the hypothesis that tVNS augments the beneficial effects of MBSR on MSNA and
ambulatory BP profiles, and ameliorates SNS overactivation by improving arterial BRS and reducing
inflammation in CKD. These studies will elucidate autonomic mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of
MM in CKD, while addressing a critical need for the development of safe, well-tolerated and effective treatment
approaches to ameliorating SNS overactivity, reducing BP and improving CV risk profiles in patient with CKD."
10897357,"My research work largely explores the underlying physiologic questions regarding tiny vesicles called exosomes.
These exosomes are released from many different types of cells or food-derived exosome-like nanoparticles and
I am investigating in VA patients the promising role of exosomes as therapeutic vehicles in delivering treatment
for a diverse but specific group of medical conditions, i.e., inflammation related diseases including widespread
brain inflammation related diseases, obesity, rheumatoid arthritis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH), and
cancer. The accumulation of inflammatory cells that release proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines not only
promote brain disease progression such as Gulf War Syndrome but also rheumatoid arthritis, obesity and/or
cancer. These diseases pose special burdens on veterans who depend on the VA for healthcare.
Since receiving my initial Research Career Scientist award, my research group has published more than 60
manuscripts on this subject. Collectively, our findings support continued funding of my team to investigate the
following aims: (1). Develop a therapeutic strategy to target delivery of therapeutic agents to microglia for
treatment of brain inflammation related diseases such as Gulf War Syndrome. Microglia cells respond vigorously
to both chronic disease and acute insults affecting brain function. Targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to
microglia is needed but highly challenging. The results published from my group (Theranostics, 2022,1220-1246,
Cell Host Microbe, 2022, 944-960, and Small 2022, 2105385) provide emerging evidence for the development
of edible exosome-like nanoparticles as a safe delivery system for targeting different tissues including brain
microglial cells, either by systemic or oral administration. (2). Investigate the role of tumor exosomes in
immunosuppression through induction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, inhibition of dendritic cell
differentiation, and inhibition of activation of NK cell immunotherapy. This approach is supported based on our
published results (Nature Communications. 2017 Feb 17;8:14448, Nature communications. 2015;6:6956). (3).
Exosomes are released from non-tumor cells and we will determine their role in: (a) exosome accumulation in
adipose tissue (Diabetes. 2009 Nov;58(11):2498-505, Hepatology, 2013 57(3):1250-61), we will investigate the
role of adipose tissue exosome-like vesicles in activation of macrophage-induced insulin resistance and induction
of liver NKT cell anergy; and (b) investigate exosomes released from rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts and inhibit
regulatory T cell development. Their role in contributing to damaging joint cartilage will be further investigated.
(4). Based on the results we published as listed below, we will further develop customized exosome-like
nanoparticles from edible plants as therapeutic vehicles to treat/prevent specific disease. (a) Ginger exosome-
like nanoparticles (GELNs) are preferentially taken up by Lactobacillaceae in a GELN lipid-dependent manner
and contain microRNAs that target various genes in Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LGG) to prevent DSS induced
mouse colitis (Cell Host Microbe, 2018, p637-652). Oral administration of oat nanoparticles inhibits brain
inflammation and improves brain memory function of mice fed alcohol by targeting microglial cells (Small 2022,
2105385). We have shown that targeted drug/therapeutic miRNAs (Nature Communications. 2013;4:1867) are
delivered to intestinal macrophages, brain microglia cells (Molecular therapy: 2015, Volume 24, Issue 1, p96–
105), inflammatory tumor sites (Cancer Research, 2015;75:2520-9) by edible and health plant derived ELN.
Broccoli-derived nanoparticle inhibits mouse colitis by induction of tolerogenic gut associated dendritic cells
(Molecular Therapy. 2017), and grape exosome-like nanoparticles induce intestinal stem cells (Molecular
Therapy. 2013 Jul;21(7):1345-57). Collectively, our findings will not only open up a new avenue for investigating
ELNs as a means to protect against the development of inflammation related diseases such as alcohol induced
liver and gut damage, brain and joint inflammation related diseases, but sheds light on studying the cellular and
molecular mechanisms underlying inter-species communication via edible plant-derived nanoparticles."
10879346,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to disproportionally impact sexual and gender minorities (SGM)
compared to non-SGM. Further, because young SGM engage in harmful cardiometabolic health behaviors
(CHB; i.e., dysregulated sleep, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and alcohol use) and experience poorer mental
health at higher rates than non-SGM, interventions are necessary to reduce harmful CHB and poor mental
health before CVD occurs. A key social determinant of harmful CHB and poor mental health among SGM is
exposure to racial, sexual orientation, and gender discrimination. However, as young people are spending
more of their time online, there is a clear gap in our current understanding of how discriminatory features (e.g.,
racial discrimination) of frequented online spaces influence harmful CHB and mental health among SGM.
Further, there is an unmet need to understand the role of protective factors (e.g., online community support) in
the association between online discrimination and CHB and mental health. Therefore, to create culturally
relevant CVD prevention interventions for SGM, we must first understand the ways in which discrimination is
experienced in relevant online spaces (e.g., social media) and how this, in turn, is associated with CHB and
mental health. The proposed work builds on research delineating the multiple environments at which
individuals can experience discrimination, including in physical (e.g., perceived discrimination) and online (e.g.,
a racist post on Twitter) environments. This interdisciplinary team includes a collaboration with the National
Internet Observatory (NIO) to understand individual-level exposure to discrimination in online spaces as well as
exposure to discriminatory online sentiment tied to the places SGM frequent using sentiment analysis with
Twitter data matched to GPS activity spaces method over a 30-day study period. Results of this study will distill
the precedents and characteristics of the online environments defining the association between discrimination
and harmful CHB and mental health among SGM. Specifically, this study aims to evaluate; 1a) the association
between direct daily exposure to online discrimination based on race, sexual orientation, and gender in one’s
social media feed and harmful CHB among diverse SGM; 1b) the association between exposure to place
based discriminatory climate and harmful CHB among SGM; 2) the association between online discrimination
and place based discriminatory climate on daily mood and stress; and 3) social protections (e.g., online
support) that mitigate the association between exposure to individual level social media discrimination, harmful
CHB, mood and stress among SGM. This study is innovative as it uses novel multi-level measurement of
online discrimination, social protections, and CHB among diverse young SGM, who are historically
underrepresented. The significance of this work includes the creation of tailored harmful CHB interventions for
diverse SGM, including smartphone-based triggering of interventions to aid in healthy coping behaviors after
online discrimination is experienced in real time."
10879360,"Establishing mechanism-based therapeutics for Parkinson’s disease (PD), Lewy body dementia (LBD) and other
synucleinopathies is a biomedical priority. Neuropathological and genetic discoveries implicate α-synuclein (αS)
in familial and ‘sporadic’ PD. Recent publications identify significant lipid components with misfolded αS in Lewy
bodies and Lewy neurites, transforming how we conceptualize PD pathogenesis, as lipids are central to many
fundamental cellular processes and are highly abundant in the brain. αS has physiologic and pathogenic
interactions with phospholipid membranes and fatty acids (FAs) and alters lipid homeostasis. Here, we propose
in vitro and in vivo approaches to dissect the interplay of αS with lipid membranes. Experiments are focused on
advancing PD-dysregulated LIPE (hormone sensitive lipase) as a candidate therapeutic target for PD/LBD in
vivo and establishing the mechanism of rescue centered on αS:lipid membrane interactions at the synapse. We
posit a dynamic relationship between normal and pathological forms of αS and FAs. Our central hypothesis is
that αS dyshomeostasis results in cellular FA metabolism imbalance, altering αS:membrane interactions and
disease phenotypes. This hypothesis underpins the PI’s central goal in this R01: to return the abnormal disease-
associated cellular lipid/FA content to equilibrium in several compelling cellular and in vivo models of PD and
LBD. This proposal has 2 distinct Aims focused on advancing monounsaturated FA therapeutic strategies,
addressing mechanistic and therapeutic questions. 1. We propose a mechanistic dissection of αS:membrane
interactions at the synapse, investigating disease-associated synaptic vesicle abnormalities, αS aggregation,
and the role of membrane FA composition in disease phenotype rescue. 2. We propose to evaluate LIPE as a
therapeutic target for reversal of motor deficits and αS neuropathology with detailed genetic, biochemical,
and pharmacological analyses in multiple mouse PD/LBD/synucleinopathy models. The PI has already
reported a FA target for PD, SCD inhibition, now in human PD clinical trials. Additionally, the PI has published
data generated in support of this proposal in patient-derived neurons identifying LIPE (a functionally distinct,
innovative target) as a candidate PD/LBD therapeutic target. These 2 distinct but complementary Aims should
advance mechanistic understanding of αS:membrane interactions and progress a candidate therapeutic target
(LIPE) for lipid dysfunction in PD and LBD."

Miscommunication in the Operating room (OR) is a leading cause of preventable error. Today’s OR is
a loud, complex sound environment, threatening unobstructed communication between team
members. Reducing hospital noise levels has been shown to have a direct impact on improving
patient safety, yet today’s OR contains multiple, competing sound sources: surgical machinery
coupled with intensified layers of simultaneous relevant and irrelevant conversations. These sources
cause a specific type of miscommunication: Speech Communication Interference (SCI), impeding the
team’s ability to communicate with each other, distracting from monitoring patient safety, and
interfering with maintaining a safe care environment. There is a critical need to examine the larger
context of the OR sound environment that leads to miscommunication. We propose groundbreaking
research in surgical error prevention by applying Human Factors principles to OR miscommunication,
including carefully selected evidence-based interventions from other industries. Our overall mission is
to use a Human Factors approach to study the impact of the sound environment on communication in
the OR and the execution of tasks necessary for monitoring patient safety. We will use the findings to
develop and evaluate interventions to enhance overall communication in the OR. Using video and
audio recordings, we will create detailed timelines surrounding Communication Interference events
and interview the participants in that failed communication. Applying Human Factors frameworks will
provide a rich understanding of the impact of overlapping conversations and environmental noises on
patient safety. We will guide a team of content experts, including surgeons, anesthetists, nursing
staff, and hospital leaders in the development and testing of interventions to improve OR
communication. Outcomes will be measured, both pre-intervention and post-intervention, at three
levels: the individual, process and system and will include important clinical outcomes such as
hemorrhage and desaturation. We will use acoustical methods to predict noise interference and
listener testing, for validation. Finally, we will test the interventions at a second hospital to ensure
generalizability. The study will occur at University Health Medical Center and Childrens Mercy
Hospital, providing care to underserved patients, many without commercial insurance. Our lab has
years of experience videorecording in the OR, creating timelines, and conducting interviews, finding
that they have an unparalleled ability to uncover near misses. This project will result in a set of
innovative interventions, grounded in a systems approach, to prevent, mitigate, and recover from
miscommunication, and will lead to a multi-center trial to test the effect of our OR communication
interventions on patient safety in diverse OR settings."

effectiveness of parenting interventions for early childhood populations. Parenting interventions are the first line
of treatment for early childhood mental health concerns due to their benefits on parenting stress and practices
as well as most child emotional and behavioral problems. However, parenting interventions have substantial
engagement issues, and many children show limited to no benefit. The objectives of this K23 are to (a) identify
predictors of suboptimal response to a parenting intervention with well-established efficacy (i.e., behavioral
parent training [BPT]) and (b) to identify ways to modify parenting interventions to benefit those parents, guided
by their input. The central hypothesis is that greater parental executive functioning (EF) difficulties will be linked
to more adverse social determinants of health (SDoHs), and both will diminish parent and child responses to a
brief parenting intervention delivered through telehealth. Parents of children 3 to 7 years with externalizing
concerns will be recruited from two sites – a children’s hospital and a group of Head Start programs – to
receive BPT from trained clinicians. Multiple methods will be used at baseline to measure candidate predictors
(i.e., parental EF, adverse SDoHs) in ecologically valid ways. A mixed methods approach will integrate
qualitative and quantitative results and guide identification of potential adaptations to parenting interventions
needed to achieve their intended benefits. The research project aims to (1) develop and test an ecologically
valid measure of parental EF during parent-child interactions, (2) characterize the roles that parental EF and
SDoH have on treatment response for parent (i.e., parenting stress, harsh parenting) and child outcomes (i.e.,
externalizing concerns), and (3) identify potential adaptations to improve intervention effects among non-
responders. Under the mentorship of a high-quality team including Drs. Laura Anthony, Tina Studts, and Susan
Mikulich, the applicant will acquire advanced training in the following areas: 1) acquire skills in developing and
adapting real-world measures to use in clinical trials, 2) advance knowledge of how SDoHs influence parenting
interventions, 3) gain competencies in mixed methods research, and 4) learn clinical trial methodologies. This
project and training will enable the PI to become an independent scientist focused on discovering ways to
improve the effectiveness of parenting interventions. The proposed training plan and research aims will provide
the PI a foundation to conduct a large-scale trial (R01) testing if tailoring delivery methods (e.g., individual or
group format; in-person or telehealth setting), dose (e.g., lengthen sessions), or content (e.g., target parental
EF) improves the effectiveness of parenting interventions for non-responders. Findings will have significant
implications for interventions that involve parents while treating youth mental health concerns."

More than 15,000 children are newly diagnosed with cancer each year in the US. Although breakthroughs in
treatments have improved the survival rate to over 85%, cancer remains the leading disease-related cause of
death among children while survivors face significant lifelong health-related morbidity and mortality. Studies of
cancer predisposition genes and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have increased our knowledge of
the genetic etiology of pediatric cancers. However, this knowledge base has been built almost exclusively from
investigations of individual cancer types. Given emerging evidence that heterogeneous cancer types also have
a significant shared genetic component, we propose to conduct the first large-scale investigation of pediatric
cancer pleiotropy. To accomplish this goal, we will combine existing genetic datasets to perform pan-cancer
analyses with up to 43,000 pediatric cancer cases representing >25 cancer subtypes from studies including St.
Jude Cloud-hosted research initiatives such as the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project, Real-Time Clinical
Genomics, Genomes 4 Kids, Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, and St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study; the NIH
Common Fund Kids First Pediatric Research Consortium studies; and ZERO Childhood Cancer Program. As a
notable data harmonization effort, we will organize existing datasets to construct the largest uniformly processed
whole-genome/-exome sequencing (WGS/WES) data resource to date with >20,000 pediatric cancer cases.
With these resources, we will conduct a systematic and comprehensive search for common variants and genes
harboring rare cancer predisposition variants (CPVs) that contribute to risks across multiple pediatric cancer
types (Aim 1). This search for specific pleiotropic risk loci will be complemented with cross-pediatric cancer
evaluations of polygenic risk, genetic correlation, and shared heritability to elucidate global patterns of genetic
pleiotropy between cancer subtypes (Aim 2). Lastly, we will characterize the clinical impacts of pleiotropic genetic
susceptibility with CPVs, rare variant burden and polygenic risk scores (PRS) on risks for pediatric cancers and
adverse cancer-related outcomes, including relapse, early mortality, subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs),
and SMN-related mortality (Aim 3). To assess genome-wide significant findings, we will perform replication
studies with independent data from NCI TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective
Treatments) and St. Jude clinical genomics programs (Real-Time Clinical Genomics and Genomes 4 Kids), and
evaluate the biological and functional relevance of pleiotropic variants, including for specific cancer types.
Altogether, this proposed project represents a unique approach to leverage existing genetic/genomic resources
to detect novel risk loci contributing to the development of distinct pediatric cancers and facilitate the generation
of new hypotheses about common carcinogenic mechanisms. Completion of these aims will also potentially
support the development of new algorithms for precision medicine, with enhanced genetic risk profiles to better
predict who may develop pediatric cancer or experience cancer-related adverse outcomes during survivorship."
10880106,"Project Summary/Abstract
The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel approaches to treating meibomian gland
dysfunction (MGD), a major cause of evaporative dry eye disease in the aging population. Meibomian
glands are holocrine glands that are embedded in the tarsal plate of the both the upper and lower eyelid, and
excrete lipid (meibum) onto the surface of the eye to form the lipid layer of the tear film to reduce aqueous tear
evaporation. Dysfunction of the meibomian gland (MGD) identified as atrophy or altered meibum secretion is a
common eyelid disorder having a widespread prevalence of 39-50% in the US population with the incidence
increasing with age that is widely recognized as a major cause of evaporative dry eye disease (EDED). While
patients with EDED and MGD comprise from 37% to 47% of the average Ophthalmologists and Optometrists
practice, management of this disease is primarily palliative due to a lack of knowledge concerning the cellular
and molecular events that cause MGD. To address this UNMET NEED we have evaluated the effects of
conditionally knocking out (CKO) Pparg expression in the meibomian gland using tamoxifen induced
Lrig1Cre/Ppargflox transgenic mice. Our studies show that following 10 weeks of Cre induction there is a male
dominant (3/5 male to 0/35 female) ablation of acini with a shift from meibocyte differentiation to Krt6a+ ductal
differentiation (See Preliminary Studies). These results support our 3D spheroid culture results concerning the
plasticity of meibocyte/ductal epithelial differentiation as well as suggest that there are male/female differences
in the regulation of meibocyte differentiation and renewal by stem/progenitor cells. Together, these findings
suggest the following hypotheses: 1) That direct loss of Pparg signaling leads to an age and sex dependent
loss of meibocyte differentiation, acinar atrophy and dry eye disease; 2) That Pparg signaling transcriptionally
regulates meibocyte differentiation that when lost leads to up-regulation of ductal epithelial differentiation in
progenitor meibocytes; 3) That loss of meibocyte progenitor cells recapitulates loss of Pparg leading to loss of
meibocyte differentiation, acinar atrophy, and dry eye disease. To test these hypotheses, we propose the
following Specific Aims: 1). Determine if loss of Pparg signaling in stem/progenitor meibocytes leads to acinar
atrophy and dry eye by establishing the sex (male/female) and age (1, 3 and 6 months) effects of Ppargflox
knockdown in Sox9-Cre and Lrig1-Cre mice; 2). Identify the Pparg specific transcriptional profile leading to
meibocyte differentiation using scATACseq and ChIP-Seq by comparing wild type to Pparg CKO mice and
identify differences related to meibocyte vs ductal differentiation as well as the effects of age and sex; and 3).
Establish the effects of meibocyte stem/progenitor cell ablation by conditionally knocking out Sox9 and Lrig1
using Krt14-Cre, Sox9flox and Lrig1flox mice and evaluating the effects on acinar atrophy and dry."
10880107,"Project Summary/Abstract:
 Axon maintenance is regulated by components of the programmed axon degeneration (AxD) pathway,
most importantly the axon survival factor, NMNAT2, and the chief axon executioner, SARM1, an NAD hydrolase
that initiates local metabolic catastrophe when activated by axon damage. Chronic SARM1 activation that
contributes to degeneration is called sarmopathy, and it is believed to play a role in diseases including
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2A, and peripheral neuropathy. SARM1
and NMNAT2 were previously believed to regulate axon integrity exclusively cell-autonomously, but we
discovered that SARM1 plays a role in cell-extrinsic mechanisms of AxD, namely macrophage recruitment and
activation contributing to the initial phase of axon dysfunction and degeneration. We developed a human disease
model featuring pure sarmopathy based on patients with a rare early-onset, progressive polyneuropathy caused
by NMNAT2 mutations. Macrophage depletion delays axon loss and significantly improves motor function even
after the onset of symptom in this model, indicating that SARM1 initiates macrophage-mediated axon elimination
months before stressed axons would otherwise succumb to cell-intrinsic metabolic failure. We also found that
blocking axonal externalization of lyso-phosphatidylserine (lyso-PS), a phagocytic “eat-me” signal that promotes
macrophage clearance of apoptotic cells, delays motor dysfunction in the model. Manipulating lyso-PS was
achieved by virally overexpressing the phosphatidylserine lipase ABHD12 in mouse spinal cord, demonstrating
a completely novel potential therapeutic strategy for peripheral neuropathy.
 In this proposal, we outline experiments to elucidate the SARM1-dependent pro-degenerative
neuroinflammatory response. We will characterize immunocytes and other cells in mouse model nerves to
determine their provenance and unique transcriptional profiles to identify key genes and pathways that shape
sarmopathic neuroinflammation. We will test the roles of repair SCs and candidate chemoattractants/ receptors
in SARM1-dependent macrophage recruitment and activation by testing whether sarmopathy is modified in
combination with informative gene knockout models. We will also specifically address the role of
phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure in sarmopathy by manipulating PS and PS receptors genetically in vivo,
including via ABHD12 overexpression. Results of these studies will establish the through-line connecting SARM1
activation, inflammation, and the development of peripheral neurodegenerative diseases, and drive forward the
development of anti-inflammatory axoprotective therapeutics for these devastating disorders."
10884241,"Abstract: TRD 3. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful analytical
instrument with numerous applications in biomedicine. Some examples of high-impact
investigation are studies using metabolite profiles as markers of health status, evaluation of
small molecules for biological activity as a drug, and discovery of new metabolic compounds.
NMR offers detailed information, but the interpretation of data involves a multistep process that
often involves using data from other analytical instruments. The use of a range of sophisticated
mathematical and computational methods is required, and this is often a major bottleneck. The
aim of this TRD is to deliver enhanced functionality for robust and reliable statistical framework,
based on Bayesian principles. This project will advance the state of NMR data analytics and
simplifies the future development of advanced NMR applications. Central components of this
TRD include a Bayesian inference engine, tools for validation of experimental models and
results, a set of programming interfaces, and a library of templates for facilitating the
identification of metabolite and small molecule signatures in biological mixtures. The
implementation of this TRD will benefit from key advantages offered by the NMRbox platform.
By facilitating the deployment, utilization, interoperation, and persistence of this advanced
technology, the proposed TRD will advance the application of NMR for a wide range of
challenging applications in biomedicine and helps ensure the reproducibility bio-NMR studies."
10884243,"Abstract: Driving Biological Projects. DBPs ensure that the TRDs address challenges posed by ongoing,
funded research on important biomedical problems. The DBP applications include protein structural biology,
NMR relaxation studies of biomolecular dynamics, and NMR metabolomics, including a clinical project. The
DBPs present challenges that can be addressed using computation as well as offering opportunities for greater
advances enabled through novel software and high-performance computation. While the challenges for clinical
metabolomics projects are similar to other metabolomics projects, clinical projects have regulatory burdens
associated with protected health information (PHI). Developing a HIPPA-compliant instance of NMRbox
presents new challenges, but extends the utility of NMRbox to a new constituency, investigators employing

10903739,"The ever-pressing problem of drug resistance harms individual patients, threatens public health control efforts, and drives costly and time-consuming new drug discovery. For antibacterial and antimycobacterial drugs, dynamic in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (hollow fiber PK/PD) studies have proven exceedingly valuable for predicting efficacy and selection of resistance and are now an expected component of drug approval packages. This proposal investigates drug therapies, including combinations, for malaria. With previous funding from this grant we established methods that allow dynamic in vitro PK/PD for antiprotozoal drugs, and for several dozen agents have discovered an unambiguous governance by either concentration or time, that is constant over logs of drug exposure. The kinetic driver for an antiprotozoal was not a priori predictable, was unrelated to static/cidal activity or time kill curves and was independent of reversible or irreversible drug action. It was, however, class-wide (e.g., all tested trioxanes were concentration-driven). In vitro findings were prospectively confirmed in murine models (supported by other sources) and retrospectively consistent with published clinical trials data. Methods for deploying two drugs simultaneously, each by its own kinetic pattern, have been established and validated. The proposed experiments will build on this foundation, addressing issues surrounding drug resistance and combination therapies. Studies will feature experimental agents, dihydroartemisinin with additive partner lumefantrine, and atovaquone with synergistic partner proguanil. Resistance studies will be conducted with well- characterized isogenic pairs of wild type cells and their clinically relevant drug resistant mutants and will include mutants with high as well as low degrees of resistance. Aim 1 studies will assess the impact of drugs applied singly, questioning whether, for the same total dose, the pattern of drug pressure (short-lived high pulse vs. constant lower concentration) differentially impacts growth of resistant vs. wild type cells. Aim 2 will feature wild type cells exposed to drug combinations, asking how the pattern of individual partner kinetics affects efficacy of the combination. Aim 3 will then examine the role of partner kinetics against resistant cells, probing the importance of maintaining their concentrations at constant ratio over time, and evaluating the consequence of matching (or not) drug kinetics to their drivers. Results from these inaugural PK/PD studies of antimalarial drug combinations and drug resistance will provide a window into the fundamental PK governance of efficacy (and resistance selection), will provide a template for similar study of other antiprotozoals, will set the stage for dynamic in vitro PK/PDs that model human kinetics vs. parasites, and will provide a new metric for judging experimental and clinically used antiprotozoals."

FSHD affects over 25,000 individuals in the United States. It is the third most common muscular dystrophy by
incidence but may be the most common by prevalence (Orphanet, 2008). The DNA lesion associated with this
disease is a contraction within a series of 3.3 kb repeats (D4Z4 repeats) near the telomere of 4q. The
contraction modifies the chromatin configuration of 4q35.2 which results in misexpression of a gene encoded
within each D4Z4 repeat, DUX4. We have shown that DUX4 is cytotoxic when expressed at high levels in
various cellular model systems, and interferes with myogenic gene expression when expressed at low levels in
satellite cells and myoblasts, and have generated an animal model that recapitulates one key aspect of the
human disease: muscle deterioration in the presence of barely-detectable DUX4 protein. However
mechanistically, DUX4 is still not well understood, we do not have a clear picture of which cell types in muscle
express DUX4 and what the consequence of that expression is, a pathological mechanism explaining muscle
loss still eludes the field, and we suffer from a dearth of specific therapies for FSHD. The research proposed in
this application addresses these issues by (1) probing the mechanism of DUX4-mediated transcription,
including studying inhibitors of that transcription (2) investigating the effects of inhibiting the p300 pathway
genetically and pharmacologically in the mouse model, and (3) studying DUX4 expression in primary cells from
FSHD patients. This research will address key outstanding questions in FSHD, will advance a mechanistic
understanding of DUX4 in FSHD at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels, and may lead to new therapeutic
directions."
10900196,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The guidance receptor EphA2 promotes atherogenic inflammation driving an unstable plaque phenotype and
promotes smooth muscle cell (SMC) fibroproliferative expansion enhancing plaque stability. While most cells
within the plaque express EphA2, only endothelial cells and leukocytes express its ephrinA1 ligand, and
endothelial EphA2 ligation with ephrinA1 enhances proinflammatory gene expression and monocyte recruitment.
SMCs express EphA2 during phenotypic transition, associated with loss of contractile markers and a transition
to a fibroproliferative phenotype. A known oncogene, EphA2 expression enhances smooth muscle proliferation
and extracellular matrix deposition in vitro, and global EphA2 deletion reduces atherosclerosis associated with
diminished inflammation and reduced smooth muscle content and matrix deposition.
While EphA2 expression promotes SMC fibroproliferative remodeling, EphA2 ligation reduces smooth muscle
proliferation and migration, suggesting that ligand-dependent EphA2 signaling may reduce plaque stability by
promoting inflammation and preventing fibroproliferative remodeling. EphA2 ligand-independent signaling,
involving canonical S897 phosphorylation and non-canonical Y772 transphosphorylation in focal adhesions,
likely mediates EphA2's positive effects on fibroproliferative remodeling and fibrous cap formation. SMCs show
EphA2 S897 phosphorylation during atherogenic vascular remodeling in vivo, and S897 phosphorylation
enhances smooth muscle migration in vitro. EphA2 Y772 transphosphorylation drives fibronectin deposition, and
our preliminary data suggest that Y772-dependent matrix remodeling likely mediates EphA2-dependent
phenotypic transition and fibroproliferative remodeling by activating a novel EphA2-binding transcription factor.
In addition, EphA2 strongly inhibits tumor suppressor expression, and our preliminary data show a key role for
one of these tumor suppressors in regulating atherosclerotic smooth muscle phenotype. Therefore, we
hypothesize that EphA2 ligand-dependent signaling promotes inflammation and reduces fibroproliferative
remodeling, whereas ligand-independent signaling drives fibroproliferative remodeling directly through
fibronectin-dependent regulation of an EphA2-binding transcription factor and indirectly through tumor
suppressor inhibition. This proposal will assess how EphA2 and ephrinA1 expression affects atherosclerotic
inflammation and plaque stability, to characterize the mechanisms of EphA2 ligand-independent signaling
regulating smooth muscle phenotype, and to characterize how EphA2-dependent tumor suppressor regulation
affects smooth muscle phenotype in vitro and in vivo. Successful completion of these Aims will characterize
novel signaling mechanisms driving EphA2-dependent plaque stability and may identify novel therapeutic
mechanisms targeting EphA2 signaling to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques."
10899977,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Our overarching goal is to develop a transformative integrative clinical, experimental
and in silico-based pipeline to create a digital twin technology for patient-specific prediction. Digital twin
technology holds the promise of the development and application of virtual models that replicate physiological
processes and characteristics of diseases to reveal mechanisms, simulate disease progression, identify potential
drug targets and simultaneously predict drug efficacy. While our planned approach is broadly applicable, here
we will apply digital twins to the problem of identification of cardiac drug targets and prediction of the efficacy or
cardiotoxicity of drugs in individuals. A major strength of our digital twin approach is that it incorporates data from
the atomic structure to the cardiac rhythm, allowing the inclusion of individual differences that affect individual
protein structure, cellular electrophysiology and electrocardiograms. Digital twins will allow for improved
understanding of how variation between individuals modifies disease severity and drug cardiotoxicity risks. Such
a technology is possible now due to the maturity of deep-learning based modeling and simulation approaches in
conjunction with the increasing availability of ion channel protein structures in physiologically relevant states,
and the development of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs).
Combining these developments will allow for the realization of high throughput testing for individuals to determine
their disease- and drug-related risks. Indeed, our preliminary data indicate the promise of a new deep learning
method to extract in silico representations of individual cellular electrophysiology and Ca2+ handling to digitally
replicate the mechanistic cellular fingerprint. We will build a new digital twin framework across multiple system
scales by bringing together new methods in atomistic scale simulation with recently developed cellular level
models and deep learning networks to discover new protocols to extract needed model parameters from data
and for translating from iPSC-CM to adult cardiac myocyte electrophysiology. We will develop and test an
experimental and computational digital twin platform applied to problem of personal cardiac disease expression
and drug-induced cardiotoxicity via a combined computational-experimental approach that will allow the
construction, prediction and validation of patient-specific digital twin cardiac cells. We aim to 1) Develop cardiac
ion channel protein digital twins for structure and function prediction, 2) Develop cardiac myocyte digital twins,
and 3) Predict the patient-specific cardiac safety pharmacology of individual drugs and combined therapeutics.
We are bringing together model simulations at the level of the atom in a totally new way to include genetic
mutations spanning benign variants to ones with known arrhythmia risks (from which all other models can be
developed by extension) and predict their impact on drug interactions and biological function modulations at
different scales. The proposed studies have the potential to conceptually transform the field by generating an
integrative, high-throughput framework that predicts individual responses to disease and drugs."
10900812,"The fovea is arguably the most important part of the human retina. The normal fovea is characterized by an
excavation of inner retinal layers (leaving behind the foveal pit and a concomitant avascular zone), an increased
density of cone photoreceptors with nearly absent rods, and specialized “private line” circuitry between cones
and midget retinal ganglion cells. Together, these specializations provide the basis for our high-acuity photopic
vision. Patients with albinism have disrupted foveal anatomy, with visual deficits including variably reduced
acuity, increased photosensitivity, high refractive errors, nystagmus, and impaired stereopsis. Despite the
prevalence of albinism (~1 in 15,000), significant gaps remain in our understanding of the anatomical basis for
the visual deficits in albinism. Such gaps not only compromise our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies
for patients with albinism but also fundamentally limit our understanding of how the retina interacts with central
visual structures to determine key features of normal visual function. We have formed a multidisciplinary
research team whose overall goal is to close these knowledge gaps through execution of the following
specific aims: 1) Examine the influence of retinal melanin on visual acuity and the phenotypic spectrum of foveal
morphology, 2) Characterize disruptions in foveal post-receptoral circuitry in subjects with albinism, and 3) Map
rod photoreceptor mosaic topography in subjects with albinism. By advancing non-invasive imaging approaches
that can reveal the physiological basis for visual deficits in albinism on a personalized basis, we gain access to
outcome measures for use in emerging therapeutic trials and develop the ability to define the therapeutic
potential for individual patients. Clinically, such approaches are broadly applicable to diseases beyond albinism.
This work is also expected to have a significant positive impact by increasing our basic understanding of the
relationships between melanin, foveal anatomy, photoreceptor topography, retinal circuitry, and visual function.
These relationships inform the basic developmental and organizational principles of the human visual
system. Importantly, our proposal directly addresses emerging needs outlined in the most recent publication
from the National Eye Institute, “Vision Research: Needs, Gaps, & Opportunities”, and incorporates specific
program objectives of the NEI Retinal Diseases Panel: (1) Characterize the macula and perifoveal regions of the
retina to better understand the predilection of the macula for disease; (2) Improve understanding of the roles of
neuronal activity and molecular events in the formation of central visual circuits during development; (3) Continue
to develop and apply noninvasive technologies such as fMRI, OCT, adaptive optics, and confocal imaging to
better understand retinal function and changes in disease states. Altogether, this project takes a multidisciplinary
approach towards elucidating how retinal structures contribute to vision deficits and reduced quality of life in
patients suffering from albinism and related vision disorders."
10901251,"Project Summary from Parent Award
Cellular communication is essential for the development of all multicellular organisms, and is a key phenomenon
that is disrupted in many human diseases. Cell-surface receptors mediate cellular communication and are the
targets for 50% of FDA-approved drugs, highlighting their disease relevance and druggability. However, many
cell-surface receptors remain understudied and undrugged. The research proposed in this application is focused
on two families of such receptors, adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptors (aGPCRs), and teneurins. The
structures, mechanisms of action and disease relevance of these two receptor families remain largely unknown;
as their large size and complex biochemical nature has made them difficult to study. Recent genetic studies
revealed that aGPCRs and teneurins have essential roles in development of the nervous system, skeletal
system, and heart. These receptors are linked to diseases including cancer, developmental disorders, and brain
malformations, raising an urgent need for mechanistic studies on aGPCRs and teneurins. My research program
aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which these receptors are activated, and to develop new tools
to modulate their activity against relevant diseases. The research proposed in this application involves an
interdisciplinary approach, integrating structural studies of these receptors and their ligands, biochemical and
biophysical assays, protein engineering approaches, and functional assays. This research will build on our
previous successes using this approach, which has yielded many three-dimensional structures of aGPCRs and
teneurins, has revealed crucial mechanistic concepts in the field, and has allowed a better understanding of the
mechanisms of action of these receptors. A major revelation from our work is that the large extracellular regions
of aGPCRs and teneurins are directly involved in regulating receptor function. Despite these advances,
fundamental questions remain unanswered. The ultimate goals of this proposal are to reveal how signal
transduction is mediated within the domains of these large receptors, what exactly activates them under
physiological conditions, how their evolution from early organisms to higher eukaryotes have changed and
diversified their critical functions, and finally how, at the molecular level, we can inhibit or activate these receptors
using synthetic ligands. Our structural studies will be complemented with mutagenesis, signaling assays, the use
of synthetic binders to understand how the different components of these receptors control receptor function,
and physiological analyses performed by collaborators that will test the relevance of the structural and functional
studies. We expect that this research will provide critical insights into the mechanistic details of aGPCR and
teneurin function that will be highly informative for the development of future therapeutics; we will also produce
potent and selective synthetic ligands which can serve as tools for the scientific community to study aGPCRs
and teneurins."

Heart disease is extremely prevalent, with about one in every four deaths (in the US) being attributed to heart
disease. Early detection of cardiovascular events, especially before patients become symptomatic, has immense
impact in preventive healthcare, reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease.
Coronary artery calcification (CAC), a strong predictor for future cardiovascular events, is a component of
atherosclerotic plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the heart, leading to coronary artery disease
(CAD). Identification of CAC is clinically important because it is used for cardiovascular risk and therapy decision
making. Currently, CAC is quantified by computed tomography (CT), however, CT-based population screening
is not widely utilized due to cost and radiation burden. Chest x-rays (CXR) are the most common medical imaging
procedure and have higher availability than CT in low-resource settings, lower radiation dose, and higher patient
throughput that could be used for screening purposes. Unfortunately, due to the lack of quantification in CXR,
only qualitative descriptors are possible. The objective of this proposal is therefore to bring much-needed
quantification to CXR, particularly for detecting and quantifying CAC by combining a new dual-layer x-ray
detector and artificial-intelligence based image processing. The proposed dual-layer detector utilizes alloys of
amorphous selenium (a-Se) that achieve favorable electro-optical properties (e.g., higher charge carrier
mobilities and higher gain) compared to conventional a-Se based x-ray detectors. This technology has four major
components: (1) a top layer direct convection a-Se alloys on an imaging backplane, (2) a bottom layer indirect
conversion a-Se alloy with intrinsic gain on an imaging backplane coupled to a scintillator, (3) top panel and
bottom panel integration into a dual-layer detector, and (4) a machine learning algorithm that enhances accuracy
of the quantitative information from the dual-layer detector. The detector development leverages a mature
platform from Varex Imaging, a leading manufacturer of x-ray detectors. We expect to show that the proposed
system has higher spatial resolution images and higher sensitivity to detect small, high contrast features
(calcifications) and to separate materials such as calcium from soft tissue. This approach will allow accurate
quantification of predictive factors and will have immense impact in proactive healthcare, improving the clinical
outcomes of patients, and reducing the number of deaths associated with cardiovascular disease. While our
focus is on CAC, we expect this technology to broadly improve CXR for early detection of lung cancer,
tuberculosis, and other diseases such as osteoporosis via quantification of bone mineral density."

conversion a-Se alloy with intrinsic gain on an imaging backplane coupled to a scintillator, (3) top panel and
bottom panel integration into a dual-layer detector, and (4) a machine learning algorithm that enhances accuracy
of the quantitative information from the dual-layer detector. The detector development leverages a mature
platform from Varex Imaging, a leading manufacturer of x-ray detectors. We expect to show that the proposed
system has higher spatial resolution images and higher sensitivity to detect small, high contrast features
(calcifications) and to separate materials such as calcium from soft tissue. This approach will allow accurate
quantification of predictive factors and will have immense impact in proactive healthcare, improving the clinical
outcomes of patients, and reducing the number of deaths associated with cardiovascular disease. While our
focus is on CAC, we expect this technology to broadly improve CXR for early detection of lung cancer,
tuberculosis, and other diseases such as osteoporosis via quantification of bone mineral density."

Hox genes serve as critical regulators of developmental processes. Disruption of their function during
embryogenesis results in dramatic “homeotic” phenotypes where regions of the body are transformed from one
identity to another. In humans, these disruptions can lead to malformation of the face, ears, limbs, and
genitalia, as well as neural defects and cancer. In many animal genomes, the Hox genes are found in clusters:
in vertebrates, these clusters are compact, while those of invertebrates are more loosely arranged or
fragmented. While still poorly understood, the structure of the Hox cluster is hypothesized to be important in
regulating their deployment. However, this is difficult to study in vertebrates as their genomes encode multiple
Hox clusters that are the result of whole genome duplications. While invertebrates typically have a single
complement of Hox genes, many invertebrate Hox clusters are disrupted, including those found in the classic
invertebrate model systems like flies and nematodes.
To address this deficit, we have developed resources and tools for studying cephalopod molluscs (squid and
octopus), including chromosome-scale genome assemblies, extensive transcriptomics, and tools for gene
manipulation. Through this work, we have found that cephalopods have a single, intact, but massively
expanded Hox cluster. In fact, they encode the largest Hox clusters yet described – the squid Hox cluster is
two orders of magnitude larger than those found in humans. Conservation of the Hox cluster in cephalopods is
particularly striking given that their genomes are otherwise highly rearranged relative to other animals. Notably,
we have found that cephalopod Hox genes exhibit the canonical, collinear nested domains of expression,
suggesting that elements of the ancestral regulatory program are retained in cephalopods despite the dramatic
increase in cluster size. Surprisingly, our preliminary knockout data suggest that loss of a Hox gene results in
the absence, rather than the transformation, of body regions. These results - the first functional analysis of Hox
genes in a mollusc - point to a fundamentally different mode of action than the homeotic transformations
characteristic of overtly segmented animals like flies and humans. Understanding differences between the
massive cephalopod Hox clusters and the more compact arrangement found in vertebrates will provide
fundamental insights concerning the regulation of these body plan transcription factors across diverse animal
species, including humans. This project is therefore poised to provide transformational insights into the biology
of Hox genes, which play key roles in human development and disease, and contribute to our fundamental
knowledge of how pattern is established in embryogenesis."

Sulfur mustard gas (SM), a vesicating and warfare agent, has been used in many wars since World War I; most
recently in Syria. SM rapidly penetrates the eye on contact and causes blindness by injuring corneal tissue-
organization and function. Clinically, patients show a pathology termed as Mustard Gas Keratopathy that involves
severe ocular inflammation, recurrent epithelial-erosions, epithelial-stromal separation limbal stem cell
deficiency, corneal ulceration, haze and neovascularization. MGK pathophysiology is biphasic including acute
and delayed-onset, and involves multiple mechanisms. We developed a novel, multimodal, non-steroidal topical
ophthalmic drops, Turbo Eye Drop (TED), containing 4 FDA-approved generic drugs with differing mode of
action, and stable at ambient temperature. Our pilot studies found that topical TED efficaciously treats acute and
delayed-onset MGK in rabbits in vivo and human cornea ex vivo without significant side effects. Our central
hypothesis is that topical TED treats acute and delayed-onset MGK in vivo by curbing SM-induced early
inflammatory responses, extracellular matrix degradation, and production of excessive pro-fibrotic and pro-
angiogenic factors without significant side effects. This project tests two novel hypotheses to establish an
efficacious and safe topical therapy for acute and delayed-onset MGK in vivo, using four specific aims: Aim-1
defines TED treatment for acute MGK in vivo by testing the hypothesis that increasing frequency and duration
of TED application will potently treat acute MGK and blindness without significant side effects. Aim-2 establishes
TED treatment for delayed-onset MGK in vivo by testing the hypothesis that low TED topical dosing for longer
duration will effectively cure delayed-onset MGK without issues in rabbits. Aim-3 uncovers mechanisms used by
TED in mitigating acute and delayed-onset MGK in vivo and in vitro. Aim-4 secures intellectual property rights,
develops regulatory strategies, and advances TED topical ophthalmic drops as an antidote for SM-induced
ocular injury towards human application. This will be accomplished using an established SM-vapor rabbit in vivo
and human cornea organ culture ex vivo models, GMP-grade TED eye drops, and monitoring eyes in live rabbits
in a time-dependent manner with clinical eye exams and diagnostic imaging. The characterization of
mechanisms used by TED in mitigating MGK will be studied using corneal tissues collected after euthanasia by
measuring integrity of corneal epithelial basement membrane, epithelial-stromal organization, and collagen fibril
arrangement using qPCR, ELISAs, immunofluorescence, H&E, and transmission electron microscopy
techniques utilizing our published methods. Successful completion of the project will lead to the development of
an effective and safe therapy for acute and delayed MGK and medical countermeasure to minimize ocular
obliteration caused by the accidental or intentional use of SM in humans, and therefore will have very high impact
in field and public safety."

For a foreseeable future antimalarial drugs will remain a mainstay for the management of malaria worldwide.
While the pipeline of new antimalarial compounds has begun to look promising in recent years, the specter of
drug resistance is always looming. This fact demands continued efforts to discover and develop new
antimalarial drugs. Among the promising new antimalarial compounds to emerge in recent years are those
that disrupt Na+ homeostasis in Plasmodium falciparum. Two of these compounds (a spiroindolone and a
dihydroisoquinolone) have progressed to Phase II clinical trials and have shown to be highly potent against P.
falciparum and P. vivax infections with in vivo parasite clearance times that are even faster than artemisinin,
the fastest acting antimalarial drug in use. Remarkably, at least 20 distinct chemical classes of compounds,
comprising ~8% of all antimalarials present in the Malaria and Pathogen Boxes distributed by Medicines for
Malaria Venture (MMV), also have the propensity to disrupt Na+ homeostasis in P. falciparum. Several lines of
evidence support the notion that all these compounds inhibit a parasite-encoded Na+-pumping P-type ATPase
named PfATP4. Thus, PfATP4 presents a highly attractive target for a very broad range of small molecules.
Extraordinarily fast clearance of parasites in vivo by PfATP4-active compounds holds the promise for these
compounds to emerge as potential replacement for artemisinin, something the world needs to be prepared for
given the potential spread of artemisinin treatment failures. While two PfATP4-active compounds have
advanced to clinical trials, the history of drug development advises prudence to explore back-up compounds to
account for pipeline attrition and mitigating chances of failure against a valuable target. It is with this
background that we are proposing here to conduct a medicinal chemistry campaign that would deliver
additional preclinical candidates that meet the stringent criteria advocated by MMV. Over the past decade we
have carried out extensive medicinal chemistry campaign to identify highly potent PfATP4-active compounds
that belong to different chemical classes than the two compounds under clinical investigations. We aim to
identify a pre-clinical candidate compound guided by potency, metabolic stability, physicochemical and
pharmacokinetic properties, in vivo efficacy in a humanized mouse model of P. falciparum infection and safety
studies. These studies will be allied with PK/PD simulations to ensure a compound that meets safety and
single dose criteria. We also propose to investigate the possibility of minimizing resistance emergence by
exploring the effects of targeting two different domains of PfATP4 by combination of distinct chemical scaffolds."
10872413,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
There is a fundamental gap in understanding how neurons integrate hypothetical information when making
decisions. This includes not only predicting future outcomes before making choices but also evaluating
consequences of unselected alternatives. These computations serve as the basis of counterfactual thinking and
regret processing. This phenomenon is central to a wide range of cognitive capabilities but whose dysfunction,
despite contributing to numerous psychiatric disorders, is poorly understood. My long-term goal is to uncover the
mechanisms governing counterfactual thinking, how the brain binds hypothetical value to unselected actions,
and how this translates into changes in motivated behavior. This proposal will determine how single neurons in
the nucleus accumbens (NAc) – a critical node of value integration and action selection – support counterfactual
thinking constrained by its known inputs. We will leverage innovative approaches in rodent neuroeconomics that
we developed to capture complex, evolutionarily conserved decision-making processes across species. We will
combine this with cutting-edge brain-wide imaging tools and novel circuit-dissection technologies we developed
to measure circuit physiology at an unprecedented level. Our central hypothesis is that populations of functionally
distinct neurons in the NAc defined by upstream inputs are differentially involved in assigning credit to missed
reward-related opportunities due to different unselected actions. This hypothesis is based on our preliminary
data implicating multiple circuits that converge in the NAc and may play distinct roles in action-specific forms of
counterfactual thinking. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Characterize hypothetical
value encoding of NAc neurons defined by their upstream inputs; and 2) Establish a link between afferent activity
in the NAc and action-specific forms of counterfactual thinking. First, single-cell NAc activity categorized by the
structures projecting to them will be recorded during decision-making behavior in mice. We will characterize firing
properties following economic situations known to invoke representations of missed opportunities and will
manipulate their excitability using chemogenetics to alter the impact of decision history on future behavior.
Second, we will record activity of axonal afferent fibers from major excitatory inputs into the NAc simultaneously
with single NAc cells and use optogenetics to manipulate input terminals during distinct action-selection
processes. This approach is innovative because it captures input-output circuit physiology in ways never before
measured in freely behaving animals using our newly engineered open two-color Miniscope. This is significant
because it answers a fundamental biological question: how do single neurons integrate hypothetical value and
assign credit to unselected actions? Furthermore, this work will test competing theories whether counterfactual
thinking derives from a generalized computation for mistake appraisal or instead comprises dissociable, action-
specific processes. Ultimately, this work has the potential to refine our diagnostic nosology of and develop circuit-
based treatments for how emotion-cognition interactions like regret processing go awry in psychiatric disorders."

Black sexual and gender minority (SGM) adolescents and young adults (AYA) face profound and increasing
suicide inequities. Evidence indicates differences in individual risk factors (e.g., mood disorders, substance
use) do not account for these suicide inequities. As such, there is a need to move beyond models of individual-
level causes of population-level inequities to identify and intervene upon the socio-structural drivers of suicide
among Black SGM AYA. Specifically, longitudinal research is needed to highlight sources of structural racism,
anti-SGM stigma, mental health stigma, and their intersections that affect suicidal thoughts and behaviors
(STBs) among Black SGM AYA, and to translate these findings into public health policy intervention. We are
submitting this application in response to RFA-MH-22-140 Understanding Suicide Risk and Protective Factors
among Black Youth (R01). We propose to build from an existing infrastructure supporting our U.S. national U-
award study (UG3AI169655), to enroll a national cohort of 1,000 Black SGM from ages 16 to 24, which would
be one of the largest Black SGM AYA national cohorts of its kind. We will use a combined approach to
recruitment (e.g., digital recruitment techniques, school-based recruitment) that capitalizes on community-,
school-, and internet-based networks maintained by our community collaborators. Participants will complete a
web-based survey annually for three years that assesses STBs, microsystemic suicide precursors
(interpersonal risk factors [thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness], suicide prevention resources
[access to psychotherapy, access to community-based SGM support]), STB correlates (e.g., interpersonal
stigma, anxiety, substance use), and key sociodemographic and contextual variables. In tandem with study
enrollment, our multidisciplinary team of oppression and suicide researchers, psychological care providers,
policy experts, and community-based collaborators will develop a database of novel quantitative structural
oppression metrics (e.g., state-level policy and social climate indicators), including developmentally-specific
forms of structural racism, anti-SGM stigma, mental health stigma, and their intersections that target Black
SGM AYA (Aim 1). We will subsequently utilize these metrics and the longitudinal follow-up data to test
whether there are direct associations from structural oppression to later STBs (Aim 2). We will also use these
data to test indirect associations from structural oppression to STBs through increased interpersonal suicide
risk factors (thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness; Aim 3a) and decreased access to suicide
prevention resources (psychotherapy, SGM AYA social services; Aim 3b). Developing and testing a socio-
structural model of suicide risk meets the calls of the 2019 Congressional Black Caucus Taskforce “Ring the
Alarm” report and has strong potential to move the field beyond individual-level models of risk to support the
structural change that will help to reduce population-level Black SGM AYA suicide inequities."

 Endometriosis is a common and debilitating gynecologic disorder characterized by the presence of
endometrial-like tissue outside of the uterus. It burdens approximately 10% of persons born with internal
reproductive organs in the U.S., and incurs significant health care costs and morbidity. Prior research suggests
that Black women are less likely to be diagnosed with endometriosis than White women; however, these
racial/ethnic differences in endometriosis diagnosis likely reflect disparities in access to care and clinical
presentation as opposed to biological differences in endometriosis incidence. To date, there has been almost no
research on risk factors for or consequences of endometriosis among Black women. This is a significant gap in
the literature as many established risk factors for endometriosis differ in their prevalence between Black and
White women (e.g., age at menarche, parity, body mass index). Further, endometriosis is associated with higher
risk of several diseases that disproportionately impact Black women (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus). In
recent work, patterns of the association between endometriosis and ovarian cancer risk differed between Black
and White women, as did modifiers of the endometriosis-ovarian cancer association. These differences highlight
the critical need for research into the impact of endometriosis on Black women across the life course. To address
these important knowledge gaps we will utilize the Black Women’s Health Study, a prospective cohort of Black
women followed to date for 27 years. This cohort represents a unique opportunity to evaluate the association
between endometriosis risk factors and comorbidities among 59,000 participants, among whom over 1,600
endometriosis cases have occurred. Here we propose to further our understanding of endometriosis among
Black women through the following specific aims:
 Aim 1. Determine whether existing risk factors that have been strongly and consistently associated with
endometriosis in studies of predominantly White populations (i.e., parity, age at menarche, menstrual cycle
length, body size, birth weight), are associated with endometriosis risk among Black women.
 Aim 2. Investigate the association between endometriosis and autoimmune diseases that have
previously been associated with endometriosis and have a higher prevalence in Black women, including
examining whether these associations vary by hysterectomy status.
 This proposed study is a unique opportunity for the first ever, large-scale prospective study on risk factors
and consequences of endometriosis among Black women. The epidemiologic methods needed to examine
endometriosis in a non-clinical setting are complex and the outcomes of this project will lay the groundwork for
a larger scale grant where more novel risk factors and endometriosis consequences can be examined allowing
for endometriosis research to expand beyond White populations."

 VEXAS syndrome is a newly discovered adult-onset autoinflammatory disease that is refractory to treatment and
often fatal. It is caused by somatic missense mutations of the X-linked E1 ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1 gene
(uba1) in hematopoietic stem cells. UBA1 protein catalyzes the initiation of most ubiquitination processes in cells. Mutant
UBA1 proteins have reduced enzymatic activity. Uba1 mutant myeloid cells exhibit decreased ubiquitination and activated
innate immune and stress pathways. Thus, enhancing UBA1 activity could be an effective treatment strategy for VEXAS
syndrome. In preliminary studies, we found that auranofin, a clinical drug for rheumatoid arthritis, binds to UBA1, enhances
UBA1 interactions with E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. As a result, auranofin has a general activity in promoting E3
ubiquitin ligase activities and accelerates the degradation of proteasomal substrate proteins. Significantly, auranofin also
markedly promotes the activity of the major VEXAS-causing mutant UBA1 protein. This novel activity of auranofin
requires concentrations about 5 to 18 times lower than the maximum serum concentration (Cmax) achieved by the therapeutic
dose for rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, auranofin, as a UBA1 activity enhancer, may have tremendous therapeutic potential for
VEXAS syndrome. In this proposal, our goals are to investigate 1) the mechanism by which auranofin enhances UBA1
activity in ubiquitination and 2) the potential of auranofin as a much-needed drug for VEXAS syndrome. To facilitate the
investigation, we have created U937 monocyte-like cell lines that harbor the primary VEXAS-causing mutation (p.Met41
codon mutation) in uba1 (U937Duba1b) by CRISPR/cas9 technology. Our preliminary studies showed that U937Duba1b
cells exhibit the similar pro-inflammatory and stress responses to that reported in patient-derived uba1 mutant monocytes,
particularly the highly activated inflammatory signatures, including TNFa, IL-6, and IFN-g, and ER stress. We have
obtained the zebrafish model (Duba1b) of VEXAS syndrome from Dr. David Beck (NIH) to assess the therapeutic effects
of auranofin. Three specific Aims are proposed to accomplish our goals. Aim 1: To define the mechanism of how auranofin
enhances UBA1 activity in ubiquitination. We will test the hypothesis that auranofin binding changes UBA1 conformation
and enhances UBA1 interaction with E2s, resulting in increased ubiquitin charging to E2s and increased activities of E3s.
We will use ubiquitination of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum as an example to validate the mechanism in
cells. Aim 2: To determine whether auranofin inhibits the major pro-inflammatory signaling (TNFa via NFkB, IL-6, and
IFN-g) identified in patient-derived uba1 mutant monocytes. U937Duba1b cells will be used as a cellular model of VEXAS
syndrome to determine whether auranofin inhibits the pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and their signaling. Aim 3: To
profile ubiquitination reduction and proteostasis disturbance in U937Duba1b cells and determine whether auranofin
alleviates the changes. Decreased ubiquitination (ubiquitinome) is likely the cause for VEXAS syndrome. Therefore, we
will use a combination of quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and bioinformatics to profile the changes in
ubiquitinome and proteome in U937Duba1b cells. We will assess whether auranofin reverses the changes and inhibits pro-
inflammatory responses and evaluate the therapeutic potential of auranofin in the zebrafish model of VEXAS."
10874715,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in solid tumors and drive tumorigenesis and resistance
to therapy. Strikingly, a commonly used cancer drug, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), drive
development of suppressive TAMs through metabolic remodeling and induction of lipogenesis that restrict T-
cell activation and function. Conversely, T-cells treated with PARPi exhibit bioenergetic fitness, superior viabil-
ity, and heightened effector function. While there is enthusiasm for combining PARPi with immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB), based on potential synergy of T-cell activation of each class of drug, early phase clinical trials
have not yet demonstrated the combination to be superior to PARPi monotherapy, suggesting lipogenic TAMs
may limit PARPi + ICB responses. Thus, there is a critical need to elucidate the dichotomy of PARPi-induced
metabolic remodeling to generate deleterious TAMs while promoting superior antitumor T-cells. In the absence
of such knowledge successful strategies to harness the power of PARPi to benefit cancer patients are unlikely.
The long-term goal is to design clinically effective strategies through TAM modulation to promote T-cell activa-
tion and weaken the immune-suppressive TME to improve therapy in breast cancer patients. The central hy-
pothesis is that lipogenic TAMs promote tumorigenesis in part through T-cell inhibition and are catalyzed by
PARPi therapy, offering a unique therapeutic opportunity to enhance PARPi + ICB. The overall objectives are
to (i) characterize TAM and T-cell metabolic regulation during PARPi and (ii) determine clinically effective strat-
egies to regulate TAM metabolism to enhance T-cell activation and PARPi responses. The central hypothesis
will be tested by pursing the following specific aims: 1) Define the mechanism of lipogenic macrophage de-
velopment. Human and murine monocytes and macrophages will be used to formally define TAM lipogenesis
catalyzed by PARPi and determine the mechanism by which TAM lipogenesis is induced during TNBC therapy
using unbiased lipidomic as well as functional studies. 2) Test that lipogenic TAMs promote tumorigenesis
through suppression of PARPi-mediated metabolic remodeling of adaptive immunity. Aim 2 will employ
in vitro and in vivo protein synthesis, proteomics and metabolomic analysis to detail how PARPi induces T-cell
metabolic fitness and define optimal metabolic perturbation for anti-tumor therapy. 3) Determine the optimal
treatment strategy of PARPi and metabolic remodeling for rapid translation to breast cancer patients.
Multiple TNBC mouse models will be employed to test if depletion of TAMs clears a path for T-cells with im-
proved bioenergetic fitness fashioned by PARPi, metabolic remodeling, or the therapies combined. Unique
clinical trial samples from patients treated with PARPi and PARPi + ICB will be assessed using state-of-the-art,
single cell imaging to identify immune phenotype and function. Successful completion will reveal novel thera-
peutic strategies to circumvent lipogenic TAMs while simultaneously activating metabolically superior antitumor
T-cells and has potential for rapid clinical translation to increase the effectiveness of PARPi + ICB therapy."
10875092,"The goal of the Columbia Roybal Center for Fearless Behavior Change is to advance behavioral
interventions that reduce psychological distress and improve health behaviors in midlife and older adults that
experience serious health events. Each year, millions of adults experience events such as heart attacks,
strokes, or life-threatening cancer diagnoses. For some, these events serve as a wake-up calls, or “teachable
moments,” and those patients acquire health behaviors that prevent recurrent events and slow disease
progression. Yet, many of these patients are highly distressed after these events, leading to substantial impact
on quality of life, health behaviors, and prognosis. For example, 1 in 3 patients develop PTSD symptoms after
cardiac arrest and critical illness, and 1 in 5 patients develop persistent depressive symptoms after heart
attacks. Those patients who are highly distressed are less likely to follow recommended health behaviors such
as taking medications, exercising, and having good sleep. We have shown that many patients avoid
medications because they are reminders of disease risk, and exercise because physiological changes (e.g.,
heart rate) are distressing reminders of the possibility of a recurrent event. Accordingly, our Roybal Center is
interested in advancing interventions that target these fear-based mechanisms for which interventions are
underdeveloped. There are already evidence-based interventions for reducing other common forms of
psychological distress after serious health events such as anxiety and depression. Our Center also aims to
conduct implementation research that accelerates the adoption of these effective interventions into practice.
Our Center will include a Behavioral Intervention Development Core that provides implementation science,
regulatory, and statistical support to trialists. In the first year, this Core will launch a Stage II randomized
clinical trial (N=90) testing a psychological intervention for PTSD (Acceptance and Mindfulness-Based
Exposure Therapy) that was that was previously developed and feasibility tested by our Center versus a
standard of care control (Present-Centered Therapy) in cardiac arrest survivors. This trial demonstrates our
capacity to advance interventions through the NIH Stage Model within our Center. In the first year, our
Center will also initiate a pragmatic cluster randomized trial (N= 50 clinicians; 200 patients) testing the effect of
an implementation strategy (a digital patient activation tool) versus usual care on the uptake of evidence-based
treaments for depressed patients with recent CVD events. This trial illustrates our Center’s capacity to
conduct Stage V research. Our Center will also include an Administrative Core responsible for soliciting
proposals for new trials consistent with our Center’s theme via a national competition. This Core will
collaborate with NIA’s Stress Measurement Network and Science of Behavior Change program to ensure
robust measurement of behavioral mechanisms in all trials. It will also oversee trials; disseminate findings;
promote DEIA in trial conduct; develop collaborations; and nurture the next generation of behavioral trialists."
10901239,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cells reuse the same signaling pathways to initiate differing responses and distinct cell fates. This plasticity in
cellular decision-making is crucial in biological contexts ranging from development to cancer biology, where
identical cells may acquire distinct properties such as differentiated cell fates or drug resistance phenotypes.
The Erk pathway is responsible for heterogeneous fate decisions in many biological contexts. Recent studies
have uncovered two potential sources of heterogeneity in Erk signaling. First, different cells may have different
Erk signaling dynamics, ranging from constant high or low signaling states to repetitive pulses of Erk kinase
activity. Second, even a uniform field of Erk-active cells do not all transcribe canonical downstream target genes.
Connecting single-cell behavior to a multitude of distinct cellular responses and cell fates requires an
understanding of the molecular mechanisms generating pathway dynamics and interpreting pathway activity into
a transcriptional response. Here, we propose to identify molecular drivers for heterogeneity in Erk-induced
responses using genomic methods, and a novel Erk biosensor: the Recorder of Erk Activity Dynamics, or
READer. READer selectively transcribes GFP only in response to pulses of Erk activation, allowing for rapid and
high-throughput identification of cells that have both undergone an Erk pulse and initiated immediate-early gene
transcription. In this proposed work, the READer system will be paired with live-cell imaging, RNA
sequencing and scalable CRISPR screening technologies to 1) investigate cell states mediating Erk
response and 2) dissect the molecular mechanisms responsible for Erk pulse generation and regulation.
Together, these data will provide key insights into how differences in single-cells can arise, and how this
heterogeneity effects signaling outcomes. Understanding the origins and consequences of heterogeneity is
crucial to our understanding of development and cancer biology, as well as for the development of novel cell-
based therapeutics, which require precise control of engineered cell fates for clinical applications.
The proposed work will take place at Princeton University in the Department of Molecular Biology under the
direct supervision of sponsor Dr. Jared Toettcher and co-sponsor Dr. Britt Adamson. The sponsors’ laboratories,
the departmental community and Princeton’s overall graduate program provide an excellent supportive
environment for the proposed project to succeed. Princeton University has stellar core facilities and resources
available and accessible to the fellow that will enable efficient, high-quality and thorough research-training and
data collection. The training plan will enable the fellow to develop skills in next-generation sequencing analysis,
live-cell imaging, and synthetic biology, as well as supporting her growth and development in mentorship and
scientific communication."
10902529,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Reading comprehension is supported by a hierarchy of cognitive-linguistic processes such as
recognizing words, mapping semantics onto words and phrases, and integrating information across units. In
bilingual individuals, successful reading comprehension must also include some mechanism of language
selection to enable reading in the target language given that both languages are active during linguistic
processing. Due to stroke, bilinguals with aphasia (BWA) routinely demonstrate impairments in reading
comprehension and language selection—in addition to other cognitive-linguistic deficits—which may severely
compromise their ability to access and select appropriate lexical representations in one or both languages
while reading. Previous studies in healthy bilinguals have used eye-tracking-while-reading to determine the
effect of contextual information on real-time sentence comprehension; however, it is currently unknown
whether BWA are sensitive to the same types of information or whether they demonstrate similar patterns of
language co-activation post-stroke.
 The overall goal of this proposal is to address this gap in the literature through a series of eye-tracking-
while-reading experiments to measure the effects of semantic and lexical variables on real-time sentence
processing in BWA. Eye-tracking-while-reading designs are ideal for examining real-time reading because they
permit subjects to i) view all words in a sentence throughout the trial (i.e., without pressing a button to uncover
them) and ii) return to earlier words or phrases for rereading which is especially important for BWA who will
require more time to retrieve lexical representations and process the meaning of a sentence. In the current
proposal, Aim 1 will examine the effects of reading cognates, which share overlapping orthographic and
semantic representations (e.g., piano in English and Spanish), and semantically constrained sentences on
real-time sentence processing. Aim 2 will examine the effects of reading interlingual homograph words, which
overlap in orthography but diverge in meaning (e.g., fin, animal part in English, end in Spanish), and
semantically constrained sentences on real-time sentence processing. Aim 3 will examine the relationship
between eye tracking outcomes and offline measures of language proficiency, linguistic impairment, and
nonlinguistic cognition to investigate the effects of individual variability in BWA reading behaviors post-stroke.
 By achieving these aims, this project will advance our understanding of reading comprehension
impairment in BWA. Ultimately, such findings can be used to enhance clinical outcomes for this population and
will represent an important first step in improving quality of life and access to literacy post-stroke."

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex biopolymer network that defines the structure and mechanics of
solid tissue and can profoundly regulate cell function in development, physiology, and disease. As a result, there
has been an enormous effort to create biomaterials and other engineered systems that mimic the ECM with the
goal of modeling and controlling cell-ECM crosstalk for discovery and therapeutics. To promote continued
discovery and translation in this exciting field while nurturing the next generation of talent, we seek support for
the 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Signal Transduction
by Engineered Extracellular Matrices (STEEM). The STEEM GRC/GRS is widely viewed as the premier venue
for sharing and discussing cutting-edge developments in ECM science and engineering. Over the past quarter-
century, STEEM has played a leadership role in bringing together biologists, engineers, materials scientists, and
other disciplinary experts into a common forum and has played a key role in incubating interdisciplinary topics
such as mechanobiology, biofabrication, and organoid technology. In the 2024 meeting, we will build on these
advances and explore several questions that will define the next decade of work in the field under the theme
Engineered microenvironments for next-generation biology, disease modeling, and therapeutics. The
GRC aims to: (1) Create a forum in which information and ideas are freely exchanged between researchers of
diverse and complementary backgrounds to enhance the potential of regenerative medicine and cell-based
therapies to improve human health; (2) Support a diverse group of young and early career investigators by
exposing them to new and exciting ideas and opportunities in an environment that encourages collegial
interactions; and (3) Bring together scientists across all experience levels, from trainees to senior scientists, and
representing diverse fields of expertise and professional settings from academic labs to national labs to small
and large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, to foster meaningful, long-lasting collaborations. The
GRS aims to: (1) Provide young and early career investigators, especially graduate students and postdoctoral
trainees, the opportunity to present their research in a forum organized by and for them; (2) Encourage lasting
collegial interactions and initiation of collaborations between young investigators of diverse fields; and (3) Provide
a unique opportunity for young scientists in the field to receive career guidance from selected faculty mentors
invited to the GRS."

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Multiple studies indicate that
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a risk factor for CVD. Clinical studies suggest that PTSD stimulates
chronic and uncontrolled inflammation through various cytokines and immune cells like macrophages and
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9. While these presented studies highlight associations, literature is lacking in
mechanisms connecting both CVD and PTSD, leaving patients vulnerable to CVD associated events.
Accordingly, the proposed study aims to determine the association between PTSD-induced chronic
inflammation and the resetting of cardiac homeostasis. The central hypothesis is that PTSD stimulates
recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages to the heart, resulting in increased cardiac fibrosis and resetting
cardiac homeostasis via MMP-9 dependent mechanism. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that monocyte specific
MMP-9 stimulates PTSD-mediated cardiac remodeling and dysfunction. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that
PTSD-induced hyperactivation of monocytes stimulate fibroblast ECM production. Together the data will
provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies between CVD and PTSD to further the fields of both
cardiology and neuroscience. Collectively, the proposed studies align with the mission of NIH and NHLBI and
will enhance overall health, quality of life, and reduce disability."

Cardiomyocyte (CM) mitochondria play a crucial role in energy production and other essential cellular processes.
Disruptions in mitochondrial homeostasis contribute to cardiomyopathies and heart failure, which remain
significant global health challenges. Therefore, it is vital to identify novel regulators of mitochondrial homeostasis
in the heart to reduce cardiac dysfunction-related mortality. Proper control of mitochondrial biogenesis and
turnover is essential for maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population in CMs. Recent research has highlighted
the importance of mitochondrial DNA transcription in mitochondrial biogenesis, as well as the role of ubiquitin
(Ub) ligase PARKIN in mitophagy. However, there are significant knowledge gaps regarding the upstream
signaling involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and other mitochondrial Ub ligases crucial for mitophagy
in CMs. Cullin 3-RING Ub ligase (CRL3) belongs to the multi-subunit Cullin-RING Ub ligases (CRLs) family. In
the CRL3 complex, Cullin 3 serves as a scaffold for interacting with the RING-box protein RBX1 and one of the
substrate receptors. The assembly of CRL3 requires the conjugation of Cullin 3 by the Ub-like protein NEDD8
(neddylation). Known as a cytosolic Ub ligase, CRL3 controls the degradation of numerous proteins and
participates in multiple pathophysiological processes such as organismal development, tumor growth, vascular
integrity, and renal sodium transport. Moreover, mutations in Cullin 3 were shown to cause familial hyperkalemic
hypertension, autism spectrum disorders, and epilepsy. Despite the increasingly recognized importance of CRL3
in health and disease, its role in mitochondria and the heart remains largely unknown. In silico analyses have
revealed an intricate interaction between CRLs and mitochondrial homeostasis. Disturbances in CRLs adversely
affect mitochondrial integrity and function in CMs, and depletion of Cullin 3 inhibits mitochondrial turnover and
respiration capacity, suggesting a potential role for CRL3 in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis. Notably,
neddylation of Cullin 3 is downregulated during cardiac development but upregulated in human failing hearts and
mouse hearts undergoing pathological remodeling. Hence, the goal of this project is to investigate the
pathophysiological significance of Cullin 3 in the heart and to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which
Cullin 3 regulates mitochondrial homeostasis using a series of newly generated, genetically engineered mouse
models and adenovirus-associated viruses. Three interconnected yet independent aims are proposed: Aim 1 will
assess the importance of neddylated Cullin 3 in cardiac maturation and mitochondrial biogenesis, Aim 2 will
establish the functional significance of Cullin 3 in mitochondrial turnover in the adult heart, and Aim 3 will
investigate the impact of Cullin 3 mutations and deficiency on cardiac remodeling while exploring the potential
of targeting Cullin 3 to prevent stress-induced cardiac damage. Successful completion of these experiments will
expand and deepen our understanding of how mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained in the developing,
homeostatic, and remodeling heart."

Lung cancer (LC) is the third most common cancer in the U.S. with African Americans (AAs) having the highest
incidence and mortality. While previous linkage, admixture, exome sequencing, and genome-wide association
studies in European-Americans and Asian ancestry show statistically compelling effects, much of LC heritability
in AAs is yet to be explained. Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium (GELCC) is the only consortium
in the U.S. that studies Familial Lung Cancer (FLC) families, but to date, the majority of data collection and
analyses are of European-American (EA) ancestry.
Our recent cross-ancestry genome-wide meta-analysis has shown that the genetic architecture of minority
populations is distinct for LC risk in the general population. Previous studies have shown differences in allele
frequencies due to differences in racial ancestry are more pronounced for rare variants. Our GELCC family-
based studies have identified several very rare, high-risk pathogenic variants in EA families. However, no family-
based LC study has been explored in the AAs because of the extremely low number of AA families and limited
accessibility and availability of biospecimens.
This application will capitalize on existing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data from the valuable collection
of GELCC AA families (120 FLC cases and 146 unaffected family members), 282 high-risk sporadic LCs with
family history of LC or early-onset, and 154 unrelated controls. To increase power, especially in rare variant
discovery where AA FLC families are limited, we will also utilize
publicly available WGS data from the All of Us,
one of the most racial/ethnically diverse biobanks in the U.S. (n ~ 50,080
) as external population controls. We
proposed in Aim 1, to identify rare and low-frequency, pathogenic variants in associated with LC risk in AAs; and
Aim 2, to evaluate common, pathogenic variants associated with LC risk in AAs.
Given the high genetic diversity in AAs, genetic analysis of this understudied population would facilitate new risk
locus and pathogenic variants discovery that has not been previously found in EA studies, including those that
are specific to African-ancestry populations or shared across divergent populations. Results from this family-
based study will provide a database that can be mined for future studies of genetic differences in AAs. Identifying
novel pathogenic variants in AAs will serve as a starting point to help future targeted LC screening and
personalized risk assessment for AAs and will move us closer to the elimination of health disparities."
10875291,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rotator cuff tears are a common source of pain and disability in the upper extremity, occurring up to 50-80% in
an elderly population. Surgical treatment is normally considered for patients who fail in non-operative
management, have an acute tear, or are unable to participate in their normal daily activities despite a course of
physical therapy. However, failure of tendon healing after rotator cuff surgery is a common complication. Multiple
studies have demonstrated that preoperative tear size, patient age, and muscle quality are critical factors to
determine surgical outcomes, but there is a need for improved non-invasive evaluation methods to assess
tendon and muscle quality to determine optimal treatment strategy.
The goals of this research project are to develop quantitative MRI methods for evaluating tendon and muscle
quality, to assess the sensitivity of developed MRI methods to degeneration in comparison to histological
analysis, and to evaluate tendon and muscle quality changes due to surgery. First, quantitative ultrashort echo-
time methods will be developed to evaluate the rotator cuff tendons, which consist of highly-ordered collagen
fiber structures resulting in a short T2 relaxation time. The quantified parameters will be compared between
controls and patients having full-thickness rotator cuff tears, and MR quantification will be compared with semi-
quantitative histologic grades of tendon samples acquired during surgery for the patient group. Second, muscle
quantitative imaging techniques will be developed for two different purposes, to evaluate fibrosis and fat fractions
simultaneously and to discriminate fat tissue as either beige or white fat. Muscle fibrosis has not been quantified
much due to its short T2* relaxation time, but UTE multi-echo images will allow the quantification of muscle
fibrosis as well. A potential of the presence of beige fat in the rotator cuff muscles after tendon tears has been
shown, which is important because beige fat can promote muscle regeneration and healing. We will also develop
accurate fat quantification technique to define beige fat. Third, a longitudinal study will be performed with patients
having full-thickness rotator cuff tears before and after surgery using developed tendon and muscle evaluation
techniques, and tendon and muscle quality changes due to surgery will be evaluated. Statistical analysis to
determine important imaging metrics that affect clinical functional outcomes will be performed, too. This proposed
approach includes comprehensive biomarkers of structural, micro-structural, and biochemical changes, and aims
for fully quantitative imaging for more precise assessments.
The proposed research and training plans are designed for the candidate to gain further knowledge in
musculoskeletal biology and statistics, and expertise in clinical research design and methodologies while
extending her MRI technical skills. The K01 grant award will help the candidate to be an independent imaging
scientist in the musculoskeletal field."
10875295,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ubiquitin (Ub) is a principal post-translational modifier crucial to eukaryotic biology. The Ub system relays an
intricate control over cellular processes through its attachment and detachment on substrate protein, giving rise
to a “ubiquitin code”. Deregulation in this code has severe consequences, primarily in disease pathogenesis. In
contrast to other post-translational modifications being singular, ubiquitination comes in many different flavors.
Subsequent attachment of the C-terminus of one Ub moiety onto a substrate lysine residue or one of eight
amines (Met1, Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, Lys63) of another Ub moiety gives rise to distinct Ub
linkages that are recognized by the decoders or readers of the “ubiquitin code”. These Ub receptors facilitate
important functions such as inflammatory response and DNA damage repair. Research over the past few
decades has provided critical insight into the writers that establish and erasers that remove the “ubiquitin code”,
yet our understanding of these Ub-receptors and Ub-interacting proteins is limited in comparison. This proposal
describes the use of Ub-based probes for profiling UBDs and Ub-dependent protein-protein interactions
using expanded protein chemistry. In two aims, we leverage genetic code expansion and liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to address the goal of this project: to develop a means to identify
and structurally characterize Ub-dependent protein-protein interactions. Aim 1. Identify transiently interacting
UBDs of eukaryotic origin using photoaffinity biotinylated Ub probes and structurally characterize promising
candidates using chemo-selective ligation and X-ray crystallography. Aim 2. Develop a means to perform
chemical (poly)ubiquitination using the traceless Staudinger ligation for access to homogenous (poly)Ub probes
and (poly)ubiquitinated substrate protein. This will be applied to the atypical Lys29 ubiquitination of the 26S
proteasome receptor Rpn13, a regulatory effect of the E3 ligase UBE3C. These approaches in Ub chemical
biology will allow us to study Ub-dependent protein-protein interactions and their biophysical counterpart by
reconstituting the elements needed to chemically trap noncovalent interactions, a feature currently limiting the
study of the Ub system. Taken together, we seek to describe how these Ub-based interactions biochemically
attenuate function and corroborate these findings using structural evidence."
10875296,"Summary. Animals are composed of living cells and the 3-diminsional network of molecules that surrounds
them, the extracellular matrix (ECM). In addition to its structural and protective functions, the ECM is an important
regulator of cell organization, differentiation, morphogenesis, and physiology. Previous ECM studies have
focused largely on basement membranes, the ECM that contacts the basal surface of polarized cells. Much less
is known about the apical ECM (aECM), which resides within epithelial, mesothelial, and endothelial lumens and
on the surface of epidermal cells. Recent studies have implicated the aECM in the control of cell shape, tissue
morphogenesis, and tube formation, leading to a new appreciation of aECM impacts on development and
disease. At present, little is known about the regulation of the aECM, including the pathways that control its
deposition, organization, and remodeling. The proposed studies will address these gaps by investigating aECM
regulation in two distinct contexts: C. elegans (1) embryonic morphogenesis and (2) larval molting. These
separate lines of investigation recently converged with the discovery that intracellular trafficking factors play a
crucial role in aECM regulation at both stages. In the case of embryogenesis, two conserved but previously
uncharacterized proteins, SYM-3/FAM102A and SYM-4/WDR44, enable the nascent epidermis to resist
deformation by biomechanical forces. Current data suggest that SYMs partner with multiple endocytic factors,
including RAB-11, to control trafficking and aECM integrity. In the case of larval molting, conserved members of
the NEK family of protein kinases, NEKL-2/NEK8/9 and NEKL-3/NEK6/7, are required at each molt to facilitate
remodeling of the cuticle, an aECM derived from the epidermis. Current data indicate that NEKLs regulate
trafficking in close association with AP2, a core component of clathrin-coated vesicles, and through the control
of endocytic actin. Future studies on SYMs and NEKLs will combine genetics, cell biological, biochemical, and
omics-based approaches to understand their specific functions in trafficking and to link these activities to effects
on the aECM. To broaden impact, analyses will incorporate mammalian cell culture systems, as current data
indicate that NEKL and SYM functions are conserved. Beyond elucidating aECM biology, these investigations
will characterize mechanisms of apical trafficking, which is poorly understood and differs substantially from
endocytosis at non-polarized or basolateral membranes. Work on NEKLs will also address the role of
phosphorylation in regulating components of the endocytic machinery, which is thought to be pervasive but
remains largely uncharacterized. Moreover, whereas the vast majority of trafficking studies have used in vitro
cell culture systems, work on the NEKLs and SYMs will take advantage of the ability to study trafficking within
an intact developing organism. Finally, proposed studies will yield insights into the roles of trafficking, signaling,
and ECM remodeling in nematode molting, an understudied process with relevance to human biology and health.
Collectively, this work will impact the fields of intracellular trafficking, ECM biology, signaling, and development."
10875297,"ABSTRACT
Many breast cancer survivors (estimated 70% in some studies) experience clinically significant depression
and/or anxiety (together psychological distress, hereafter distress) in the months and years after finishing cancer
treatments. To address this important need, meditation interventions have been developed to reduce distress
for breast cancer survivors, while also improving (or stabilizing) objective indicators of stress physiology (i.e.,
diurnal cortisol rhythm; DCR). In the last several years, progress has been made to deliver these meditation
interventions through digital technology to improve scalability and accessibility (i.e., online and/or through apps)
to reduce distress experienced by survivors. Online meditation interventions are especially important because
they ensure ongoing viability of a popular integrative modality for many survivors who are unable to engage in
face-to-face supportive care activities outside the home. Despite progress, existing online meditation
interventions have several limitations that undercut their effectiveness to reduce survivor distress. Online
meditation interventions have: 1) centered mostly on mindfulness, which does not actively work to cultivate
prosocial and interpersonal relationship capacity and provides limited contemplative skills for survivors who may
suffer from feelings of social isolation that contribute to distress; 2) often been asynchronous, with no direct
interventionist contact over the course of meditation training; and 3) have often not included survivors' informal
caregivers (i.e., adult family members who live with and typically provide half the care for survivors). This
research will address these limitations. We will build on the rigor of prior research to reduce survivor distress
with a compassion meditation intervention called CBCT (Cognitively-Based Compassion Training) for online
synchronous delivery by trained interventionists that is also inclusive of caregivers. CBCT is an 8-week
intervention that starts with attention and mindfulness but then builds to contemplation about compassion for the
self and others, and is different from other meditation interventions (i.e., mindfulness meditation). The goal of
CBCT is to directly enhance feelings of social connection, equanimity, and self-compassion, and reduce negative
affect, and through these pathways lessen distress. We seek to determine if CBCT reduces distress and
improves DCR for survivors compared to an active attention control (Health Education, HE) when delivered
remotely by Zoom to both survivors and caregivers as a dyad (i.e., CBCT for dyads; CBCT-D). We will also test
whether or not including caregivers in CBCT-D reduces distress and optimizes DCR more than when survivors
receive CBCT by themselves alone (i.e., CBCT for survivors; CBCT-S). If successful, this research will provide
evidence regarding efficacy of an online, synchronous dyadic CBCT intervention and the extent to which it
does so through the mediational pathway of social connection with caregivers. This research will fill an important
gap in evidence for interventions that can reduce distress, an NCI priority for the growing numbers of survivors
and caregivers."

The overarching goal of this project is to optimize, validate and implement a revolutionary and safe modality
for noninvasive functional imaging of neural currents deep in the human brain through the skull at
unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Transcranial Acoustoelectric Brain Imaging (tABI) is a
disruptive technology that exploits pulses of ultrasound (US) to transiently interact with physiologic current,
producing a radiofrequency (RF) signature detected by one or more sensors (e.g., surface electrodes). By
rapidly sweeping the US beam and simultaneously detecting these RF modulations, 4D high resolution current
density maps are generated. This approach overcomes limitations with electroencephalography (EEG), which
suffers from poor spatial resolution and inaccuracies due to blurring of electrical signals as they pass through
the brain and skull, and, unlike fMRI and PET that measure slow “intrinsic” signals, tABI directly maps fast
time-varying current within a defined brain volume at the mm and ms scales. As a disruptive and scalable
modality for noninvasive human brain imaging, tABI offers the following benefits: 1) High spatial resolution
determined by the US focus (e.g., 0.3 – 3 mm); 2) Real-time, volumetric imaging of local field potentials and
evoked activity; 3) 4D imaging of neural currents from deep brain structures without assuming the
conductivity distribution; and 4) Co-registration of neural currents (tABI) with brain structure, motion (pulse
echo US) and cerebral blood flow (Doppler). Our multidisciplinary team of engineers, physicists,
neuroscientists, psychologists, and imagers will overcome the primary challenge of detecting weak interaction
signals through skull at safe US intensities. To demonstrate tABI as a safe and reliable modality for electrical
brain imaging at the mm and ms scales in healthy volunteers, we propose to 1) Optimize, calibrate, and
validate tABI using established human head and in vivo swine models; 2) Develop and validate the first tABI
platform for functional brain imaging in human subjects; 2a) Assess extraoperative tABI for mapping patients
with intractable epilepsy referred for surgery; and 2b) Assess tABI for mapping somatotopic organization in
healthy volunteers. If successful, this project will deliver a safe, revolutionary and mobile technology for
noninvasive human brain imaging with the goal of transforming our understanding of brain function and help
diagnose, stage, monitor and treat a wide variety of neurologic (e.g., epilepsy, Parkinson’s), psychiatric (e.g.,
depression) and behavioral (e.g., OCD) disorders."
10906376,"Summary
Invasive neurostimulation is an established technique in the therapy of movement disorders and epilepsy, and
shows promise for amelioration of psychiatric and cognitive disorders. Recently, several implantable
neurostimulation hardware platforms have begun to incorporate sensing of cortical and subcortical field
potential activity, with the capability for wireless streaming from the internal device to external computers over
years. These high temporal and spatial resolution signals may be used for discovering the circuit basis of brain
disorders, developing new therapies rationally derived from circuit analysis, and developing adaptive (feedback
controlled) neurostimulation paradigms in which the device auto-adjusts according to changing brain needs.
The most recent “second generation” implantable devices, such as Summit RC+S (Medtronic), have
substantially improved capabilities and offer great flexibility for novel uses, at the expense of increased
complexity. However, effective use of this and related platforms requires academic investigators to develop
previously unfamiliar capabilities, including programming of the desired device functions using an “application
programming interface”, and documenting the performance and validation of software according to FDA
device regulations. While many BRAIN Initiative funded grants intend to use these second generation
bidirectional interfaces, the four institutions on this proposal, working together, are the only groups that have
surmounted the technical and regulatory barriers to launching clinical protocols with second generation sensing
devices. We have formed the “Open Mind” neural communications consortium to share technical and
regulatory infrastructure with each other and with new investigators, and begun to disseminate this knowledge
at open meetings for new investigators, at the April 2018 and 2019 Brain Initiative Meetings. Through this
proposal, we will greatly expand these technology dissemination activities, to provide investigators with
elements critical to the launch of their own clinical studies: A “turnkey” user interface to get started that
includes open source software elements for neural sensing at home and for adaptive stimulation, and a
streamlined regulatory pathway for FDA approval of investigational protocols, which we call the “Open Source
Quality Management System”. We will disseminate education and resources through biannual workshops and
a web-based library of regulatory documents, software, and the Quality Management System. Our team
represents the major clinical areas of interest in neuromodulation: movement disorders (UCSF), epilepsy
(Mayo Clinic), and psychiatry (Brown/Baylor), and includes experts in the design and dissemination of
implantable devices (Oxford). This consortium will facilitate already funded proposals, as well as entry of new
investigators, in the rapidly evolving ecosystem of implantable wireless neural interfaces. Two new clinical
teams have already begun to work with our neural sensing interface in preparation for their own clinical trials of
adaptive stimulation, demonstrating readiness of tools for dissemination."
10900472,"The Training in Diversity education program, or TiDe, will transform the culture of rehabilitation research by
educating current rehabilitation clinician scientists in the skills and knowledge needed to recruit, train, and
support research trainees from populations underrepresented in biomedical science. TiDe will leverage
partnerships across disciplines and institutions to provide didactic and hands-on research experiences and
“training for the trainers” (current rehabilitation clinician scientists). These clinician scientists will in turn
support the next generation of diverse clinician scientists with the capacity to advance rehabilitation research.
The lack of diversity in science is problematic for several reasons, including limiting (1) the potential range of
diverse talent and perspectives needed to push science forward, (2) the breadth and depth of questions that are
asked, and (3) the generation of scientific outcomes that have the greatest potential impact for the entirety of
society. Given changing demographics in our society, it is more critical than ever that the health sciences
workforce reflects the true diversity of our citizens. Low diversity among the rehabilitation research workforce
is particularly problematic. The lack of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity among rehabilitation
students, practitioners, and faculty automatically reduces the potential pool of underrepresented rehabilitation
scientists. Further, the change to entry-level doctoral degrees for rehabilitation graduate professional programs
has increased education costs. These burdens risk even greater reductions in underrepresented personnel. To
address these needs, rehabilitation professions have launched a series of strategies to engage, matriculate, and
financially support underrepresented students in rehabilitation graduate professional programs across the nation.
Thus, graduate professional programs are currently the richest environment to recruit and train potential
future rehabilitation clinician scientists. Now is the time to augment these strategies and to create pathways
for underrepresented students to transition from professional to research training. Our program will “turn the
TiDe” and transform the extramural research climate by training current clinician scientists in best practices
for recruiting, training, supporting, and advancing future diverse clinician scientists. Current clinician scientists
need to learn how to create training environments that (1) embrace diverse talent and perspectives, (2) actively
combat the sense of isolation often experienced by underrepresented trainees, and (3) provide unbiased, genuine
mentorship and necessary financial support. TiDe will sustain the transformed research climate by investing
in diverse future clinician scientists who will enrich the breadth, depth, and impact of rehabilitation research.
TiDe will be led by rehabilitation scientists in top-ranked occupational and physical therapy research programs
at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Delaware, Washington University, and Boston University.
TiDe will also partner with national professional and scientific organizations invested in training rehabilitation
clinician scientists who have agreed to provide personnel, resources, and funding to augment NIH R25 funding."
10897451,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Decision-making is an important cognitive function that animals use to seek life-preserving rewards like
food while avoiding dangers like predation and injury. Understanding how animals balance between risk and
reward is important, with implications for psychiatric disorders like substance use disorder (SUD), in which
decision-making is impaired. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and dorsal medial striatum (DMS) are brain regions
that are part of the decision-making circuitry. The OFC sends a strong projection to the DMS and it has been
found that OFC-DMS plasticity is important for punishment-resistant reward-seeking behavior. Dopamine (DA)
signaling in the DMS has also been found to play a crucial role in the development of punishment-resistant
reward-seeking behavior. However, whether DA controls changes at OFC-DMS synapses that are important for
punishment-resistant reward-seeking behavior is not known.
 The Lerner Lab found that mice prone to developing punishment-resistance have increased phasic DA
activity in the DMS on rewarded nosepokes and dips in DA activity on unrewarded nosepokes.
I hypothesize that
both events (increases and dips in DA) are important for the development of punishment-resistant reward-
seeking behavior because they separately control the plasticity of OFC synapses onto D1- and D2-receptor
expressing DMS neurons. In Aim 1, I will test OFC-DMS plasticity in punishment-resistant sucrose seeking mice,
to understand how plasticity changes with a natural reward. I will use an operant behavior that elicits punishment-
resistant behavior and then look at plasticity using whole cell electrophysiology. In Aim 2, I will investigate if DA
increases in the DMS lead to plasticity changes in the OFC-DMS circuity using optogenetics and whole cell
electrophysiology. In Aim 3, I will test if dips in DA lead to punishment-resistant behavior as well as plasticity
changes in the OFC-DMS circuit. My proposal, in accordance with NIDA’s mission statement, will aide in the
advancement of science on drug use and drug addiction by providing a better understanding of the decision-
making circuitry that is impaired in SUD. Under this training grant, I will receive training in oral and written
communication skills through presenting at conferences, and through supervised grant and manuscript writing.
I will also receive training in programming, data analysis, and mentoring. The training under this grant will provide
me with the tools necessary to become a high-achieving postdoctoral fellow and eventually a successful principal
investigator."
10898243,"PROJECT ABSTRACT. Despite major treatment advancements, inequities pervade care for children
diagnosed with congenital heart defects (CHD), the most common congenital defect, with minoritized children
(i.e., Black, Latinx) at higher risk of disease complications and death. Parental Participation (PP) is parents’
performing caregiving activities for their hospitalized child, including typical parent activities (e.g., comforting,
diapering) and also includes healthcare activities, (e.g., medication administration, decision making). PP is the
basis of parents’ essential role, contributes to development of parenting confidence (PC), and leads to positive
short and long- term outcomes for children and parents. Further research is needed to understand the
mechanisms by which PP influences PC development. Each family’s unique family demographics and social
determinants of health (SDOH) can negatively impact PP. SDOH include factors which affect health, including
family demographics (family structure, race, ethnicity), SDOH resources (income, insurance, access to
transportation), and SDOH processes experienced in the healthcare environment (healthcare discrimination,
cultural responsiveness). Children with CHD with low SDOH resources are more likely to have poor access to
healthcare and worse outcomes, including a higher risk of death. Despite the demonstrated benefits of PP and
PC, there is paucity of research on the impact of family demographics and SDOH on PP and PC in CHD care.
A more nuanced understanding of individual factors is desperately needed to discern the ways unique family
demographics and SDOH influence PP and PC in the CHD population. This mixed methods study seeks to
examine the relationships among family demographics, SDOH, PP, and PC in CHD care among parents of
children with CHD (n=110). The aims are to: Aim 1. Examine the influence of family demographics (family
structure, race, ethnicity), SDOH resources (income, insurance, access to transportation), SDOH processes in
in the healthcare environment (healthcare discrimination, cultural responsiveness of the care environment),
and PP on PC using structural equation modeling (SEM) of data obtained via cross-sectional survey. Aim 2.
Describe parental perceptions of how family demographics, SDOH resources, SDOH processes and PP affect
development of PC in caring for their child with CHD using content analysis of narrative interviews among a
group of parents purposively subsampled to encompass diverse levels of PP and PC by race and income level.
Aim 3. Construct a comprehensive model of PP and PC, including the influence of SDOH, for racially and
ethnically diverse parents using mixed methods integration of data from Aims 1 and 2. Without a more
complete understanding of the impact SDOH have on PP and PC in CHD, creation of targeted interventions
will fail to meet families’ individualized needs. Results from the proposed study will be foundational to informing
explorations of: (1) additional influences on PP and PC in CHD care, (2) children’s perceptions of PP, and (3)
creation of multi-level family support interventions to enhance equitable PP in pediatric hospital care."
10902344,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mitochondrial diseases (MD) are a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders caused by respiratory chain
dysfunction and metabolic failure. These diseases often result from pathogenic mutations in genes that function
in oxidative phosphorylation or mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance, are often debilitating, and have limited
treatment options with no cures. Environmental exposures, such as microbial infection, appear to exacerbate
the stepwise progression of MD. MD patients are also more susceptible to recurrent infections from opportunistic
respiratory pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Infections can quickly spiral out of control,
leading to sepsis and unrestrained inflammatory responses in MD patients. The underlying immune alterations
in MD that enhance immunopathology are unclear, constituting a key gap in knowledge that complicates
treatment and increases mortality in these patients. Thus, there is a critical need for mechanistic research to
advance immune-focused therapies for MD. Mutations in mtDNA polymerase gamma (PolG) represent the most
prevalent single-gene cause of MD. Ongoing experiments using a faithful mouse model of PolG-related MD have
uncovered novel immune alterations in PolG mutant animals. Notably, PolG mutants exhibit elevated numbers
of myeloid immune cells in the lung and increased lung neutrophil infiltration and cytokine production after
instillation of bacterial lipopolysaccharide or intranasal delivery of PA. Additional preliminary experiments
revealed that PolG mutant macrophages undergo increased pyroptosis after exposure to PA, which is driven by
elevated expression and activity of caspase-11. Prior mechanistic studies showed widespread repression of the
transcription factor nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in PolG mutant mice. Nrf2 orchestrates both
antioxidant and anti-inflammatory responses. Stabilizing Nrf2 with the FDA-approved drug dimethyl fumarate
(DMF) was effective at reducing inflammation in PolG macrophages exposed to live PA. Therefore, this proposal
will test the central hypothesis that loss of Nrf2 activity promotes myeloid cell hyperinflammation, lung
immunopathology, and increased morbidity and mortality in PolG mutant mice and patients with PolG-related
MD. Specific Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that elevated type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and the subsequent
reduction of Nrf2 activity in PolG mutant macrophages promotes hyperinflammatory innate immune signaling
and inflammatory cell death via potentiated non-canonical inflammasome activation. Specific Aim 2 tests the
hypothesis that hyperinflammatory innate immune responses contribute to acute lung injury during PA infection
using a faithful in vivo model of PolG-related MD. Both Aims will incorporate in vitro and in vivo DMF treatments
to characterize how Nrf2 stabilization alleviates hyperinflammation and reduces lung pathology during PA
infection. This research will fundamentally advance understanding of innate immune defects in a relevant model
of MD. It may also lead to the development of innovative Nrf2-based therapies to slow the damaging toll of
respiratory infections and lung immunopathology in PolG-related MD or other mitochondrial disorders."

This is a proposal to request funding for 20 travel awards to be competitively awarded to early stage investigators
presenting alcohol use research at the annual convention of the American Psychological Association (APA), and
to highlight their research in a special poster session and networking event. This event, called the ""Early Stage
Investigator Poster Session,"" has been taking place at the annual convention of the APA for the past fifteen
years, and has been co-sponsored by APA Divisions 50 (Society of Addiction Psychologists) and 28
(Psychopharmacology), made possible through funding from NIAAA and NIDA. Funding from NIAAA has been
formalized for the past 15 years through an R13 award, most recenUythrough R13 {Pl Hoeppner R13AA022858),
which is scheduled to end in January 2023. This proposal is submitted to continue this successful, well-regarded
and unique event that specifically promotes the early career to independent investigator pipeline. The aim to
foster the career development of early stage alcohol and addiction investigators is in line with NIAAA's Strategic
Plan in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of alcohol-related problems, as well as for the rapid dissemination
of research findings. This event is well-attended and information is shared with APA conference attendees as
well as with broader audiences via social media. The rationale for targeting the APA convention is twofold. First,
psychologists make up a major constituency in the scientific community of alcohol researchers and on topics
related to alcohol and addiction. Second, virtually all psychologists' work is direcUy or indirectly affected by issues
related to alcohol use and addiction, providing a unique opportunity to communicate addiction research to the
larger scientific and clinical community. The APA is the largest organization of psychologists and their trainees
in the US and its annual convention attracts roughly 16,000 attendees annually. The APA meeting thus
represents an ideal opportunity to advance alcohol and addiction research and foster career development among
trainees. The goal of this project is to foster the development of the next generation of alcohol researchers from
the psychological community by (1) providing the means necessary to attend the APA convention, (2)
showcasing early career investigators' research, and (3) stimulating networking among trainees and leading
alcohol and addiction scientists. To maximize inclusion, we will specifically encourage early career investigators
from backgrounds under-represented in research to ask questions about the process of submitting abstract and
travel awards, to request connections with mentors/collaborators for submissions to APA, and to apply for travel
awards. To date, the ""Early Stage Investigator Poster Session"" has been highly successful in meeting these
objectives over the past 15 years. The goal for the proposed project is to sustain these contributions to the field
and advance scientific innovation and excellence in alcohol research by supporting the early career to
independent investigator pipeline with researchers from under-represented backgrounds."

on mast cells and basophils is directly responsible for allergic symptoms, signifying a critical role for IgE in the
pathophysiology of allergy. Allergen-specific IgE and the corresponding allergies can persist for a lifetime.
However, the mechanisms that govern the catabolism of IgE and distinguish it from other antibody isotypes,
such as IgG, remain poorly understood. This research project seeks to uncover the cellular and molecular
factors responsible for IgE catabolism. Regulation of IgG half-life is of interest for both improving current
monoclonal therapeutics and treating autoimmunity; targeting IgE in a similar fashion could allow for specific
control of pathogenic IgE. A striking finding from this proposal using transgenic mice is that the two canonical
receptors for IgE, FcεRI and FcεRII, are dispensable for controlling the half-life of IgE in circulation, which is
much shorter than that of IgG. IgE is primarily observed in a cell-bound state, which contrasts with the
predominance of IgG in soluble form. IgE also possesses unique sugar modifications known as glycans, which
affects its cognate receptors. Preliminary data generated by the applicant shows IgE bound to the surface of
macrophages of the spleen and liver. As such, this proposal hypothesizes that IgE is recognized by novel
receptors on macrophages in a glycan-dependent manner. The experiments of Aim 1 seek to investigate the
receptors and cell types directly responsible for IgE catabolism through high-throughput yeast display, single-
cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and radioactive tracing. In particular, the role of spleen and liver-resident
phagocytes in this process will be studied using transgenic mouse models. Aim 2 of the proposal focuses on
characterizing the impact of IgE glycosylation on catabolism. The effect of IgE oligomannose modifications on
its binding to receptors and its clearance kinetics will be evaluated using flow cytometry and fluorescence
kinetics. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses will be used to investigate the
regulation of IgE plasma cell enzymatic machinery on glycosylation. Collectively, these data will uncover key
components of the signaling networks controlling IgE catabolism. In particular, the identification of a novel
receptor could lead to the development of new therapeutics targeting pathogenic IgE. The applicant’s team of
mentors has a diverse set of expertise that will facilitate the success of the project and the applicant’s
development into an independent researcher in Type II inflammation."

Pediatric obesity is an epidemic with striking disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity.
Thus, there is a need to identify novel approaches for obesity prevention, particularly for those at greatest risk.
Primarycare may be an ideal settingfor enhancing reach and equitable access to obesity prevention given the
high percentage of children who attend annual well child visits and recommendations that lifestyle behaviors be
addressed in primary care with all children who do not yet have obesity. However, there is limited support for
effectiveness of obesity prevention for school-aged children in primary care. Thus, identification of effective
and efficient approaches that are well suited for translation are imperative. One such efficient approach may be
enhancing children's sleep. A good night's sleep in childhood is a well-known correlate of healthier weight
status. Adult experimental studies demonstrate that increasing sleep leads to positive changes in eating
behaviors and weight. However, few interventions to enhance sleep duration have been conducted with
school-aged children and we are unaware of any in primary care, which is striking given the large percentage
of children with insufficient sleep and accumulating evidence supporting the importance of sleep for weight
regulation. Our own randomized controlled trials with school-aged children provide compelling preliminary
evidence that a brief behavioral intervention can result in clinically meaningful improvements in children's sleep
duration and that enhancing sleep can lead to positive changes in eating and activity behaviors and weight
status. However, our studies have been limited to academic settings. Thus, the purpose of the proposed study
is to determine

by a RN in primary care) or 2) enhanced usual care (EUC; usual care plus sleep education delivered at the
same timepoints as OSPC). At baseline, end of treatment (2 months), and 6 months, the following will be
measured: feasibility/acceptability metrics, sleep duration (actigraphy), eating behaviors (24-hour dietary
recalls), physical activity (accelerometry), and anthropometrics (measured height and weight)."
10906085,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease affecting over half of the US adult population and
characterized by destruction of the supporting structures of the teeth. Although there is a clear relationship
between increased obesity and periodontal disease incidence, the mechanisms that underpin the links between
these two conditions are not completely understood. Chronic low-grade systemic inflammation in response to
obesity, referred to as metainflammation, is a consequence of immune dysregulation that results from the
continuous exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and saturated free fatty acids under hyperglycemic
conditions. Obesity is known to cause the expansion of immature myeloid cells, termed myeloid-derived
suppressor cell (MDSC) populations, which can differentiate into mature osteoclasts, resulting in alveolar bone
loss. In this application, it is hypothesized that MDSC expansion and mobilization contribute towards obesity-
associated periodontitis through MDSC metabolic reprograming with increased osteoclastic capacity contributing
towards alveolar bone loss. The aims outlined in this application will address questions to determine: 1) the
mechanisms that govern obesity-directed MDSC subpopulation mobilization and function in the periodontal
microenvironment; 2) how obesity or HFD, independent of obesity, contributes toward M-MDSC osteoclastogenic
reprogramming potential, and 3) if obesity status contributes towards differences in MDSC subpopulations in
human periodontal disease. At the conclusion of these studies, new evidence will be provided related to the
cellular mechanisms engaged during diet-induced obesity that contribute towards periodontal disease
susceptibility and progression through MDSC populations in mice and humans."

 Periodontal disease (PD) is an inflammatory condition in which immune dysregulation causes inflammation and
eventually results in tissue destruction. The onset of PD is caused by the outgrowth of pathobiont organisms that activate
chronic immune stimulation. A numerous and complex variety of bacteria participate in the etiology of PD. One such
member of the pathobiont community in disease is Selenomonas sputigena, the subject of this proposal. Numerous studies
have reported that S. sputigena is associated with disease. Despite this, no other published research has directly investigated
how the bacterium causes PD. Recently, our group has published the first ever characterization of how S. sputigena promotes
inflammation in gingival keratinocytes. This study reports that S. sputigena activates the secretion of a broad range of
important pro-inflammatory mediators. Importantly, this prior study also displays that S. sputigena stimulates immune cell
recruitment; of which is an essential hallmark of PD etiology. In preliminary data reported here, we show that S. sputigena
invades gingival epithelial cells (GECs). Here, we propose to elucidate i) the mechanism by which S. sputigena is
endocytosed by GECs, ii) the biochemical and endosomal characteristics of the S. sputigena-enclosing vesicle, and iii) the
intracellular lifecycle of the organism, including the time frame of bacterial viability and subsequent exocytosis. We
hypothesize that S. sputigena is endocytosed by GECs via a clathrin-dependent mechanism and is ultimately trafficked to
the nuclear membrane in a late endosome-resembling multivesicular body. Afterwards, we hypothesize that the organism
survives within the endosome via inhibition of lysosomal fusion and exits the cell via ESCRT-dependent exocytosis. We
propose two integrated Aims to investigate this hypothesis. In Aim 1, to investigate initial invasion, we will directly
modulate clathrin-dependent endocytosis via pharmacological inhibitors. Also, in Aim 1 we will utilize
immunofluorescence microscopy to observe S. sputigena vesicular trafficking during invasion. Last, we will perform
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in order to identify defining features of the S. sputigena-enclosing vesicle. In Aim
2 we will identify how long S. sputigena remains alive inside the cell. Also, we will investigate exocytosis of the S.
sputigena-enclosing vesicle via immunofluorescence microscopy and, in so doing, identify a mechanism by which the
bacterium may escape to re-infect naïve cells. Finally, we will infect a three-dimensional epithelial tissue model with S.
sputigena to investigate tissue invasion via cell to cell spread. The data resulting from these Aims will elucidate the
intracellular life cycle of S. sputigena in GECs. Thorough characterization of this process will establish the foundation
through which to identify specific interactions between the bacterium and intracellular constituents. In this manner, the
precise mechanism by which S. sputigena stimulates inflammation in GECs can be investigated and novel therapeutic targets
can be considered. Understanding how S. sputigena causes PD will further the collective knowledge of how periopathogens
interact with the host and will progress the current understanding of how the members of the complex plaque biofilm cause
disease. Last, researching host-pathogen interactions in S. sputigena will allow for experiments that investigate bacterial
community interactions between S. sputigena and more robustly characterized periopathogens like Porphyromonas
gingivalis."

Enterococcus faecalis exhibits remarkable hardiness, intrinsic resistance, and a proclivity to exchange
resistance driving mortality rates as high as 30% during systemic infections. Progression to infective
endocarditis (IE) caused by adherence and proliferation of bacterial cells on heart tissues presents a poor
prognosis with few treatment options. The relative contributions of clonal lineages, bacterial genetic factors, or
host risk-factors for IE development in humans are still unclear. Animal model and in vitro studies have
identified presumed virulence factors associated with distinct stages of IE disease. Also, studies of patient risk
factors for IE have suggested the presence of a prosthetic heart valve or having a community acquired
infection are important. However, no study has tracked and assessed all these bacterial and host factors
concurrently, which is critical for making optimal healthcare decisions. The proposed work intends to fill this
gap by integrating bacterial genomics, proteomics, and patient health data from a comprehensive collection of
1,189 enterococcal bacteremia cases from an urban region of Canada. Such a unique dataset collected over
15 years will both validate and reveal bacterial genetic factors important for human IE infections. It will also
clarify the importance of microbial genetics in the context of patient risk factors. Aim 1 will curate and assess a
range of patient health and demographic variables from all cases of enterococcal bacteremia to detect patient-
level characteristics associating with IE. Additionally, these characteristics will be mapped to phylogenetic
relationships to link patient factors with clonal spread of bacterial lineages. In Aim 2, genetic variants
associated with IE will be detected via a microbial genome wide association study. Using a linear mixed model
incorporating corrections for population structure and covariates, a comprehensive assessment of significant
variants will be accomplished. Finally, in Aim 3, the expression profiles of ~1,300 proteins per isolate will be
used to compare IE vs. non-IE cases to both validate the importance of previously identified virulence factors
and find new associations unobtainable from genomics alone. Following this, the isolates with the highest and
lowest IE associations will be studied in blood conditions, facilitating a more representative view of protein
expression during IE. Successful completion of this work will provide critical links between bacterial variation
and IE, which will be applicable to improved diagnostic and treatment solutions. The proposed work will be
done at the highly collaborative and innovative Broad Institute under the guidance of Dr. Ashlee Earl and Dr.
Michael Gilmore (Harvard Medical School) and in close partnership with clinical and data scientist
collaborators. Under a clear training plan, the postdoctoral fellow is perfectly placed to network with superb
researchers, publish high-impact publications, and build professional skills. The fellow will also have access to
extensive computational and molecular resources and talented personnel that will improve their technical skills."

Twenty percent of US adults suffer from chronic pain, a condition characterized by reduced mental and
physical well-being, and despite current treatments over half of patients experience undertreated pain
symptoms. Although the most efficacious medications for pain are opioids, they possess serious side effects
and long-term consequences, highlighting the importance of identifying novel therapeutics for treating pain.
There is established clinical and preclinical evidence that cannabis (a plant containing over 550 chemical
compounds including terpenes) possesses analgesic/anti-allodynic effects, at least partially explained by
cannabis’s action on cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors. Cannabis strains with high terpene (odor-causing
molecules of the cannabis plant) concentrations are preferred among patients who use cannabis, and
preclinical work on rodents (demonstrated by the applicant) has shown terpenes can produce antiallodynic
effects in pain models, which was blocked by CB1 receptor antagonists despite not directly binding to these
receptors. In order to advance the understanding of how terpenes interplay with the endocannabinoid system
to relieve pain, the goal of this proposed research is to elucidate how terpenes may alter eCB levels using a
sophisticated and novel modified eGFP CB1 receptor sensor. The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), a
region involved in the descending modulation of pain, has a dense population of CB1 receptors and stimulating
this area induces analgesia. This sensor paired with fiber photometry will be used to measure
endocannabinoid release in the vlPAG in vivo in mouse models of chronic pain.
 The Cahill laboratory uses a Chronic Constriction Injury (CCI) model of neuropathic chronic pain in
mice that captures the acute hypersensitivity and negative affect associated with chronic pain in humans. By
naturally increasing endocannabinoids via inhibitors of their degradation (FAAH/MAGL inhibitors), Aim 1 will
determine if myrcene can augment changes in hyperalgesia and negative-affect like behaviors in CCI mice,
partially attenuated by knockdown or antagonism of vlPAG CB1 receptors. Aim 2 will address mechanism of
action by directly measuring endocannabinoid release using a genetically modified eGFP CB1 receptor sensor
in awake, freely-moving animals. This will be achieved by measuring endocannabinoid release before and after
terpene administration in the vlPAG. Such findings would identify non-intoxicating, FDA-approved compounds
that rapidly modulate endocannabinoid levels as a potential therapeutic strategy. UCLA contains supportive
and collaborative atmosphere with personnel specializing in photometry, in-house virus packaging, and
resources from an established chronic pain laboratory. This productive an integrative environment will support
this trainee plan for a scientist with a disadvantaged background toward her goals of conducting her own
research laboratory at an R1 institution."
10903358,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Family planning prevents unwanted pregnancy and reduces maternal and child mortality in low-resourced
settings; however, women in these settings encounter unnecessary medical barriers to contraceptive care.
Inappropriate medical contraindications (IMCs) occur when providers deny eligible women their preferred
contraceptive method without an evidence-based medical rationale. This medical barrier to family planning use
is difficult to identify using traditional survey methods and has been understudied for the last 20 years. The
applicant’s previous research suggests non-preferred method use is one indicator of IMCs, as 55% of non-
preferred method users reported a ‘medical reason’ for nonuse. Further, qualitative data on medical reasons
for non-use revealed IMC application by providers. Non-preferred method use is undesirable, as it can lead to
dissatisfaction, discontinuation, and unplanned pregnancies. Identifying interventions that effectively reduce
non-preferred method use and IMCs is an important contribution to global public health. The applicant’s long-
term objective is to identify effective and scalable interventions for reducing medical barriers to contraceptive
care for women living in low-resource settings. The proposed project will 1) estimate the impact of two social
accountability interventions on non-preferred method use at the population level; 2) determine the frequency
and elucidate the nature of non-preferred method use due to IMCs using innovative mystery client data
collected among 137 public-sector Kenyan facilities, and 3) use qualitative methods to investigate provider
perspectives on non-preferred method use and IMCs to explore key factors. The applicant hypothesizes that
social accountability interventions, in which community oversight motivates providers to improve their
performance, could increase patient-centeredness of care and therefore reduce non-preferred method use. To
test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will use difference-in-difference methods to analyze pre- and post-intervention data
from a randomized controlled experiment assessing two social accountability interventions in Kisumu, Kenya.
Aim 2 will use mixed methods to analyze mystery client data collected from all public facilities in Kisumu,
Kenya. Aim 3 proposes in-depth interviews with family planning providers in Kisumu, where the applicant will
build a new skill – standardized vignettes – to understand and contextualize provider decision-making around
IMCs. These data collection methods will overcome major methodological challenges that have prevented
research into IMCs in the past 20 years. Results will contribute important new information for improving
contraceptive care in low-resource settings. Additionally, the proposed rigorous training and research plans will
support the applicant in developing specialized subject knowledge, building mixed methods expertise, and
advancing in their development as an independent researcher."
10903424,"Project Summary
Sexual violence (SV) is a major public health issue that disproportionately affects bisexual women (BiW). SV is
associated with devastating mental health consequences. In particular, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are
disproportionately elevated among BiW SV survivors. BiW are also especially likely to use alcohol to cope with their
distress. Alcohol use in the context of intimate relationships is a known risk factor for intimate partner violence (IPV),
including physical, sexual, and psychological harm. BiW report much higher rates of IPV victimization than either
heterosexual or lesbian women. Although research has demonstrated consistent links between SV experiences, PTSS,
drinking, and subsequent IPV risk, little is known about the impact of SV disclosure on these processes. This is surprising
given a robust body of research demonstrating the impact of the disclosure process and social reactions on survivor health
outcomes. This work shows that receipt of negative social reactions to SV disclosure may constitute a “second assault.”
Specifically, BiW survivors are more likely to receive negative reactions – such as blame, disbelief, or minimization – in
response to their disclosures, and are especially likely to disclose SV to intimate partners. The integration of this literature
suggests a process whereby receipt of negative reactions to SV disclosure is associated with heightened trauma symptoms,
which exacerbate alcohol use that, in turn, heightens risk for IPV victimization. As much as trauma symptoms and alcohol
use may be impacted by survivors’ disclosure experiences, these mechanistic processes are further complicated by
minority stress. Minority stress – particularly salient among BiW given the proliferation of misogyny, heterosexist
attitudes, and biphobia within both gay/lesbian and heterosexual communities – exacerbates PTSS, contributes to
hazardous alcohol use, and impedes processes of recovery. More specifically, minority stress may interact, in serial
fashion, with negative reactions from partners and trauma symptoms to predict greater alcohol use and subsequent IPV
victimization. To test this model, a national sample of 300 BiW who disclosed sexual violence to an intimate partner will
complete self-report questionnaires assessing receipt of social reactions to partner-involved disclosure, trauma symptoms
linked to SV, alcohol use, minority stress, and IPV experiences at three time points across six months. Findings from the
proposed study are expected to clarify key interpersonal and intrapersonal processes that may increase risk for IPV among
BiW SV survivors, thus informing the development of effective intervention strategies."

The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is rapidly increasing and
impacts 25% of the global population. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is the fastest
growing cause of cirrhosis and liver cancers, but there are no approved targeted therapies for MASH to date.
Thus, there is a critical need to investigate the mechanistic regulators of MASH to develop effective treatments.
Mitochondria are the primary organelles involved in hepatic substrate oxidation and energy production. Declines
in hepatic mitochondrial respiratory capacity occur in parallel with MASH progression, making mitochondrial
regulators potential treatments for MASH. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein SLC25a25 transports ATP and
inorganic phosphate, thus regulating metabolic potential. SLC25a25 is a critical regulator of ATP availability,
which directly impacts rates of mitochondrial oxidation through alteration of the adenylate pool. The goal of this
proposal is to examine the role and regulation of SLC25a25 in the onset and progression of MASH. The
overarching hypothesis is that SLC25a25 is activated in MASLD to restrict hepatic lipid deposition and
progression to MASH via increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. In Aim 1, I will perform the first cross-
sectional analysis of SLC25a25 expression in human samples from patients with obesity across the MASLD
spectrum. In Aim 2, I will employ a hepatocyte-specific loss-of-function model in mice to mechanistically dissect
the role of SLC25a25 in the onset and progression of MASH. This project will reveal the role of SLC25a25 on
MASH development through regulations of hepatic mitochondrial function and metabolic potential. Determination
of the mechanism of SLC25a25 on hepatic mitochondrial function will provide further understanding of the role
of mitochondrial transporters on metabolic function and disease development, paving the way for the
development of new treatments for MASH. The experimental approach harnesses innovative transgenic and
molecular approaches supported by physiologically relevant first-in-human evidence of SLC25a25 expression to
obtain meaningful data on MASH progression. The findings of this proposal have the potential to provide the
conceptual framework for the development of targeted pharmacotherapies for MASH, which can impact clinical
care and outcomes for patients with liver disease."

Massachusetts. Dr. Solinsky is establishing himself as an early career investigator in the clinical application and translation
of autonomic neuroscience to improve functional outcomes for individuals after spinal cord injury. This K23 award will
provide Dr. Solinsky the necessary support to accomplish the following training goals: 1) Broaden his understanding in
computational neuroscience, with a focus on developing expertise in direct sympathetic nervous system recordings and
spike train decoding, and in ambulatory monitoring of autonomic indicators; 2) Develop novel functional autonomic
neuroimaging through collaboration with local experts 3) Grow his expertise in advanced statistical methods, appropriate
for small-n studies of often heterogeneous populations such as those with spinal cord injury; and 4) Expand research project
management, grantsmanship, and clinical research skills.
To achieve these goals, Dr. Solinsky has developed a training plan with Dr. J. Andrew Taylor as his primary mentor. Dr.
Taylor is a well-respected PhD scientist, with research expertise in autonomic control of the cardiovascular system as well
as how this system is affected by exercise, specifically in individuals with spinal cord injury. Dr. Solinsky will have
additional co-mentors: Dr. Teresa Kimberley, PT, PhD whose research focuses on translation of autonomic neuromodulation
to improve outcomes after neurologic disease, and Dr. Roy Freeman, MBChB, a Neurologist and researcher specializing in
clinical assessments of autonomic dysfunction. Further collaborators with expertise in functional neuroimaging, advanced
statistical methods, and clinical spinal cord injury care are included in this proposal, which will be headquartered at
Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.
Autonomic dysfunction following spinal cord injury is a significant clinical issue contributing to mortality and increased
healthcare costs. Unfortunately, our understanding of autonomic dysfunction in this population is in its infancy. The overall
objective of this research proposal is to characterize cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction after spinal cord injury using a
battery of laboratory, ambulatory, and imaging-based tools. These will be focused on cardiovascular autonomic function,
as this has the highest potential for clinical translation, with correlative structures to other components of the autonomic
nervous system investigated. Research will specifically look to answer two questions: 1) Can discrete cardiovascular
autonomic phenotypes be identified within those with spinal cord injury and correlated to clinical secondary autonomic
complications? 2) Do those with the most dysregulated cardiovascular autonomic phenotypes demonstrate the highest rates
of aberrant spinal cord functional connectivity on fMRI? Answering these questions will help us understand how autonomic
regulation changes after spinal cord injury and how alterations translate to clinical secondary complications."

The FASEB SRC TGF-β Superfamily: Signaling in Development and Disease Conference in 2024 (hereafter
“TGF-β 2024”) will bring together investigators who are leaders in a variety of interconnected and interrelated
disciplines that intersect through a key role of TGF-β signaling in the process. Bringing together such a diverse
group of scientists is essential for a comprehensive understanding and assessment of the TGF-β signaling axis
in development, homeostasis, regeneration, aging, injury, and disease. The scientific presentations, formal and
informal discussions, and poster presentations throughout the conference are designed to expand the
understanding of the genetic, molecular and cellular mechanisms and processes by which the TGF-β signaling
axis influences development and maintenance of organ systems, and to uncover how deregulation of this
control results in disease. This knowledge is fundamental to understand how TGF-β signaling pathways are
regulated and how they execute their functions under normal conditions in restoring the homeostasis of the
body and facilitating successful tissue repair and regeneration. TGF-β 2021 will leverage new and important
findings and provide attendees with: a broader appreciation and perspective of the complexity of the TGF-β
signaling axis; examples of therapeutic strategies being tested and opportunities for considering and
discussing future ones. This is the 13th FASEB TGF-β conference. The field of TGF-β signaling has been
rapidly advancing and expanding; in particular, almost 10,000 articles per year related to
TGF-β/BMP/GDF/Activin/Nodal have been published in the past five years. This fast pace warrants the
convening of this conference and ensures its success. TGF-β 2024 takes pride in the strong tradition of
collegiality of conference attendees and, most importantly, the collaborations that are generated through this
conference. The collective experience built over the previous twelve conferences has provided us with the
confidence that TGF-β 2024 provides a forum for extended discussions and conversations, interactions,
networking, debating of novel hypotheses and prioritization of unmet research or therapeutic needs, and career
training/advice particularly for young investigators and trainees from diverse backgrounds who represent future

This proposal requests funding from the National Institute on Aging for the Biological Sciences (BS) Section
Program at the 2024 Annual Scientific Meeting (ASM) of the Gerontological Society of America (GSA) in Seattle,
WA. Our aim for BS programming is to highlight the highest-quality aging research with a focus on Harnessing
the Hallmarks of Aging. We believe that the best work in the field will emerge when basic researchers
exchange information about health-related biology of aging with medical researchers and practitioners,
psychologists, sociologists, and public policy experts. In turn, improvements in clinical care and public health are
likely to result when gerontologists from diverse disciplines better understand basic mechanisms of aging and
are exposed to the latest and best research with the promise of yielding interventions to ameliorate aging and
age-related disease. We in the BS Section take our responsibility to expose our members, those of the Biological
Sciences and the GSA at large, to well-communicated, cutting-edge science that ultimately serves to inform and
improve the work of all who attend, very seriously. The ASM is situated uniquely in the U.S. to promote an
interdisciplinary effort of this scope, and the 2024 November meeting in Seattle will provide an outstanding
opportunity to expand the diversity of participating scientists. The BS Section has demonstrated quantifiable
success in producing a scientific program of the highest possible quality and providing a forum to engender
interaction and exchange of ideas among scientists from diverse fields. In November 2024, we propose to
intensify and extend our efforts, through a single-track meeting program featuring emerging concepts in the basic
biology of aging; to promote discussion and networking among attendees across sections; to enact gender
balance and diversity in the oral program; and to feature talented early career investigators prominently in
Biological Sciences symposia. In Seattle, we will begin with the National Institute on Aging, Division of Aging
Biology sponsored pre-meeting, two half-day workshops organized by Max Guo and Tiziana Cogliati and Fei
Wang. During the main meeting 14 (non-competing) oral sessions will be held. These sessions were devised by
a team of ten Investigators recruited for their expertise and as leaders in aging research. Each member of the
team will Chair a session and will participate in all aspects of the meeting organization, evaluation, and student
engagement, under the mentorship of PI LeBrasseur. There will also be two poster sessions scheduled so as
not to compete with any talks. Along with GSA leadership, we have devised strategies to recruit
underrepresented scientists and support 8 minority scholar travel awards. Our program shows 31% of all
speakers are Early-Stage Investigators, 42% of the invited speakers are women, and 29% are from
underrepresented minority groups."

Oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is predominantly caused by HPV 16 and other oncogenic HPV types and
disproportionately impacts men and people living with HIV (PLWH). There is no reliable method to detect OPC
pre-cancerous lesions for secondary prevention. Trials assessing efficacy of the 9vHPV vaccine to prevent OPC
are ongoing by our team: NCI-funded U54 grant, Research on Oral and Cervical Cancer, HPV and HIV in the
Americas [ROCCHHA] Trial 201 among men with HIV, and the Merck v503-049 trial among HIV-uninfected
men. While HPV vaccination is a promising approach for the primary prevention of OPC, vaccination may not be
available to those in greatest need as most countries exclude males in their national programs and may not have
policies for PLWH vaccination. Additional methods to prevent OPC and identify PLWH at highest risk for
surveillance are urgently needed, particularly given that OPC incidence rates are significantly increasing in the
US and Latin America. To inform prevention strategies, the identification of modifiable risk factors and easily
measured biomarkers identifying those at highest risk is needed. Development of HPV-related OPC is multi-
factorial. Sexual behavior leading to an oral oncogenic HPV infection is a necessary step. Regardless of
anatomic site of infection, only a proportion of infections persist and progress to cancer. Multiple interplaying
factors influence viral persistence. We are among the few groups that have conducted large oral HPV natural
history studies contributing to this literature. Results from ours and other studies indicate that older age, poor
oral health, immune dysregulation, such as occurs among PLWH, and aberrant DNA methylation influence oral
HPV persistence. Exacerbating this is the fact that PLWH are living to older ages which results in lifelong immune
dysfunction that may accelerate biological aging, increase risk of acquiring or reactivating a multitude of
infections such as EBV, and ultimately lead to reduced oncogenic viral control. Social factors compound this
scenario as PLWH have lower utilization of dental care and other services resulting in prolonged untreated oral
infections, subsequent chronic oral inflammation, periodontal disease, and tooth loss, factors that potentially
promote oral HPV carcinogenesis, and have independently been associated with HPV-OPC risk. We are
conducting two large studies as part of our ROCCHHA grant among PLWH that obtain clinical data and oral
gargle specimens at bi-annual study visits, which we will leverage to study oral HPV natural history. The goal of
this application is to define the natural history of oncogenic oral HPV infection among PLWH. The central
hypothesis of the Oral HPV Research Among Latin Americans Living with HIV (ORAL H2) Study is that
among PLWH advanced biological age, dental health, and viral factors are associated with persistent oral
oncogenic HPV. We will estimate oral HPV 16 and oncogenic HPV infection, assess factors associated with viral
persistence, and determine the optimal combination of biomarkers and behavioral factors that predict oral
oncogenic HPV persistence."

differentially in distinct types of neurons on the OT, but it is not clear how stable these changes in
representations are. Recent studies in many brain regions have revealed a surprising instability in sensory
representations, even when the animal’s behavior is stable. Unstable representations are hypothesized to
potentially arise from ongoing synaptic plasticity, as might occur with ongoing activity or further learning.
Whether such “representational drift” is present in striatal areas including the OT is unknown and will be a
subject of inquiry in this proposal. The PIs will ask whether OT neural representation of previously learned
associations is stable when new associations are learned, and whether the representations are altered
when old associations are unlearned or degraded. The PIs will use deep brain multiphoton imaging at
subcellular resolution to monitor activity in identified subtypes of OT neurons over weeks as mice learn and
maintain odor-outcome associations. Using our collective expertise in behavior, physiology, and imaging,
the PIs will tackle the following Aims. Aim 1: To determine whether neural representations of cue-outcome
associations in the OT are stable over several days. The PIs will train mice to learn the arbitrarily assigned
valence of several odors and track the activity of two cardinal types of neurons in the OT in behaving mice
during and after task learning over multiple weeks. The PIs hypothesize that continuous experience and
reinforcement will stabilize representations in the OT, which can degrade with pauses in experience. Aim 2:
To determine whether and how existing representations in the OT change when new cue-outcome
associations are learned. After mice have stably associated several odors with specific outcomes, the PIs
will introduce new odors to be learned, reverse or extinguish familiar associations, as specific OT neural
populations are tracked. The PIs hypothesize that new learning will lead to greater representational drift for
older, familiar associations. Aim 3: To determine the role of dopaminergic signaling in maintaining stability
and flexibility of representations in the OT. Whether continued dopamine signaling in the OT helps maintain
stable representations through repetition or perturbs stability by promoting additional synaptic plasticity is
unknown. The PIs will perturb dopaminergic signaling to the OT in mice that have learned cue-outcome
associations and investigate how neural representations in the OT evolve. The PIs hypothesize that
perturbing dopamine signaling will degrade representational stability even with continued experience. Our
studies, in addition to answering questions about the function of the OT, will also shed light more broadly on
exciting new ideas about continual learning."

We propose to organize and conduct the Eleventh (11th) Annual Pediatric Transplant and Cellular Therapy
Consortium (PTCTC) Meeting at the Seattle Convention Center, which is an indoor arena located in Seattle, WA,
on April 2, 2024. A unique aspect of the Annual PTCTC Educational Meeting is that it is jointly held with the
international American Society of Pediatric Hematology Oncology Conference (April 3-6, 2024) and includes a
Combined Plenary Session, bringing pediatric hematology oncology professionals together from around the
world. Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a potentially curative therapy for many childhood illnesses.
Basic, translational, and clinical research advances have significantly increased non-relapse mortality after HCT.
The remarkable success is partly owed to the presentation, dissemination, and sharing of new knowledge at
annual meetings. This 1-day program will invigorate the field of pediatric HCT. The theme of the 11th Annual
PTCTC Educational Meeting will be “The First 100 Days”. The meeting will focus on transplant-related
complications and improving care during the first 100 days after HCT. Sessions focusing on transplant
complications will include presentations and discussions on endothelial injury (e.g., veno-occlusive disease and
thrombotic microangiopathy), infections, and acute graft versus host disease. The fourth session will be a
dedicated session analyzing the first 100 days from a patient's and parent’s perspective; the speakers will include
a transplant survivor and his dad. Finally, we will have a session dedicated to healthcare provider burnout. The
primary objectives include providing evidence-based guidelines to screen, recognize, and treat endothelial injury
after HCT through standardized strategies that can be implemented irrespective of the treating institution; II)
review the “state of the science” in acute GVHD immunology and management; III) provide clinically relevant
strategies to preserve the microbiome, and decrease infections after HCT; IV) enhance the understanding of
wellness, thereby maximizing long-term quality-of-life and survivorship of pediatric HCT patients and their
parents; V) review physician burnout and provide attendees meaningful strategies to recognize and prevent
burnout; VI) provide mechanisms to recognized to promote networking and collaboration of research and clinical
trials involving pediatric HCT patients. The results of the 11th Annual PTCTC Educational Meeting will likely
enhance our understanding of the basic, translational, and clinical state of the scientific research in the first 100
days after HCT, which will provide an opportunity and platform to engage young and senior clinicians and
scientists to develop collaborative research. The Organizing Committee will make every effort to enhance
diversity by increasing individuals from diverse backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups.
Participation of trainees and underrepresented minorities is especially encouraged through travel awards."
10898148,"Human communication crucially depends on the ability to maintain good speech intelligibility in dynamically
varying acoustic backgrounds. This ability declines with age and age-related hearing loss. Understanding the
mechanisms underlying this decline is key to finding successful interventions and potential treatments for this
widespread problem of high public-health relevance. Recently, magneto- and electroencephalographic
(M/EEG) measures have been increasingly used to investigate changes in subcortical and cortical neural
processing due to age and hearing loss. Advances in measurement and data analysis methods enable
characterization of neural tracking of acoustic, and higher-level (linguistic and semantic) speech features from
M/EEG recordings obtained while study participants listen to continuous speech. These techniques provide a
unique window into neural tracking of the target speech and to-be-ignored competing background. However,
the interpretation of these measures is hampered by poor control for differences in peripheral (cochlear)
auditory function, lack of direct experimental validation for the role of specific underlying mechanisms, and
often small study samples. Non-speech stimuli have been used to gain a better understanding of specific
mechanisms contributing to the age- and hearing-loss-related decline in speech perception but experimental
evidence that individual or group differences in neurophysiological responses to these stimuli are reflected in
perception is often lacking. The goal of this proposal is to provide the missing link between measures of
cortical tracking of temporal envelope fluctuations in non-speech and speech stimuli and performance in
perceptual tasks, using comparable stimuli. The studies will use young normal-hearing listeners, older normal-
hearing listeners, and older hearing-impaired listeners. In Aim 1, we will investigate effects of age and hearing
loss on perceptual measures of modulation-rate selectivity and discrimination using non-speech well-controlled
stimuli with envelope modulation rates relevant for speech perception. In Aim 2, we will measure cortical
responses to the non-speech stimuli used in these perceptual tasks to establish the sensitivity of EEG-based
measures to changes in perception resulting from comparable experimental manipulations. In Aim 3, we will
estimate cortical responses to speech envelope for natural (continuous) speech stimuli to investigate
contributions from loss of cochlear nonlinearity, changes to modulation-rate selectivity and discriminability, and
changes to cognitive function to neural processing and perception of masked speech. The outcomes from this
project will provide the experimental basis for interpreting noninvasive neural (cortical) measures of temporal-
envelope processing, thus advancing our understanding of mechanisms contributing to deficits in speech-in-
noise perception experienced by older normal-hearing and hearing-impaired adults. The results from the
project will have an impact on the development of potential future interventions and treatments for
communication problems that are widespread among the growing population of older individuals."
10898329,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ABSTRACT
Polycystin ion channel complexes play fundamental roles in human fertilization and embryonic development,
although most frequently dysregulation of polycystins leads to renal manifestations. Autosomal dominant
polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common inheritable form of kidney disease and affects 1:1000
individuals. The root of ADPKD has been tracked to mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes which encode for
polycystin subunits. There is no cure for PKD and patients are relegated to survive on dialysis before culminating
in kidney transplantation.
The hundreds of mutations that lead to PKD are well documented by nephrologists. However, the functional
consequences of these variants are poorly characterized compared to the native polycystin function. Primary
cilia electrophysiology and structural biology have revealed key aspects of polycystin gating, but these
methodologies cannot be rapidly adopted for the characterization of multiple disease variants.
The candidate has developed a novel synthetic biology approach for polycystin characterization that can
potentially enable faster rates of discovery. The goal of this F32 fellowship proposal is binary. 1) Characterize
the functional consequences of ADPKD disease causing variants by implementing a cell-free protein synthesis
method for investigating polycystins. The new synthetic biology method will be deployed to characterize a
mutation hotspot in PKD2, that relies on post-translational N-glycosylation for its function. In aim 1, PKD2 TOP
domain variants will be investigated for membrane integration dynamics and stability of the homotetrameric
assembly. In aim 2, the PKD2 variants will be evaluated for their channel function. Lastly, in aim 3, ciliary
trafficking of these mutants will be quantified via super resolution imaging. 2) The secondary goal is to provide
the applicant with a mentored research and career development training framework to grow as an
interdisciplinary scientist in his journey towards a successful independent academic position.
To accomplish the training component of this proposal the candidate and his mentoring committee have
assembled a training plan tailored to empower his career goals. First, a mentored research training experience
in synthetic biology and ion channel biophysics tied to the proposed aims of evaluating the function of PKD2
variants. Second, career development activities to enhance the leadership skills expected of a successful
independent investigator. Lastly, scientific training focused in providing hands-on experience in advanced
characterization techniques like single particle cryo-EM. By funding this proposal, the candidate will be ideally
situated to transition to an independent career and study other dysfunctional human protein targets utilizing
innovative biochemical tools."

This F31 NRSA application will provide the applicant with the training necessary to achieve their goal of becoming
an independently-funded researcher integrating perspectives from developmental psychology, neuroscience,
and prevention science. This dissertation project seeks to incorporate epigenetic aging as a biomarker and
potential mechanism to explain the association between maternal stress and behavioral and cognitive
development over the first few years of life. The application proposes training in: 1) the integration of epigenetic
aging into the larger study of maternal stress and child development; 2) the methodology for DNA methylation
extraction and analysis; and 3) advanced longitudinal models. The sponsorship team consists of experts in the
fields of Psychology, Neuroscience, and Education from both Teachers College, Columbia University and
University of Texas-Austin. The resources afforded by these sponsors and institutions will facilitate the applicant’s
goal of integrating multimodal and interdisciplinary methods to improve the trajectories of children experiencing
early life stress. RESEARCH PROJECT: Maternal stress during pregnancy and early childhood is a robust
predictor of deleterious outcomes for children’s cognitive and behavioral development. Epigenetic processes are
a powerful mechanism to explain how adverse experiences biologically embed to predict later functioning.
Accelerated aging reflects a biological age that exceeds one’s chronological age, and is tightly linked with both
early life stress and negative physical and mental health outcomes in adults. However, little is understood about
these associations during early childhood. The reported spike in maternal stress since the onset of the COVID-
19 pandemic highlights the urgency with which researchers must examine how stress biologically embeds to
predict later functioning. The present study will leverage an existing birth cohort of socioeconomically diverse
families from New York City to examine the longitudinal associations among maternal stress, accelerated aging,
and cognition and behavioral regulation in early childhood, with the following Aims: 1) Examine the longitudinal,
stress-related alterations in epigenetic age across early childhood; 2) Examine biomarkers and cognitive effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic in mothers and children; and 3) Examine whether accelerated aging predicts
cognition and behavioral regulation in childhood. Maternal stress will be assessed both prenatally and at various
points throughout the first three of years of the child’s life. Both perceived and physiological measures of stress
will be examined in these associations. Children will provide saliva samples at 1-month and 30-months of age to
examine epigenetic age and complete well-validated assessments of cognition and behavioral regulation at 30-
months. Findings will elucidate the relationships between maternal stress and accelerated aging during
childhood and the functional relevance of accelerated aging to children’s behavior and cognition."

 We are requesting grant support for the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
(FASEB) conference “The Consequences of Aneuploidy.” In partnership with FASEB, the next meeting will be
held from September 15-19, 2024 in Melbourne, Florida. The broad goal of the meeting is to bring together a
diverse and cross-disciplinary group of experts who study aneuploidy and its impacts on human health.
Importantly, this meeting fills a substantial gap for the scientific community because there is no recurring
conference series in the United States focused on the consequences of aneuploidy. Our long-term goal is to
develop the conference into a regular meeting series that occurs every two years.
 Aneuploidy, an abnormal number of chromosomes, is associated with many human conditions and
diseases. During human development, aneuploidy is the leading cause of miscarriages and birth defects. In
addition, aneuploidy is also a hallmark of aging and cancer, occurring in approximately 85% of all cancers.
Although recent advances have expanded our understanding of the consequences of aneuploidy, many critical
questions remain: What are the fates of aneuploid cells during development, tumorigenesis, and aging? What
are the universal vs. chromosome- or tissue-specific pathologies associated with aneuploidy? What are the
vulnerabilities of aneuploid cells? How can we therapeutically target aneuploidy-associated pathologies to
develop medical rehabilitation interventions and how can we exploit the vulnerabilities of aneuploid cells to
selectively eliminate these cells? We are assembling the world’s experts on aneuploidy to share their latest
findings, foster collaborations, and advance research in the field. Our current program agenda has 34
confirmed male and female senior and junior experts and includes international investigators as well as
underrepresented groups. An additional 19 speakers will be selected from abstract submissions with an
emphasis on providing opportunities for junior trainees and early career investigators to present their research.
Furthermore, the program agenda includes networking opportunities for junior trainees and investigators during
poster sessions and career development sessions. Critically, an R13 grant will help us to defray the costs for
junior trainees and early career investigators to attend the meeting. In conclusion, a meeting dedicated to
aneuploidy research will substantially advance our understanding of human health and disease and lead to
new therapeutic strategies that prevent aneuploidy, eliminate aneuploid cells, and treat aneuploidy associated
pathologies."

Natural killer (NK) cells have long been known to provide critical early defense against viral infections and
malignancies. Nevertheless, most of the clinical success associated with using NK cells has been restricted to
hematological malignancies, which can be partly attributed to the defective NK cell activation in peripheral
tissues. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are present in all peripheral tissues where they maintain
homeostasis by providing scaffold as well as important developmental cues to the surrounding cells. We have
recently discovered a critical role for ECM proteins in switching the function of conventional NK cells as they exit
the circulation and enter the peripheral tissues. We aim to investigate how ECM proteins regulate NK cell
functions in the skin and solid cancers. Skin and breast cancer are the leading cause of cancer morbidity and
mortality in the United States. These cancers frequently develop primary and secondary resistance to current
immunotherapeutics. In addition, chemotherapies for them cause wide-ranging side effects and thus significantly
burden the health care system. Defective ECM turnover is a hallmark of skin, breast, and other solid cancers.
To fully elucidate the bi-directional interactions between NK cells and ECM in the context of solid cancer
development, we aim to (1) Determine the mechanism of collagen-induced loss of NK cell killing function in solid
cancers, (2) Determine the role of collagen-III in the regulation of NK cell helper function in solid cancers, and
(3) Examine the impact of other major ECM proteins on NK cell functionality. The outcomes of the proposed
studies will reveal novel mechanisms of ECM-NK cell interactions in cancer. Our research will greatly facilitate
the development of novel therapeutic strategies to harness NK cells for the treatment of solid cancers."

Panic disorder affects millions of adults in the U.S. every year. Panic attacks are characterized by
overwhelming fear, difficulty breathing, accelerated heart rate, and an urge to escape. Panic therapies are
often ineffective, emphasizing the need to develop a novel mechanistic understanding of panic attacks to
advance treatment. The periaqueductal gray region has been strongly implicated in panic, as electrical
stimulation of the periaqueductal grey (PAG) induces panic in humans and induces escape, freezing, and other
defensive behaviors in rodents. However, the genetic identity of the specific cell population that selectively
drives escape is unknown. Cholecystokinin (cck), a neuropeptide, is expressed in the lateral and ventrolateral
PAG (l/vlPAG) columns. I propose to dissect a novel neural circuit involving cck+ neurons in the lateral
ventrolateral PAG (l/vlPAG) underlying escape in mice during an ethological predator-exposure behavioral
assay to elucidate the mechanism of escape. In Aim 1, I will test if cck+ l/vlPAG neural activity is sufficient and
necessary for escape from a live predator using chemogenetic manipulations. In Aim 2, I will examine if cck+
l/vlPAG neural activity predicts escape using miniaturized microscope calcium imaging in freely-moving mice in
the presence of a live rat. In Aim 3, I will test if cck+ l/vlPAG cells contribute to encoding of escape and threat
in pan-neuronal PAG cells using chemogenetics to manipulate cck+ l/vlPAG neural activity and recording
subsequent neural activity in cck- PAG cells using miniaturized microscopes. Together, these three Aims will
serve as a comprehensive approach to elucidating the neural mechanism of escape, which will provide better
insight into understanding panic mechanisms."

 Aspergillus fumigatus is the main etiological agent of invasive aspergillosis (IA). IA primarily affects
immunocompromised patients and carries a mortality rate as high as 60%. Due to the significant increase in
the immunocompromised patient population and the emergence of azole-resistant A. fumigatus, a critical
understanding of A. fumigatus biology is needed to improve patient outcomes. Caspofungin, which
targets fungal cell wall synthesis, is a second-line therapy for invasive aspergillosis. However, this antifungal is
fungistatic rather than fungicidal. Comprehending how A. fumigatus responds to caspofungin can lead to a
much-needed breakthrough, improving the caspofungin treatment success.
 Septins are a conserved family of GTP-binding proteins. Septins interact with each other to form higher-
order structures and recruit other proteins. Septins play roles in recognizing micron-scale plasma membrane
curvature, cytokinesis, cell cycle progression, and response to cell wall stress. The overall aim of our R01
application is to determine the molecular mechanism that contributes to the septin-dependent fungal response
to caspofungin. We hypothesize that septin AspB mediates Aspergillus fumigatus fungistatic response
to caspofungin. Our hypothesis is supported by 1) an increase in susceptibility to caspofungin after deletion of
core septin genes in various fungal pathogens, 2) the increase in the number of visible septin structures after
exposure to caspofungin, 3) protein pulldowns that show septin complex together with components of the cell
wall integrity pathway, and 4) preliminary proteomics analysis that shows differential septin-protein interactions
after exposure to caspofungin.
 We will test our central hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1. Determine the role of the septin cytoskeleton in
response to caspofungin, Aim 2. Define septin-protein interactions after caspofungin exposure and Aim
3. Elucidate the role of the septin cytoskeleton in the cell wall integrity pathway.
 Completing this grant will close a critical gap in understanding how fungal pathogens respond to
caspofungin and how septins facilitate this. With this knowledge, novel therapeutic approaches can be
designed to ultimately improve the outcome of caspofungin treatment."

Hypothyroidism is a common disorder that requires lifelong treatment with thyroid hormone replacement.
Levothyroxine (LT4), a sodium salt of the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4), is the recommended medication for
thyroid hormone replacement, but it fails to replicate normal thyroid physiology, which includes production of
both the thyroid hormones T4 and triiodothyronine (T3). The clinical implications of non-physiologic thyroid
hormone replacement are not clear. A substantial minority of patients with hypothyroidism have residual
symptoms of hypothyroidism despite receiving recommended doses of LT4. An adequately powered,
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of combination therapy with LT4 and T3 replacement
(LT3) is required to provide high-quality evidence to guide management of the millions of patients treated for
hypothyroidism. The goal of this proposal is to generate pilot and feasibility data required to design and lead
this definitive trial. The investigators involved in this protocol have experience in LT3 administration in both
clinical and research settings, and they have led the US-based and international guidelines that provide a
roadmap for the proposed RCT design. Data required for the design of a clinical trial of combination therapy
include refinement of the study population, dosing strategy for LT4 and LT3, primary and secondary outcome
selection, and evaluation of statistical power. We are targeting the study population to those most likely to
benefit: individuals requiring LT4 doses of at least 1.2 mcg/kg/day who have residual symptoms. We will
include important subgroups, stratifying randomization by underlying etiology of hypothyroidism (autoimmune
vs. thyroid absence) and analysis by the severity of symptoms and the presence of a genetic polymorphism
that affects metabolism of T4 to T3. We will refine the dosing strategy to ensure equivalence of thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH) levels between LT4/LT3 and LT4/placebo groups using a novel, low-dose LT3
preparation. We will refine primary and secondary outcome selection, symptom and safety monitoring, and
obtain estimates of efficacy for sample size calculations of the large RCT. The proposed aims will provide
essential data on feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and study conduct to inform a fully powered clinical trial of
combination therapy of LT4/LT3 in patients with hypothyroidism. This definitive clinical trial would resolve the
outstanding question of whether a “more physiologic” thyroid hormone replacement regimen that includes both
LT4 and LT3 would benefit patients with residual symptoms taking current standard-of-care therapy with LT4
alone."

funding from the NIH, disease specific sources or foundations. The P/F program is primarily designed for
young investigators who desire to pursue a career in nutrition research. While we do not exclude applications
from more established investigators who propose to move into the area of nutrition research or to explore new
directions within nutrition research, these applications are typically reviewed less favorably. The P/F
program offers a $40,000 award over a two-year period. The Colorado NORC provides funding for pilot and
feasibility projects for investigators who meet one of the
following:
1. New investigators with a project relevant to Nutrition who have no independent NIH (or
 comparable) funding
2. Established investigators with a project relevant to Nutrition who have not previously worked
 in the field of nutrition
3. Established nutrition investigators who propose a project significantly different from previous
Over the past 20 years we have funded 39 pilot projects. Of those who have completed their projects, 92% are
still in obesity/nutrition research, 74% remain in our research base, and 65% have been successful in securing

 Despite recent advances in cancer treatment, pancreatic cancer (PDA) remains a devastating disease
with increasing incidence. PDA is highly refractory to the current standards of care which is due, in part, to a
rewired metabolism that supports growth in an austere tumor microenvironment. Therefore, elucidating the
metabolic pathways critical for tumor growth is imperative to understanding the complexities of PDA biology as
well as identifying novel therapeutic opportunities. There is emerging evidence, however, that in vitro metabolism
may not be entirely reflective of the metabolic requirements of a tumor. Due to the difficulties of studying
metabolism in vivo with conventional techniques, a functional genetic CRISPR screening approach was
employed to determine the metabolic liabilities of PDA tumors and comprehensively define critical metabolic
pathways for primary tumor growth and metastasis.
 In the F99 phase of the proposal, I analyzed CRISPR screening data to create a map of PDA metabolic
dependencies in vivo. I will now use this map of PDA metabolic dependencies to determine critical pathways to
support tumor growth and evaluate these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in orthotopic mouse models
of pancreatic cancer. I will also determine the mechanism by which a metabolic pathway that supports growth
in vivo is not required in vitro. Preliminary analysis of the CRISPR screen suggest that heme biosynthesis is
required in vivo but is not essential to growth of PDA cells in vitro. I have designed a series of experiments to
determine how heme biosynthesis supports growth in tumors and how this dependency is masked by in vitro
culture conditions.
 In the K00 phase of this proposal, I will shift focus from the metabolism primary tumor to metastasis and
the immune system. PDA is highly metastatic and metastasis is the primary cause of mortality for most cancer
patients. Understanding the differences between the metabolism of primary and metastatic cancer will offer
insight into how to treat metastasized tumors and how to target cancer cell metabolism to increase immune
surveillance of circulating tumor cells.
 The proposed work will be the first comprehensive analysis of pathways that support PDA growth in vivo
and will help identify candidates for therapeutic intervention. These experiments will also determine the
metabolic differences between primary and metastatic tumors and how cancer cell metabolism interacts with the
host’s immune system. These data will inform what metabolic pathways lead to immune evasion and if targeting
these pathways therapeutically will lead to a reduced primary tumor growth and metastatic tumor burden."

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a national health crisis, with over 93,000 deaths due to overdose in 2020.
Currently, no FDA-approved therapeutics exist for SUD, with targeted therapeutics out of reach due to
incomplete understanding of the neurobiology of addiction. Our lab has identified expression of Reln mRNA as
necessary for cocaine-responsiveness in NAc Drd1+ medium spiny neurons (MSNs). Reelin is a secreted
glycoprotein that plays a critical role in cortical cell migration during brain development, with mutations leading
to lissencephaly, defined by a smooth-brain phenotype. In the adult brain, Reln expression remains high in the
cerebellum, hippocampus and striatum. Brain-wide Reelin signaling blockade attenuates response to
methamphetamines, indicating a critical role for Reelin in the striatum. Despite high striatal Reln expression
and evidence suggesting Reelin modulates behavioral output of the striatum, Reelin’s role in the striatum
remains under-studied. Using RNA single-molecule fluorescent in-situ hybridization (smFISH), I have validated
our single-cell data showing Reln marks cocaine-sensitive Drd1+ cells. I have also found Drd1+ cells are
enriched in Reln compared to Drd2+ cells in both rat and human brain tissue. My smFISH data show Reln
expression is restricted to the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc) core and absent in the NAc shell.
As these regions have distinct functions, this pattern may reflect the functional relevance of Reelin signaling. I
have assessed the role of Reelin signaling using a CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) strategy to knockdown
Reln. NAc whole-cell patch clamp demonstrates that CRISPRi at Reln significantly impairs MSN excitability.
Critically, in vivo CRISPRi-knockdown of striatal Reln attenuates cocaine preference in a rat model.
Given these findings, I hypothesize that Reelin facilitates the dopamine-induced neuronal adaptations that
follow drug exposure and promote drug-seeking behavior. The proposed study will take a multidisciplinary
approach to rigorously investigate the following aims: (1) Reelin is required for cocaine-related behavioral
adaptations and (2) Reelin regulates membrane excitability to facilitate dopamine signaling. The proposed
studies will deepen our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of SUD, providing avenues for
therapeutic exploration for a disease completely lacking targeted treatments. Under this award, I will master
intravenous self-administration and locomotor sensitization assays to assess the relevant consequences of
genetic manipulations. I will hone patch clamp electrophysiology skills to assess mechanisms behind
behavioral adaptations. These techniques will aid my success as a physician-scientist studying mechanisms of
and engineering therapeutics for brain disorders."
10900435,"Biomolecular condensates are cellular compartments formed through liquid-liquid phase separation of
macromolecules, typically RNA-binding proteins and nucleic acids. The eukaryotic RNA-binding protein Pumilio1
(PUM1) is a post-transcriptional repressor of gene expression that exhibits efficient phase separation in the
presence of NORAD, an abundant, highly conserved mammalian long noncoding RNA. To negatively regulate
PUM activity, NORAD serves as a multivalent binding platform on which PUM proteins assemble, enabling
additional PUM-PUM interactions via intrinsically disordered regions. This promotes sequestration of PUM
proteins within cytoplasmic phase-separated condensates termed NORAD-Pumilio (NP) bodies. The
mechanisms through which NORAD-induced Pumilio phase separation is dynamically regulated are still
unknown. Post-translational modifications of RNA-binding proteins, such as phosphorylation, are important
regulators of biomolecular condensate dynamics. We have made preliminary observations that NP bodies rapidly
disperse during mitosis and reassemble at the start of G1, and I have recently identified by mass spectrometry
putative PUM1 phosphorylation sites exclusively detected in mitotic cells. These observations lead us to
hypothesize that PUM1 phosphorylation rapidly regulates NP body dynamics. In Aim 1, I will quantify our
preliminary qualitative observation of NP body dispersal during mitosis by adapting a fluorescent cell cycle
marker to accurately capture cell entry and exit from mitosis during live-cell imaging. Additionally, I have
previously generated a quantitative image analysis pipeline that I will adapt to measure condensate size, number,
and localization over the course of the cell cycle. Based on my mass spectrometry results, in Aim 2, I will
simultaneously mutate nine phosphorylated residues to generate recombinant phosphomimetic and phospho-
dead PUM1 variants and study their behavior in isolation through in vitro phase separation assays. To determine
the key sites regulating NP body dynamics, I will generate additional PUM1 variants by systematically mutating
fewer sites. Each of the phospho-mutants will be expressed in HCT116 cells, and through live-cell imaging using
confocal microscopy, I will determine whether perturbation of the phosphorylation sites impacts NP body
dynamics in unsynchronized cells and over the course of the cell cycle. Lastly, in Aim 3, I will identify the kinase
responsible for PUM1 phosphorylation by knocking out candidate kinases in HCT116 cells using CRISPR/Cas9
and probing for measurable impacts on PUM1 phosphorylation and NP body dynamics during the cell cycle.
Through the proposed work, I hope to uncover a paradigm for rapid regulation of biomolecular condensate
dynamics that can be broadly applied to other physiologically relevant systems, including pathological protein
aggregation in disease."

This proposal details a five year training plan for the development of a research program focused on
non-genetic mechanisms of therapy resistance in melanoma. Therapies that target the MAPK pathway
in melanoma have remarkable success in shrinking patients’ initial tumors but disease recurs, often
without new mutations that explain therapy failure. This appears to be due to a small population of rare
cells present in the initial tumor that display high levels of resistance genes such as epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) and are not killed by initial MAPK targeted therapy. The mechanisms that drive
formation of these rare pre-resistant cells are unknown, though preliminary studies implicate gene
regulation by enhancers. The goals of this research proposal are to characterize the key genetic
pathways that define pre-resistant cells in patient tumors, identify enhancers that drive expression of
resistance genes and cellular variation, and to identify pharmacologic targets for preventing therapy
resistance. Since EGFR plays an important role in many cancers and non-genetic variation appears to
undergird treatment failure in many different malignancies, the implications of this work for human
disease may be far-reaching. The work will be mentored by Phillip A. Sharp at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, a leader in understanding gene regulation in cancer and whose laboratory has
produced numerous distinguished alumni.
I am a practicing molecular pathologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital interested in how
variation arises naturally within biological systems. In diagnostic pathology, we are attempting to
achieve ever greater ‘personalized medicine’ in cancer treatment using sequencing. To achieve the
best precision medicine possible, we must understand the mechanisms by which tumors evade therapy
that go beyond genetic changes such as mutations. This will allow us to build better, more accurate

during the proposal period is to obtain a tenure-track position at an academic medical center continuing
work as a Principal Investigator. Specifically, during the proposal period I will gain experience with
melanoma model systems, enhancer biology, genomics, and systems biology approaches. My long

Background: Antibiotics have traditionally been developed and deployed as stand-alone antimicrobials,
comprising a single destructive pressure to kill microorganisms. While initially successful, this model presents
minimal barrier against the emergence of resistance. Thus, the arms race between man and microbe has
reached a perilous tipping point: many clinically-significant bacterial pathogens are increasingly resistant to
multiple, and in some cases all, available antibiotics. For nearly 15 years the Hughes laboratory and
colleagues have investigated the antimicrobial actions of the human chemokine CXCL10. This multifunctional
effector mediates receptor-dependent host-targeted activities, including immune defense and regenerative
processes, as well as direct bactericidal effects against multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens.
Towards harnessing the therapeutic utility of these actions, our collaborative team has divided the principal
biological activities of CXCL10 into a pair of individually-tailored derivatives: peptide P1 exerts host-targeted
effects, while peptide D8 kills diverse MDR bacteria. We hypothesize that this exciting breakthrough provides
a tunable arrangement from which to balance and apply a 'multi-fold' therapeutic strategy that directly kills
invading bacteria, enlists immune defense to combat infection, and promotes host recovery.
Approach: To test this innovative concept, we propose to deploy CXCL10-derived peptides to counter
wound/surgical site infections, the most common and costly type of healthcare-associated infection. Using an
established murine model amenable to measuring wound healing and infection outcomes, we will: [Aim 1]
distinguish peptide P1 dose/dosage strategies for affecting host-immune engagement and the promotion of
tissue repair/regeneration; and [Aim 2] determine the therapeutic efficacy of bactericidal peptide D8, unaided
and together with peptide P1, against wound infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
(CRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), clinically-challenging etiologic agents of
wound infections in humans. Animal research will be enriched by in vitro studies that elaborate physiologic
and bactericidal modes-of-action, measure peptide biostability, assess potential lead-peptide cytotoxicity, and
evaluate the emergence of peptide D8-resistant bacterial phenotypes. The proposed research will be
accomplished by a cross-disciplinary group of collaborators with demonstrated expertise in the areas of clinical
infectious diseases, regenerative medicine, immunotherapy, peptide chemistry, and therapeutics development.
Outcomes: The proposed research activities are expected to yield entirely new anti-infective and regenerative
technologies, and establish a unique paradigm whereby antimicrobial therapies not only kill pathogens, but
also conscript host processes to combat infection, diversify selective pressures, and promote recovery.
The original resources and compelling preliminary data described in this application attest to the feasibility and
likelihood of successfully achieving these outcomes towards addressing the mounting burden of MDR bacteria."

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive and devastating malignant disease of the exocrine
pancreas which is characterized by invasiveness, early metastasis and profound resistance to therapies. PDAC
is the fourth-leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States, with approximately 60,430 new cases
and 48,220 deaths anticipated in 2021. Unfortunately, despite the tremendous scientific efforts, it is shocking to
note that PDAC has the worst prognosis with 5-year survival rate of 10% which has not significantly improved
from the past 40 years. Further, the PDAC burden is projected to increase in the next decade and is anticipated
to be the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths by 2030. The high mortality and awful prognosis of
PDAC can be attributed to multifactorial reasons like its intrinsic and acquired resistant behavior, early
micrometastatic dissemination, desmoplastic effect and heterogeneities in tumors, rendering the current
treatments rather ineffective. Developing reliable methods for the effective treatment of PDAC will have a major
impact on the clinical outcome for this deadly disease. We have designed, synthesized and characterized a
target-specific, stimuli-responsive MSN platform for the controlled delivery of cisplatin (cisPt) and gemcitabine
(Gem) (TAB004-Gem-cisPt-MSNs) with an optimal drug ratio. Our preliminary data demonstrates that this
delivery system effectively targets tumor associated MUC1 (tMUC1), increases therapeutic efficiency with
reduced toxicity in both a syngeneic and a spontaneous mouse model that overexpressed tMUC1. In this project,
we are proposing to develop novel MSN-based sequential delivery systems for the effective treatment of PDAC.
The hypothesis underlying this proposal is that by developing a sequential nanoparticle-based regimen where
the primary nanoplatform targets the tumor stroma to deliver a SHh inhibitor; and the secondary nanocarrier,
hTAB004-Gem-cisPt-MSNs, is used to release chemotherapeutics to PDAC cells, the treatment of PDAC will be
dramatically improved. The main goal of this project will be accomplished by the completion of three Aims: 1)
Study the effect of hTAB004-Gem-cisPt-MSNs on the biological stability of Gem and its mechanistic role on DNA
damage repair in PDAC cells; 2) Investigate the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and safety of CyP-MSNs and
hTAB004-Gem-cisPt-MSNs; and the therapeutic efficacy of the sequential therapy in patient derived xenograft
(PDX) mice; and 3) Evaluate the targeting, therapeutic efficacy and effectiveness against tumor metastasis of
the sequential therapy CyP-MSNs and hTAB004-Gem-cisPt-MSNs in a transgenic spontaneous PDA.MUC1
mice model. This data will be the proof of concept for successful bench to bedside translation of this platform."
10900316,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Praziquantel (PZQ), a drug used clinically for four decades, is essential for treatment of many neglected
tropical parasitic diseases; PZQ is the key therapy for treating schistosomiasis, a disease that afflicts over 200
million people worldwide and it is classified as an essential medication by the World Health Organization.
However, heavy reliance on PZQ has several limitations. One challenge has been the lack of understanding of
how PZQ works, as no molecular target in parasites has been identified. Additionally, sensitivity of parasitic
flatworms to PZQ varies, leading to different clinical dosages being required for treating different infections.
Infections caused by pseudophyllidean cestodes, the causative agents of long lasting, sometimes fatal
diseases such as sparganosis (Spirometra spp. and Sparganum spp.) and diphyllobothriasis (Diphyllobothrium
spp.) currently lack an effective drug treatment.
My sponsor's laboratory (Dr. Marchant) recently identified a target for PZQ in parasitic flatworms: a Ca2+
permeable ion channel in the transient receptor potential melastatin family (TRPMPZQ). Resolution of this target
provided an explanation for the different sensitivity of parasites to PZQ, as the binding pockets of TRPMPZQ in
tapeworms with low sensitivity to PZQ contain two key natural amino acid variants that differ from the
schistosome TRPMPZQ pocket. I hypothesize that these differences underlie the decreased sensitivity of these
tapeworms to PZQ. In Aim 1, I will functionally profile cestode TRPMPZQ channels with the goal of discovering
novel chemotypes that activate TRPMPZQ in parasite species that show poor sensitivity to PZQ. This Aim will
provide me training in cell culture, molecular cloning, fluorescence reporter methods and experience
developing a robust, reproducible drug screening pipeline. This effort will also be the first study of a tapeworm
ion channel by high-throughput drug screening. Next, building on my progress evidencing the druggability of
this family of ion channels, I propose in Aim 2 to identify and functionally profile other TRPM paralogs in
schistosomes in vitro and by functional genetic manipulation in the parasites themselves. The work will utilize a
broad range of experimental methods important for my training, including bioinformatic analysis, generation of
stable cell lines, and methods to localize and manipulate gene products within parasites. This work will likely
generate new tools useful for the broader molecular parasitological community.
Overall my training plan will help me master skillsets to work with parasitic flatworms and manipulate their gene
products in vitro (Aim 1) and ex vivo (Aim 2). My training and mentoring plan would provide opportunities for
participation at conferences and enrollment in courses on parasitology, drug design, and global health,
equipping me with skills to work towards a career focused on efforts to eradication neglected tropical diseases."

Lack of appetite is a common symptom of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. While this response is likely
adaptive in acute illness, in chronic diseases it may result in malnutrition leading to morbidity and mortality.
Inflammation-induced anorexia is mediated primarily by immune cell-secreted inflammatory cytokines. One of
the most potent and well-studied anorexigenic cytokines is interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Despite prolific literature on
this compound, the mechanism by which it signals to the brain to generate the psychological and behavioral
state of anorexia is incompletely understood. We have obtained preliminary data demonstrating that IL-1β
influences the dynamics of canonical “hunger” neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. Our current
proposal seeks to expand upon these initial observations by determining how peripherally administered IL-1β
modulates the activity of deep brain nuclei to suppress food intake, focusing on contributions from peripheral
sensory neurons, especially vagal afferent populations. To accomplish this, we will use a suite of cutting-edge
tools including calcium imaging with fiber photometry, chemogenetic and behavioral approaches, and
microsurgical techniques. Our experiments will address how IL-1β promotes anorexia at the circuit level with the
ultimate goal of revealing novel circuit-based therapeutic approaches to treat the nutritional complications of
inflammatory disease. In addition to completing the proposed experiments, this project will enable me to obtain
formal training in both scientific and professional areas. I will solidify my lab-based knowledge in computer
programming and immunology by attending workshops and taking courses in these areas. I will pursue
microsurgical training that will enable me to perform the complex surgeries required for this project. Finally, I will
gain valuable formal training in professional skills including mentorship and grantsmanship through workshops
and programs offered through the university. Taken together, completing the work outlined in this proposal will
leave me ideally positioned to obtain a postdoctoral fellowship in a top lab and ultimately a faculty position
where my lab will work at the intersection of neuroimmunology, metabolism and homeostasis."

Barrett's esophagus (BE), a metaplastic change of the esophageal lining associated with chronic
gastroesophageal reflux disease, is the only known precursor to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). EAC is
one of the most rapidly increasing cancers in the United States, frequently presenting at an advanced stage
and associated with a dismal 5-year survival rate. Endoscopic eradication therapy (EET) is the standard of
care for patients with BE and high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or mucosal EAC. However, a central unresolved
issue is whether BE patients with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) benefit from EET. The diagnosis of LGD is far
more common than HGD and is associated with a lower risk of EAC, so it is unclear whether the costs and
complications of EET are justified in this group of patients or whether they should simply continue with periodic
surveillance endoscopy. The presence of clinical equipoise and the importance of this question indicates that a
trial of endoscopic surveillance versus EET in this patient population is an urgent, unmet gap in our current
knowledge regarding treatment of this common condition. We are uniquely positioned to address this
significant gap in knowledge as we have assembled a multidisciplinary team with the requisite expertise in the
conduct of clinical trials and biomarker research to ensure successful design and high-quality execution of the
SURVENT trial (Surveillance versus Endoscopic Therapy for BE with LGD). This multicenter randomized
controlled trial (n=530) will compare endoscopic surveillance and EET for the management of LGD using
uniform inclusion criteria, design and endpoints. This trial will also include an observational cohort arm for
those who decline randomization but are otherwise eligible (up to 150 subjects). Following our achievements
during the U34 grant period, we propose the following aims for the U01: Specific Aim #1 will compare the two
approaches using the primary endpoint of neoplastic progression rate (progression to HGD or mucosal or
invasive EAC). Specific Aim #2 will compare patient-centered outcomes such as health-related quality of life
between the two treatment groups. Specific Aim #3 will determine the utility of molecular (TissueCypher and
p53 immunohistochemistry) and imaging (wide-area transepithelial sampling – WATS) biomarkers to improve
risk-stratification in BE with LGD patients undergoing surveillance and EET. Biological samples will also be
obtained at pre-specified time points to establish a biorepository for future translational research initiatives. The
relevance of this work to the public health is high. BE is a common condition, affecting 2-3% of adult US
population and LGD is seen in up to 40% of BE patients. This is a precursor for EAC and millions of dollars are
spent yearly on the management of BE and EAC patients. The impact of our innovative study will include
identifying the best patient-centered treatment approach for BE patients with LGD, which will inform the care of
thousands of patients annually."

Xpert® MTB/RIF Ultra (“Ultra”) is a highly sensitive and widely used rapid molecular test for diagnosing
tuberculosis (TB), with potential to play a much-needed role in finding people with undiagnosed TB. Results at
Ultra’s lowest semi-quantitative result level, “trace,” account for much of the assay’s enhanced ability to detect
TB. However, the usefulness of Ultra is jeopardized by the large number of people (including asymptomatic,
treatment-naïve people) whose sputum is positive at the trace level by Ultra, but negative for M. tuberculosis
by culture. The cause of these Ultra-trace-positive but culture-negative results is uncertain: They might include
people who are in the early stages of developing TB disease, people with recent TB that is resolving, people
recently exposed to M. tuberculosis and possibly infected, or laboratory error. Because the associated risk of
developing TB for people with trace-positive Ultra results is unknown, it is unclear how these individuals should
be managed. Furthermore, in the context of efforts to achieve earlier diagnosis of TB by screening
asymptomatic individuals in the community, it is unclear whether trace-positive Ultra results with negative
corresponding cultures represent false-positive tests (and thus should prompt more cautious use of the Ultra
assay) or represent very early TB that is likely to progress to advanced TB disease (making people with trace-
positive Ultra results the ideal target for efforts at early detection of TB).
This study seeks to clarify the current burden and future risk of TB in people with Ultra-trace-positive sputum,
while gaining insight into the dynamics that underlie trace-positive Ultra results. By offering sputum-based
testing for TB on a community-wide basis to asymptomatic adolescents and adults in Uganda, we will test tens
of thousands of people for TB with Ultra. In the process, we will identify 250 people with trace-positive sputum
Ultra results in community settings in Uganda, along with positive and negative controls who clearly have or
clearly do not have TB. In Specific Aim 1, we will collect extensive clinical and laboratory data in order to
determine how many of these individuals have evidence of TB disease at the time that they test Ultra-trace-
positive, and to understand what other mechanisms might explain the Ultra results of those in whom we find no
further evidence of TB. In Specific Aim 2, we will closely follow those who were not found to have TB initially.
Among these individuals, we will evaluate the incidence of TB and the dynamics of any molecular, imaging,
and immunological abnormalities over time. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will use several approaches (decision
analytic modeling of individual outcomes, dynamic transmission modeling of population impact, and a public
health ethics analysis) to place what we learn from Ultra-trace-positive individuals into context, in order to help
public health decision-makers use our results to improve how they go about finding people with TB."

The goal of this proposal is to dissect the distinct molecular roles of protein-RNA interactions between RNA
and the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) during neural differentiation. PRC1 is a conserved chromatin
modifier that represses transcription via chemical and structural alterations of chromatin architecture. PRC1
mutations cause neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by microcephaly, intellectual disabilities, and
dysmorphic body features, making it crucial to gain understanding about PRC1 function. Despite its ubiquitous
expression, PRC1 can target distinct sets of genes for silencing in different cell lineages, resulting in cell-type
specific expression. Though there are decades of research on Polycomb protein function, a key unanswered
question is how PRC1 selects different target genes in different cell types. Mounting evidence in the field
indicates that major epigenetic events are regulated by interactions between RNA and chromatin-modifying
proteins, including subunits of PRC1. However, PRC1-RNA interactions remain underexplored.
My preliminary data indicates that at least two PRC1 subunits, SCMH1 and RING1B bind to RNA in vivo. I will
investigate the regulatory role of these protein-RNA interactions in the context of directed differentiation of mouse
embryonic stem cells (ESCs) into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) with the following specific aims.
In Aim 1, I will identify RNAs directly bound to SCMH1 and RING1B in pluripotent ESCs using state-of-the art
photocrosslinking and sequencing approaches. I will also map protein residues required for these interactions
using a new technology that couples genetically encoded peptide barcodes to a mutational library for each
subunit followed by a mass spectrometry readout.
In Aim 2, I will investigate the functional roles of these protein-RNA interactions during neural differentiation by
using our existing RNA-binding PRC1 mutants and a degrade-and-rescue approach, leveraging my lab’s
expertise in acute protein degradation. The experiments in this proposal will provide the first in-depth
characterization of PRC1-RNA interactions in regulating cell fate transitions during differentiation.
To achieve these aims, I have developed with my sponsor and co-sponsor a rigorous and comprehensive
training program with four primary goals: 1) become an expert in mass spectrometry for protein-RNA
biochemistry, 2) gain experience in cutting-edge functional genomics methods, 3) increase proficiency in
bioinformatics and data analysis, 4) sharpen my research communication skills.
I am confident that my choice of sponsor and co-sponsor combined with my diverse training background and
the collaborative nature of my training environment will enable me to achieve my goals and the proposed
research plan simultaneously."

Chemical modification of RNAs opens another avenue to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional
level. Many mRNAs are modified with N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and controlled modification is important to
maintain proper RNA function throughout its life cycle, including processing, translation, splicing, and
degradation. METTL3/METTL14 RNA methyltransferase complex is responsible for creating m6A marks on many
mRNAs. The catalytic activity of the METTL3/METTL14 complex is essential to most of its known functions.
Dysregulation of METTL3/METTL14 activity has been linked to many types of cancer. In numerous types of
malignancies, hyperactivity of the METTL3/METTL14 complex promotes disease. Therefore, potent and specific
small molecule inhibitors of METTL3/METTL14 are likely to have therapeutic benefit. Moreover, the mechanisms
through which a change in METTL3/METTL14 activity influences various biological processes including
oncogenesis need to be investigated with more rigor. Chemicals that can specifically switch off
METTL3/METTL14 on demand will be valuable probes to dissect the diverse pathways that involve m6A,
including carcinogenesis. Here we propose to identify small drug-like molecules that block the methyltransferase
activity of METTL3/METTL14, prioritizing the inhibitory effect on the gain-of-function mutant. We will use an
unbiased screen of a large chemical library to find compounds that can effectively inhibit METTL3/METTL14
activity. In Aim 1, we will establish the primary high-throughput assay and implement it to test all the compounds
in our chemical library. In Aim 2, we will efficiently and effectively prioritize the cherry-picked compounds to
identify the top hits through a streamlined approach that uses multiple high-throughput secondary and counter
screens. In Aim 3, we will use multiple orthogonal assays and mechanism of action studies to prioritize the top
hits further to arrive at potential lead compounds that are specific for METTL3/METTL14, and not for other
enzymes including other m6A methyltransferases. In addition we will initiate lead optimization by using our
structural expertise to analyze the structure-activity relationship. The proposed study will yield small molecules
inhibitors of METTL3/METTL14 that have been rigorously characterized by using biochemical, biophysical, and
cell-based methods and will establish the groundwork for future development through the NCI Experimental
Therapeutics (NExT) program."
10872550,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
Radiation therapy has a definitive role in curing high risk, very high risk, and even oligometastatic or low-
volume metastatic disease as phase III trials in these settings have demonstrated overall survival benefits.
However, radiation therapy also involves incidental radiation dose to rectum, small bowel and urethra, which
cause radiation dose-limiting toxicity. Locoregional control, particularly within pelvic lymph node regions where
currently possible radiation doses are non-curative, can be a limiting factor in overall prostate curability in these
settings. In this proposal, we seek to create state-of-the-art PSMA-targeting therapeutics, taking advantage of
this relatively prostate-specific surface antigen. We will create two molecules consisting of the PSMA ligand
linked to a lysosomal cleavable linker which is turn linked to radiation sensitizing small molecule inhibitors of
the DNA damaging response. One molecule will involve a potent inhibitor of ATM and the second will involve
an inhibitor of DNA-PK, two targets integral to radiation efficacy. In SA1 we will test these novel molecules with
in vitro assessments of inhibition of the ATM and DNA-PK kinases in PSMA expressing prostate cancer cell
lines compared to PSMA non-expressing cells. In SA2, we will test these molecules for in vivo efficacy in
prostate cancer xenografts and determine target engagement and preliminary normal tissue toxicity. The
overarching goal addressed by the proposed research project is to develop treatments that could improve
survival for men with lethal prostate cancer by improving locoregional control, which does impact overall
survival in these men. In addition, if these molecules successfully radiosensitize, it is also possible they will
allow for external beam radiation dose de-escalation and enable less normal tissue toxicity in order to improve
quality of life outcomes. Finally, in downstream work the molecules could be combined with Radium-223 to
systemically radiosensitize a therapy proven to extend survival. In this pilot grant, we will determine the initial
feasibility of this approach, laying the groundwork for further therapeutic development."
10875093,"The goal of the Columbia Roybal Center for Fearless Behavior Change is to advance behavioral
interventions that reduce psychological distress and improve health behaviors in midlife and older adults that
experience serious health events. Each year, millions of adults experience events such as heart attacks,
strokes, or life-threatening cancer diagnoses. For some, these events serve as a wake-up calls, or “teachable
moments,” and those patients acquire health behaviors that prevent recurrent events and slow disease
progression. Yet, many of these patients are highly distressed after these events, leading to substantial impact
on quality of life, health behaviors, and prognosis. For example, 1 in 3 patients develop PTSD symptoms after
cardiac arrest and critical illness, and 1 in 5 patients develop persistent depressive symptoms after heart
attacks. Those patients who are highly distressed are less likely to follow recommended health behaviors such
as taking medications, exercising, and having good sleep. We have shown that many patients avoid
medications because they are reminders of disease risk, and exercise because physiological changes (e.g.,
heart rate) are frightening reminders of the possibility of a recurrent event. Accordingly, our Roybal Center is
interested in advancing interventions that target these fear-based mechanisms for which interventions are
underdeveloped. There are already evidence-based interventions for reducing other common forms of
psychological distress after serious health events such as anxiety and depression. Our Center also aims to
conduct implementation research that accelerates the adoption of these effective interventions into practice.
Our Center's Administrative Core will support and facilitate the administrative management of the proposed
Center, as well as the coordination of clinical trial selection via a national competition; financial and regulatory
oversight of trials; maintenance of Common Evaluation Metrics including those relevant to DEIA in the make-
up of scientific teams and recruitment/retention of participants; engagement with key stakeholders;
communication within and between Roybal Centers and clinical trial scientists; and dissemination of scientific
products. This Core will collaborate with the Stress Measurement Network and Science of Behavior Change
program to ensure robust measurement of behavioral mechanisms in all trials. It will also convene an External
Advisory Committee comprised of scientific experts in the conduct of behavioral trials and patient stakeholders
that will review and prioritize applications for new trials to the Center as well as provide strategic advice on the
overall conduct of the Center. This Core will remain in close communication with the Behavioral Intervention
Development Core that provides implementation science, regulatory, and statistical support to trialists, and is
responsible for conducting clinical trials in our Center. Together, these Cores will ensure the efficient and
successful conduct and dissemination of rigorous behavioral trials with the potential to improve the well-being
and prognosis of midlife and older adults who experience serious health events."

Severe malaria induces changes in circulating blood levels of the biogenic amines histamine and serotonin
(5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and these changes are associated with human disease pathology. Histamine and
5-HT are also important neuromodulators in insects, including mosquitoes. Our overarching hypothesis is
that histamine and 5-HT, ingested in blood by feeding mosquitoes, signal through anopheline biogenic amine
receptors and alter endogenous biogenic amine levels, life history traits, behavior and mosquito infection
success to amplify malaria parasite transmission. These studies are innovative in that they connect novel
mosquito biology to clinical observations in malaria, they focus on mosquito ingestion of biogenic amines at
physiological levels detected in blood and they will define previously unexplored anopheline gut-brain axes for
histaminergic and serotonergic signaling. We will address our overarching hypothesis with three Specific Aims.
In Aim 1, we will define and model the scope of effects of ingested histamine and 5-HT, alone and in
combination at concentrations that reflect malaria-associated and healthy blood levels, on An. stephensi
infection success with Plasmodium falciparum and with the mouse parasite Plasmodium yoelii yoelii 17XNL.
We will also examine the effects of these treatments on the tendency to take a second bloodmeal,
thermotolerance, fecundity, clutch size and lifespan. In Aim 2, we will use antennal and retinal recordings and
behavioral bioassays to define the effects of ingested histamine and 5-HT, alone and in combination, on visual
and olfactory physiology in An. stephensi. In Aim 3, we will quantify endogenous histamine and 5-HT in An.
stephensi and map associated histaminergic and serotonergic gut-to-brain signaling networks. We will also
identify and model effects of ingested biogenic amines on levels of endogenous biogenic amines and use
histamine and 5-HT receptor antagonists to interrupt signaling control of malaria parasite infection, tendency to
take a second bloodmeal and reproduction in An. stephensi. With completion of these studies, we will establish
that biogenic amine concentrations associated with severe malaria and ingested by feeding mosquitoes can
alter mosquito physiology and biology in patterns that would be predicted to favor parasite transmission. Such
knowledge can be used in the future to connect transmission control to clinical interventions (e.g., to reduce
elevated histamine and reverse declines in 5-HT to mitigate human malarial disease) and for future
development of novel lures to manipulate biogenic amine signaling in vector mosquitoes."
10875524,"We propose to use fertilization in the green alga Chlamydomonas as a model system to investigate conserved
but still poorly understood cellular and molecular mechanisms of ciliary signaling and the gamete membrane
fusion reaction. When Chlamydomonas gametes of opposite mating types are mixed together they adhere to
each other by complementary adhesion receptors on their cilia. Interactions between the adhesion receptors
SAG1 on plus gametes and SAD1 on minus gametes initiate a signaling pathway that is transmitted to the cell
body and triggers a rapid increase in cellular cAMP that activates the gamete for cell-cell fusion. Regulation of
ciiliary cyclic nucleotides by ciliary receptor engagement has been conserved throughout evolution and in almost
all ciliary signaling events in vertebrates, the primary response to engagement of ciliary receptor is a change in
the concentration of cAMP within the organelles. Moreover, in most vertebrate ciliary systems, the mechanisms
that transmit the increase in ciliary cAMP to a cellular response are unclear. We have discovered that a protein
kinase, GSPK, in Chlamydomonas functions at a previously unrecognized step in ciliary signaling. GSPK is
localized in the cytoplasm, not the cilia, yet the entire cellular complement of GSPK is phosphorylated within 1
minute after engagement of the ciliary adhesion receptors. Furthermore, GSPK phosphorylation is upstream of
the cAMP increase and GSPK function is required for the rapid increase in cAMP. Our findings set the stage for
new strategies to investigate cellular and molecular mechanisms that couple ciliary receptor engagement to a
cytoplasmic response. We will use a combination of cell biological, biochemical, and imaging strategies to
investigate the mechanisms underlying GSPK function. Gamete activation also activates erection of apically
localized protrusions, the plus and minus mating structures, from the plasma membrane of each gamete that
are the sites of membrane fusion during fertilization..We have made exciting advances in understanding
conserved molecular mechanisms of the gamete membrane fusion reaction, and we now know more about cell-
cell fusion in Chlamydomonas than is known in any other system. 1) We showed that bilayer merger of the two
cells is driven by trimer formation of eukaryotic class II fusion protein, HAP2, a ancient protein required for
fertilization in organisms across kingdoms. 2) We have now identified the separate cell-cell adhesion proteins s
FUS1 and MAR1 at the fusion site of each cell. 3) We demonstrated that the adhesion protein MAR1 on minus
gametes not only binds to FUS1 on plus gametes, but MAR1 is also biochemically and functionally linked to
HAP2. 4) We showed that membrane adhesion mediated by FUS1-MAR1 interactions releases the restrained,
prefusion form of HAP2, leading to the irreversible structural rearrangements into the fusion-driving HAP2 trimer.
5) In collaborative laboratory studies and field studies in Africa, we showed that targeting the conserved fusion
loop of Plasmodium HAP2 inhibits the mosquito transmission of malaria. Our discoveries now make possible a
detailed, structure- and function-based molecular dissection of ciliary signaling and gamete fusion.."

 Manganese (Mn) is an essential metal, but elevated levels induce severe neurotoxicity that has no treatment.
While the direct neurotoxic effects of Mn are well studied, Mn is predominantly excreted by the liver and
intestines, and a high prevalence of neurotoxicity associated with elevated blood and brain Mn levels is reported
in patients with liver disease. Moreover, recent epidemiological studies suggest that alterations in Mn excretory
capacity are widely prevalent in the general population due to common genetic polymorphisms. Yet, the role of
Mn excretion in modulating the outcomes of Mn induced neurological disease is unclear, and the critical question
of whether the risk of Mn neurotoxicity depends on Mn excretion capacity has not been answered.
 Until recently, a major limitation in studying the relationship between Mn excretion and neurotoxicity was that
the mechanisms of Mn excretion were unknown. Our recent work, supported by a NIEHS “ONES” R01, revealed
that the combined activities of two Mn transporters, SLC30A10 and SLC39A14, were necessary for Mn excretion
— SLC39A14 transported Mn from blood into the liver and intestines, and SLC30A10 excreted the intracellular
Mn into bile and feces. Further, our analyses of Slc30a10 and/or Slc39a14 knockout mice demonstrated that
brain Mn levels were primarily regulated by the excretory activities of these transporters in the liver and intestines.
 Based on the predominant role of excretion in controlling Mn levels in the brain, we hypothesize that hepatic
and intestinal Mn excretion are critical modulators of the risks and outcomes of Mn neurotoxicity. We will test
this hypothesis by leveraging liver or intestine specific Slc30a10 knockout or knockin mice, which we generated
in the ONES phase, as novel human relevant models to decrease or increase Mn excretion, respectively.
 Aims 1 & 2 will directly establish the regulatory role of hepatic and intestinal Mn excretion in Mn neurotoxicity.
In Aim 1, we will determine whether liver or intestine specific Slc30a10 knockout mice exhibit heightened
sensitivity to Mn neurotoxicity. In Aim 2, we will test whether liver or intestine specific Slc30a10 knockin mice
are protected against Mn neurotoxicity. Studies in Aim 2 have high translational relevance as they may identify
increasing Mn excretion to be an effective strategy for the management of Mn neurotoxicity.
 Aim 3 will build on our finding that elevated Mn exposure enhanced SLC30A10 expression via Hif1α in the
liver, providing a means to increase Mn excretion during toxicity. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanisms and
determine whether this response protects against neurotoxicity. These studies will provide foundational
information about protective responses to Mn at the organism level, which have not yet been described, and set
the stage to test if Hif1α activators, in clinical trials for other diseases, can be repurposed for Mn neurotoxicity.
 In sum, our studies will provide fundamental insights into a central, but overlooked, aspect of Mn
neurotoxicity, and aid in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for Mn induced neurological disease."

of whether the risk of Mn neurotoxicity depends on Mn excretion capacity has not been answered.
 Until recently, a major limitation in studying the relationship between Mn excretion and neurotoxicity was that
the mechanisms of Mn excretion were unknown. Our recent work, supported by a NIEHS “ONES” R01, revealed
that the combined activities of two Mn transporters, SLC30A10 and SLC39A14, were necessary for Mn excretion
— SLC39A14 transported Mn from blood into the liver and intestines, and SLC30A10 excreted the intracellular
Mn into bile and feces. Further, our analyses of Slc30a10 and/or Slc39a14 knockout mice demonstrated that
brain Mn levels were primarily regulated by the excretory activities of these transporters in the liver and intestines.
 Based on the predominant role of excretion in controlling Mn levels in the brain, we hypothesize that hepatic
and intestinal Mn excretion are critical modulators of the risks and outcomes of Mn neurotoxicity. We will test
this hypothesis by leveraging liver or intestine specific Slc30a10 knockout or knockin mice, which we generated
in the ONES phase, as novel human relevant models to decrease or increase Mn excretion, respectively.
 Aims 1 & 2 will directly establish the regulatory role of hepatic and intestinal Mn excretion in Mn neurotoxicity.
In Aim 1, we will determine whether liver or intestine specific Slc30a10 knockout mice exhibit heightened
sensitivity to Mn neurotoxicity. In Aim 2, we will test whether liver or intestine specific Slc30a10 knockin mice
are protected against Mn neurotoxicity. Studies in Aim 2 have high translational relevance as they may identify
increasing Mn excretion to be an effective strategy for the management of Mn neurotoxicity.
 Aim 3 will build on our finding that elevated Mn exposure enhanced SLC30A10 expression via Hif1α in the
liver, providing a means to increase Mn excretion during toxicity. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanisms and
determine whether this response protects against neurotoxicity. These studies will provide foundational
information about protective responses to Mn at the organism level, which have not yet been described, and set
the stage to test if Hif1α activators, in clinical trials for other diseases, can be repurposed for Mn neurotoxicity.
 In sum, our studies will provide fundamental insights into a central, but overlooked, aspect of Mn
neurotoxicity, and aid in the development of novel therapeutic approaches for Mn induced neurological disease."

Children who exhibit externalizing problems including conduct problems, oppositional defiance, and attention-
deficit hyperactivity symptoms exhibit significant psychological difficulties and incur substantial societal and
economic costs. One identified early risk factor for children’s externalizing difficulties is callous-unemotional
(CU) traits, defined by indifference and apathy and diminished sense of guilt and empathy for others. Prior
work has been limited to investigations of correlates of CU traits and externalizing behaviors separately.
However, research has yet to examine process-oriented models to identify explanatory risk mechanisms of the
relation between children’s CU traits and later externalizing problems. Understanding the underlying processes
of this association may help to further refine current early childhood interventions and identify important targets
necessary to disrupt the pathogenic cascade and ensuing externalizing difficulties. Therefore, the present
study plans to address this gap by examining three distinct classes of risk mechanisms as mediators
of the relation between children’s CU traits and subsequent externalizing problems. First, although
conceptual models propose that CU traits modify how children’s encoding and processing of emotional cues
and consequently their increased aggressive behavior towards others, no studies have examined children’s
emotion-biased attentional processes as a risk mechanism of CU traits and externalizing problems. Thus,
the current study examines children’s attentional biases to happy, angry, and sad faces as mediators of this
association (Aim 1). Second, research has indicated that children with CU traits may also experience deficits in
emotion understanding, including emotion identification and emotion perspective taking. In turn, children with
high CU traits are posited to have difficulties tailoring their responses to others due to deficits in understanding
the meaning and consequences of emotional displays. Thus, this project proposes to test children’s emotion
understanding as an explanatory risk mechanism in the relation between children’s CU traits and later
externalizing problems (Aim 2). Lastly, given children with CU traits are more likely to have deficits in the
motivation to recruit resources to address challenges in the environment, this may be instantiated in dampened
reactivity across both the parasympathetic (PNS) and sympathetic (SNS) nervous systems. Thus, the
proposed research will examine whether children’s physiological reactivity mediates the prospective
association between CU traits and externalizing problems (Aim 3). This work addresses the limitations of prior
research by leveraging existing data from a multimethod (i.e., surveys, observations, physiology, eye-tracking),
multi-informant (i.e., mother, partner, child), multilevel (i.e., behavioral, cognitive, biological), longitudinal study
of 238 families and their preschool children. Findings of this work will contribute to the development of
additional clinical tools and improvement of interventions for children’s externalizing problems."

 Dental caries is a polymicrobial disease that affects much of the human population worldwide, where the
equilibrium of a cooperative eco-organization among commensal microbes shifts towards a dysbiotic framework
with an overrepresentation of pathogenic microorganisms, especially by Streptococcus mutans (SM). The
progression of this disease begins with bacterial attachment and a complex cascade of events that include the
production of soluble (a-1,6-linked) and insoluble (a-1,3-linked) glucans by glucosyltransferases (Gtfs) from the
GH70 hydrolase family. This class of enzymes utilizes dietary sucrose to produce various isomeric glucan
polymers through two important steps: (i) first is the sucrase (invertase) activity, where cleavage of sucrose
results in glucose and fructose; (ii) subsequently, the polymerization of glucose molecules forms extended a-
glucans. SM’s three different Gtfs, GtfB, GtfC, and GtfD, have been biologically well characterized, and their
synthesis of glucans is crucial for biofilm formation, bacterial colonization, and virulence. However, despite more
than 30 years of research and numerous studies, there remains a fundamental knowledge gap on their enzymatic
mechanism; specifically, how do they produce the soluble and insoluble glucans via distinct functional domains?
 The goal of this application is to determine the specific molecular mechanism(s) that drive SM’s Gtfs to produce
various glucans, particularly how they synthesize soluble and insoluble glucans. Our structural studies show that
the sucrase activity pocket is very tight and cannot accommodate an a-retaining double displacement reaction
like the GH13 enzymes. Therefore, polymerization must take place at another distinct site in the nearby vicinity.
We hypothesize that ‘The GH70 glucosyltransferases of SM adopt a novel enzymatic mechanism to produce the
soluble a-1,6-linked and insoluble a-1,3-linked glucans.’ We will address our hypothesis through three specific
aims (SAs) by (a) determining the structures of Glucosyltransferases (GtfB & GtfD) of SM (SA1), (b) elucidating
the catalytic mechanism of SM’s glucosyltransferases (SA2), and (c) characterizing the role of (i) the sucrase
site, (ii) the polymerization site, (iii) the glucan binding domains and (iv) their inhibitors on biofilms, colonization,
and virulence potential through in vitro and in vivo models of dental caries (SA3).
 The results from this study will (1) determine the novel structures adopted by these Gtf enzymes, (2) assign
specific roles to domains/regions, (3) identify key residues involved in the dual-step enzymatic action, (4) specify
how each GtfB and GtfD polymerize glucans, (5) reveal the importance of the sucrase site, the polymerization
site, and the glucan binding domains on disease outcomes, and (6) develop inhibitors that selectively target each
Gtf’s enzymatic activity. These investigations would provide a mechanistic foundation for the 800+ GH70
hydrolases, as multiple biotechnology interests exist to engineer these glucansucrases to dispense varied sizes
of dextran for chromatography, food preservation, and pharmaceuticals. The long-term objective of this study is
to explore innovative strategies for specifically addressing the cariogenic dysbiosis mediated by SM’s Gtfs."

 Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are a class of proteins that do not have a fixed three-dimensional
structure. IDPs can be fully unstructured, or contain modular regions of folded structure and unstructure, known
as intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). IDPs/IDRs are dynamic; fluctuating through diverse conformational
ensembles that allow them to play widespread roles in biological functions, both during normal and pathological
conditions. IDPs/IDRs play a pivotal role in a multitude of cellular processes including, but not limited to,
proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis. Here, I will focus on Abl kinase Interactor 1 (ABI1), a
modular scaffolding protein, whose biophysical investigation had remain elusive for decades.
 ABI1 is a multi-isoform and modular adaptor and scaffolding protein that plays a critical role in the
organization of the cytoskeleton via downstream coordination of actin cytoskeletal reorganization with growth
and proliferation signals as member of the WAVE complex. ABI1 also controls the progression of prostate tumors
and acts as a prostate tumor suppressor wherein loss of ABI1 contributes to tumor metastasis. It is now known
that ABI1 also functions in the nucleus, binding to DNA and nuclear hormone receptors (NHRs) like the androgen
receptor (AR). My overall goal is to investigate the molecular basis of ABI1’s nuclear functions. In Aim 1,
I will elucidate the mechanism of interaction between ABI1 and AR. Through biophysical methods, I will study
the interaction of full-length ABI1 and full-length AR. Through truncation analysis, I will also determine the
contribution of the folded domain(s) and IDR(s) from each protein towards binding and LLPS. In Aim 2, I will
determine how ABI1 binds DNA and I will determine how ABI’s interactions with AR reciprocally affects each
protein DNA binding properties. In this proposal, I will use an array of highly sensitive complementary biophysical
techniques to determine the DNA binding properties of ABI1 in the presence and absence of full-length and
various constructs of apo AR and AR bound to DNA. Due to their difficulty in expression and purification, there
is little in vitro data on the biophysical and structural mechanisms underlying the interaction between ABI1 and
AR.
 The results obtained will elucidate how the DNA-ABI1-AR axis regulates transcription, and will set the
stage for developing novel inhibitors for prostate cancer. Without this knowledge, our understanding of ABI1’s
functions in regulating AR in normal and prostate cancer will remain limited. This work will have a positive impact
by providing a model for determining the mechanism of the interactions of ABI1 and other nuclear hormone
receptors, such as the estrogen receptor, a major driver of breast cancer."

Substance use disorder (SUD) presents a pressing global health issue with devastating consequences, including
physical and mental health risks, as well as substantial economic burdens. Despite extensive research efforts,
the lack of efficient therapies underscores the critical need for a more comprehensive system-level
understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving addiction. SUD is a complex trait influenced by genotypes,
cellular environments, and drug exposure. However, existing studies often focus on only one or two of these
factors, leading to a limited understanding of the full picture.
We propose to leverage GRNs as an integrative framework that bridges genotypes, cellular environments, and
drug exposure, enabling a more holistic and system-level comprehension of addiction mechanisms. The
objective of this research project is to develop cutting-edge statistical methods and bioinformatics tools that will
enable a systems-level analysis of SUD. By integrating diverse data types, such as genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) and single-cell multiome data from both Drosophila and human brain samples of addicted
individuals and controls, we aim to identify crucial genotype-affected addiction-causing cells (“affected cells”),
driver regulators, and gene regulatory networks (GRNs) associated with SUD.
Aim 1 of the research will focus on developing a novel method to identify ""affected cells"" that serve as a link
between genotypes and SUD. Leveraging data from GWAS, we will compare the expression of SUD-associated
genes in addicted individuals and controls, allowing us to pinpoint cellular populations affected by addiction-
related genetic variations. This integrative approach will shed light on the cellular mechanisms that contribute to
addiction susceptibility. In Aim 2, we will advance state-of-the-art methods to elucidate the causal reasons behind
differentially expressed genes observed in addicted individuals compared to controls. By investigating the role
of driver regulators responsible for addiction, we will identify key GRNs governing addictive behaviors. This
integrated analysis will provide a comprehensive view of the regulatory landscape underlying SUD.
The outcomes of this project are poised to advance understanding of addiction mechanism significantly.
Successful implementation will result in the development of broadly applicable novel methodologies, offering a
new perspective on understanding complex traits, including SUD, from a systems biology viewpoint. Specifically,
we aim to unravel how driver regulators respond to substances and influence genes and chromatin through
GRNs, gradually leading to addiction. This enhanced system-level understanding of addiction biology will have
far-reaching implications, paving the way for the development of new therapeutics aimed at modulating or
reversing the transcriptional or regulatory actions contributing to SUD."

Earlier detection and treatment of human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell
carcinomas (HNSCC) has the greatest potential to improve overall survival rates, which have remained stagnant
at around 50% for several decades. Patients with HPV-negative HNSCC often have a clinical history of oral
epithelial dysplasia (OED), but it remains unclear which lesions will progress to cancer. Through comprehensive
sequencing of these tumors, it is known that a common (about 20%) genetic alteration event is the amplification
at locus 3q26.3, which harbors oncogene SOX2 (SRY-box transcription factor 2). Previous research revealed
that SOX2 inhibits a critical immune sensing pathway by degrading stimulator of interferon genes (STING)
protein in HNSCC cancer cells. The activation of the STING pathway is essential for establishing a spontaneous
anti-tumor immune response, as it promotes the presentation of tumor antigens on the surface of myeloid cells,
leading to the activation of cancer-killing T cells. It remains unclear how STING signaling in tumor-resident
immune cells may be impacted during SOX2-driven malignant transformation. To investigate this, we have
developed a preclinical mouse model to study the transition from OED to HNSCC. Upon high-dimensional
analysis of the immune landscape, we find a unique myeloid cell phenotype that suppresses anti-tumor immune
response. This study will utilize a multipronged approach to investigate the mechanism by which myeloid cells
in SOX2-positive lesions develop terminal suppressive phenotypes. We will test pharmacological and genetic
strategies to intercept the evolution of these pro-tumoral myeloid cells. Ultimately, this project will provide a high-
resolution atlas of functionally distinct myeloid cell subsets in precancerous lesions and identify key interception
points for therapeutic intervention."
10906077,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ1) is one of the sites most often affected by osteoarthritis, leading to a
condition called hallux rigidus (HR). This is very common, estimated to affect 25% of the adult population and
increasing in prevalence with age. The number of patients seen by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) for
HR has more than doubled over the last decade. In contrast to degenerative osteoarthritis at the hip and knee,
which is commonly treated with joint replacement arthroplasties, the most common surgical treatment for severe
HR is arthrodesis, which eliminates joint function. This approach does not allow modification of footwear,
interferes with some activities (e.g., yoga, Pilates) and may lead to secondary complications such as
metatarsalgia and mobility restrictions. To date, various designs for MTPJ1 arthroplasties have been proposed,
but none have been particularly successful, with high failure rates due to loosening and regular reports of
migration of the implant. This may be in part because of the relatively small amount of cortical bone in the
metatarsal head and proximal phalanx regions, making it difficult to achieve adequate fixation of the prosthetic
components. Development of new implants aimed at addressing these problems has been limited by the
sparseness of the literature regarding the mechanical environment of the MTPJ1. Similarly, there is very little
detailed information on the typical 3D movement of the MTPJ1 required during activities of daily living. Our recent
work has established the groundwork for a computational-based modeling workflow that is intended to optimize
the design of a novel MTPJ1 implant, and we have had some initial success in generating new, evidence-based
implant concepts. In this project, we intend to advance this work, increasing our ability to further MTPJ1 implant
technology through computational and robotic gait simulation-based testing. This will ultimately lead to improved
patient outcomes. We intend to achieve these aims by: 1) characterizing pathological and healthy MTPJ1
function during different activities of daily living; 2) using a robotic gait simulator to measure the effectiveness of
existing and novel MTPJ1 implants at restoring joint function; and 3) further refining our musculoskeletal and
finite element models of MTPJ1 to improve their accuracy and provide further validation of their ability to generate
useful results. We believe this work has the potential to reinvigorate the study of MTPJ1 arthroplasty, which at
present is primarily driven by ideas and not data. The knowledge disseminated from this research will allow
surgeons and patients to make better decisions regarding surgical treatments for HR. Specifically, these data
will help better understand the disease process of HR and lead to more physiologic MTPJ1 replacements, that
will ultimately result in an improvement in mobility and quality of life for Americans with HR. Upon completion,
our group will have obtained the expertise to undertake a large clinical trial investigating surgical treatment of
HR with the goals of developing a more rigorous classification of HR, and better insight into the various causes
of MTPJ1 pain (e.g., dorsal first metatarsal osteophytes or MTPJ1 cartilage damage or sesamoid arthropathy)."
10906193,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Tissues in a developing (or regenerating) appendage must correctly interpret their location in biological space,
and use this positional information to inform size, pattern and shape during outgrowth. Relative changes in how
cells interpret their positions during development can lead to debilitating changes in appendage phenotype,
including limb malformations. Further, the ability to regenerate requires that tissues remember or reinterpret
positional identity, then re-deploy this information to guide regrowth. Nonetheless, despite incredible relevance
to both basic biology and biomedicine, it remains poorly understood how spatial context regulates the local
morphogenetic processes which sculpt the pattern and shape of growing organs. Understanding the nature of
positional identity in vertebrate appendages can further efforts to prevent, diagnose and treat congenital limb
disorders, and will be necessary for development of advanced regenerative therapies.
Zebraﬁsh ﬁns are a powerful system for studying mechanisms of growth and regeneration, and the caudal (tail)
ﬁn possesses an elegant, simple-yet-informative structure. After amputation or removal of any portion of the
organ, ﬁns regenerate rapidly to reproduce the original size, patterning and shape. Long- and short-ﬁnned mu-
tants have served as crucial tools in decades of important progress towards the mechanisms regulating rela-
tive ﬁn size. Fin length phenotypes preserve the proportional patterning and overall shape of the ﬁn structure—
length is the only aspect of morphology that is altered. Indeed, before now, there have not been experimental
models to disrupt ﬁn ray patterning or the forked shape of the ﬁn, and this lack of experimental tools means
that essentially nothing is known about how pattern and shape are established or remembered.
In this proposal, researchers introduce novel phenotypes in which patterning and shape are decoupled from
size in the ﬁn; these tools will be used to identify pathways and cellular processes underlying positional identity
and the morphogenesis of form. The team will initially focus on mechanisms of skeletal patterning along the
proximo-distal axis of ﬁn rays, using the discovery that thyroid hormone regulates relative ray polarity. The re-
searchers next ask how identity is imprinted across the medio-lateral axis. The team has developed a system
in which the adult ﬁn never develops a central cleft, and grows into a triangular rather than a forked shape.
This phenotype will be used to test a model in which larval Shh expression regulates relative morphogenetic
behaviors across the ﬁn fold to pre-pattern the eventual forked shape of the organ. Researchers will explicitly
identify the cell states that constitute modules of positional identity regulating size, patterning and shape—the
three essential characteristics of overall ﬁn morphology. In all, the proposed research will open fresh horizons
for the broader ﬁeld, leveraging new paradigms by which different aspects of positional identity can inform
morphogenesis. These advances are expected to contribute foundational knowledge relevant in developing
clinical interventions for congenital disorders, and critical in laying the groundwork for regenerative medicine."
10906371,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bacteria use a diverse set of gene regulatory mechanisms to successfully adapt to ever-changing environments.
While some regulatory pathways for gene expression such as activation or repression by transcription factors,
and transcription/translation attenuation systems are well-characterized text-book examples, others are just
coming into prominence. My research program is focused on understanding two distinct bacterial gene regulatory
mechanisms: (i) small protein regulators, less than 50 amino acids long, and (ii) epitranscriptomic proteins that
link RNA modifications and translation to metabolism and stress response. Small proteins are directly encoded
by short open reading frames, which were missed in initial genome annotations due to the preset size cut-offs
for gene size. This group of proteins are increasingly shown to play significant roles in fundamental cellular
processes such as cell division, growth and development, modulation of transport and signaling. Despite the
advances in small protein discovery, there has been little progress in functional characterization of these new-
found proteins. To tackle the major challenge in this emerging field, Theme 1 will focus on the identification and
functional characterization of small proteins involved in bacterial stress responses. We will: (i) modify and
develop ribosome-profiling methods – Ribo-RET and Ribo-RET-PUR – to measure translation rates and identify
condition-specific small proteins, (ii) develop an in vivo site-specific photo-cross-linking and a proteomics-based
approach – SPICE-MS (Small Protein Interactions via Crosslinked Ensemble Mass Spectrometry) – tailored to
capture small protein targets. Based on my previous experience with elucidating the interactions between a small
protein MgrB and its target PhoQ sensor kinase, we will systematically characterize the functions of small
proteins and their associated targets identified here using genetic and biochemical tools. Functional and
mechanistic analyses of these small proteins will be useful in designing novel antibiotics and therapeutics. In
addition, the methods developed here will be broadly applicable to small proteins from other prokaryotes as well
as eukaryotes. In theme 2, we will focus on studying epitranscriptomic enzymes and their regulatory roles.
Specifically, we will investigate role of QueE – an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of a ubiquitous RNA
modification called queuosine – in bacterial cell division during antimicrobial peptide stress. RNA modifications
and the related machinery are modulated in response to different cellular stressors, and little is known about how
this regulation affects cell physiology. We will investigate the mechanisms by which regulation of this tRNA
modification enzyme, QueE affects cell division, translation and metabolism during antimicrobial peptide stress
response in E. coli. Together, our work will advance the fields of small protein biology and epitranscriptomics by
(a) identifying and characterizing small proteins involved in stress responses, and (b) depicting how
epitranscriptomic enzymes act as nodes connecting translation to cellular metabolism and physiology,
respectively."

Over the past 5 years, Cornell’s Roybal Center–The Translational Research Institute on Pain in Later Life
(TRIPLL) has developed innovative approaches and an effective infrastructure for the translation of behavioral
and social science research to improve the health and well-being of older adults. A major strength of TRIPLL is
its demonstrated ability to link behavioral and social science research to real-world contexts. TRIPLL has
supported the development of behavioral intervention trials that leverage new technologies to bring about
adaptive behavior change in the context of pain, an issue characterized by the Institute of Medicine as a
critically important and under-addressed public health problem. In this renewal application, we propose to build
on our accomplishments to date by measurably expanding the infrastructure of the Center to augment the
development of scalable behavioral interventions for pain mitigation. We will maintain program elements that
have helped TRIPLL achieve success (e.g., frequent oversight of supported projects) and add new elements
(e.g., an Industry Advisory Board to promote collaborations with industry partners and advise on
commercializing Center products) to attain additional successes. We will also build on our capacity to test
potent and scalable behavioral interventions for pain, targeting specific Mechanisms of Behavior Change
(MoBC), and help to advance interventions along the NIH Stage Model continuum with particular emphasis on
later stages. We will focus on extending this research to underrepresented populations. This emphasis is
justified because of established disparities in pain and pain treatment in underrepresented groups of older
adults. The expanded multidisciplinary collaboration among prominent research centers in Ithaca and New
York City (NYC), including New York City-based Weill Cornell and Cornell Tech, constitutes a major strength of
this renewal application. TRIPLL’s overarching goal is to foster a culture of innovation and achievement that
generates new knowledge in behavioral intervention development and effectively moves projects along the NIH
Stage Model continuum. We will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Maintain a responsive leadership and
administrative infrastructure to support intervention development for later-life pain across the NIH Stage Model,
2) Support and monitor innovative clinical trials that are anchored in the Mechanisms of Behavior Change
MoBC and strive to ensure applicability in demographically diverse, underrepresented groups; and finally 3)
Leverage the intellectual, fiscal, and other resources of the academic and industry collaborators in this
application and foster new collaborations with other NIA-funded Centers to achieve synergistic results that
would not be attainable by any one institution. The proposed structure of the Center, its clinical trial
development program, the support from multiple advisory committees, and the extensive array of resources will
help TRIPLL measurably advance the science of behavioral intervention development to address a significant
public-health problem: later-life pain."

Cornell’s Roybal Center–The Translational Research Institute on Pain in Later Life (TRIPLL) has developed
innovative approaches and an effective infrastructure for the translation of behavioral and social science
research to improve the health and well-being of older adults. TRIPLL maximizes the joint resources for aging-
related research at Cornell University, uniting social and behavioral scientists and experts in translational
research at Cornell’s Ithaca campus with researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine and Cornell Tech in NYC.
TRIPLL’s Administrative Core (AC) will build on the structure we successfully implemented over the past five
years to include working actively to foster multidisciplinary collaborations across NIH-funded Centers and
engage and supporting researchers across different career stages and along the NIH Stage Model continuum.
The AC’s flexible organization will allow TRIPLL to identify, respond to, and take advantage of new trends and
developments in the field, such as advances in research design (e.g., adaptive clinical trials), as well as
implementation and evaluation science methodologies. The AC will build on NIA’s investment over the past 5
years by expanding support to develop scalable behavioral interventions that target older adults with a focus
on under-represented populations adversely affected by pain. Given the continued high prevalence and burden
of pain in older people, and the movement away from primary reliance on surgical and pharmacological
interventions to treat pain, it is crucially important to develop, test, and disseminate treatment alternatives.
The AC will provide the overall strategic vision for the Center, conduct national competitions to identify
innovative clinical trials to support, foster an environment that promotes opportunities for external
collaborations with respect to behavioral intervention development activities, conduct evaluations of Center-
related activities, and serve as a national resource for the behavioral and social intervention research
community. TRIPLL AC aims are to: 1) Conduct the management tasks of the Center; 2) Launch national
competitions to fund clinical trials in Years 2-5; 3) Convene advisory committees, including an external
advisory committee, internal advisory committee and industry advisory board to help to shape the projects
TRIPLL supports and help to identify sources of project co-funding; 4) Expand TRIPLL’s reach by
strengthening existing and establishing new strategic collaborations; 5) Conduct formal evaluations of Center-
related activities; and finally 6) Oversee all dissemination activities. The AC will devote resources to maintain a
vigorous, comprehensive program of dissemination of new research findings and targeted outreach to
constituencies and consumers who would benefit from TRIPLL-developed programs. Accomplishment of these
aims will help us to maintain/expand a vibrant Center, composed of investigators skilled in conducting
translational research and one that generates principle-driven behavioral interventions designed to mitigate
pain and enhance quality of life for large numbers of older adults adversely affected by pain."

Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) developed and successfully implemented the ‘Building
Capacity for Implementation Science in Non-communicable Diseases (BImS-NCDs)’ (D43TW011964; Contact
MPI: Obua) to build capacity for junior faculty in non-communicable diseases (NCDs) with focus on Neurological
disorders (epilepsy and dementia), mental disorders, alcohol abuse disorders and implementation science. We
now propose to expand on the BImS-NCDs investment by pilot testing an implementation strategy for suicide
prevention with support from National Institutes of Health and IC partners such as the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH) which supports research that transforms the understanding and treatment of mental illnesses.
The research team will utilize these supports to leverage the existing district health system structure (District
Health Management team (DHMT) and engage a multi sector group (proposed champions, implementers and
beneficiaries) to co-design a contextually tailored strategy to promote implementation of evidence-based
practices in the WHO LIVE LIFE guide for suicide prevention. Suicide is one of the leading causes of death
worldwide with far-reaching impact on families, friends and communities. We propose to pilot an evaluate the
feasibility of a contextually tailored strategy consisting of the WHO LIVE LIFE guide with DHMT as Champions
for Suicide Prevention (WLLDC-SP) across the lifespan in rural Uganda. We will draw on existing research
team comprising of psychiatrists and mental health practitioners, health systems and implementation sciences
experts to develop a manual to implement the pilot. This will be achieved through three specific aims: 1) Co-
design an implementation strategy manual for the WHO LIVE LIFE guide with the District Health Management
Team (DHMT) Champions for suicide prevention in rural Uganda.; 2) Evaluate the feasibility of an
implementation strategy consisting of WHO LIVE LIFE guide with DHMT as Champions for Suicide Prevention
(WLLDC-SP)across the lifespan in rural Uganda; 3) Create a community of practice and build research capacity
among multi-sectoral and stakeholder collaborators for suicide prevention in rural Uganda.. During the 3-years,
we will train community stakeholders using the DHMT champions on evidence-based interventions for suicide
prevention derived from the WHO LIVE LIFE guide. The aims will be supported by expertise from the University
of Virginia and from Mbarara University of Science and Technology. By the end of the 3 Years funding, this grant
will have provided awareness on suicide prevention measures and practice change among stakeholders to
reduce cases of suicide in rural Uganda potentially providing capacity for research on suicide across the globe."

The falling costs of DNA sequencing has resulted in a proliferation of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
seeking to identify causal variants associated with disease and other important phenotypes. However, a striking
93% of phenotype-associated variants fall within non-coding regions, often several hundreds of kilobases away
from the nearest gene. Recent studies have demonstrated that such variants are enriched within cis-regulatory
elements (CREs) and can affect transcriptional outcomes. CREs are composed of clusters of 4-30 bp DNA motifs
recognized by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) that cooperatively establish patterns of transcription
in a development and cell type-specific manner. However, it remains unclear how genetic variants within CREs
mechanistically perturb patterns of transcription and contribute towards phenotypic diversity at the scale of
individual cells, tissues and whole organisms. The aim of this proposal is to determine the molecular relationships
among genetic variants, CREs, and gene transcription across diverse cell types and genetic backgrounds, and
their concerted effects on cellular and organismal phenotypes.
 Zea mays (maize) is characterized by extensive intraspecies phenotypic and genetic variation comparable
to the levels observed among primates. The genetic framework of this proposal, the 282 maize diversity panel,
was specifically constructed from geographically dispersed individuals to represent the full spectrum of extant
variation within the species. The rate of linkage-disequilibrium decay in the 282 maize diversity panel is 10-40X
that of human and mouse genomes, affording significantly smaller population sizes with equivalent resolution.
The rationale for this study is that the abundance of genetic variation, genomic resources, reduced population
size requirements and recent expansion of reference-quality genomes (~35) present an ideal model to
investigate the mechanistic basis of phenotypic diversity stemming from regulatory variation. The proposed
research is innovative in that cutting edge genomic approaches, including scATAC-seq and snRNA-seq, will be
utilized in parallel with microscopy-based imaging across 200 maize genotypes to test the central hypothesis
that CRE variation underlies distinct spatiotemporal patterns of gene transcription that collectively manifest in
phenotypic diversity at cellular and organismal levels. Realization of the proposed aims will usher a new
understanding of the determinants of cell type-specificity and the phenotypic consequences of evolving gene
regulatory landscapes. Successful completion the proposed work will lay the foundation for future interrogation
of the mechanistic role of genetic variants towards human disease, relevant to the missions of the NIH.
 This application was specifically designed to enhance the applicants career development through associated
training activities in mentorship, grant writing, and scientific communication. Accomplishment of the career
training plan will facilitate the successful transition of the applicant from a post-doctoral position to a faculty
position at a research-intensive institution."

Parkinson's disease (PD) is the 2nd most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting over 1 million people in
the United States. PD causes difficulties with movements such as walking and speaking that occur because of
loss of the brain chemical dopamine. Current symptomatic PD treatments are based largely on dopamine
replacement therapies with L-DOPA; however, these treatments have many long-term side effects which led to
interest in non-dopaminergic therapies. The most severe side effect is the development of L-DODA-induced
dyskinesia (LID), involuntary movements that can be as or even more debilitating than the disease itself. Any
adjunct therapy extending the time frame where L-DOPA can be used without LID would be a major advance.
 Recent publications showed that low-dose ketamine infusion paradigms were safe and well tolerated in
clinical trials for pain states (including migraine headaches), treatment-resistant depression and posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). Low-dose ketamine has led to a long-term reduction of pain states, treatment-resistant
depression, it also reduced PTSD symptom severity and comorbid depression. One commonality between
migraine headaches, depression, PTSD, PD and LID is that electric activity in the brain is overly synchronized
and maladaptive plastic changes occur in the brain, including in an area that is of interest in PD and LID called
the basal ganglia (BG). Therefore, we investigated the use of low-dose sub-anesthetic ketamine in the treatment
of PD and LID. We have evidence of a therapeutic effect of low-dose ketamine infusion from preclinical data in
a rat model of LID (dose-dependent reduction of abnormal involuntary movements; long-term effects after a
single ‘infusion-treatment’) and from 5 PD patient case studies (reduced dyskinesia and reduced depression).
In the rat LID model this effect was only seen when low-dose ketamine was given for 10 hours and not with just
a single acute low-dose ketamine injection. The premise of the proposed studies to define mechanisms of the
novel use of low-dose ketamine is ‘true bench to bedside’ science, will provide the foundation for controlled
clinical trials of low-dose ketamine treatment for LID, and could identify new more specific therapeutic drug
targets to treat LID and depression, two critical problems for many PD patients. Our main hypothesis is that a
low-dose sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion desynchronizes overly synchronous oscillatory activity in nerve cells
involved in LID sufficiently to induce a lasting anti-dyskinetic effect, working as a “chemical deep brain stimulation
(DBS)”. We hypothesize that ketamine works on the molecular level via 2 types of receptor molecules in the BG
and cortex, NMDA receptors and opioid receptors, and that the long-term effect includes changes in nerve cell
connections called dendritic spines. A multidisciplinary team of researchers and a clinician with the necessary
expertise will fill a critical gap in knowledge by investigating the mechanisms of this long-term effect of low-dose
ketamine infusion on the molecular and cellular level. They will study effects on receptors and changes in spine
size and density (Aim 1), and on the systems level, investigate synchrony of oscillatory neural activity (Aim 2)."

Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is among the most common osteochondrodysplasias. It is genetically
heterogenous, resulting from mutations in 22 different genes. Regardless of the genotype, the disorder is
characterized by brittle bones with recurrent fractures due to impaired bone quantity and quality. OI is also
phenotypically heterogeneous with mild, moderate, severe, and perinatal lethal forms of disease. The
incidence is estimated at 1/20,000 births and around 20,000 to 50,000 Americans have OI.1,2 About 85% of
OI cases result from dominant mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 which encode the α1 and α2 chains of type
I collagen, the major protein in bone.3 Rare forms of OI are from mutations in other genes involved in type I
collagen synthesis, modification, trafficking, or osteoblast function.4
 In the United States, there are no therapeutic agents labeled for use in OI. OI is typically treated with
bisphosphonates and supplemented with calcium and vitamin D.3,5 Bisphosphonates are anti-resorptive
agents that induce osteoclast apoptosis and are indicated for use in osteoporosis and diseases with
pathologic bone resorption.6 While bisphosphonates have been effective in increasing bone mineral density
in OI, their effect on fracture risk is uncertain and may cause OI bone to become even more brittle.7 This
uncertainty, combined with our growing knowledge of OI pathophysiology, have driven the field to search
for alternative treatment strategies. Intermittent parathyroid hormone, anti-sclerostin therapy, and anti-TGFβ
therapy have all been clinically tested in patients with OI. In each study, only a subset of patients exhibited
a beneficial response. In OI, the mechanistic etiology of the variability in response to treatment is not
understood and significantly affects patient care. I hypothesize this response variability in OI results, in
part, from a genotype dependent accumulation of misfolded type I collagen.
 Type I collagen is co-translationally inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen as procollagen
alpha chains. There, they are post-translationally modified and fold before exiting the ER. In OI due to glycine
substitutions or splicing mutations, misfolded type I procollagen accumulates in the ER lumen of osteoblasts
producing ER stress. In addition to collagen, many other cellular products are processed through the ER
including transmembrane receptors, extracellular matrix components, and secreted ligands. Under ER
stress, the cell may not be able to synthesize and process normal levels of these cellular products . I will
test the hypothesis that ER stress in OI is genotype dependent and leads to dysregulated osteo-
progenitor/osteoblast signaling function due to receptor/ligand signaling cascades. This proposal will
establish that ER stress is more than a cellular response – it is clinically important and genotype dependent
in OI. It also provides preclinical data for a new treatment strategy for OI and adds to the growing view that
the OI phenotype is not simply due to a structurally defective extracellular matrix."

This grant seeks support for graduate student and early career faculty travel to attend the 11th World Congress
on Stuttering and Cluttering (formerly referred to as the “International Fluency Association Joint World
Congress”) to be held May 15-19, 2024 at the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at
Austin (Austin, Texas, United States).
The World Congresses have a long and distinguished history going back almost 30 years, and have long
attracted both senior and junior researchers and clinician attendance. It publishes proceedings, and many
Congress contributions have gone on to both publication and citation in other research publications. The 2024
World Congress has paired with other major organizations to broaden participation and impact. Although
financially enabled by commitments of the World Stuttering and Cluttering Organization (WSCO, formerly
referred to as the “International Fluency Association”) and the Arthur M. Blank Center for Stuttering Education
and Research, it will also engage with the International Cluttering Association and the International Stuttering
Association (representing consumers and families world-wide). This broad inclusion is meant to strengthen the
development of Whole-Person Care approaches that most closely meet the needs of people who stutter and/or
clutter and their families.
The need for junior researcher attendance at the World Congress is of significant importance given the declining
numbers of faculty researchers in communication sciences and disorders, in the United States and abroad, and
in fluency disorders specifically. Past meetings have greatly contributed to the development of early career
investigators who have gone on to achieve well in their research, publication, and funding careers. This meeting
will offer students and early career faculty two workshops designed to develop grantsmanship and publication
skills. It will also host a panel designed to mediate viewpoints of persons who stutter and/or clutter, researchers,
and clinicians on research needs in fluency disorders.
Taken together, this meeting of dedicated researchers, clinicians, and advocates should result in high quality
proceedings and peer-reviewed research publications. It should also facilitate long-term health impacts in
understanding and treating fluency disorders that will continue the positive contributions made by World
Congresses over the past three decades."

Altered mitochondria quality control in osteoblasts and osteoclasts has been implicated in the loss of bone mass
associated with aging and estrogen deficiency – the two most important causes of osteoporosis in humans,
however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Sirtuin-3 (Sirt3) is the primary mitochondrial protein
deacetylase and plays a critical role in mitochondrial quality control, including mitochondrial biogenesis,
mitochondrial dynamics, and mitophagy—all of which are affected in age-related metabolic diseases. Earlier
work aiming to elucidate the role of Sirt3 in bone has produced conflicting results with some studies suggesting
that Sirt3 is critical for skeletal homeostasis while others found no physiological role of Sirt3 in bone. We have
shown that deletion of Sirt3 or pharmacologic inhibition of Sirt3 in mice prevents the loss of bone mass caused
by aging and estrogen deficiency and this is associated with decreased bone resorption. Osteoclasts lacking
Sirt3 exhibit impaired mitophagy and increased acetylation of the mitophagy protein PTEN-induced kinase 1
(PINK1). Moreover, the mitophagy inhibitor mdivi-1 mimics the effects of Sirt3 deletion or Sirt3 inhibition on
osteoclast generation and bone resorption. We have also obtained proteomic evidence to suggest that the
protective effects of Sirt3 deletion on bone mass are mediated by its posttranslational regulation of ATPase
inhibitory factor 1 (ATPIF1), an essential protein for mitophagy. Notably, ATPIF1 silencing osteoclast progenitors
exhibit impaired polykaryon formation and resorptive activity as well as decreased mitophagy. We hypothesize
that Sirt3-mediated deacetylation of ATPIF1 promotes osteoclast function via PINK1-dependent or
independent mitophagy and that this process contributes to the excessive bone resorption that occurs
with aging and estrogen deficiency. In Aim 1 we will determine the contribution of Sirt3/PINK1-mediated
mitophagy to the development of osteoporosis in aged or ovariectomized mice with PINK1 loss-of-function. We
will also quantify mitophagy and mitochondrial architecture in vivo using a mitochondria reporter mouse. In Aim
2 we will determine the role of ATPIF1 in the actions of Sirt3 on osteoclast function. Successful completion of
this work should establish novel molecular and cellular mechanisms that contribute to osteoclast function and
osteoporosis. These studies also should elucidate a previously unappreciated deleterious role of Sirt3 in age-
related metabolic diseases."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common forms of dementia, affecting one in ten people over the
age of 65 and nearly half of people over the age of 85. AD is currently untreatable, posing a significant health
concern. Many attempted treatments for AD target amyloid-beta (Ab) plaques, but these treatments have all
failed in clinical trials1,2. Emerging evidence shows that tau pathology may play a causal role in the development
of AD. Inflammation prompted by microglia may precede the spread of pathogenic tau3-6, and most AD risk genes
are found in microglia, supporting a significant role for inflammation in disease7,8. Inflammation requires
metabolic reprogramming to provide the energy and substrates needed for activation9,10, and mitochondrial
dysfunction could contribute to aberrant inflammatory responses in AD11. The APOE4 risk allele along with the
R47H variant of the microglial Trem2 receptor both display large effect sizes in increasing AD risk. APOE4 is
found in approximately 20% of the population, whereas the R47H mutation is much rarer, representing less than
1% of the population12. The APOE3 allele is considered neutral to disease risk and is often used as a control
comparison in experiments. APOE is a known ligand of the Trem2 receptor, and Trem2 activation robustly
increases microglial APOE expression, as well as affecting cellular metabolism and inflammation. Activation of
the microglial Trem2-APOE pathway is associated with heightened inflammation13,14. However, the mechanistic
underpinnings of the pathway are not well understood, and there has been little research on the interactions
between risk variants R47H and APOE4. My preliminary data indicates that R47H/+ has a remarkable differential
effect on the APOE3 background compared to the APOE4 background, such that R47H with APOE3 (R47H-E3)
has heightened inflammation in response to tau and increased mitochondrial respiration, but R47H with APOE4
(R47H-E4) has low inflammatory response and decreased mitochondrial function. This differential response is
accompanied by enhanced AKT activation in R47H-E3 but reduced AKT activation in R47H-E4, suggesting
potential mechanistic involvement in these phenotypes. I hypothesize that alterations in AKT signaling drive the
differential effects of R47H on mitochondrial respiration and inflammation in the E3 vs. E4 background. In this
proposal, I aim to further elucidate the interactions of R47H with different APOE genotypes to affect microglial
metabolism and inflammation, both in vitro using a primary microglia model and in vivo using a tauopathy mouse
model. I will then explore the potential mechanistic involvement of AKT in this pathway using AKT inhibition.
These studies will provide a better understanding of the function and mechanisms of the disease-implicated
Trem2-APOE pathway in microglia, providing novel targets for the treatment of AD."
10906387,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT - Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is one of the most devastating
pediatric cancers. Numerous clinical trials in decades, involving different combinations of chemotherapeutic
agents and radiation, have been ineffective in treating DIPG. The identification of efficacious therapeutic targets
based on the molecular characteristic is of high importance for improving treatment outcomes for children with
DIPG. The discovery of oncogenic histone gene mutations in DIPG has dramatically improved our understanding
of disease pathogenesis, and stimulated the development of novel therapeutic approaches to target epigenetic
modifiers. We have recently shown that targeted bromo- and extra-terminal (BET) domain protein 4 (BRD4)
activity using JQ1 inhibitor results in a significant delay of tumor progression and prolonged survival of animals
bearing DIPG patient-derived xenograft (PDX). Because of their promising anti-tumor activity, BRD4 inhibitors
are being tested in a number of cancer patient clinical trials. However, tumors that initially respond to small
molecule inhibitor therapies, such as those targeting BRD4 activity, eventually become resistant to monotherapy
treatment, affirming the need for more effective therapeutic interventions. In order to identify new effective
therapeutic targets, and discover novel combinatorial approaches to prevent or delay acquired resistance to
monotherapy, we performed an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic screen of patient-derived
DIPG cells. We identified nine “network modules” that are significantly enriched in CRISPR targets. One of these
modules includes POLR2I, which encodes a subunit of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) that is involved in transcription
elongation. We subsequently observed that targeting POLR2I activity through short-hairpin RNA knockdown and
treatment of the small-molecule Pol II inhibitors block transcriptional elongation and inhibit the growth of DIPG
in vitro and in vivo. Here, we will test the hypothesis that inhibition of Pol II transcriptional elongation in
combination with BRD4 inhibition will further suppress gene transcription and will either delay or prevent DIPG
from acquiring resistance to monotherapy. This dual inhibition approach will interfere with gene transcription at
two levels: transcriptional initiation (BRD4) and elongation (Pol II). This project will also explore how these
targeted therapies interact with radiation in treating DIPG, which is important due to the use of radiation in treating
nearly all cases of DIPG in children. The successful completion of proposal study has significant impact on
clinical practice and accumulating data from this research could therefore lay the foundation for early clinical
trials of this approach, given the high unmet need and orphan disease status of DIPG."

In the first year after birth, human sensitivity develops markedly to the fundamental features on which all higher-
level vision depends: contrast, spatial scale, edge orientations, chromatic content. It is well known that this
development is highly dependent on visual experience because disruptions in experience have significant and,
in some cases, permanent consequences for vision from sensation to cognition. The field does not have,
however, an empirical characterization of the low-level feature statistics of typical infant visual experience. This
gap is critical because emerging studies of higher-level content indicate these statistical properties change with
development and are dependent on the infant’s own changing internal visual biases and behaviors (eye
movements, head movements, other body movements). These factors play a direct role in selecting and
organizing the spatial structure of images projected to the eye. This project will collect and analyze the first-
person visual experiences of 200 infants (50 each) at 2-3, 5-6, 8-9, and 11-12 months of age, plus a sample of
20 infants tested at all of those ages. The core hypothesis is that the statistics change systematically in a
developmentally consistent sequence in the everyday lives of infants. The experiences are collected by infant
head cameras worn for hours in the home and precision measures of eye and head movements in the laboratory.
Analyses will quantify the spatial organization of fundamental low-level features in the collected images as a
function of age, posture, activity, and specific contents. The project will also characterize the influence of
refractive error and front-end visual immaturities on the images. The research will determine how infants’
behaviors influence the spatial organization of visual features in the input by analyzing the motion patterns in the
at-home head-camera images and through direct measures of eye and head motion patterns in the laboratory.
The research will provide the first characterization of the natural visual statistics of infant experience in the first
year after birth and is expected to reveal specific developmental risk-points in those expected visual statistics."

The 2024 FASEB Conference on Trace Elements in Biology and Medicine will take place in Melbourne, Florida
from June 12 – 16, 2024. This conference, the 17th iteration of this biennial meeting since 1983, is designed to
bring together a diverse group of researchers to share and discuss the latest findings in trace element research.
Trace elements such as iron, copper, zinc, manganese, and selenium play critical roles in biology, nutrition, and
health as illustrated by the wide range of disorders and diseases associated with imbalances in these essential
micronutrients. A notable strength of this conference series has been its ability to unite basic scientists focused
on the structural and molecular details of trace element homeostasis in diverse model systems with clinical
scientists/physicians studying the direct impact of trace elements on human health, nutrition, and disease, thus
bridging the gap between basic and applied science. By integrating molecular and biomedical research, this
conference has been highly successful in fostering fruitful collaborations across disciplines and in identifying
novel systems and approaches to solve problems related to micronutrients and health. The program will span a
range of scientific interests ranging from cellular and systemic trace element transport and homeostasis, trace
elements and disease, metal signaling, and nutritional aspects of trace elements. The meeting also includes a
careers workshop, a “meet the experts” event, two flash talk sessions, and informal group activities, which
provide opportunities for trainees and early career investigators to gain additional knowledge and cultivate
professional skills. The ultimate goal of this conference series is to provide a forum for education, collaboration,
and inclusiveness in order to foster further scientific advancements in the role of trace elements in biology, health,
and disease."

P. aeruginosa is a leading cause of blinding eye disease. Contributing to disease pathogenesis is invasion of
corneal epithelial cells, as we have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report that P. aeruginosa can
establish multiple niches inside corneal epithelial cells, some colonizing the cytoplasm and other vacuoles – often
in the same cell. Reporter expression results show different phenotypic states in these alternate locations, the
pattern suggesting “acute” infection mode for cytoplasmic bacteria and “chronic” (biofilm forming) mode for
those in vacuoles. While genetic regulation of the switch between these two states has been extensively studied
in vitro, how this might work inside a cell is unknown. Our published and preliminary data show that “acute”
and “chronic” modes cooperate to determine corneal epithelial cell responses, to allow P. aeruginosa to penetrate
the multilayered corneal epithelium, to colonize the cornea, and to cause pathology. Here, we will test the
hypothesis that their unique intracellular niches contribute to their cooperative efforts during corneal infection.
The three aims will explore significance of intracellular diversification to the bacteria, to the host corneal
epithelial cell, and to disease pathogenesis. Approaches will utilize multiple novel tools developed using funding
from this grant, including bacterial constructs, imaging technologies, and infection models. The two consultants
are leading experts in bacterial gene regulation, respectively covering both phenotypes. Importantly, our data
suggest that vacuolar P. aeruginosa transition into biofilms, which can be difficult to kill or even to culture. A
vacuole would enclose a biofilm inside two host membranes - vacuolar and plasma. This intracellular phenotype
alone could explain why P. aeruginosa infections are notoriously difficult to manage and why disease can
continue despite apparent sterilization of the ulcer."

 Tissues are sculpted into 3D shapes through coordinated force generation during embryogenesis.
Force generation is mediated by the cytoskeletal protein, F-actin, and the motor protein, myosin, which can be
coupled across cells through adherens junctions to form supracellular actomyosin networks. A range of tissues
use supracellular actomyosin networks to facilitate a diversity of folding events, adjusting the network
composition and structure satisfy the mechanical needs of the tissue. The modularity of actomyosin networks
is evident in vertebrate neural tube closure (NTC). All vertebrates undergo NTC in an actomyosin-dependent
manner, but the mechanism of closure varies substantially across organisms. Additionally, failures in NTC lead
to congenital malformation in humans. However, it remains to be determined if there are generalizable
mechanisms of actomyosin-mediated tissue folding or what mechanisms fail and prevent NTC. The
mechanisms of mouse NTC are unclear, due to the large tissue size and prolonged folding time. Using a
computational workflow that we developed to create two-dimensional shell projections from curved three-
dimensional samples, we reconstructed the apical actomyosin network of the entire mouse neural tube (NT) at
subcellular resolution. Using preliminary analysis of these reconstructions, we propose a lateral tension model
for cranial mouse NTC, where enrichment of actomyosin and apical constriction introduces apical tension in
the lateral neural folds. Combined with concurrent tissue thickening, the neural folds stiffen and efficiently
elevate when pushed by adjacent tissues, promoting NTC. To test this model, we will: 1) Quantify key features
of the actomyosin networks of wild-type mouse NTs which inform on the mechanical tissue properties,
including protein levels, actomyosin cable orientation, and cellular morphologies. A comparative analysis with
mutant mice whose networks are perturbed will allow us to identify features of the actomyosin network and
regions of the NT critical to NTC. 2) Experimentally determine the presence differential tissue tension. We will
perform laser ablation in live mouse embryos to demonstrate the presence and directionality of tension
throughout the mouse NT. We will also use this live-imaging platform to quantify the dynamic changes in the
actomyosin networks throughout NTC. This work will be primarily conducted in the lab of Prof. Adam C. Martin
at the MIT Department of Biology with laser-ablation training and experiments occurring in the lab of Prof.
Gabriel Galea at the University College London, UK. The proposed work will illuminate paradigms in
actomyosin-mediated tissue folding during development and build an intellectual foundation from which to
understand congenital malformations, ultimately leading the design of preventative therapies and treatments.
The applicant will also receive advanced training that will support their pursuit of an academic career."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent psychiatric disorder that has a complex multifactorial
etiology, with stress vulnerability emerging as a critical risk factor. MDD disproportionately affects women, with
female prevalence almost double that of men, but the biological basis of this sex difference is not understood.
Additionally, roughly half of MDD patients do not respond to existing treatments, and therefore there is an urgent
need to understand MDD’s biological etiology and the molecular mechanisms underlying sex differences to
develop new therapeutic strategies. MDD is associated with abnormalities of the brain’s reward circuitry, and
studies have implicated the ventral hippocampal (vHPC) projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc; vHPC-
NAc) in stress-induced susceptibility to anhedonia, the reduced motivation from pleasurable stimuli, in male mice.
However, despite the higher prevalence rates of MDD in females, studies that include both male and female
subjects are lacking. Our lab used subchronic variable stress (SCVS), which shows an anhedonia phenotype in
female mice but not males, to investigate the sex differences in stress-induced anhedonia. We found that female
mice are susceptible to SCVS-induced anhedonia and have increased basal vHPC-NAc circuit excitability
compared to males. Moreover, vHPC-NAc circuit excitability is reduced by adult testosterone, and I now show
that AR on vHPC-NAc neurons are necessary for testosterone-mediated reduction in circuit excitability, but the
mechanisms by which androgen receptors (AR) regulate this excitability remain unknown. Here, I will test the
hypothesis that ARs reduce excitability of vHPC-NAc neurons by directly changing gene expression in the
nucleus. In Aim 1, I will use novel mouse lines to conditionally knockout cytosolic or nuclear AR signaling in male
and female mice to determine effects on vHPC-NAc excitability using whole-cell slice electrophysiology. This
experiment will reveal the signaling mechanisms by which ARs reduce vHPC-NAc excitability in both sexes and
pave the way for investigation of downstream gene targets or signaling mechanisms that could represent novel
targets for therapeutic MDD strategies. In Aim 2, I will identify the ion channels mediating the basal sex difference
of vHPC-NAc circuit excitability by using pharmacology to selectively isolate channels while using whole-cell
slice electrophysiology on male and female control mice. These experiments will elucidate the underpinning of
sex differences in this circuit and may lead to specific pharmacological targets that could be used to treat females
for MDD. Overall, this research plan will determine the AR signaling pathways involved and the molecular
mechanisms underlying vHPC-NAc circuit excitability in both sexes. The knowledge gained from these studies
will elucidate how adult testosterone regulates vHPC-NAc circuit function to drive sex-specific behaviors and
vulnerability to stress. Critically, this project will also provide me with world-class training in electrophysiology,
neuropharmacology, and circuit manipulations in mouse models, propelling my independent career."
10902586,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Human health is inextricably linked to our ability to rapidly develop novel medicines and agrochemicals to
address global needs. However, the development of such bioactive compounds requires extensive synthesis
campaigns to access late-stage analogs of lead molecules for fine-tuning of bioactivity. The scope of accessible
analogs is limited by current methods for late-stage diversification, which mostly change the periphery of
molecules. The development of single-atom skeletal editing methods, particularly for saturated heterocycles
ubiquitous in bioactive compounds, would expedite this process by enabling facile, precise changes to molecular
cores, circumventing lengthy de novo synthesis and expanding accessible chemical space.
The photomediated ring contraction of saturated heterocycles has been reported as a novel skeletal editing
method that accomplishes an endo-to-exocyclic migration of a heteroatom in a ring upon blue LED irradiation.
However, limitations in scope and unpredictable variance in enantioselectivity preclude the successful application
of this reaction to diverse bioactive compounds of interest. Moreover, rational optimization of this ring contraction
is challenging due to a lack of mechanistic and photophysical understanding. This proposal will accomplish: 1)
expansion of the ring contraction scope to include unfunctionalized, electron-rich, and drug-like azacycles, 2)
investigation of mechanism and wavelength-dependence of rate and quantum yield, and 3) parametrization of
non-covalent interactions between substrates and chiral catalysts to optimize enantioselectivity.
Expansion of the method will be pursued through execution of various synthetic strategies to install the requisite
photoreactive handle onto N–Ar azacycles, and the yields and diastereoselectivities of the resulting substrates
will be quantified. In addition to demonstrating the ring contraction on novel, larger rings, heterocyclic cores, and
drug fragments, strategies to remove the photoreactive handle will be explored for enhanced synthetic utility.
Wavelength-dependent reactivity will be investigated by quantifying rates and quantum yields with a range of
different wavelengths, while kinetic experiments in combination with quantum yield determination will elucidate
mechanistic details. Finally, an enantioselective data set will be generated and analyzed through data science
driven computational approaches to rationalize and optimize enantioselectivity. Ultimately, this research will not
only improve fundamental understanding of photochemical reactions, but also generalize the application of this
skeletal edit to late-stage derivatization in an asymmetric fashion."

Infection of gut epithelia by attenuated rotavirus (RV) vaccines serves to protect millions of lives annually. It is
increasingly appreciated that gut microbiota, which shape the milieu in which rotaviruses encounter the
epithelium is a pivotal determinant of rotavirus vaccine efficacy. Indeed, RV vaccines have proven to be much
less effective in developing countries which are known to have stark differences in gut microbiota composition.
Our published work demonstrates that microbiota can both directly impact RV and, moreover, impact gut
epithelia to prevent against its entry and replication. Furthermore, our unpublished work compellingly argues for
a central role for gut microbiota composition in RV vaccine inefficacy. Specifically, we find that transplant of
microbiota from non-RV vaccine responding children confers a microbiota-dependent non-responder phenotype.
In addition, culturing infant fecal samples in bioreactor continuous culture systems yields supernatants that
differentially inhibit RV vaccine replication in vitro. Hence, the central goals of this proposal are to identify and
isolate microbiota constituents that drive RV vaccine inefficacy in humans and determine mechanisms by which
they act. Findings from this work will advance our fundamental knowledge on bacterial-viral interactions in the
gut, mechanistically enlighten how microbiota can impact replication and response to live, attenuated oral
vaccines and potentially aid in the development of novel strategies to reduce the burden of enteric viral infections."

the scope and expedite progress for each of the YCC research programs. As Associate Director
of Bioinformatics at the Yale Center for Genome Analysis (YCGA), one of the YCC Shared
Resources, I established the bioinformatics analysis services for the YCC with the goal of bringing
bioinformatics and NGS expertise closer to the cancer investigators. My bioinformatics work with
them for the last 9 years has focused on three areas: 1) providing full “design-to-publication”
bioinformatics support; 2) facilitating access to new genomic technologies and develop/build new
analytical pipelines to enable cutting edge genomics; and 3) providing training and education in
cancer bioinformatics through mentoring, seminars, and workshops. I have brought such
expertise to over 300 projects for 78 laboratories, have developed new data analysis pipelines
and enabled new NGS applications, and have trained many students and researchers to become
proficient in their own bioinformatics analyses. During my work for the YCC, I have co-authored
over 28 publications in leading scientific journals with YCC investigators, involving a diverse set
of analysis for different techniques, cancer types, and organisms. The support of the R50 award
will allow me to continue to develop and use bioinformatics tools to increase the progress and
scope of cancer research and provide broader access and training to YCC researchers."

Ovulation is essential for human fertility. During ovulation, a fluid filled antral cavity that forms late in
folliculogenesis expands and, in coordination with thinning of a distinct region of the follicle wall, leads to rupture
and release of the cumulus oocyte complex. Impaired ovulation resulting from endocrinopathies, ovarian
pathologies, idiopathic anovulation, or ovarian aging are associated with decreased fertility. Improving our
understanding of ovulation biology will contribute to the development of novel treatment strategies for infertility,
as well as development of new non-hormonal contraceptives that block follicle rupture during ovulation. Although
previous research has elucidated many of the molecular mechanisms that underlie ovulation, less attention has
been paid to the role of biomechanical forces within the ovarian follicle in driving follicle rupture. Prior research
has characterized an increase in pressure in the region of the ovulatory follicle within the ovary; however, this
work was unable to distinguish the role of follicle-intrinsic forces from the external forces from the surrounding
ovarian microenvironment. Our lab and others have demonstrated formation of the antrum in an ex vivo model
of folliculogenesis and ovulation, suggesting that follicle-intrinsic forces drive fluid flow and cavity expansion in
the ovulatory follicle. Therefore, we will apply our ex vivo model of ovulation to study the follicle-intrinsic
biomechanical forces that drive ovulation, a promising strategy to integrate new technologies into the study of
ovulation and address unanswered questions about the role that pressure, wall tension, and fluid accumulation
plays in ovulation. Our overarching hypothesis is that increased intrafollicular pressure exerts
disproportionate wall tension on the rupturing side of the follicle due to localized wall thinning and that
the intrafollicular pressure increase is driven in part by downregulation of TRPV4 leading to reduced
calcium efflux and increased fluid influx into the antrum. We will quantify intrafollicular pressure and regional
wall tension within ovulatory follicles to determine if excess wall tension in one region of the follicle is predictive
of the site of rupture. We will also examine the role of TRPV4 as a novel regulator of antral cavity expansion and
subsequent ovulation efficacy. The long-term goal of the proposed work is to elucidate fundamental aspects of
ovulation biology and to pioneer the use of novel technologies that can quantify biomechanical parameters of
follicle rupture to study conditions of anovulatory infertility and to develop novel non-hormonal contraceptive
agents, all of which align directly with my own long-term career goals. Ultimately, the translational nature of this
project, the rich intellectual infrastructure of the Northwestern Center for Reproductive Science, and my
interdisciplinary mentoring team spanning disciplines of biomechanics, mathematics, bioinformatics, and
reproductive science and medicine will provide me with support and unprecedented skill sets to develop into an
independent clinician-scientist."

Peripheral nerve injuries are common and debilitating conditions affecting more than one hundred thousand
people annually in the United States. Prognosis for recovery of severe nerve injuries is poor, as high-grade
axonotmetic and neurotmetic injuries usually do not spontaneously recover. These injuries require surgical
intervention and if the nerve injury is located far from the target muscles, nerve repairs fail to provide useful
function in half of patients- leading to permanent physical disabilities and enormous emotional stress. To improve
clinical outcomes, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in nerve injury is critical. The
traditional view that Wallerian degeneration (WD) is inevitable after nerve injury has recently been challenged
with the discovery of the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) in supporting maintenance of viable
axons. SARM1 with its NADase enzymatic activity, has been identified as a key gatekeeper of WD. After a severe
nerve injury, SARM1 rapidly degrades NAD resulting in catastrophic structural changes to the distal axon.
Blockade of this phenomenon, combined with the promise of fusogens can provide a potential mechanism for
transected nerves to rapidly recover after injury. Optical imaging with its high spatial and temporal resolution is
highly promising to visualize the entire process in the nerve tissue, however high scattering from the skin and
other adjacent organs limit the application to only in vitro or ex vivo studies. To address these limiting issues, we
developed a minimally invasive in vivo model that enables continuous imaging of a peripheral nerve injury with
a high, single axon resolution. Our approach uses a flexible skin-embedded transparent optical window with the
nerve surgically repositioned above the muscle layer. This modality allows daily or even hourly, longitudinal
imaging of the nerve with virtually any optical reporter that can be used in living animals. When combined with
fluorescent reporters and a high-resolution imaging system (i.e., two-photon imaging), this method generates a
3D view of the nerve with unprecedented resolution. In Aim 1 we will develop a double transgenic mouse reporter
model (THY-1/CFP and S100/GFP) expressing different levels of SARM1 (SARM1-/-, SARM1-/+, SARM1+/+). We
will then monitor differences in the degree and timing of axonal degeneration after a unilateral sciatic nerve injury,
using our optical window. In Aim 2, we will synthesize a library of small activatable fluorogenic probes that mimic
NAD+ to directly measure the activity of SARM1 in the distal stump. Overall, this imaging approach will provide
direct visualization of the morphologic and metabolic characteristics of the distal stump degeneration in live
animals. It will also establish a conceptual framework for future investigation of the fundamental processes
during nerve regeneration. This approach will lead to new discoveries in the biology of these processes and spur
new approaches toward developing novel therapeutics for nerve injury."

The goal of this project is to use engineered extracellular matrix environments leveraging structural and me-
chanical control over the extracellular matrix to examine the mechanisms by which cells respond to multiple
directional migration cues. Cell migration plays an important role in many physiological and pathological pro-
cesses such as wound healing, development and cancer invasion. Frequently migration is not simply random,
but directed towards targets through recognition of aligned extracellular matrix fibers or gradients in stiffness,
generating contact guidance and durotaxis, respectively. In many biological contexts these cues are presented
simultaneously, forcing cells to integrate this information. For instance, gradients of stiffness and aligned colla-
gen are generated within the wound bed to direct dermal fibroblast migration. Similar fiber structures and gra-
dients stimulate cancer cell migration out of the tumor microenvironment and normal cells including stromal
and immune cells towards the tumor microenvironment. While there is a firm understanding of how cells re-
spond to individual directional cues, virtually nothing is known about how cells integrate multiple cues and
make migrational decisions based on that integration. Furthermore, there is a hypothesis that contact guidance
and durotaxis are overlapping directional cell migration mechanisms, but this has not been rigorously tested.
Mechanistic understanding of multi-cue directional migration will require a refined understanding of how the F-
actin and microtubule networks operates. Indeed, some evidence suggests that contact guidance and durotax-
is may use slightly different F-actin network structures, since contact guidance is thought to be governed by F-
actin fiber structures, but durotaxis is not. Engineering approaches will be taken to design in vitro environments
that allow for independent tuning of contact guidance and durotaxis in both 2D and 3D environments. Further-
more, the effect of F-actin branching, bundling and contraction in allowing cells to prefer aligned fibers of colla-
gen or gradients of stiffness will be tested. This will uncover shared or competing molecular pathways involved
when these two directional migration cues are present in isolation and together. Understanding how cells mi-
grate in response to multiple cues has broad impact on several biomedical fields including tissue engineering
and disease therapeutics. Determining how cells respond to multiple cues in vitro will allow us to predict cell
responses in wound healing, development, cancer invasion and immune response leading to drug candidates
as in cancer or strategies to enhance wound healing and immune response."

Pathological Basis of Gastroparesis Study (PBG) conducted by Drs. Grover and Farrugia at the Mayo Clinic to
continue their identification of the molecular factors involved in pathogenesis of gastroparesis. Our aims for the
continuation are: 1) To complete the adult trial of Buspirone for Early Satiety and Symptoms of Gastroparesis,
the Pyloric Sphincter Abnormalities (PSAGS) study, and adult and pediatric gastroparesis registries initiated
during the previous funding cycle; 2) To develop and conduct a new adult or pediatric treatment trial; and 3) To
coordinate and implement use of a single IRB (sIRB) to oversee all ongoing and future GpCRC studies.
 The SDRC will provide leadership, expertise in biostatistical analysis, study design, data management,
multicenter coordination, quality assurance, and will be responsible for supporting all current and future

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by extracellular β-amyloid (Aβ),
microtubule-associated protein tau intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), cellular loss, and cognitive decline.
NFTs correlate significantly to the onset of clinical symptoms, yet current disease-modifying therapies do not
target tau aggregation mechanisms. Pathogenic misfolded tau propagates across neuronal cells in AD and
causes a ‘gain-of-function’ misfolding of normal tau proteins in a templated manner. Evidence from our group
and others has identified specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that co-aggregate with pathological tau in AD
brains. A majority of these RBPs are insoluble, mislocalized to the cytoplasm, and display loss of splicing function
in AD. Importantly, a specific class of RBPs that correlate with increased AD pathology and cognitive decline in
AD contain disordered low complexity (LC) structural domains that are rich with serine and arginine residues
(SR-rich). It is currently unknown if SR-rich RBPs alter tau aggregation in disease. I propose that this class of
RBPs has distinct interactions with tau in AD through their SR-rich LC domains. My central hypothesis is that
RBPs co-aggregating with tau in AD will seed and enhance tau aggregation via the SR-rich LC domain. I will use
a combination of biochemical, cellular, and in vitro assays to examine how SR-rich LC domains alter tau
aggregation. The long-term goal of this project is to identify points of therapeutic intervention by modulating tau
aggregation in AD and enhancing our mechanistic understanding of the aggregation process. Aim 1 will
determine if RBPs mediate tau aggregation via SR-rich LC domains through co-localization with tau fluorescent
reporter cells and thioflavin-T fibrillization experiments. In Aim 2, I will identify co-aggregating RBPs through a
novel tau proximity labeling system in mammalian cells. This proteomic screen provides the ability to resolve
additional co-aggregating RBPs through mass spectrometry techniques and subsequent bioinformatic analyses.
These two parallel aims will allow me to determine mechanisms that underlie tau seeding and aggregation in
disease. By understanding how the SR-rich LC domain of RBPs implicated in AD promote tau aggregation, I will
contribute to the understanding of AD pathological proteins and provide impactful insight toward therapeutic
targets to reduce tau burden. The training provided through successful completion of the proposal aims will
significantly prepare me for a career as an independent researcher in neurodegeneration."

Abstract
Animal survival is dependent on locomotion to successfully find shelter, locate a mate, capture prey, and avoid
predators. Although it is well established that spinal locomotor circuits in vertebrates are activated by
glutamatergic-mediated excitation, our understanding of glutamatergic signaling is incomplete. This is
important to understand since glutamatergic excitation contributes to the generation of rhythmic activity and the
amplitude of motor output. Dissecting the precise role that subtypes of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate
receptors play in spinal locomotor circuit function will provide mechanistic data critical for understanding
locomotor circuit function. We will address this gap in knowledge by determining the roles of glutamate
receptor subtypes in the larval zebrafish spinal locomotor network using a well-validated complement of tools
that span from molecular to behavioral levels, including optogenetic activation of spinal locomotor networks,
pharmacology, electrophysiology, high-speed videography, and calcium imaging. The goal of this proposal is to
advance our mechanistic understanding of glutamatergic signaling responsible for regulating the properties of
vertebrate spinal locomotor output and spinal motor neuron recruitment. The results of these experiments will
set a foundation for investigations into the specific neuronal targets of glutamatergic actions, revealed here, in
a future R01 proposal. Since many principles of CPG function are conserved across vertebrates, we expect
these findings to translate to other animals, including humans."
10904226,"The Medical Image Perception Society (MIPS) was founded as a non-profit organization in 1997 after a series
of meetings (Far West Image Perception Conference) that started in 1983 to understand the perceptual factors
that underlie the construction and interpretation of medical images for the purposes of improving diagnostic
accuracy, reducing missed detections, and identifying the causes of reader error. MIPS XX will bring together
an international community of experts including radiologists, pathologists, other image-based clinicians,
psychologists, statisticians, physicists, engineers, and computer scientists who all seek to investigate the
extraction of diagnostic information from medical images. This highly interdisciplinary meeting attracts
attendees from all research career stages and offers unique research and learning opportunities for new
trainees and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. MIPS XX is being
organized by the Medical Image Perception Society (a US-based society; Elizabeth Krupinski, PhD President)
in conjunction with local host Frank Tong, PhD, and will take place August 6-9, 2024 at Vanderbilt University.
Nine topic areas have been selected for MIPS XX, reflecting important dimensions of medical image
interpretation. This year’s special focus themes reflect current trends in medical imaging 1) Improving
Diagnostic & Screening Performance (or outcomes) in Medical Imaging Using Human & Machine Expertise
(e.g., AI, deep learning) and 2) Technological & Human Interventions for Enhancing Medical Image Perception.
Studying how clinicians extract diagnostic information from images identifies the causes of missed diagnoses
and ways to eliminate these errors. Careful design and evaluation of imaging systems are critical in view of
their enormous costs. With the current emphasis in the practice of medicine on developing computer-based
tools (e.g., AI, deep learning) to improve detection and diagnosis, the role of the clinician as both end-user and
ultimate decision-maker cannot be ignored. Medical image perception research develops and applies modern
methods of vision science, cognitive science, image analysis, and advanced statistical and computational
modeling to the evaluation of observer performance in diagnostic imaging tasks. Understanding fundamental
aspects of the perception of medical images can reduce diagnostic error and improve medical decision-making
quality. This R13 grant will support 10 graduate, undergraduate or post-doctoral trainees to attend and present
their research at MIPS XX. To date, 128 (~40% women & ~40% underrepresented minorities) students have
been awarded scholarships to attend past MIPS meetings and the majority have gone on to pursue future
studies and careers in academia and industry. The primary goal in supporting these students is to create
opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee’s career to enhance their
research potential and likelihood of success as independent basic science and clinician-scientist researchers."

 Non-specific disruption of neuronal cell membrane induced by amyloidogenic aggregation of b-amyloid
(Ab) peptides is considered a viable mechanism in the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Understanding
the structural basis of key molecular interactions that are responsible for the membrane disruption remains
challenging, mainly due to the heterogeneity nature of Ab-membrane systems and the low abundance of key
intermediate states. High-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy provides the
most powerful method for studying the membrane-disruptive Ab aggregation in its native-state-mimicking
environments, i.e., in model liposomes and/or in the presence of neuronal cells.
 Our long-term goal is to understand the structural basis of key Ab-membrane interactions that are
responsible for the non-specific membrane disruption in neurons. During the last funding period, my group has
demonstrated the generality of two distinct membrane-disruptive processes in model liposomes: local membrane
leaking induced by on-fibrillation-pathway Ab intermediates and membrane fragmentation induced by off-
fibrillation-pathway large Ab oligomers. We have also established ssNMR approaches to investigate the
structural features and molecular interactions at the intermediate states of individual processes. These ssNMR
measurements allow systematic studies of time-dependent structural changes of Ab aggregates and key Ab-lipid
interactions in the time frame of membrane disruption process, as well as the modulations of lipid dynamics due
to the Ab amyloidosis. In addition, we are exploring the feasibility for extending the studies from membrane-
mimicking liposomes to neuronal cells, by using a multipronged strategy combining in-cell ssNMR spectroscopy
with cellular imaging/viability assays/quantitative analysis.
 The current renewal proposal contains three aims. Aim 1 and 2 seek for finalizing the mechanistic studies
of membrane-disruptive Ab interactions in liposomes. Specific mechanistic models are proposed and will be
demonstrated using extensive ssNMR experiments, including advanced sensitive-enhancing dynamic nuclear
polarization (DNP) ssNMR techniques. Key membrane-interruptive intermediate states (including Ab structural
features, lipid dynamics and Ab-lipid interactions) will be elucidated. In Aim 3, we strive to developing in-cell
ssNMR approaches and quantitative cellular assays/analysis for probing the molecular basis of Ab-induced
cellular membrane disruption. This involves identification of Ab-induced membrane-disruptive intermediate
states with neuronal cell lines and establishment of in-cell 31P and DNP-assisted ssNMR spectroscopy, including
the optimization of sample conditions and spectroscopic methods. Outcomes from the current period, including
both the understanding the membrane disruptive effects and the development of ssNMR-based methods, will
pave the way for future studies in primary neurons."

Antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threats to today’s public health. Mechanisms underlying antibiotic
resistance are extremely complex and have both genetic and non-genetic components. For instance, transient
tolerance of antibiotics by transcriptional reprogramming (non-genetic) in subpopulations of bacteria could aid
in the ultimate rise of mutations (genetic) conferring resistance, leading to recurrent treatment failure and the
emergence of multidrug resistance in the clinic. This has been seen in cases of adaptive resistance and
bacterial persistence. A systems-level survey of genetic and transcriptional determinants influencing antibiotic
sensitivity will generate a strong foundation for developing novel antimicrobial strategies. In particular,
identification of factors that sensitize bacteria to specific antibiotics (drug potentiation) is a viable strategy to
confront resistance. Using transposon mutagenesis, previous studies have unbiasedly assessed the
contribution of every non-essential gene to antibiotic sensitivity in many bacterial species. However, due to its
irreversible perturbation and inability to target essential genes, transposon mutagenesis is not ideal for
studying phenotypes that have a transient, non-genetic component such as persistence. In order to address
this challenge, I propose to develop a systematic framework using a novel genome-wide CRISPR-interference
(CRISPRi) screening technology to interrogate the genetic and transcriptional determinants of antibiotic
sensitivity. Compared to conventional design-based, low-diversity guide-RNA (gRNA) libraries generated using
array-based oligonucleotide synthesis, the proposed technology harnesses the natural capacity of the CRISPR
adaptation machinery to convert genomic DNA into comprehensive genome-wide crRNA (analogous to gRNA)
libraries. My preliminary results show that this approach can greatly reduce the expense, labor and time
required for the generation of CRISPR libraries, while substantially increasing their diversity and sensitivity,
thereby revealing novel genetic loci not previously implicated in antibiotic sensitivity. Moreover, compared to
the strong loss-of-function perturbation caused by transposon mutagenesis, the diverse crRNA members of the
library are expected to create a wide range of transcriptional repression. This will allow us to survey a much
broader fitness landscape, crucially including the mild suppression of essential genes. Using this proposed
genome-wide CRISPRi library and an inducible version of it, along with other techniques including ORF
overexpression libraries, bacterial genetics, computational analysis and animal models, I will carry out a
systems-level investigation of the genetic and transcriptional determinants underlying antibiotic sensitivity, and
the under-studied gene-level collateral sensitivity in two evolutionary distinct bacteria of basic and clinical
importance: Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. I expect results from these proposed experiments to
substantially expand our knowledge on the diverse genetic and non-genetic mechanisms of antibiotic
resistance and yield novel targets for drug development."

The global spread of antibiotic resistance is producing a human health crisis. The objective of this application
is to investigate a novel combination therapy, by using antimicrobial blue light (aBL) with antibiotics, for
synergistic antimicrobial activity and/or for the preservation/potentiation of the potency of conventional
antibiotics. Our central hypothesis is that aBL+antibiotics will provide a broader action spectrum and
improved antimicrobial activity through a multifunctional mode of action with both synergistic and adjuvant
capabilities. To address this hypothesis, we have formulated three Specific Aims.
In Aim 1, we will first investigate the potential for aBL to synergize with antibiotics against bacteria in vitro. We
will next examine whether aBL can mitigate or reverse bacterial β-lactam resistance, repurpose glycopeptide
and penicillin antibiotics for application against Gram (-) bacteria, and mitigate or reverse bacterial efflux-
mediated resistance. For the safety study, we will evaluate the effects of aBL+antibiotics on human cell viability,
inflammatory response, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and functions of human cells. Additionally, we will
determine whether bacteria can develop resistance to aBL+antibiotics.
In Aim 2, we will elucidate the mechanism of action of aBL+antibiotics. To this end, we will first analyze the
individual contributions of different reactive oxygen species (ROS) to the overall ROS upregulation induced by
aBL+antibiotics in bacteria. We will next assess the effects of aBL on bacterial β-lactamase activity and
expression, the outer membrane permeability of Gram (-) bacteria, and bacterial efflux activity and expression.
Finally, we will examine potential changes to bacterial transcriptome following aBL+antibiotics.
In Aim 3, we will determine the efficacy of aBL+antibiotics in vivo for treating cutaneous abscesses in mice
infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and tympanostomy tube otorrhea (TTO) in chinchillas
infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To treat cutaneous abscesses, we will utilize a novel dual-functional
microneedle array to deliver aBL and levofloxacin simultaneously and interstitially to the infection sites. To treat
TTO, we will use our newly invented optical tympanostomy tube (Optical-TT), which emits aBL uniformly from
its entire tube surface, in conjunction with sulfamethoxazole ear drops, to eradicate biofilms on the tube
surface. Additionally, for the safety study, we will first determine the viability loss of the host cells in animals
following aBL+antibiotic treatment. We will also evaluate the effects of aBL+antibiotics on wound healing and
inflammatory response in animals. Finally, we will determine whether there is a long-term carcinogenic effect
associated with aBL+antibiotics.
If the strategy of aBL+antibiotic combinations can be shown to be both effective and safe, it may provide an
innovative broad-spectrum regimen to combat antibiotic resistance. This is particularly important in the
situation that no new antibiotics are expected to become available in the foreseeable future."

 Tumor immunotherapies represent the most exciting advance for cancer patients in recent decades. However,
only a minor proportion of treated patients experience long-lasting benefits from current tumor immunotherapies.
A subset of tumor-specific T lymphocytes carrying features of memory or progenitor T cells has been named
“stem-like” T cells. These stem-like T cells are essential to sustain anti-tumor T cell immunity and are the major
responder to several current tumor immunotherapies. Thus, a better understanding of these stem-like T cells will
greatly facilitate the improvement of current therapies or the development of future tumor immunotherapies.
 Tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM) are a subset of non-circulating memory T cells initially discovered after
acute infections. Recently, we have discovered that stem-like T cells differentiate into tissue-resident T cells
inside tumor-draining lymph nodes, which is negatively associated with the response to tumor vaccine. In other
words, a large number of stem-like T cells lose migratory capacity and are trapped inside tumor-draining lymph
nodes.
 However, several open questions remain to be addressed regarding this newly discovered feature of stem-
like T cells. For example, what is the lineage relationship between this TRM-stem T cell subsets and other T cells
inside tumor-draining lymph nodes? Is there a connection between TRM-stem in TDLN and stem-like T cells inside
the tumor microenvironment? Whether can we manipulate TRM program of stem-like T cells to boost tumor
vaccine? In this application, we will use multiple well-established tumor models to track tumor-specific CD8+ T
cell response in the presence and absence of tumor vaccination. We will answer this series of questions focusing
on this unique T cell subset, i.e., TRM-stem. Further, our proposal will primarily focus on tumor-draining lymph
nodes, which serve as a reservoir for tumor-specific stem-like T cells. Our proposed studies will greatly advance
our understanding of stem-like T-cell biology. Importantly, we will establish a new targeting organ (tumor-draining
lymph nodes) and a novel target (the lymphoid residency program of stem-like T cells) to boost the efficacy of
tumor vaccine."
10879565,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) designated Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter
baumannii (CRAb) an “urgent threat pathogen” for which novel therapies are desperately needed. The current
COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the emergence of CRAb in medical intensive care units and hospitals,
creating a parallel health care crisis in the US. The combination of β-lactamase production and cell penetration
challenge every drug class used to treat CRAb. By applying novel chemistry to design more potent “cross-class”
boronic acid transition state inhibitors (BATSIs) that are effective β-lactamase inactivators, and developing a
deeper understanding of the genetic diversity of β-lactamases present in CRAb, we propose to extend our efforts
to also target class B metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs; specifically IMP-1, -14, and NDM-1, as they are the most
prevalent MBLs in Ab), and develop drugs that penetrate Ab more readily. We will build upon the efficacy of two
potent BATSIs (MB076 and CR167 that were iteratively designed in our current funding cycle) to also interact
with Zn2+ ions in the active site of MBLs, as well as penetrate CRAb more effectively. Concurrently, we discovered
that OXA β-lactamase overexpression in Ab drives significant collateral changes in bacteria consistent with
increased amidase activity. As a result, peptidoglycan integrity is impacted, and new cellular vulnerabilities were
revealed. Further studies have also shown that at least five genes become conditionally essential in OXA
expressing Ab. As a result, we propose a multidisciplinary approach to overcome CRAb using the following
strategies. Firstly, we propose that structural and mechanistic similarities in class B, C, and D β-lactamases can
be exploited to permit the design of “cross-class” inhibitors by the addition of novel functional groups (e.g., Zinc
Binding groups, ZBGs). In addition, we will design novel cyclic boronates that demonstrate interactions in the
active site that inhibit MBLs as well as serine β-lactamases. Secondly, we hypothesize that the penetration of
BATSIs into Ab can be improved and overcome by modifications of the R1/R2 side chains to enhance steric and
electronic interactions that facilitate passage through porins, specifically CarO. In addition, we will synthesize
novel BATSIs that use Fe3+ mediated transport that penetrate CRAb readily and resist efflux. We will perform
molecular modeling and structural analyses of CarO to give us insight on how to overcome this major porin
conferring imipenem resistance. Studying the mechanistic/structural features inherent to CarO and the imipenem
scaffold will facilitate our first two goals. Thirdly, we discovered that OXA β-lactamase expression in CRAb
creates new cellular vulnerabilities and that certain gene products become essential for viability, but only in OXA-
overexpressing isolates. We propose that these gene products represent novel bacterial targets that can be
inhibited by small molecules to selectively kill OXA expressing bacteria. We will use high-throughput screening
to identify compounds that selectively kill OXA expressing Ab and identify the cellular target of these inhibitors."

unmet medical need. In some cancer types, microscopic metastases may have already occurred at the time of
diagnosis. Because an established tumor microenvironment mediates therapeutic resistance through a variety
of mechanisms, cancer cells are likely most vulnerable during their time in the bloodstream and early in the
development of micrometastasis. Thus, effectively targeting those cells requires constant surveillance in order
to “catch” them either in the circulation or in their early metastatic niche, before they have re-established a
protective microenvironment. Currently FDA-approved systemic therapies for solid tumors are unable to
adequate do so as they are intermittent; chemotherapy is given in cycles to allow recovery from toxicity to bone
marrow and other organs, and even long-half-life antibodies result in peaks and troughs. Collectively, our
available therapies likely fail to provide systemic tumor control of metastases in part because intermittent
exposure not only kills only a percentage of cells during each treatment cycle, enabling surviving cells to develop
cell-intrinsic drug resistance, but also due to the drug-free windows that enable cancer cells to spread. Our
overarching hypothesis is that we can prevent and treat micrometastasis by leveraging gene therapy to provide
constant, long-term, systemic immunologic pressure on cancer cells. We will test our hypothesis in models of
neuroblastoma, the most common solid tumor in children outside of the brain, and Her2+ breast cancer, both of
which have a poor prognosis when metastatic. We have developed an off-the-shelf strategy utilizing a single
intravenous dose of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to instruct normal cells to secrete bispecific T
cell engagers into the bloodstream for long periods of time (rAAVrh74-aGD2-aCD3 and rAAVrh74-aHer2-
aCD3), a platform we term “TransJoin.” Our specific aims are to: (1) Test the anti-metastasis efficacy of GD2
and Her2 TransJoins in preclinical models, (2) Test the safety of GD2 and Her2 TransJoins in preclinical models,
and (3) Develop controllable expression of GD2 and Her2 and a kill switch. If successful, our data will support
clinical translation of rAAVrh74-aGD2-aCD3 for neuroblastoma and rAAVrh74-aHer2-aCD3 for Her2+ breast
cancer. Following a human phase I safety study, we envision clinical trials during post-induction therapy in the
setting of minimal residual disease, to either prevent and/or treat micrometastases and improve long-term patient
survival."

The NORC Enrichment Program (NEP) has been an essential component of the Colorado NORC since it
was first established. The overall mission of the NEP is to spawn interdisciplinary team science and
translational outreach programs related to nutrition and obesity. As the NORC research base has grown
and integrated with other programs on campus, NEP has adapted to meet the unique needs of its researchers,
trainees, and educators. The educational activities supported by the NEP in the past have been very
successful in fostering the development of the next generation of scientists, recruiting new scientists to pursue
research questions that are aligned with the NORC's objectives, and promoting research in obesity and
nutrition on campus. In the next cycle of the award, the NEP will capitalize on this success by developing and
promoting educational and training opportunities related to the sciences of nutrition and obesity with the
ultimate goals of fostering team-oriented research proposals and disseminating evidence-based information to
the lay public.
To accomplish these goals, the enrichment program has the following specific objectives:
Aim 1. Partnering and Integrating with existing institutional programs
Aim 2. Expanding our impact in the Rocky Mountain region
Aim 3. Expanding the impact of the broader NORC Program
Aim 4. Translating discovery with community outreach"

The Administrative Core (Core A) is an essential core that will organize, coordinate, and oversee, and support
the three Projects, and the other two Cores of this PPG. The Core is co-led by George F. Murphy, MD, and
Markus H. Frank, MD, whose collaborative history, complementary expertise, and delegation of Core A
responsibilities are in keeping with the multi-PI infrastructure of this PPG. In addition to the institutional resources
and administrative support structures available to Drs. Murphy and Frank through BWH and BCH, respectively.
The overarching goals of the Core are summarized in the categories of i) communication and data sharing; ii)
oversight and guidance; and iii) administrative support, and may be briefly described as follows:
1) Implement and oversee a web-based mechanism for data sharing. This relates to the establishment and
maintenance of a web-based, secure site for data sharing consisting of three complementary layers of DropBox,
Harvard Dataverse and Basecamp, that permit secure access from any location or device with internet
capabilities. In addition, it recognizes the ongoing responsibility of Core A CL’s to regularly monitor data accrual
and overall PPG progress in a manner that data is rapidly and efficiently shared with the scientific community
through web-based technology and an ongoing commitment to publish appropriate findings in open-access
journals, or by utilizing public relations resources at the participating institutions for data sharing with the lay
public.
2) Monitor and maximize Project progress, inter-Project/Core synergies, and Core utilization. This includes the
creation of mutually-agreed upon milestones to be achieved among Projects and Cores, their centralized
monitoring, and maintenance of a continuous feedback loop involving Projects/Cores and Core A to maximize
project momentum, intercept and address any problems that may inhibit or delay progress, monitor aspects
related to reproducibility, and insure that appropriate deliverables are attained in a focused manner that insures
translational relevance and eventual clinical application. This aim is structured on regular (monthly) scheduled
interactions involving all Project and Core leads during which progress may be assessed and maximized.
3) Provide general administrative support for the PPG. This includes a) the scheduling of monthly meetings; b)
establishment and orchestration of periodic meetings with an External Advisory Board (EAB) to review progress
and assist in planning; c) conflict mediation and resolution; d) preparation of non-competitive renewal
applications and progress reports; e) budgetary management; f) coordination and facilitation of institutional
approvals; g) manuscript submission to PubMed Central; and management of new intellectual property created
from the grant, including preparation and filing of new invention disclosures to OTD)."

This Cell and Tissue Imaging and Analysis Core seeks provides a centralized and integrated resource for in situ
proteomic analysis and imaging of the cellular and antigenic bioarchitecture of skin stem cells as a function of
chronologic age and in the context of age-related deficiency in wound healing. It also provides translational
validation through comparative examination of experimental murine and human skin selected as matched pairs
by expert dermatopathologists to ensure cross-relevance. The Core thus combines highly skilled professional
dermatopathology analysis and cutting-edge multiplex imaging technologies that permit sequential assessment
of how cells and molecules behave in healing wounds, and how this behavior is compromised in the setting of
age-related skin stem cell depletion/dysfunction. Specific Aim 1 provides PPG investigators with conventional
histology of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biospecimens, multiplex labeling for 3-4 epitopes, image
quantification, and a variety of optional specialized technologies on an as-needed basis. This aim is essential to
assess the cellular constituents and efficiency of wound healing responses in the context of various experimental
models proposed in Projects 1-3 and in a manner that permits comparisons across projects. It also provides key
data that will interface with the Bioinformatics Core (Core B), and assists in developing strategies to enhance
wound healing through understanding potential utility of targeted therapeutic approaches directed at defective
stem cell-driven repair pathways. Importantly, it offers standardized and uniform expertise and experience not
available through simultaneous use of multiple institutional pathology resources. Specific Aim 2 takes multiplex
labeling to the level of high-resolution, highly-plexed imaging, whereby cellular and proteomic intricacies can for
the first time be visually unraveled at the level of 20 or more simultaneously identifiable antibody probes. This
approach leverages in-house technology involving NanoZoomer scanning technology and QuPath data analysis
in order to provide state-of-the art quantitative and spatial analysis of multiple epitopes expressed in situ by cells
and their microenvironments relevant to skin aging and stem cell involvement in the wound healing process. It
is fortified by collaborative interactions with Dr. Peter Sorger and application of related CyCIF labeling
technology, as well as the availability of GeoMx technology for digital spatial proteomic and genomic profiling.
Aim 3 provides an extensive human skin biobank whereby data generated by Core analyses of murine models
may be readily compared and contrasted with relevant age-matched and co-morbidity-controlled wound healing
responses in the human integument, as well as accessing and prospectively accumulating a wealth of relevant
biospecimens for PPG analyses. Core C thus provides an essential, centralized, and highly integrated analytical
component to the PPG, offering insight into actual cellular and molecular events that occur in situ in skin where
potentially critical microenvironmental relationships remain intact, thus representing a key feedback loop in
assessing experimental results, clinical relevance, and therapeutic efficacy."
10884374,"SUMMARY
Human skin is the largest and one of the most complex organs in the human body. It performs diverse functions,
ranging from protection, sensation, heat regulation, absorption of gases, excretion of sweat, and water
resistance. Skin structure and functions gradually deteriorate with age. While there is a substantial effort towards
understanding cellular mechanisms that cause cellular aging and influence the lifespan of model organisms, the
molecular mechanisms of age-related alterations in human skin in vivo are barely explored. The limited number
of studies on this subject conducted by bulk sequencing or metabolomics analyses of whole tissue lysates failed
to provide evidence on robust transcriptional, epigenetic or metabolic alterations that drive skin aging or generate
any reliable theory on the molecular determinates of these processes. We hypothesize that aging in the human
epidermis affects only the discrete populations of cells with stem and progenitor features and results in the
deterioration of their ability to drive self-renewal. Our preliminary data show that cycling stem cells maintain
epidermal homeostasis by undergoing a profound metabolic reprograming, which determines their ability to
differentiate and build the cornified barrier. We also found that the aptitude to initiate such metabolic adaptations
is progressively impaired in aging stem cells, which correlates with decreased expression of certain metabolic
enzymes. Consequently, we propose that exhaustion of metabolic reprogramming capacity is caused by aging
of the epidermal stem cells and is highly relevant for age-related alterations in the skin. We plan in aim 1 to
utilize our unique repository of primary human epidermal stem cells derived from donors of different ages and
further expose the metabolic failure of elderly progenitors. We will define the transcriptional alterations underlying
the defects in reprogramming from cytosolic glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Aim two will
employ human artificial skin equivalents and a recently developed total thickness human skin regeneration
system as models of epidermal homeostasis and wound healing to address the functional significance of altered
metabolism-associated genes identified in Aim 1. Based on these findings, we will further explore the function of
the gene candidates in vivo in the mouse epidermis (in aim 3) using a highly efficient in utero gene-editing
system."
10884377,"SUMMARY
Defective wound healing accounts for enormous morbidity and fiscal burden worldwide. Chronological aging of
skin is at the foundation of defective wound healing, although little is known regarding the underlying cause of
this association. However compelling data indicates that skin stem cells that become deficient as we age are the
basis for defective wound healing. Moreover, reversible epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in stem cell
health and maintenance. We therefore posit that the fundamental underpinnings of regenerative healing of skin
reside in the epigenetic regulation of skin stem cells. Here, we propose to study epigenetic changes in skin
regeneration in wound healing and aging, and test a newly discovered form of in vivo epigenetic
reprogramming that we predict will reverse the age and restore function to aging stem cells. Thus, the
primary goal of this project is to elucidate epigenetic mechanisms of skin stem cell regulation with focus
on DNA methylation/hydroxymethylation and histone modification, and to develop novel and practical
translational approaches to reprogramming age-related stem cell epigenetic aberrances. We have
assembled a synergistic interdisciplinary team of investigators with a history of pioneering discovery in the areas
of aging biology, epigenetics, epigenetic reprogramming, skin stem cell biology, dermatopathology and
biomarker application. We also have developed experimental models that encompass biodegradable wound
healing scaffold development, human skin xenotransplantation, three-dimensional bioprinting, and a mouse
model of epigenetically inducible premature aging. Thus, we will leverage multiple points of synergy, experience,
and collaborative interaction to tackle the complex and clinically important questions of age-related wound healing
deficiency. Most importantly, we will define and test the therapeutic effects of epigenetic reprogramming in our
novel and complementary pre-clinical model systems. This proposal presents a new approach of epigenetic
reprogramming of functionally deficient aging stem cells to enhance skin regeneration in order to heal chronic
wounds in the aging populace. If successful, such an approach could transform the way we think about the aging
process and treating age-related skin disorders."
10884387,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The Administrative Core (AC) of our Biomarker Characterization Center (BCC) will facilitate and optimize
the integration of biomarker discovery and initial validation studies by the Biomarker Discovery Lab (BDL) and
the development and validation studies to create clinical-grade, CLIA compliant biomarker assays by the
Biomarker Reference Lab (BRL). The Administrative Core will be managed by the Center Administrator and run
by the PIs of the BDL and BRL. It will support and enhance cross BCC and cross EDRN communication, data
dissemination and data review and analysis, which will promote the BCC’s core mission to discovery and validate
clinical grade biomarker assays for GI cancer risk prediction and early detection The Administrative Core will
provide administrative support for collaborations and communications between the EDRN BCCs, Clinical
Validation Centers (CVCs), Data Management Center (DMCC); collaborating industrial partners (e.g. Cernostics,
Qiagen, etc.) and academic partners, and collaborating NCI programs (e.g. CISNET, NIST, etc.). Through the
functions of the Administrative Core, the BCC with other EDRN BCCs, CVC, and DMCC, industrial partners, and
academic partners will collaborate not only on the BCC’s studies but also on resulting derivative studies and
other EDRN BCC and CVC projects that arise from the BCC’s highly innovative, productive and significant
program of biomarker discovery and validation for GI cancer risk prediction and early detection and the programs
of other BCCs.
 The Administrative Core has the following aims:
Aim 1: To provide the organizational structure for supporting the key objectives of the BCC, which are the BDL’s
and BRL’s scientific and educational missions and the successful collaboration among the BDL and BRL PI and
scientists, EDRN partners, academic partners and industrial partners.
Aim 2: To provide efficiency in management of large-scale collaborative research efforts involving multiple
institutions and multiple PDs/PIs, including local and national meetings management.
Aim 3: To coordinate with EDRN DMCC for protocol development, biospecimen sharing, biospecimen blinding,
data analysis, data sharing, data deposition, populating Biomarker Data Commons, and any other relevant
functions deemed necessary for BCC operations as well as for the larger Network."
10884388,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 The goal of this BDL proposal is the discovery and validation of biomarkers for reducing mortality from
gastrointestinal cancers. We focus on colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer deaths in
the U.S., and on esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), which is increasing rapidly and has an 83% mortality rate.
For CRC, we propose to develop biomarkers to accurately identify individuals at high risk for CRC, who benefit
from aggressive screening programs. We will conduct EDRN phase 1 and 2 studies to discover and validate a
class of methylated DNA based molecular markers found in the normal colon mucosa, which our prior studies
have implicated as identifying individuals at increased CRC risk. For EACs, we propose to identify biomarkers
that will accurately detect high grade dysplasia (HGD) and early EAC in esophageal cytology samples, which
can be obtained with a non-endoscopic device and can be used in a cost-effective BE surveillance program.
Thirdly, we will conduct EDRN Phase 1 and 2 studies to discover and validate biomarkers that predict the risk of
BE progressing to HGD or early EAC. Our overall vision is to develop accurate biomarker-based tests of
esophageal samples that ultimately can be used to predict the risk for HGD and EAC and to detect early HGD
and EAC to achieve cost-effective effective BE surveillance using non-endoscopic esophageal cytology samples.
We base these Phase 1 and 2 studies on our identification of novel methylated DNA biomarkers that highly
discriminate many early EAC and HGD from BE as well on our identification of candidate methylated DNA
markers and genetic markers that associate with BE progression to HGD or EAC. We will develop an optimal
panel of methylated DNA markers for detecting HGD and early EAC. For the risk marker studies, we will develop
a panel of methylated DNA markers and genetic markers for predicting the risk of BE progressing to HGD or
EAC. The specific aims of this proposal accordingly are:
Aim 1. To assess in EDRN phase 1/2 studies, the sensitivity and specificity of a set of candidate biomarkers
whose detection in the normal colon mucosa identifies individuals at increased risk of developing advanced
adenoma or CRC.
Aim 2. To assess in EDRN phase 1/2 studies the sensitivity and specificity of a set of candidate DNA methylation
biomarkers, aneuploidy markers, and copy number alteration (CNA) markers for identifying Barrett’s esophagus
that is at risk for progressing to HGD or EAC
Aim 3. To develop in EDRN phase 1/2 studies a set of candidate biomarkers for detecting early EAC and HGD
as well as “high-risk” low grade dysplasia (LGD) in esophageal cytology samples."
10884391,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Background: Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) arises from Barretts epithelium (BE) and colorectal cancer
(CRC) arises from tubular and serrated adenomas, allowing for screening measures to prevent these cancers.
The risk of CRC and EAC is variable and screening programs are most effective when optimized for high and
low risk. However, our current methods for risk stratifying people are suboptimal, resulting in interval CRCs and
EACs, which are preventable. In addition, current EAC screening tests are invasive and inconvenient, resulting
in high social and economic burdens and low adherence. Epigenetic and genetic alterations are common in
precursor lesions for CRC and EAC and can serve as early detection and as risk biomarkers for colon
adenomas/CRC and BE/EAC, respectively. Hypothesis: For CRC, we hypothesis that a clinical testing program
using methylated DNA biomarker assays in normal colonic mucosa will identify people at high risk of CRC who
will benefit from more aggressive follow-up colonoscopies. For EAC, we hypothesize that clinical grade
biomarkers assays based on epigenetic and genetic alterations for EAC risk prediction and early detection of
high-grade dysplasia and early EAC in BE patients will improve EAC screening in BE patients and prevent EAC
deaths.
Proposal: We will clinically validate and develop GLP compliant assays, which can: 1) accurately detect high
grade dysplasia (HGD) and early EAC; 2) can predict the risk of BE progression using DNA from either
esophageal biopsies and ultimately brushings; and 3) can accurately identify people at high-risk for CRC, for
whom aggressive CRC screening could be lifesaving. Assay design, protocols, controls, validation samples,
and reference materials will be generated by the BDL and transferred to the BRL where the assays will undergo
clinical validation. The BRL will develop harmonization and proficiency programs, along with GLP compliant kits
in collaboration with industry partners to ensure other BCC BRLs can also conduct studies with these assays.
BRL validated assays will support EDRN Phase 2/3 trials and will be based on a novel set of BDL discovered
methylated DNA and genetic biomarkers that: 1) identify patients who are at increased risk of CRC from testing
of normal colonic tissue biopsies; 2) improve risk stratification of patients with BE who are at increased risk of
EAC and HGD using two classes of assays:one novel custom MPS assay and a smaller targeted MS-ddPCR
assay, and 3) accurately detect HGD or early EAC in BE patients undergoing surveillance and that use
esophageal brushing samples. Establishing proficiency testing programs with harmonized BRLs will ensure the
biomarker tests are robust and reliable for Phase 2-4 clinical trials."

PROJECT SUMMARY: Identification and treatment of risk factors that accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD)
are essential to slowing disease progression. Alphaherpesviruses (herpes simplex virus type 1 [HSV-1], varicella
zoster virus [VZV]) are potential accelerators of AD because they increase dementia risk and produce similar
pathologies, including amyloid, neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and cognitive impairment1-3. In
parallel literature, early AD is characterized by smell loss4,5, amyloid deposition in olfactory epithelium (OE)6,7,
and olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) dysfunction (reviewed in8). Because sniff-induced gamma () oscillations
generated in olfactory bulb (OB) are directionally coupled to the hippocampus9-12, smell loss would result in
decreased hippocampal  oscillations that have been postulated to lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive
decline.14-16 Because alphaherpesviruses infect and reactivate in the nasal cavity, alphaherpesvirus disruption of
olfactory pathways may accelerate AD. Our preliminary data show: (1) compared to controls, OB and olfactory
tract (OT) from familial AD (FAD) subjects have upregulation of viral and inflammatory transcriptional
pathways , confirmed at the protein level; (2) VZV immediate early protein 62 was detected in serum of 2 of 3
AD subjects and in 0/4 controls; (3) HSV-1- and VZV-infected human OE cultures (OECs) contain amyloid and
increased OSN differentiation; and, (4) intranasal HSV-1-infected 5xFAD mice have increased OE amyloid and
decreased olfaction compared to uninfected or pre-inoculation controls, respectively. Taken together, we
hypothesize that alphaherpesvirus infection of the OE contributes to pathological processes within the olfactory
system and hippocampus, thereby accelerating disease. To test this hypothesis, we will: (Aim 1) identify
gene
hippocampus, (Aim 2) determine
whether infection of human OE with VZV and HSV-1 ex vivo elicits amyloid production and
loss of odorant responsiveness, recapitulating smell loss in AD; and (Aim 3) test whether HSV-
1 worsens olfactory dysfunction in 5xFAD mice, accelerating the AD phenotype; specifically, we
will test whether HSV-1-induced pathology and functional changes are diminished by
optogenetic stimulation of mitral/tufted cells in the  frequency range and if entrainment of
hippocampal  oscillations can prevent cellular and behavioral deficits elicited by HSV-
1. Understanding how viruses interact with the aging olfactory system, as well as with individuals who
overexpress amyloidogenic peptides (FAD), to accelerate AD will identify potential biomarkers and therapies
(e.g. vaccines or antiviral agents) that may slow or halt progression to clinical dementia, disability, and death.

Understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits is critical for personalized medicine, as knowledge of
underlying risk loci is required for treatment and prediction of disease state. Genome wide association studies
(GWAS) have identified hundreds of thousands of genotype-phenotype associations. This information –
incorporated in Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) – has provided levels of prediction accuracy for some complex
diseases and health-related traits comparable to those obtained for monogenic diseases. While this is an
important advance, significant problems still need to be overcome to achieve the ultimate goal of precision
medicine. First, prediction accuracy is low for most complex traits. Possible reasons for this observation are the
higher polygenicity of these traits, requiring larger sample sizes to discover associated loci and estimate their
effect; and gene-by-context interactions that are usually ignored in prediction models. Second, genetic
analyses of complex traits have been largely performed for individuals of European ancestry. Unfortunately,
results obtained using individuals of a specific ancestry usually transfer poorly to a different ancestry and are
therefore not generalizable. This is due to differences in effect sizes across ancestries because of different
patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allele frequencies and/or gene-by-context interactions. Third,
prediction accuracy can be different even between groups of individuals of the same ancestry, stratified
according to age, sex, or socio-economic status, pointing to the presence of gene-by-context interactions. My
research program will focus on investigating the role of gene-by-context interactions on the genetic architecture
and polygenic prediction of complex traits. My first goal is to elucidate the importance of gene-by-context
interactions and their contribution to effect size differences in multi-ancestry samples. To do so, I will
develop a new analytical strategy using a combination of methods that will increase the power for discoveries.
This will result in a comprehensive assessment of the contribution of gene-by-context interactions to complex
trait variation. My second goal is to evaluate the utility of accounting for gene-by-context interactions to
improve phenotypic prediction in single-ancestry as well as multi-ancestry samples. To do so, I will use
statistical methods developed for agricultural breeding that have been successful at increasing complex trait
prediction accuracy in that field. Considering the specific features of multi-ancestry human data, I will also
develop a prediction method that models gene-by-context interactions explicitly, while simultaneously
accounting for other sources of effect heterogeneity. The long-term goal of my laboratory is to increase
prediction accuracy for medically relevant traits in the general population. To do so, we need methods
and analysis strategies that work well on datasets with individuals of multiple ancestries, including those
underrepresented in genetic research."

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), in which persons with ongoing HIV risk use antiretroviral medications to
reduce their risk of acquiring HIV infection, is a promising prevention strategy. However, data show that PrEP’s
effectiveness is greatly compromised by suboptimal adherence to treatment.1 Persons on PrEP face many
challenges to optimal adherence and retention in care, including stigma and misperceptions about risk.2,3 Due
to these challenges, the prescribing of PrEP should be accompanied by adherence interventions that are
appealing to diverse populations.1,4 We developed and examined the preliminary efficacy of an action-oriented,
appealing, mobile game to improve adherence to PrEP entitled Viral Combat.5,6 Viral Combat was tested in a
randomized trial with 69 participants newly initiating PrEP. At the 24-week follow-up, those in the intervention
group were 3.75 times (p=0.02) as likely to engage in optimal PrEP dosing (i.e. 4 or more days/week as
indicated using levels of tenofovir diphosphate from dried blood spots) compared to the control group.6 In this
next phase of research, we will test Viral Combat through a multisite Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-

Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is self-reported concern about cognitive changes among persons without
objective deficits on standardized cognitive testing, and may be a pre-clinical stage of Alzheimer’s Disease
(AD). SCD is also closely linked to depression. Studies have reported 10-38% of older adults experience both
depression and SCD. Depressive symptoms can precede, co-occur, or follow the onset of SCD, however,
appropriate management of persons experiencing depression in SCD is undefined. An intervention study to
understand the impact of decreasing depression on SCD has not been done. Such a study would clarify
appropriate management and potentially alter the trajectory of cognitive decline. We have developed a
community-based peer support intervention called Peer Enhanced Depression Care (Peers) for underserved
older adults that we seek to adapt for older adults with depression and SCD. It is a manualized depression
care program in which older adult peer coaches who have experienced depression provide 8 virtual weekly
meetings in which social support, self-care skills, and linkage to community and clinical care are provided.
Preliminary work has shown feasibility, acceptability, and potential mediators such as self-efficacy and
loneliness. In this proposal our goal is to adapt Peer Enhanced Depression Care for older adults with
depression and SCD, with particular emphasis on older adults of color. We will collaborate with the
community-based organizations associated with the Massachusetts Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center. In
Aim 1, we will conduct pre-intervention focus groups with older adults with depression and SCD to understand
the experience, needs, and coping strategies associated with managing depression and SCD. We will
conduct focus groups with other key stakeholders (e.g., community-based organization staff) to identify early
stage barriers and facilitators to implementation of the intervention in community settings. Results will be used
to adapt the intervention manual and training procedures to address the specific emotional and informational
needs of ethnically diverse older adults with SCD in addition to depression. In Aim 2, we will assess the
feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of the adapted intervention, which we will call PeersSCD, consisting of 8
weekly video chats focused on emotional, appraisal, and informational support delivered by community-based
older adult peer coaches to adults 50 years of age and older with depression and SCD. We will conduct pre-
and post-intervention assessments and semi-structured interviews with participants, peer coaches, and
community-based organization staff to assess feasibility and acceptability and identify facilitators and barriers
to early-stage implementation of the intervention. The interviews will also be used to explore the potential
mechanisms of action of the interventions from participants’ and peer coach perspectives. The preliminary
data that we obtain will support a future randomized controlled trial to study the impact of depression care on
SCD."
10875094,"The goal of the Columbia Roybal Center for Fearless Behavior Change is to advance behavioral
interventions that reduce psychological distress and improve health behaviors in midlife and older adults that
experience serious health events. Each year, millions of adults experience events such as heart attacks,
strokes, or life-threatening cancer diagnoses. For some, these events serve as a wake-up calls, or “teachable
moments,” and those patients acquire health behaviors that prevent recurrent events and slow disease
progression. Yet, many of these patients are highly distressed after these events, leading to substantial impact
on quality of life, health behaviors, and prognosis. For example, 1 in 3 patients develop PTSD symptoms after
cardiac arrest and critical illness, and 1 in 5 patients develop persistent depressive symptoms after heart
attacks. Those patients who are highly distressed are less likely to follow recommended health behaviors such
as taking medications, exercising, and having good sleep. We have shown that many patients avoid
medications because they are reminders of disease risk, and exercise because physiological changes (e.g.,
heart rate) are distressing reminders of the possibility of a recurrent event. Accordingly, our Roybal Center is
interested in advancing interventions that target these distress-based mechanisms for which interventions are
underdeveloped. There are already evidence-based interventions for reducing other common forms of
psychological distress after serious health events such as anxiety and depression. Our Center also aims to
conduct implementation research that accelerates the adoption of these effective interventions into practice.
Our Center will conduct Stage 0-V research through a Behavioral Intervention Development Core that
provides implementation science, regulatory, and statistical support to trialists. In the first year, this Core will
launch a Stage II randomized clinical trial (N=90) testing an Acceptance and Mindfulness-Based Exposure
Therapy for PTSD in cardiac arrest survivors that was that was previously feasibility tested by our Center
versus Present-Centered Therapy, a standard of care control,. This trial demonstrates our capacity to
advance interventions through the NIH Stage Model within our Center. In the first year, our Center will
also initiate a pragmatic cluster randomized trial (N= 50 clinicians; 200 patients) testing the effect of an
implementation strategy (a digital patient activation tool) versus usual care on the uptake of evidence-based
treaments for depression in patients with recent CVD events. This trial illustrates our Center’s capacity to
conduct Stage V research. Our Center will also include an Administrative Core responsible for soliciting
proposals for new trials responsive to our Center’s theme via an annual national competition. This Core will
collaborate with the Stress Measurement Network and Science of Behavior Change program to ensure robust
measurement of behavioral mechanisms in all trials. It will also oversee trials; disseminate findings; promote
DEIA values in trial conduct; develop collaborations; and nurture the next generation of behavioral trialists."

Adolescent Wellness Visits in Tanzania
Getting adolescents in the door of a health facility is an entrenched health system problem, particularly for HIV
and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services. Adolescents in low-resource settings need a preventative
health service platform applicable for all young people that promotes a culture of health-seeking behavior. In
response to PAR-
impact of Adolescent Wellness Visits (AWVs), a
19-274 [Dissemination & Implementation Research in Health], this R01 will evaluate the 
new health service platform, for reaching young adolescents
with HTC and other evidence-based prevention services which are clinic-based and school-facilitated. We posit
that by coupling sexual and reproductive health (SRH) and non-SRH information and services, issues of self-
risk assessment, and access to services may be circumvented. AWVs could meet the SRH needs of at-risk
adolescents, and have a larger public health impact for all adolescents on access to traditionally neglected and
untreated non-SRH issues such as poor nutrition, vision, dental, and mental health problems at the time of
delivery as well as in the future as adolescents continue with more timely service utilization. The AWV is
designed to be delivered during the last year of primary school when school attendance is high and
adolescents are on the cusp of puberty (mean age 13). This project is a collaboration between Duke University
and Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Specific Aims are: 1) To

leverages a new population level health service for adolescents that aligns with NICHD’s Research Theme #5:
Improving Health during the Transition from Adolescence to Adulthood (NOT-HD-18-031), and as a nurse-
delivered intervention, it also aligns with NINR’s strategic focus area—Wellness: Promoting Health and
Preventing Illness (16-NR-778). A prevention-focused adolescent health service in LMICs can set the tone for
a ‘culture of health and wellness’ during this critical developmental period."
10872746,"Project Summary/Abstract
Regulation of autophagy and the nutrient-sensing kinases mTOR and AMPK are not only important in cancer,
but have garnered much recent attention in neurodegeneration. The Per–Arnt–Sim domain kinase (PASK)
function both up- and downstream of mTOR. Our studies in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) revealed that
PASK is overabundant upon ATXN2 mutation. In yeast, Pask directly phosphorylates the ATXN2 homolog
Prp1. This was an intriguing connection to our work as we had previously found that mTOR is dysregulated
upon ATXN2 mutation. Our preliminary data support a feedforward control mechanism of PASK in SCA2.
When ATXN2 is mutated, PASK levels rise further limiting autophagy. In our previous work we showed that
STAU1 is also elevated with ATXN2 mutation leading to enhanced translation of mTOR mRNA, which in turn is
known to activate PASK. In preliminary data we have shown that targeting PASK by RNAi or with the PASK-
specific inhibitor BioE-115 in cultured cells, or genetically in SCA2 mice significantly reduced STAU1 protein
levels, improved autophagic flux and levels of Purkinje cell marker proteins, effectively mimicking ASO
knockdown of ATXN2. We hypothesize that the kinase activity of PASK regulates activity in the ATXN2 –
STAU1 pathway modulating TDP-43 pathology. We further hypothesize that that targeting PASK is an effective
way to normalizing TDP-43 proteinopathy, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) / frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) and the Alzheimer’s disease-like dementia disorder limbic age related TDP-43 encephalopathy
(LATE). The overall objective of our study is to understand PASK in neurodegeneration and to generate proof-
of-concept for targeting PASK for treating SCA2 and TDP-43 proteinopathies to support future therapeutic
development. Three specific aims are proposed: In Aim 1 we will use a proteomic approach to identify
phosphorylated peptides of the ATXN2 protein. We will also investigate isogenic SCA2 and TDP43 mutant
patient iPSC cortical neurons to produce transcriptome and proteomic analysis to identify differentially
regulated genes, proteins and pathways dependent on BioE-1115. In Aim 2 we perform two genetic interaction
studies to demonstrate modification of motor and molecular autopagy phenotypes in SCA2 (ATXN2-Q127) and
Prp-TDP43-Q331K transgenic mice haploinsufficient for Pask. In Aim 3 we will demonstrate modification of
molecular phenotypes of Prp-TDP43-Q331K mice treated with BioE-1115, and also conduct a proof-of-concept
study showing effectiveness of an ASO targeting Pask in modification of both motor and molecular phenotypes
of Prp-TDP43-Q331K mice. Our expectation is to demonstrate that ATXN2 is phosphorylated, that its
phosphorylation is modulated by BioE-1115, and to demonstrate PASK as a therapeutic target for SCA2, ALS,
FTD and possibly other AD/ADRDs."
10875527,"Sepsis with acute organ dysfunction is a common condition with high morbidity and mortality and no specific
therapies other than antimicrobials. The NHLBI PETAL Network Phase 2B Acetaminophen and Ascorbate in
Sepsis: Targeted Therapy to Enhance Recovery (ASTER trial) is a randomized double blind platform trial that
will test the effect of two potential therapies, acetaminophen or vitamin C versus a common placebo to improve
lung, cardiovascular and kidney dysfunction in 900 patients with sepsis and pulmonary or cardiovascular
dysfunction including patients with sepsis due to COVID-19. The rationale for this clinical trial rests, in part, on
novel findings from our group and others that (1) circulating cell-free hemoglobin (CFH) is elevated in patients
with sepsis, including those with COVID-19; (2) higher plasma CFH in sepsis is associated with death and
organ dysfunction including ARDS and acute kidney injury; (3) both acetaminophen and vitamin C are
hemoprotein reductants that reduce the capacity of CFH to cause lipid peroxidation and other oxidant injury
and (4) acetaminophen and vitamin C can reduce the injurious effects of CFH on the microvascular
endothelium both in vitro and in the isolated perfused human lung. Although ASTER is well designed to test
the clinical efficacy of acetaminophen and vitamin C, key information will be needed to understand trial results
and plan for potential phase 3 studies. The proposed studies in this R01 will define the mechanisms by which
acetaminophen and vitamin C affect organ dysfunction in sepsis (Aim 1) and determine whether there are
subgroups that can be identified within the trial for whom a differential treatment effect exists (Aim 2). Specific
Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms by which acetaminophen and vitamin C improve lung and kidney
dysfunction in sepsis by testing the hypothesis that acetaminophen and vitamin C reduce levels of oxidized
ferryl (4+) hemoglobin resulting in decreased oxidative injury, inflammation, and endothelial injury as measured
by plasma, distal airspace fluid, and urinary biomarkers of hemoglobin oxidation (ferryl hemoglobin) lipid
peroxidation (F2-Isoprostanes, Isofurans), inflammation and endothelial injury. Distal airspace fluid will be
sampled at ten participating PETAL Network sites by collecting fluid that condenses on heat moisture
exchanger filters placed in the mechanical ventilator circuit, a method that has been developed and validated
by Dr. Ware's research group. Specific Aim 2 will identify whether previously described and validated
hyperinflammatory or hypoinflammatory subgroups of sepsis patients benefit more from treatment with
acetaminophen or vitamin C. A finding of heterogeneity of treatment effect in Aim 2 would be of great value for
predictive enrichment in a future phase 3 clinical trial. In summary, the proposed studies will greatly enhance
the value of the ASTER clinical trial by determining the biologic mechanisms of the therapeutic effects of
acetaminophen and Vitamin C and assessing for heterogeneity of treatment effect in this NHLBI-funded Phase
2B clinical trial."
10875528,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Adipose fibrosis is characterized by progressive stromal fibrosis that causes adipose dysfunction in obesity,
diabetes, and inflammatory conditions. The sustained activation of unwanted myofibroblasts promotes
progressive tissue changes with excessive amounts of altered fibrotic matrix. Although PDGFRα+ and CD9+
progenitor cells have been implicated, the cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Matrix Gla Protein (MGP) is
an extracellular inhibitor of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4, a mediator of endothelial cell (EC)
inflammation. Loss of MGP triggers endothelial-mesenchymal transitions (EndMTs), a source of multipotent
cells. We discovered that MGP is expressed in PDGFRα+ and CD9+ progenitor cells, and plays a limiting role
in myofibroblast lineage in mice. By characterizing the adipose fibrosis in Mgp-knockout (KO) mice, integrating
profiles from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) combined with cell sorting and culture, we propose to
dissect the mechanism of MGP in adipose fibrosis. In preliminary studies, global Mgp deletion caused
extensive adipose fibrosis in white adipose tissue (WAT) in mice. ScRNA-seq uncovered MGP expression in
ECs and progenitors with projected trajectories towards myofibroblasts. Loss of Mgp enhanced abnormal ECs
and cell populations with myofibrogenic potential, isolated by FACS. Mice with mutated Mgp lacking BMP-
binding displayed fibrosis limited to perivascular areas, suggesting a structural role for MGP. EC-specific Mgp
deletion largely mimicked the global fibrotic phenotype. We also found robust changes in brown adipose tissue
(BAT) with excessive ECs, myofibroblasts, and abnormal thermogenesis. Potential mechanisms of
differentiation involved BMP4/7, the BMP receptor ALK1, the TGFβ receptor ALK5.
Our hypothesis is that loss of MGP causes transition and expansion of ECs and specific progenitors, followed
by enhanced myofibroblast differentiation, in a two-step model. Aim 1 will elucidate the mechanism by which
MGP regulates the transition of ECs and progenitors to myofibroblasts in WAT. We will characterize the Mgp-
KO mouse as a new model of adipose fibrosis, using scRNA-seq, FACS and adipogenic cultures. We will
assess EC contribution to myofibroblasts by lineage tracing using tdTomato-labeled ECs. In vitro, we will test
profibrotic effects of BMP3b and BMP4/ALK1/ALK5 signaling. Aim 2 will determine whether loss of BMP-
binding in MGP or endothelial deletion of MGP is sufficient to cause myofibroblasts transitions or a shift in the
pattern of fibrosis. Comparisons of myofibroblast transition without BMP binding and endothelial deletion of
Mgp allow us to deduce the anti-fibrotic of MGP and the relative importance of endothelial MGP. Aim 3 will
characterize BAT after Mgp deletion. We will examine fibrotic and vascular phenotypes in Mgp-KO mice. We
will identify MGP-expressing cell populations, their transcriptional profiles and cell trajectories, and determine
how MGP helps direct brown adipogenesis by early BMP7. Our results may impact the field of obesity and
obesity-related complications and lead to new therapeutic strategies that limit fibrosis in chronic disease."

The Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) has provided the framework for landmark clinical trials that utilize
rigorous methodology to change clinical practice. The Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) PFDN
Clinical Site has been a significant and consistent contributor since 2007. We are excited to offer our
dedicated faculty, experienced research team, and established track-record of high patient recruitment with this
re-application to the PFDN. DUMC has a rich tradition of excellence in clinical care, training and research in
pelvic floor disorders, offering detailed evaluation and treatment in a high-volume, multidisciplinary setting with
broad institutional resources, and serving as a tertiary southeastern US referral center. Our eight fellowship-
trained urogynecology investigators have expertise in both surgical and non-surgical management of the full
spectrum of pelvic floor disorders including urinary urgency/frequency, urinary incontinence (UI), fecal
incontinence (FI), and pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Last year, our Urogynecology Division cared for 3165 new
patients, performed 191 surgical procedures for UI and 377 for POP. This is in addition to 474 non-surgical
procedures (including bulking injection, bladder Botox, and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation) for UI. The
Urogynecology Division is a hub of multidisciplinary collaboration including urology, colorectal surgery,
gastroenterology, radiology, physical therapy, and multiple basic research laboratories across our campus.
DUMC provides comprehensive diagnostic evaluation including multi-channel urodynamic testing, video
urodynamics, cystoscopy, defecography, static and dynamic MRI, as well as and endoanal ultrasound. We
have expertise in study design, recruitment, retention, adverse event reporting, and data analysis. We have
unique and substantial expertise in translational sciences and prediction modeling that we aim to leverage in
innovative translational aims embedded in PFDN clinical trials. Our clinical patient population is 72% White,
19% African American, 0.4% Latina, 0.3% Asian, and 0.01% American Indian, from suburban and rural
communities with stable care and follow-up patterns. We recognize that our clinical population is skewed as
Durham County statistics report that our local community is 50% White, 37% African American, 13% Latina,
4% Asian, and 4% American Indian. Thus, in the current cycle we will actively engage with new institutional
resources that provide bilingual coordinators and community-based engagement for research. The long-term
objective of the DUMC PFDN Clinical Site is to improve the evidence-based clinical care of women with pelvic
floor disorders. To accomplish this objective, we propose to provide meaningful scientific contributions to the
PFDN by collaborating with other sites and the data coordinating center, implementing all approved protocols
in a manner that maximizes faculty engagement and participant recruitment and retention, and involving
collaborators with a range of clinical, basic science, and methodological expertise, when appropriate."

pronounced within this group. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 6, and 12-months using a hip-worn
ActiGraph for assessing minutes/week of MVPA, as justified by guidelines. Implications: This research is highly
significant because our intervention would be the first scalable PA intervention squarely grounded in SCT with
N-of-1 adaptation driven by a mathematical dynamical model version of SCT. Further, favorable results would
justify use of our COT methods for other complex and highly idiosyncratic and dynamic behaviors such as weight

10875617,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the United States and is recognized as a major cause of
morbidity and mortality. Young adults (18-35 years) are at particularly high risk for weight gain and obesity. In-
person behavioral interventions generally produce clinically significant weight losses; however, cost and
access limit their potential to reduce obesity at a population level. Although web-based interventions that mimic
the structure of weekly face-to-face treatment have proven a viable alternative treatment, weight losses are
generally smaller than in-person treatment. Exclusively mobile treatments have been less effective, producing
1-3 kgs over 6 months. Newer digital intervention approaches called “Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions”
(JITAIs) promise to improve upon outcomes by offering adaptive, personalized feedback on behavior “when
needed” in “real time,” rather than on a fixed schedule. This “just-in-time,” or JIT, approach is made possible by
the emergence of low-cost and widely available digital health tools that allow for the collection of continually
updated health data. However, few studies have used JIT approaches in remotely delivered, fully scalable
weight loss interventions. Although JITAIs are a potentially transformative approach to delivering obesity
interventions, a major obstacle in their development is efficient selection of components and systematic design
of an optimized intervention package that produces clinically meaningful weight losses with a population-level
strategy. To solve this problem, we will use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), an engineering-
inspired framework, and a highly efficient experimental design to identify which levels of 5 intervention
components contribute meaningfully to change in weight over 6 months among young adults with overweight
and obesity. All participants (n=608) will receive a core 6-month weight loss intervention that includes
evidence-based lessons, behavioral skills training, and daily weighing. With the goal of determining if greater
adaptation will lead to greater weight loss, we will randomize participants to standard versus more adaptive
options of 5 additional intervention components: 1) diet monitoring approach (standard vs. simplified), 2)
adaptive physical activity goals (weekly vs. daily), 3) decision points for message timing (fixed vs. adaptive), 4)
decision rules for message content (standard vs. adaptive), and 5) message choice (no vs. yes). Candidate
components have been carefully selected from empirical evidence, tested in our prior studies, or in our pilot
micro-randomized trial. Assessments will occur at 0, 3 and 6 months to accomplish the following specific aims:
1) Build an optimized JITAI consisting of the set of intervention components that yield the greatest
improvement in weight change among young adults at 6 months; 2) Conduct mediation analyses to test the
relationships between the intervention components and hypothesized proximal mediators (self-regulation,
competence, relatedness, relevance, autonomy) and more distal behavioral mediators (dietary intake, physical
activity, and daily self-weighting); and 3) Conduct exploratory"

This F32 project aims to advance understanding of perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMAD), their
consequences to infant social-emotional development, modifiable behaviors to alleviate PMAD, and preferences
for evidence-based PMAD management approaches. Approximately 20% of women worldwide report PMAD
during pregnancy or within the first year postpartum—predominantly depression, anxiety, and high stress.
Maternal PMAD increases risk of adverse infant outcomes. Risk of social-emotional developmental (SED) delays
is 60% higher among infants born to women experiencing PMAD compared to infants unexposed to PMAD.
Infant SED impacts mental health, social competence, and economic attainment throughout the lifespan. Little
is known about particularly influential timing of PMAD within the perinatal period which could optimize
intervention timing for maximal benefit to mother-infant dyads. Maternal engagement with infants through
interactive behaviors like playing, talking, and singing may mitigate mechanisms connecting PMAD and infant
SED delays. Low quality dyadic interactions are more likely with maternal PMAD and associated with suboptimal
SED. Interventions that increase mother-infant engagement quality improve infant SED, yet improvement to
maternal mental health is unclear. Gaps remain in understanding preferences for PMAD interventions among
pregnant and postpartum women in the sub-Saharan African region where PMAD disproportionately affects
women and maternal child health (MCH) clinics are widely attended, offering a high-impact access point for
maternal mental health services. The proposed F32 research project leverages data from an ongoing cohort
study (PrIMA-X, R01HD100201, PI: Pintye) among 1300 Kenyan mother-infant pairs followed from pregnancy
through 36-months postpartum with longitudinal assessment of maternal perinatal mood and anxiety disorder,
mother-infant engagement, and infant-child social-emotional development. In Aim 1, we will use dyadic data
collected monthly in pregnancy and 6-monthly through 36 months postpartum to prospectively assess impact
and timing of PMAD on SED delays among Kenyan mother-infant pairs. In Aim 2, we will determine the
relationship between mother-infant engagement and PMAD remission timing longitudinally through 36 months
postpartum, potentially highlighting an effective avenue for intervention. In Aim 3, we will evaluate acceptability
and preferences for PMAD management approaches among perinatal Kenyan women to inform patient-driven
intervention design using qualitative methods guided by the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. This large-
scale mixed method study will contribute novel data toward informing a future PMAD intervention. The research
plan will provide the F32 candidate rigorous postdoctoral training including: 1) advanced epidemiologic and time-
to-event methods using longitudinal data with repeated measures, 2) experience with qualitative methods to
inform a patient-centered intervention, 3) content-area expertise in maternal-infant mental health—an area
critical to closing MCH gaps."
10901737,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of
substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons. The reasons for their selective vulnerability and the
mechanisms that drive their degeneration remain unclear. There is mounting evidence that the activity of
energetically-burdened SNc neurons is altered in PD, however the role of neural activity in the susceptibility of
dopamine neurons is poorly understood. Additionally, while dopamine is known to be toxic to neurons that do
not have a means of sequestering or metabolizing it, the role of dopamine itself in the degeneration of dopamine
neurons in PD is not known. To investigate the role of activity in dopamine neuron selective vulnerability, we
have developed novel mouse models in which we can chronically manipulate midbrain dopamine neuron activity
using chemogenetics. With these models, we propose to determine how chronically manipulating activity and
dopamine metabolism within dopamine neurons impacts their susceptibility to degeneration. These experiments
will be the first to directly interrogate the role of neural activity in degeneration in a chronic, minimally-invasive
manner. Furthermore, they will provide insight for future therapeutic strategies to protect dopamine neurons from
degeneration in PD."

 Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide and its
incidence is increasing due to endemic obesity. Sexual dimorphism exists in HCC incidence as women have a
significantly lower risk for developing HCC than men. However, the molecular mechanisms of HCC sexual
dimorphism remain unclear, hindering development of better therapies for this disease. This proposal will
utilize a new model that we developed of diet-induced progression of NASH to HCC that recapitulates key
physiological, metabolic, histologic and transcriptomic changes observed in the human disease to examine
previously unrecognized roles of sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), an enzyme that regulates the balance of
bioactive sphingolipid metabolites, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide, in sexual dimorphism of
HCC. Similar to humans, we found that on this diet, wild-type male mice, but not females, develop HCC.
Strikingly, SphK2 knockout male mice have reduced tumor incidence, whereas in females, liver cancer
developed only in SphK2 knockout mice. Thus, we propose that SphK2 plays a critical role in sexual
dimorphism of HCC. We will test the central hypothesis that SphK2 protects females from HCC, while
promoting it in males through several mutually non-exclusive mechanisms in distinct hepatic subcellular
organelles. Aim 1 will examine the role of liver SphK2 in key signaling pathways that promote HCC in males
and Aim 2 will define the role of SphK2 in nuclear and mitochondrial mechanisms mediating resistance of
females to HCC. Our proposal utilizes a unique animal model and state-of-the-art techniques to identify novel
SphK2-regulated molecular mechanisms involved in sexual disparity in diet-induced progression of NASH to
HCC, and also has translational implications for the use of SphK2 inhibitors now in clinical trials. This study will
lead to better understanding of sex differences in HCC important for personalized treatment strategies for this
devastating disease."

facility has been established at the SEI. This facility enables the construction of novel devices and
instruments that lead NEI investigators into unexplored and exciting areas of research. In response to
reviewers comments in the last review changes were made in our modular structure. In the previous

as prototype fabrication (machine shop). Both had extremely heavy usage and as indicated by the
reviewers could easily be separated. Therefore, the Prototype Construction Core (PCC) Module has
been spun off as a separate core and is still one of the most heavily subscribed. Innovative changes
have been made in the PCC module which in the proposed renewal include:
A. Personnel improvements including a formally trained CNC mechanician with a secondary
degree in electronics.
B. Acquisition and updating of state of the art fabrication equipment.
C. Improved Access and Availability. To extend access to NEI grant holders on the campus
with need for unique prototypes for experimentation.
D. Training (for personnel with little experience in computer aided design and fabrication).
E. Project Prioritization to streamline efficiency in fabrication, determine project urgency
F. Synergistic Use of the Core Components.
G. Foster Collaborative Relationships, Particularly Clinical and Basic Research

 2 Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects as much as 5% of children, and results in significant cardiovascular and
 3 neurobehavioral morbidity if left untreated. The gold standard for evaluation of OSA in children is in-laboratory
 4 polysomnography (PSG). However, PSG is resource-intensive, requiring caregivers to spend a night away
 5 from home, and facilities are limited. Consequently, 90% of children who undergo adenotonsillectomy to treat
 6 OSA never have the diagnosis made by PSG. Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) is an alternative to PSG
 7 where a patient has an unattended OSA assessment in their home. Clinical trials in adults showed no
 8 difference in functional or treatment outcomes in those evaluated by HSAT compared to PSG, but similar
 9 studies have not been conducted in children. The performance of HSAT compared to PSG in children is
10 unknown, and this has been a critical barrier to its clinical use as a diagnostic tool in the pediatric population.
11 HSAT has been shown to be feasible in children and our preliminary data have shown that HSAT may be
12 accurate compared to PSG and preferable to families. This milestone-driven comparative effectiveness trial will
13 compare HSAT to PSG for the evaluation of OSA in children through the following Aims:
14 1) Compare the diagnostic accuracy of HSAT with PSG for determining OSA status
15 2) Determine the agreement between HSAT and PSG results for therapeutic decision-making
16 3) Determine child/parent-reported acceptability of HSAT and preference of HSAT vs PSG.
17 To accomplish these aims, 317 children age 5-12 years old clinically referred for evaluation of OSA will
18 undergo HSAT and PSG within one week in random order and OSA classification between the two modalities
19 will be compared within subjects using receiver operating characteristics. Off-site investigators who are
20 pediatric sleep medicine physicians will provide a therapeutic decision based on clinical data and HSAT or
21 PSG result and agreement between therapeutic decision between the two tests will be assessed. Parent- and
22 child-reported questionnaires assessing preference and acceptability will be compared between HSAT and
23 PSG, and parent-reported feasibility of HSAT will be assessed.
24 The results of this comparative effectiveness trial will provide critical data directly comparing HSAT to the gold
25 standard in-lab PSG to determine its clinical utility. If shown to be diagnostically accurate and result in the
26 equivalent therapeutic decision as PSG, HSAT could provide a more patient-centered diagnostic alternative
27 that dramatically increase the capacity for OSA evaluation in children, reducing morbidity related to delayed
28 diagnosis and increasing objective testing prior to adenotonsillectomy."

Modern biomedical research relies on new approaches to advance our understanding of complex and
multifaceted illnesses of growing public health significance such as cancer. Emerging technologies enable
population scientists to generate data on a scale never before imaginable (i.e., through whole genome array
scans). Thus, there is a critical need to not only train the next generation of scientists in the classic disciplines
involved in studies of human malignancies, but to cross-train them in complementary disciplines to allow them
to bring their scientific discoveries to light. Therefore, we propose to continue a highly successful postdoctoral
program that combines specialized research knowledge and methodologies in the fields of bioinformatics,
biostatistics and epidemiology. This novel program, entitled “Training Program for Quantitative Population
Sciences in Cancer,” is structured to complement the existing resources for cancer research and education at
the Geisel School of Medicine and the Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC), an NCI designated
Comprehensive Cancer Center affiliated with the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth and Dartmouth
Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC). Our training efforts will continue to be led by investigators with
complementary expertise in the fields of bioinformatics, biostatistics and epidemiology primarily within the
Departments of Biomedical Data Science, Epidemiology and Molecular and Systems Biology. We will
capitalize on Dartmouth’s talented cadre faculty in these disciplines who can offer expert mentorship, and a
versatile portfolio of research and center grants that can supply access to a wealth of population science data,
biologic samples and core research facilities. To accomplish our objectives, we propose to cross-train eight
postdoctoral trainees in epidemiology, bioinformatics or biostatistics for a period of 2 to 3 years. Trainees will
be paired with a primary and secondary mentor from two of the focus disciplines and complete cross-
disciplinary coursework with an optional MS degree in Quantitative Biomedical Sciences. In years two and
three of the program, trainees will concentrate on the conduct of mentored research activities, prepare a mock
NIH grant application, and participate in the preparation of professional manuscripts, presentations at
symposia and scientific conferences and an optional research externship. Program leaders, in consultation
with an Advisory Committee, will select trainees, monitor their progress and provide recommendations to
ensure that the necessary didactic and research experiences are provided to produce highly knowledgeable
investigators for the future of interdisciplinary cancer research in the population sciences. The ultimate goal of
the training program is to accelerate cancer research by enhancing the existing pool of cancer researchers
with the skills to meet the present and future challenges in translational cancer research in the population
sciences."

The heart is composed of a broad range of diverse cardiac cell types, which organize into distinct cardiac
structures that coordinately regulate cardiac function and circulation throughout the body. Despite efforts
devoted toward understanding how these cardiac cell types are created in order to develop potential human
cardiac therapies and/or illuminate underlying mechanisms/etiologies of congenital heart disease (CHD), our
understanding of how diverse cardiac cell types emerge from developmental heart field progenitors, and how
they organize into heart structures remains to be fully defined. Thus, we propose to identify and investigate the
cardiovascular developmental regulators and gene regulatory networks that direct the development of Juxta-
Cardiac Field (JCF)-derived cardiovascular cell types creating the mammalian heart. Toward this end, a multi-
disciplinary experimental and computational systems biology approach will be employed to: (1) examine the
contribution of JCF progenitors to the developing heart, (2) investigate how JCF progenitors differentiate into
specific cell types contributing to heart development and (3) investigate whether mechanisms in JCF
development are conserved in human heart development."
10903343,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Cell division requires spatial organization of cellular contents for its successful completion. The centrosome, which
ensures appropriate chromosome segregation, is an example of a membraneless organelle which uses physical
mechanisms other than segregation by lipid membranes to create spatial organization. Mutations of centrosomal
proteins are associated with diseases such as ciliopathies, primordial dwarfism, neurodegeneration, and cancer.
It is critical to understand the mechanisms that control the assembly of the centrosome to better understand the
pathophysiology of related disorders.
Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is thought to be the process by which centrosomes form, based on recent
evidence that several centrosomal proteins, such as pericentrin in humans, are capable of this process. Centroso-
mal proteins are enriched with both coiled-coil (CC) domains and disordered regions, but it is not yet known how
these domains contribute to the LLPS of the centrosome. The central hypothesis of this proposal to be tested
is that centrosomal proteins, such as pericentrin, use coiled-coil domains as the key drivers of LLPS. Our
preliminary work with simulated and synthetic protein systems suggests that CC domains have physical features
that enable them to drive protein LLPS. The ability of CC domains to mediate protein-protein interactions and
the abundance of these domains in pericentrin makes them a good candidate for facilitating LLPS. However,
CC-driven LLPS in biologically-relevant natural proteins systems has not yet been explored.
This central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two aims. In Aim 1, I will develop a chemically realistic simu-
lation framework to predict likely CC domains that drive LLPS in natural proteins. I will use bioinformatics-based
approaches to generate a sequence-specific interaction framework for molecular modeling. Simulations of natural
CC proteins that phase separate will then be performed to identify possible interactions between CC domains
that might support LLPS. In Aim 2, I will test the contribution of CC domains to the phase separation of peri-
centrin, our model centrosomal protein, by using a combination of cellular and in vitro biophysical approaches. I
will systematically mutate CC domains in pericentrin and find those that drive LLPS through in-cell visualization
of deficient centrosome formation. The domains that drive LLPS will then be assembled into truncated protein
constructs to assess the sufficiency of these regions to cause LLPS in vitro. Additional biophysical experiments will
be used to characterize the contacts between CC domains in the synthetic protein to provide a mechanistic picture
of pericentrin self-assembly. The outcomes of this proposal will contribute to our understanding of centrosome
biogenesis and demonstrate how CC domains might mediate biological LLPS.
This research will be performed as part of a fellowship plan with a carefully selected mentoring team which will
provide me with individualized advanced training in computational methods and experimental approaches, as well
as scientific and career guidance, positioning me for a successful career as an independent scientist."

Following prison release, individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) experience high rates of return to
substance use and overdose. Justice-involved people account for an important part of the population with high
overdose risk; therefore, a high priority for national overdose prevention strategies is to identify and implement
better interventions to support them in safe re-entry. Promising strategies include pre-release medication for
opioid use disorder (P-MOUD) and peer navigation (PN). To assess implementation and effectiveness, and
support translation across the nation's prison systems, it is vital to assess uptake and re-entry outcomes;
identify what components are effective, for whom, how and why, and for how long; document barriers and
facilitators to program success; and assess PN's effectiveness in supporting post-release MOUD retention and
recovery. New Jersey has implemented both interventions at large scale across all of its 11 prisons, with more
than 4,000 individuals receiving P-MOUD and 2,500 PN through 2022, creating a unique research opportunity
to develop and disseminate knowledge on these interventions when implemented systemwide as standard
practice. Use of richly linked clinical and administrative data, for an unprecedently large cohort of individuals
with SUD released from 2016-2027, will provide power to assess interactions among interventions and their
effects in key subgroups, with longitudinal follow-up to examine long-term outcomes, using state-of-the-art
analytic models to produce robust estimates across subgroups of concern. Innovative mixed-methods
strategies, leveraging linked data and first-hand experiences, will assess patterns and disparities in pre-release
MOUD and PN participation; retention in services during re-entry; and recovery outcomes among participants
and non-participants. In-depth interviews during re-entry will document participants' experiences with the
programs, in the context of their broader re-entry experience, their decisionmaking about MOUD and illicit drug
use, and recovery barriers and facilitators. Interviews with policymakers, providers, and other stakeholders will
elicit their perspectives on implementation and generate evidence to support cross-state translation. Among
releasees with SUDs, the study will: 1.) examine patterns/predictors of pre- and post-release MOUD and PN;
2.) examine recovery outcomes over the re-entry period and their relationship to PN and MOUD, separately
and jointly, utilizing innovative event history analysis strategies incorporating propensity scoring and machine
learning strategies; and 3.) utilize qualitative interviews to elicit experiences of implementation and adaptation
of PN and MOUD from the perspectives of participants and multiple other stakeholders. Implementation and
dissemination will be guided by a Stakeholder Advisory Board including persons with lived experience,
providers, correctional leaders, prisoner rights advocates and experts. This study of NJ's innovative, large-
scale interventions provides a unique opportunity to build knowledge that can help save lives and improve
outcomes during community re-entry, with important implications for intervention in other at-risk populations."

Oxygen is essential for the life of many organisms, as it used during aerobic respiration to generate cellular
energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Low oxygen (whether caused by environmental or cellular
hypoxia) prevents adequate ATP production and can consequently cause cell death. Paradoxically, excessive
oxygen, which often occurs post-hypoxia, is equally damaging, due to a surge in reactive oxygen species
(ROS) that is damaging to biomolecules. Hence, aerobic organisms such as humans are susceptible to
fluctuations in oxygen levels, which is manifested in many disease states, including chronic kidney disease,
acute kidney injury, sickle cell anemia and stroke. Stroke alone was the 5th leading cause of death in the US in
2017. Thus, an understanding of how cells can adapt to changes in environmental oxygen under different
circumstances, and how this response can be manipulated therapeutically, is a major challenge for improving
human health. Despite the pathology caused by low O2, evolutionarily conserved mechanisms exist that
protect organisms from hypoxic injury. One such mechanism is metabolic suppression, which involves the
downregulation of energy-demanding processes to match reduced ATP production. The signaling pathways
that trigger and maintain metabolic suppression are mostly unknown. The Brewster laboratory recently
uncovered a novel role for the adapter protein N-myc Downstream Regulated Gene 1a (Ndrg1a) in promoting
long-term adaptation to anoxia (zero oxygen) in the zebrafish embryo via metabolic suppression. The specific
aims of this proposal are to deepen our mechanistic understanding of how Ndrg1 functions. Specifically, we
will: (1) Uncover how Ndrg1 regulates trafficking of the sodium-potassium ATP-ase (NKA) pump in response to
anoxia and re-oxygenation; (2) Investigate the broader function of Ndrg1a and Ndrg3a in hypoxia adaptation;
(3) Determine whether lactate is necessary and sufficient to prime cells for anoxia survival.
 In addition to these research goals, the PI will leverage the University of Maryland Baltimore County's
outstanding commitment to Inclusive Excellence and her own position as the Director of the Graduate
Research Training Initiative for Student Enhancement (G-RISE) Program to enhance the recruitment and
retention of PhD students from historically underrepresented (HUR) groups at UMBC and will train HUR
students at all levels in hypoxia research in her laboratory. These students will be an integral part of her
research group; will work on independent projects and author publications."

There is an urgent need to improve the efficacy of chemoradiation therapy for patients with locally advanced
cancers. Since unrepaired DNA double strand breaks (DSB) are the primary lesions responsible for the
therapeutic efficacy of chemoradiation therapy, targeting cellular DNA damage response (DDR) pathways to
prevent efficient DNA repair is a promising approach to enhance the efficacy of chemoradiation therapy. Defects
in the DDR occur in a majority of cancers, suggesting targeted inhibition of the DDR would also provide an
opportunity to selectively enhance sensitivity to chemoradiation in tumor compared to normal cells. Furthermore,
our recent data demonstrate that DDR inhibition synergizes with radiation to confer sensitivity to immune
checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. My training in cancer and radiation biology and pharmacology as well as my
collaborations with Dr. Ted Lawrence and other physician-scientists at the University of Michigan make me
uniquely well-qualified to develop innovative therapies combining DDR inhibitors, ICB and radiation. My effort is
currently funded by U01 CA2166449 entitled, “Sensitization to chemoradiation by therapeutic targeting of the
DNA damage response.” The overall goals of this project are to 1) evaluate DDR inhibitory drugs for their ability
to modulate the cellular response to radiation-induced DNA damage and sensitize tumor cells to standard of
care chemoradiation therapy 2) develop viable biomarkers for target engagement and/or therapeutic response
and 3) translate our preclinical findings to rationally-designed clinical trials. As my research focus has evolved
from antimetabolite-induced cell cycle checkpoints to targeted inhibition of DNA repair pathways, exploitation of
replication stress and most recently anti-tumor immunotherapy, I have mastered a wide variety of state-of-the-
art methodologies that have allowed me to critically assess the key determinants of therapeutic response
including: flow cytometry and sorting for single cell protein analysis; confocal microscopy to track protein
activation and localization at sites of DNA DSBs; immunohistochemistry to verify pharmacodynamic target
inhibition in skin biopsies; DNA fiber combing to assess replication stress; and patient-derived xenograft based
models of tumor response including their treatment with CT and bioluminescence image-guided conformal
radiation. Furthermore, I am adept at developing complementary genetic and pharmacological models to critically
assess the relative contributions of modulation of the DDR to therapeutic response and translating those results
to the development of viable biomarkers for both target engagement and therapeutic efficacy as evidenced by
our recently completed clinical trial. This award will enable me to continue the preclinical development of DDR
inhibitors and ICB in combination with radiation therapy that will inform future clinic trials for patients with locally
advanced cancers."

People living with HIV (PLWH) on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) still suffer from HIV-associated non-AIDS
complication (HANA) such as neurocognitive disorders. Although chronic inflammation has been thought to be
the driver of HANA, what causes chronic immune activation in PLWH on ART remains unclear. Despite
successful ART, cell-associated HIV RNA has been detected in peripheral and tissues in PLWH on ART. We
have demonstrated that cytoplasmic expression of HIV intron-containing RNAs, even those from defective HIV
proviruses, induce pro-inflammatory responses in primary human macrophages including brain-resident
microglia. Since the current ART regimens cannot prevent expression of HIV RNA, it is plausible that persistent
HIV RNA expression in infected cells contributes to chronic inflammation in PLWH on ART. In fact, we have
found in our cohort that there is a correlation between the expression level of cell-associated HIV RNA and the
degree of systemic inflammation, supporting our hypothesis that cell-associated HIV RNA drives innate immune
activation. However, the molecular mechanism that makes HIV RNA immunostimulatory remains unclear.
Increasing lines of evidence have suggested that post-transcriptional base modification of viral RNA plays a role
in HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, our preliminary data demonstrate that (1) there is a link between HIV RNA
stability and its immunostimulatory potential, (2) HIV RNA has a different RNA modification landscape compared
to a non-immunostimulatory HIV mutant RNA, and (3) RNA modification reading proteins (RNA “readers”) play
an important role in innate immune activation in HIV-infected monocyte-derived macrophages. Therefore, we
hypothesize that the interaction of unique modified bases on HIV RNA and “proinflammatory” RNA
readers makes HIV RNA stable and immunostimulatory, which contributes to chronic inflammation in
PLWH on ART. To test this hypothesis, in this proposal, we will determine the role of HIV RNA modifications in
chronic inflammation in PLWH on ART. Specifically, we will identify the molecular mechanisms that link
“proinflammatory” RNA readers to innate immune activation in HIV-infected macrophages. In addition, we will
identify HIV RNA modifications which are associated with innate immune activation using nanopore direct RNA
sequencing. Moreover, we will identify the unique RNA modification landscape associated with inflammation in
PLWH on ART in our cohort at Boston Medical Center. Then, we will develop strategies to alter proinflammatory
RNA modification landscape to reduce HIV RNA-induced inflammation in PLWH on ART. Through this work, we
expect to better understand the role of post-transcriptional modifications of HIV RNA in innate immune responses
and to develop strategies to prevent proinflammatory HIV RNA modifications. This would ultimately allow us to
develop novel therapeutics as adjunct therapy to ART to dampen chronic inflammation in PLWH and reduce the
risk for HANA."

Estuaries are dynamic environments in which the variability of abiotic and biotic factors support highly diverse
microbial communities in sediments, including seagrass rhizospheres. A high likelihood of chemically mediated
interactions in these complex, competitive communities makes estuaries an exciting potential source of new
biologically active compounds. New pharmaceuticals are needed to combat drug resistance in the treatment of
infectious and chronic diseases. Compounds targeting the protein secretory pathway at the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) display potent anticancer, antiviral, and antibacterial activities. Within this Sec61 translocon -
mediated pathway, protein chaperone GRP78 is emerging as a potential druggable target with inhibitors showing
efficacy against drug resistant cancers and viral and bacterial infection. Environmental sampling of sediments
provides access to metabolites from complex microbial communities, for investigating both their role in the
environment and potential biomedical relevance. Solid phase adsorbent resin samplers have been used
extensively to monitor toxins from harmful algal blooms and have recently begun to be applied to the detection
of natural products in marine sediments. The central hypothesis of this project is that microbial communities in
estuarine sediments are valuable sources of novel bioactive NPs, with potential for the treatment and
management of human disease, that may be accessed by in situ environmental sampling using adsorption
resins. Sediments in eelgrass beds and nearby unvegetated areas across an estuarine gradient in Oregon will
be sampled both by deploying adsorbent resin samplers and collecting small sediment scoops (Aim 1). The
adsorbent resin samplers facilitate direct sampling of sediment metabolites from the environment for chemical
and biological characterization. The sediment scoops enable parallel 16S rRNA microbial community analysis
and comparison of metabolites obtained by solvent extraction of sediment versus adsorbent resin. High
resolution LC-MS/MS and computational tools will be used to identify trends in metabolite production at sampling
sites with and without eelgrass and support biological assays (Aim 2) in prioritization of samples for further
investigation of new bioactive natural products. In Aim 2, a high-throughput magnetic microbead affinity selection
screening assay (MagMASS) will be used to identify ligands of GRP78 from the complex mixtures in sediment
extracts. When possible, hits identified in this assay will be verified using a cellular thermal shift assay to test
GRP78 binding in cells. Extracts will additionally be screened against a panel of bacterial and fungal pathogens
and bioactive components of complex mixtures will be predicted using computational methods (NPAnalyst). In
Aim 3, laboratory culturing of stabilized microbial communities from estuarine sediments and monocultures of
putative natural product producers will assist in linking natural products to their microbial producers and facilitate
resupply of prioritized natural products for comprehensive chemical characterization and advanced biological
testing."
10904443,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The nervous system of most bilaterian animals consists of two classes of cells, neurons and glia, each of which
comprised of many different types. While great strides have been made in understanding the gene regulatory
mechanisms that specify the fate and identity of distinct neuronal cell types, comparatively little is known about
how glia cell types differentiate into distinct types and subtypes and how their differentiated state is maintained
throughout the life of the animal.
The restricted size and complexity of the nervous system of C. elegans has enabled the discovery of broad,
overarching organizational themes of neuronal cell fate specification. Specifically, we have recently described
that all neuronal cell types of the worm are uniquely defined by neuron type-specific combinations of
homeodomain protein expression and, consequently, that the vast majority, if not all, neuronal cell types require
homeodomain proteins for their proper identity fate specification. Moreover, most homeodomain proteins work
as master-regulatory terminal selectors to coregulate the many distinct identity features of a given neuron types.
In this grant proposal, we set out to test the hypothesis that similar gene regulatory principles operate to specify
the identity and diversity of the complete set of 17 distinct glial cell types in C. elegans. Leveraging the unique
opportunities offered by the C. elegans model system, we ask whether each of the 17 distinct glial cell types of
the C. elegans hermaphrodite is uniquely defined by a glial-type specific signatures of homeodomain proteins.
Using rigorous loss of function analysis, in combination with gain of function analysis, we will ask whether
homeodomain proteins operate in a master regulatory-type manner to specify the fate of all the distinct glial cell
type of C. elegans. Lastly, we will integrate the function of homeodomain proteins with potential pan-glia
regulators of glial fate specification.
This approach presents the first nervous system-wide view of glia cell fate specification, potentially carving out
general regulatory principles about glial identity specification and maintenance. Our analysis may provide
insights into potential evolutionary trajectories of glial cell type specification and may reveal candidates for
future functional analysis in the vertebrate system."
10906230,"Project Abstract:
Over 95,000 people will die this year in the United States from excessive alcohol use and misuse (AU/M).
Although alcohol is the substance most commonly used by teens, sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY)
are more likely to engage in early and excessive AU/M than heterosexual and cisgender youth, placing them at
greater risk for AU/M across the life course. The persistence of these disparities over the past several decades
indicates an urgent need for research identifying critical periods for prevention. Yet, there remain pressing
questions regarding the onset, progression, and mutable mechanisms that contribute to SGM-related
disparities in AU/M during adolescence. The objective of the proposed research is twofold. First, I aim to
examine developmental trends of AU/M across groups of youth defined by sexual orientation, gender identity,
and race/ethnicity. Second, I will explore how normative mechanisms of alcohol use (e.g., social norms, peer
influence) coincide and coexist with SGM-specific experiences (e.g., stigma) to influence SGMY alcohol use.
The project will leverage the California Healthy Kids Survey, a unique population-based data source of more
than one million adolescents, and primary mixed methods data collection to complete the following research
aims: (Aim 1.1) Estimate developmental trends in the prevalence of AU/M across groups defined by (1.1a)
sexual orientation, gender identity and (1.1b) the intersections of these identities with race/ethnicity; (Aim 1.2)
Examine the extent to which bias-based bullying and perceived harm of alcohol use attenuate differences in
developmental trends of AU/M across groups defined by (1.2a) sexual orientation, gender identity and (1.2b)
the intersections of these identities with race/ethnicity; and (2) Explore how SGM-specific and normative
adolescent factors collectively shape AU/M among SGMY. To accomplish these goals, I require additional
training in SGM-specific and developmentally typical mechanisms of AU/M disparities, and complex
quantitative and mixed methods approaches to investigating SGMY’s AU/M. The training plan combines
tailored mentorship from sponsors and consultants with formal coursework and training seminars to provide me
with the skills, resources, and mentorship needed to reach my long-term goal of becoming an independent
researcher focused on understanding and eliminating AU/M inequities among SGMY. Elucidating the interplay
of normative adolescent and SGMY-specific stressors implicated in SGMY AU/M will allow me to develop
future research that contributes to developmentally appropriate and culturally relevant interventions to interrupt
AU/M pathways and support resiliency in SGMY."
10906388,"ABSTRACT. The parent project is an exploratory-sequential mixed methods study to document the nature of
daily variation in acute perceived discrimination-related stress among adults from Black, Indigenous and People
of Color (BIPOC) communities that have been historically impacted by structural and social inequities. We aim
to examine how these variations influence poly-substance use (PSU) among BIPOC minoritized adults, with an
emphasis on evaluating momentary predictors of resilience to stress. PSU carries elevated risks of addiction and
is associated with negative health outcomes and greater comorbidity than single-substance use. This is a highly
timely study because the extent to which these processes of stress and PSU are at post-pandemic, and how
they coincide with poignant events involving modern displays of overt racism and discrimination, then perpetuate
and aggravate addiction-related disparities is unknown. The parent grant focuses on African American, Latinx
American and Asian American adults who co-use combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes, marijuana and/or alcohol
(i.e., PSU), to inform context-sensitive EMA, refined during a qualitative study phase. Subsequently, an
independent sample of BIPOC adults who co-use 2+ substances (N=270) will complete 7-day EMA over 4 waves
to assess time-varying contexts relevant to the experience of discrimination associated with daily variation in
PSU. Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (NH/PI) are an understudied NIH health disparity population deeply
impacted by cultural trauma and negative social and economic factors that contribute to severe substance use
disparities. Recruiting and analyzing a unique sample of NH/PI adults will strengthen the aims of the parent study
by capturing unique aspects of discrimination that adversely affect individuals with various aspects of minoritized
identities and its relation to PSU among NH/PI. Guided by leading NIH experts in NH/PI substance use
disparities, in Aim 1, we will use 2-3 focus groups (FGs; N~20) to better understand the experience of
discrimination, cultural trauma, and coping resources in the context of intersectionality of race/ethnicity and
gender in relation to PSU to inform context-sensitive EMA, refined during a pilot EMA phase. In Aim 2, an
independent sample of NH/PI adults who co-use 2+ substances (N=25) will be recruited through intensive
community-led efforts and targeted digital ads, and will complete 7-day EMA every 3 months over 4 waves to
determine the within-person effects of perceived discrimination and cultural trauma on PSU and identify the
underlying mechanisms. IMPACT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-wave EMA study that uses
a social-ecological framework and a novel, culturally appropriate, real-time assessment design to determine the
impact of day-to-day discrimination and PSU in NH/PI adults. We expect our study to uncover micro-temporal
etiologies of PSU disparities across NH/PI adults that will inform future targeted interventions to ameliorate the
effects of cultural trauma and acute perceived discrimination on PSU and reduce addiction-related burdens
disproportionately affecting NH/PI, an urgent aspect of post-pandemic recovery."
10902723,"UNCOVERING THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF VEGFA AND ANG2 PRO-ANGIOGENIC SIGNALING IN HEREDITARY
HEMORRHAGIC TELANGIECTASIA
Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare genetic vascular disease with no cure. HHT is
characterized by abnormalities in blood vessels that occur in mucocutaneous tissues (telangiectasias) and deep
tissues (arteriovenous malformations, AVMs). The tangled, enlarged, fragile and aberrant vasculature in HHT
patients is prone to sudden or chronic bleeding. Sudden hemorrhaging of AVMs in brain, lungs or liver may
cause serious complications and even death. While diagnosed AVMs can be surgically treated, there are no
FDA approved drugs to prevent or manage them. Developing therapeutics to manage AVMs has been especially
challenging as the mechanism of AVM formation is not clearly understood. Increased VEGF-VEGFR2 and
ANG2–TIE2 pro-angiogenic signaling pathways have been indicated in abnormal vascular malformation in HHT.
Both signaling cascades have been separately inhibited to demonstrate beneficial effects in HHT mouse models.
Furthermore, VEGFA inhibitor—Bevacizumab—has been semi-successfully used to manage chronic nose
bleeds in HHT patients. Although unknown in HHT, there have been reports of these signaling pathways working
in concordance in other vascular pathologies. Thus, my working hypothesis is that dual VEGFA-ANG2 inhibition
will have a superior beneficial effect on AVM suppression compared to monotherapies in HHT. To test this
hypothesis, my proposed central aim is to evaluate the molecular effectiveness of a dual inhibitor over
individual inhibition in normalizing vascular malformations in an HHT mouse model. I will utilize a
bispecific VEGFA-ANG2 inhibitor, VEGFA inhibitor and ANG2 inhibitor in a comparison study focused on the
Smad4 HHT mouse model. I will begin by determining minimal effective dosage of each inhibitor that normalizes
VEGFA and ANG2 levels postnatally after Smad4 deletion. Next, I will comprehensively assess surface and
whole brain vasculature, as well as retinal blood vessels, to compare phenotypic effects of each inhibitor via
vascular latex casting, light sheet microscopy and immunofluorescent staining methods. Lastly, I will investigate
transcriptomic and molecular changes and determine the potential role of various downstream signaling
pathways. Overall, this study will further the mechanistic understanding of AVM development and explore
potential therapeutic options for HHT treatment. This project will also advance my scientific training goals as the
Principal Investigator, with focus on improving my breadth of scientific knowledge, approach to study design and
project management, and building mastery of key technical skills. As a trainee, I will also further my experience
in various ways of scientific communication, including presenting at conferences and manuscript writing. I will
benefit from the mentorship of a highly experienced sponsor and extensive resources at a prestigious research
University."
10903109,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), remains the leading cause of death
amongst infectious causes. While we have made progress reducing TB mortality, disease burden has stagnated
due to our inability to reduce the incidence rate of TB. This can be attributed to our lack of transmission blocking
interventions and the highly infectious nature of Mtb’ s aerosol transmission. Aerosolization represents an
essential physiologic process for Mtb’ s transmission and infectious life cycle that can be targeted to reduce TB
transmission and incidence. Mtb has likely evolved an adaptive response to the dramatic microenvironment
changes it experiences as it transitions from the nutrient-rich lung to the desolate atmosphere. The specific
genes and metabolic pathways that Mtb employs to navigate these changes are poorly understood. In the aerosol
droplet environment, Mtb is deprived of CO2 and nitrogen sources which provide the carbon and nitrogen building
blocks on which Mtb relies for biosynthetic processes. My project seeks to understand metabolic mechanisms
underlying Mtb’ s response to CO2 and nitrogen deprivation. Preliminary data from our lab has identified arginine
biosynthesis as a key metabolic pathway mediating Mtb’ s response to CO2 limitation. I propose that arginine
biosynthesis mediates Mtb survival in the CO2 and nitrogen limited aerosol droplet environment, by maintaining
a steady flux of carbamoyl phosphate, thermodynamically activated and short-lived essential intermediate. In
this model, I propose that arginine biosynthesis is configured as a cycle mediated by ArcA or Rv2323c, a currently
uncharacterized protein which I hypothesize to act as an arginine dihydrolase. Through this configuration,
arginine biosynthesis couples NH4+ regeneration in ArcA or Rv2323c catalysis with the oxidative production of
CO2 in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. I hypothesize that Mtb can regulate between Rv2323c and ArcA based
on nutrient availability. I predict that Mtb preferentially uses ArcA during CO2 and nitrogen limitation, since ArcA
can mediate an arginine cycle without consuming CO2 and NH4+ equivalents. I will test this hypothesis with three
Aims. In Aim 1, I will identify the biochemical role of Rv2323c in arginine metabolism through in vitro and in vivo
characterization of Rv2323c’s catalytic activity and physiologic function. In Aim 2, I will characterize the roles of
ArcA and Rv2323c in CO2 limited environments and measure their contributions to the endogenous pool of CO2
and impact on Mtb survival in air. In Aim 3, I will characterize the role of ArcA and Rv2323c in nitrogen limited
environments by determining Mtb’ s preference for either enzyme in these conditions and their impact on Mtb’ s
survival. These approaches will reveal novel insights into Mtb’ s adaptive response to aerosolization with the
potential of identifying therapeutic targets to block Mtb transmission."
10903188,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Allosteric enzymes govern many metabolic and regulatory processes. Their regulation is modulated by the
binding of an effector molecule to a site distal to their active site, inducing a conformational change that alters
their activity. As such, the dysregulation of allosteric enzymes can cause metabolic disorders and
cancer. However, despite its importance and ubiquity in biological processes, general mechanisms for protein
allostery are poorly understood, and no single approach typically provides sufficient structural and energetic
information to describe allosteric conformational changes in full molecular detail for most enzymes.
Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) is a broadly conserved, allosterically regulated glycolytic enzyme. PFK-1
effectors elicit subtle conformational changes in the protein’s ensemble and oligomer state that
modulate its activity. Cancer-associated somatic mutations in PFK-1 have been identified across the length of
protein and in a wide range of cancer types. Altered PFK-1 allostery from somatic mutations and post
translational-modifications has been shown to play a role in metabolic re-programming in cancer, making PFK-
1 an attractive therapeutic target. However, due to human PFK-1’s (hPFK) complex combinatorial regulation by
~20 effectors, for which few binding sites are known, structural data are insufficient for understanding shifts in
hPFK’s conformational ensemble upon allosteric effector binding. This complex combinatorial regulation cannot
be explained by a simple phenomenological model of allostery. A deeper understanding of hPFK’s ensemble
regulation is necessary to determine how disease-associated mutations disrupt its allostery to drive disease
phenotypes. A complete picture of the mechanism and evolution of combinatorial ligand regulation in hPFK will
enable the rational design of allosteric therapeutics to specifically target this and other conserved, essential
enzymes traditionally considered to be “undruggable”.
In this proposal, I will train in multidisciplinary techniques, combining computational protein design, molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, traditional biochemistry, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange with mass
spectrometry (HDX/MS) to 1) discover the molecular basis for allosteric ligand regulation in hPFK, 2) map the
evolution of allosteric ligand regulation in PFK-1 from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and 3) design a peptide
antibiotic that specifically inhibits multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli PFK-1. Our approach to discover the
molecular details of PFK-1 effector regulation will enable future discoveries of how long-range allostery is
encoded in other oligomeric enzymes. This work will deepen our understanding of the role of allosteric
conformational changes to tune protein function in healthy and disease states."

Child maltreatment (CM) affects at least one in every seven U.S. children each year and has been recognized
as a major public and global health issue. Children who have experienced any form of CM are more likely to
manifest adverse mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, and substance use. CM is a
preventable, multidimensional risk factor for psychopathology, and research aimed at better understanding the
underlying mechanisms of these risk processes is a critical need. Researchers note the lack of clarity
surrounding this heterogeneity in mental health sequelae of CM and highlight the urgent need for additional
investigations to elucidate mechanisms of effect. Neurocognitive research mapping of structural brain
development can help identify mechanisms of the relation between CM and negative mental health outcomes.
Currently, it is unknown how CM subtypes (i.e., physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, and neglect) might
differentially affect neurodevelopmental trajectories and how these trajectories might explain subsequent
mental health outcomes.
This project focuses on the hippocampus, the most stress-sensitive brain structure, during the critical
neurodevelopmental period of adolescence. Past research on youth hippocampal volume following exposure to
adversity has produced mixed findings. This application posits that these inconsistent findings reflect the
existence of multiple trajectories and CM subtype-based differences that have not been accounted for in
previous work. The goal of this study is to examine neurodevelopmental trajectories of the hippocampus, with
attention given to the distinct role CM subtype may have, and ascertain if those trajectories act as a
mechanistic explanation for anxiety, depression, and substance use following CM. Secondary data analysis of
the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, an ongoing, multi-site, longitudinal investigation of
brain development and mental health of nearly 12,000 U.S. youth, will be used to address this goal through two
aims: (1) Identify trajectories in adolescent hippocampal development, as a function of different CM exposures,
using multilevel linear modeling, (2) Investigate the mediating role of brain development on adolescents’
mental health outcomes following CM. Findings will shed light on addressing vulnerability to psychopathology
following CM, specific to subtypes. With this knowledge, interventions and treatments could be better
customized to target the cognitions, processes, and skills associated with specific neurocognitive structures
known to underpin psychiatric sequelae of CM. This project aligns with priorities and the strategic plan of both
NIMH and NICHD’s PTCIB. Data analysis and interpretation of this project will confer essential skills needed
for a career as an independent research scientist at the intersection of developmental cognitive neuroscience
and CM. The funding of this project will result in a more innovative, rigorous, and effective CM researcher."

Tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of many cell types that co-exist to promote tumor progression. Most
cancer therapeutics are designed to target one molecule in one defined cell type. For example, vemurafenib
(BRAF inhibitor) kills melanoma cells through targeting mutated BRAF; whereas pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1
antibody) blocks PD-1 on T cells, re-activating anti-tumor immunity. Our overarching goal is to identify targetable
molecules/pathways that are critical for multiple cell types within the TME. Using the published single cell
RNAseq (scRNAseq) datasets, we searched for these molecules/pathways meeting the following criteria: 1) they
should have important functions in cancer cells and immune suppressive cell types such as regulatory T cells
(Tregs), exhausted T cells (Texh), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) etc.; 2) they are not important
for effector function of major immune cells such as effect T cells (CD4+ or CD8+ Teff) or nature killer cells (NK);
3) they should be targetable with known inhibitors. NR4A1 fits all 3 criteria and represents a valid target for
cancer immunotherapy. In the current proposal, we intend to use proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC)
technology to develop a first-of-its-kind NR4A1 degrader for melanoma therapy. Aim 1. Rational design of novel
celastrol-based NR4A1-Ps by modifying celastrol and linkers. Aim 2. Determine cellular and molecular
mechanisms by which NR4A1-Ps work to inhibit melanoma. Aim 3. Explore the therapeutic potential of NR4A1-
Ps as a single agent or in combination. The outcome is to define the rationale for the future clinical translation of
NR4A1-Ps to enhance ICI therapy responses in melanoma."
10903120,"Abnormal GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in the cognitive
and emotional disturbances present in schizophrenia and mood disorders. Two key PFC areas that exhibit
altered activity in neuropsychiatric disorders are the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the medial prefrontal
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which have distinct temporal patterns of activation and roles in executive function
and cognitive control. Neurochemically diverse inhibitory interneurons (INs) mediate inhibition in the cortex and
target specific somatodendritic compartments of pyramidal (PYR) cells, differentially modulating cortical activity.
While somatic inhibition from parvalbumin INs has a well-characterized role in the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia, emerging evidence suggests that decreased dendritic inhibition and altered GABAAR
composition in the PFC are also associated with schizophrenia and mood disorders. However, the properties of
dendritic inhibition on PYR cells across diverse LPFC and ACC areas and layers, and its contribution to
oscillations has not yet been elucidated. Thus, our overall objective with this proposal is to compare the spatial
distribution, kinetics, and synaptic physiology of dendritic inhibition on PYR cell dendrites in the ACC and LPFC
of rhesus macaques, an ideal model organism for studying the primate PFC. Our central hypothesis is that
greater dendritic inhibition and slower inhibitory current kinetics are associated with slower oscillatory dynamics
in the ACC relative to the LPFC. This would reveal a cellular and subcellular mechanism by which diverse laminar
network activity emerges in the PFC and suggest points of intervention to treat altered PFC activity observed in
cognitive and psychiatric disorders. In Aim 1, we will study inhibitory postsynaptic currents in PYR cells in the
rhesus macaque ACC and LPFC via ex vivo whole-cell patch clamp recordings, along with dendritic calcium
imaging via intracellular filling with calcium indicator dye to study subcellular calcium dynamics associated with
compartment-specific inhibition. In these experiments, will study the effect of pharmacologically blocking
GABAARs containing the α5 subunit. We will additionally perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) and confocal
imaging on these electrophysiologically-characterized PYR cells to compare the subcellular distribution of IN-
labeled inhibitory appositions between areas. In Aim 2, we will compare local field potentials (LFPs) and spike-
field coupling between putative INs and LFPs across cortical layers via acute in vivo laminar recordings in the
ACC and LPFC. We will also use IHC and confocal imaging to compare the laminar distribution of IN appositions
onto PYR cells in ACC and LPFC subregions along the medio-lateral axis. We will assess relationships between
in vivo functional and tissue-based structural laminar parameters using a biophysical PYR-IN-network model and
test how dendritic-targeting INs and synapses affect population rhythm generation. These experiments will shed
vitally needed insight on the mechanisms of differential susceptibility of these areas to network disruption,
potentially aiding diagnosis and treatment of cognitive-affective disorders."

With an aging population, the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on public health continues to explode.
Altered daily rhythms in physiology and behavior are prominent features of AD. These altered activity rhythms
are difficult to treat, disrupting the lives of both patients and caregivers. Mounting evidence suggests that these
changes are more than just symptoms. Altered rhythms may contribute to AD progression and development.
Many important transcripts, proteins, and metabolites oscillate with a daily cycle. Understanding these
rhythms, and their influence on AD, offers the potential to identify new therapies.
The translation of circadian biology to Alzheimer's care is limited. Which molecules and pathways show daily
rhythms in our human brains? How do those rhythms change with AD? Do changes in molecular rhythms
explain changing behavioral patterns? Can these rhythms be exploited for therapeutic benefit?
To answer clinical questions, we need human data. AD brain banks provide an invaluable resource. But brain
banks almost never provide the time of day when patients died, making it difficult to use these data for rhythms
research.
We developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure), a machine-learning tool to uncover
molecular rhythms using unordered biopsy samples. Evaluating brain expression data, we showed that
CYCLOPS could correctly reconstruct rhythms in brain samples and correctly predict the time of death.
Here we will order cortical brain samples from control subjects and patients with AD. We will reconstruct the
molecular rhythms in these human brains, identifying differences in AD patients and rhythms in known drug
targets and AD disease pathways.
We will analyze a subset of samples where time of death is known, comparing each subject's “internal
molecular time” with the “time on the clock.” We will test the hypothesis that patients with poorly aligned
molecular rhythms are more likely to have circadian behavioral disturbance. We will evaluate a measure of
transcriptional rhythm strength, testing if “weaker” rhythms predict behavioral or molecular misalignment.
Does AD alter rhythm generation? Does it desynchronize still rhythmic cells and brain regions? Using data
from multiple brain regions sampled from the same subjects, we will evaluate intracortical circadian synchrony
and compare AD patients with controls. Using single-nucleus sequencing data, we will explore the effect of AD
on cell type specific rhythms and their synchrony. Finally, we will test the direct influence of important AD
causing mutations on molecular clock function, measuring rhythms in isolated cells.
This work will advance our understanding of circadian rhythms in AD pathology, clarify the relationship
between behavioral and molecular circadian disruption, and catalyze opportunities for AD chronotherapy."

Texas A&M College of Medicine Developing and Readying Underrepresented Minority Researchers (DRUMR)
Summer Research Program
 Texas ranks 2nd behind California in the percentage of its minority population (55%) as well as in the
size of its Hispanic population (11.7 million as of 2017). Texas is also 2nd in terms of the size of its rural area,
only behind Alaska. Since NIDDK-related diseases affect minorities and rural populations at a significantly
greater rate, it is not surprising that Texas sits near the top for deaths (CDC). One important step to rectify
these disparities involves an increase in minority representation of Texas’ biomedical research workforce, such
that it more adequately reflects the state’s population diversity. This program will provide research
opportunities to the best minority undergraduate students of the Texas A&M University System.
 The Texas A&M University System is a statewide network of 11 university campuses with an enrollment
of over 152,000 students. Aside from the flagship campus located in College Station, the majority of students
at the other 10 campuses are mainly Hispanic, Black, disadvantaged, and/or underprivileged students from
mostly rural and remote areas of Texas. The Texas A&M’s College of Medicine (TAMCOM) Developing and
Readying Underrepresented Minority Researchers (DRUMR) Summer Research Program (SRP) will offer
disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students the opportunity to work with TAMCOM faculty in
Bryan/College Station on research projects in NIDDK-related biomedical research areas. This 10-week
program will also feature the nationally recognized Southwest Rural Health Research Center, 1 of only 7 in the
country, and the A&M Rural and Community Health Institute. The 50 total students, 1 from each of the 10 sister
schools each year for 5 years, will be selected by their institution based on eligibility, academics, and career
goals, and then matched with College of Medicine faculty mentors in Bryan/College Station based on their
NIDDK-related area of research interest.
 TAMCOM has been operating a SRP for 12 years and on average about 30% of participants each year
are underrepresented minorities or disadvantaged. Over this time, 78% of participants enter graduate and/or
medical school, which is higher than the 54% national average for other SRPs (National Science Foundation).
The overall objective of the TAMCOM DRUMR SRP is to prepare disadvantaged and underrepresented
Texas A&M University System students for careers in NIDDK-related biomedical research. The TAMCOM
DRUMR SRP has 3 aims: (1) Provide integrative training and mentoring to participants in NIDDK-related
biomedical research, (2) Provide laboratory skills to prepare participants for a career in biomedical research,
and (3) Develop a network of students (“DRUMRs”) that will increase the diversity of the biomedical research
workforce."

Arboviruses present a constant threat to human and animal health worldwide. They are transmitted by
hematophagous arthropods, primarily mosquitoes. One of them, Aedes aegypti, is the primary vector of several
widely spread arboviruses such as Zika, dengue and West Nile viruses, and for most of them, human-licensed
vaccines do not exist or are suboptimal. These pathogens are transmitted into the host skin together with saliva
during feeding. This saliva contains over one hundred unique proteins which can modulate many physiological
functions, facilitating blood feeding.
It has been shown that many salivary proteins enhance infectivity and pathogenesis of arboviruses by modulating
immune responses at the bite site. The development of blocking therapies against them could be a good
approach to reduce viral spread in the infected host. This approach may also overcome issues associated with
the use of viral antigens as a vaccine targets, due to their high variability or the possibility of induction of antibody-
dependent enhancement episodes.
In Phase I, a proof-of-principle has been established for a novel strategy of prophylaxis, targeting one salivary
protein secreted in A. aegypti saliva, AgBR1, in which passively and actively immunized immunocompromised
murine models were partially protected against Zika virus transmitted via mosquito bites. The degree of
protection correlated with the antibody titer reached in the immunized animals. However, the use of
immunocompromised models has some limitations, such as the weakness of the antibody response, a fact that
limits the maximum protection that can be achieved. In this Phase II application, we will define, optimize, and
validate a vaccination regimen.
We will circumvent the limitations of the immunocompromised animal model by conducting immunizations in
immunocompetent murine hosts. We will test the degree of protection achieved by transferring antibodies and/or
immune cells to immunocompromised mice, also studying the role of the cellular branch of the immune response
against ZIKV infection, as the cellular immune response against mosquito salivary antigens is poorly understood.
In addition, we will perform these vaccination studies in guinea pigs and hamsters, to demonstrate that a strong
immune response against AgBR1 can be elicited in species other than mice. We will develop a guinea pig and
a hamster model of Zika infection transmitted by A. aegypti mosquito bites, and we will test the immunization
efficacy of our vaccine candidates. Lastly, we will analyze the potential efficacy of our vaccine against other Zika-
related flaviviruses, such as DENV and WNV, with the aim to generate a pan-flaviviral vaccine candidate which
could be used alone or in conjunction with pathogen-specific vaccines."

Lung transplantation improves survival and quality-of-life for patients with end-stage lung disease. Primary graft
dysfunction (PGD) and acute lung allograft dysfunction (ALAD) are early and intermediate events, respectively,
that threaten the long-term benefits of transplantation and increase the chances of chronic lung allograft
dysfunction (CLAD)—the primary cause of long-term mortality among lung transplant recipients. Efforts to
improve patient outcomes have relied, in part, on the use of risk-stratification to guide clinical decisions in lung
transplantation. Specifically, the Lung Allocation Score (LAS) ranks transplant candidates based on the risk of
death within one year of being listed and the probability of survival one year after transplantation. The estimated
risk of PGD and ALAD may present additional opportunities for stratification. However, in order to predict PGD
or ALAD accurately, recipient and donor risk factors exhibiting a strong association with these outcomes must
be identified. Most clinical risk factors do not have sufficiently strong associations with PGD or ALAD to facilitate
improvements in prediction outcomes. Biomarkers with a mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of PGD or ALD
are likely to be the strongest predictors of these outcomes. Notably, a growing body of evidence shows that
exosomes—30-150nm diameter lipid bound extracellular vesicles—released from immune and non-immune
cells—modulate the immune response to antigens in a variety of diseases. Our team recently proposed a
conceptual framework for the role of exosomes in innate and adaptive immunity that predicts the development
of PGD, ALAD, and CLAD. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of measuring recipient-derived exosomes
in patients with end-stage lung diseases and preliminary data suggest an association between exosome
phenotypes and CLAD. However, it remains to be determined whether recipient-derived exosome phenotypes
are associated with PGD or ALAD, whether changes in exosome phenotype occur post-transplant and if so,
whether these changes increase the risk of ALAD. To address these knowledge gaps, we propose a three-year
prospective cohort study with one-year follow-up of lung transplant recipients with the following aims: 1)
Determine if recipient-derived exosome phenotypes are associated with PGD, 2) Determine if recipient-derived
exosome phenotypes are associated with ALAD, and 3) Determine if PGD alters exosome phenotype post-
transplant and/or the risk of ALAD. The ultimate goal of our research is to improve patient outcomes by
increasing knowledge of biomarkers that predict PGD and ALAD. Evidence of an association between recipient-
derived exosome phenotypes and PGD and ALAD accomplishes the first step of developing a risk-stratification
tool to better inform transplant recipient selection and donor matching, and to further guide immunosuppression
and other post-transplant management protocols. This line of investigation is also expected to enhance our
knowledge of exosome-mediated immunoregulation, providing novel insights into the role of exosomes in the
pathogenesis of PGD and ALAD and novel therapeutic targets for future investigation."

Diabetes is a global epidemic. Many patients with diabetes suffer from and die of heart disease or stroke. Diabetic
heart diseases include diabetic cardiomyopathy, obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), and coronary
microvascular disease (CMD, also known as non-obstructive CAD). Obstructive CAD is primarily caused by
narrowed vessels due to lipid plaque formation. In contrast, the mechanisms responsible for CMD are
microvascular rarefaction, attenuated vasodilatation, and vascular remodeling in small coronary arteries (CAs).
Coronary endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction leads to decreased capillary density in the heart and attenuated
endothelium-dependent relaxation in CAs, and diabetes causes endothelial dysfunction. However, there is no
specific treatment for coronary endothelial dysfunction in patients with diabetes. Our long-term goal is to define
the mechanisms of diabetes-associated coronary endothelial dysfunction and ultimately develop novel therapies
for CMD in diabetes. Milk fat globule epidermal growth factor (MFGE8) is a glycoprotein primarily secreted from
apoptotic cells and initially identified as an immune suppressor by assisting apoptotic cell clearance
(efferocytosis). MFGE8 is also capable of promoting angiogenesis and facilitating macrophage reprogramming.
MFGE8 administration exerts beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease, including anti-inflammation, tissue
repairing, and compensated cardiac hypertrophy; however, the role of MFGE8 in coronary endothelial
dysfunction and CMD in diabetes has never been investigated. The objective of this study is to examine
whether and how MFGE8 improves CMD in diabetes. Our preliminary data show that i) cardiac ECs from diabetic
mice and diabetic patients displayed lower MFGE8 levels than their controls, ii) Mfge8-/- mice exhibited reduced
coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR), iii) inhibition of MFGE8 attenuated endothelium-dependent relaxation in
CAs and endothelial migration, iv) chronic administration of MFGE8 in diabetic mice improved CFVR
accompanied with increased capillary density in the heart, v) macrophages enabled to engulf apoptotic ECs ex
vivo, and MFGE8 pretreatment increased macrophage efferocytosis of ECs, and vi) MFGE8 administration in
diabetic mice facilitated reprogramming of macrophages to an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Based on these
data, we hypothesize that MFGE8 administration is a novel therapeutic strategy in diabetic patients with CMD
by improving coronary endothelial function and enhancing macrophage engulfment of apoptotic ECs in the heart
where MFGE8 level is reduced in coronary ECs. Three Specific Aims are proposed to test our novel hypothesis:
1) to define the role of MFGE8 in coronary endothelial dysfunction and CMD in diabetic mice, 2) to determine
the molecular mechanisms by which MFGE8 regulates coronary endothelial function in diabetes, and 3) to
investigate the role of MFGE8-mediated macrophage efferocytosis of coronary ECs in endothelial dysfunction in
diabetes. Completion of this study will provide important insights into the development of new and effective
therapeutic interventions for CMD in diabetes."

The National HIV Strategy encourages expansion of HIV testing to community health settings, emphasizing it is
critical that all people, particularly high incidence groups like people who inject drugs (PWID), know their HIV
status for rapid initiation of HIV treatment or potential initiation of PrEP. Despite recommendations from CDC
that PWID be tested for HIV every year, only 55% report receiving an HIV test in the previous 12 months. Injection
drug use (IDU) continues to be a leading cause of HIV infection and PWID remain a high priority population
under Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) with 11% of new HIV infections and 66% acute HCV infections attributable
to IDU in 2020. In recent years, there has been a national increase in IDU-associated HIV and hepatitis C (HCV)
outbreaks, driven primarily by the ongoing overdose crisis, creating an obstacle to meeting EHE goals. While
the majority (87%) of syringe services programs (SSPs) offer HIV testing, it is estimated that participant-level
uptake is only 17%, highlighting a significant practice gap regarding how and under what conditions SSPs are
offering HIV testing. SSPs face a myriad of organizational-level barriers to implementing HIV testing, such as
lack of financial resources, lack of training on best practices, staff turnover, and organizational capacity/policies.
Our team developed, refined, and pilot tested the ACCESS implementation strategy—a multicomponent, multi-
phase, organizational-level intervention focused on improving the SSP organizational capacity to implement
HIV/HCV testing best practices through funding and practice facilitation. We propose a hybrid Type II
effectiveness-implementation cluster randomized trial of 32 SSPs. We will create a cross-sector implementation
team to facilitate the ACCESS implementation strategy in EHE jurisdictions and locales with increased
vulnerability to HIV outbreaks. Selected SSPs will then be randomized to receive the ACCESS strategy (i.e.,
funding and peer external facilitation), or an information control condition that contains a link to the CDC
Compendium website and information regarding nationally available resources to support implementation. The
primary outcome of the study will be HIV/HCV testing reach during the intervention period (12 months) compared
to control sites. The aims of the study are: 1a) to evaluate the effectiveness of the ACCESS strategy on
participant-level uptake of HIV/HCV testing across 12 months; 1b) to examine the effect of routine opt-out
HIV/HCV testing on equitable HIV/HCV testing uptake and diagnosis across 12 months; 2) to examine the
effectiveness of our ACCESS implementation strategy on site-level adoption of opt-out testing and
implementation fidelity; 3) to assess the cost-effectiveness of the ACCESS strategy in increasing uptake of
HIV/HCV testing; and 4) to examine the sustainability of opt-out HIV/HCV testing at SSPs across 24 month
follow-up. The cost-effectiveness analysis and mixed-methods implementation evaluation will provide compelling
data on the impact of our ACCESS strategy on scaling-up routine opt-out HIV/HCV testing at SSPs. Leveraging
the critical role of SSPs, the ACCESS strategy has the potential to make EHE an attainable reality for PWID."

In response to RFA-DA-22-037: Accelerating the Pace of Drug Abuse Research Using Existing Data, this
competing continuation (renewal) ""Trajectories of Nonmedical Prescription Drug Misuse"" builds on our
prior R01 and will combine national panel data with other national data sources (eg, death records) to
assess longitudinal relationships among trajectories of medical use of prescription drugs, nonmedical
prescription drug misuse (PDM), other drug use, polysubstance use (PSU), substance use disorder (SUD)
symptoms, drug overdose death, and all-cause mortality from adolescence up to older adulthood. This renewal
will focus on prescription opioids, sedatives/tranquilizers, and stimulants because most US adults are
prescribed these medications over their lifespan, all have high misuse potential, and there have been important
changes in the prescribing of these medications (eg, major increases in opioid prescribing from 1990 to 2010
followed by sharp declines and major increases in stimulant therapy among US middle-aged and older adults).
Prospective studies are needed to examine whether the discontinuation, initiation, or developmental timing of
medical use of prescription drugs are associated with increased adverse consequences. US drug overdose
deaths reached an all-time high in 2021, and most are PSU-involved. An important literature gap, as over 90%
of PDM is PSU-involved, is the lack of national studies examining the longitudinal relationships between
trajectories of medical use of prescription drugs and PDM or other drug use. We propose secondary analyses
using the Monitoring the Future (MTF) panel data which features over 40 independent cohorts of 103,957 high
school seniors (modal age 18) who completed biennial follow-ups to ages 29-30 and follow-ups every five
years to age 60, resulting in up to 13 waves. The MTF panel data and other linked sources (eg, National Death
Index) provide a unique opportunity for innovative analysis to examine associations and risk/protective factors
from adolescence up to older adulthood. This renewal aims to: (1) identify the temporal ordering of medical use
of prescription opioids, sedatives/tranquilizers, and stimulants, and other drug use (eg, PDM) from
adolescence up to older adulthood (age 60); (2) examine longitudinal associations between trajectories of
medical use of prescription drugs, PDM and adverse consequences (eg, all-cause mortality, drug overdose
death, SUD symptoms) up to older adulthood; (3) assess if adults who discontinue or initiate medical use of
prescription opioids, sedatives/ tranquilizers, or stimulants are more likely to transition to PDM and adverse
consequences; and (4) determine the individual, relationship, community, and societal, risk and protective
factors of high-risk trajectories of medical use of prescription drugs and PDM using a developmental social-
ecological model. For all aims, we will examine variations by age, cohort, sex, race/ethnicity, and education.
The findings have important and timely implications for clinical, research, policy, and public health domains."

While there have been significant gains in malaria control, mainly focusing on Plasmodium
falciparum (Pf), Plasmodium vivax (Pv) has been expanding to fix the niche left behind. This
phenomenon could be due to the formation of dormant liver forms, called hypnozites,
sequestration in extravascular spaces, and early mosquito transmission of sexual staged
parasites. Pv was thought to be absent from Africa due to the high prevalence of Duffy-
negativity, an antigen on human erythrocytes that was thought to be required for Pv infection.
There has been a paradigm shift in this belief due to multiple reports of Duffy-negative invasion
throughout the African continent. Despite these reports, there has not been a definitive invasion
pathway identified for Pv that facilitates Duffy-negative invasion. This proposal aims to support a
promising MD/PhD student's career development and scientifically help us understand the
mechanisms that govern Pv Duffy negative invasion through a dual in vitro and in vivo
approach, utilizing cutting edge genomics and computational tools to understand the molecular
mechanisms of Duffy-negative invasion at the single cell level. By investigating Pv invasion
utilizing an in vitro model inhibited by invasion blocking monoclonal antibodies, a novel line of
Plasmodium knowlesi that can invade Duffy-negative erythrocytes, and single cell RNA
sequencing (scRNAseq) (Aim 1), we will identify invasion pathways that are upregulated to
facilitate alternative invasion pathways at the level of the malaria cell cycle stage. We will
validate these pathways through isolating Pv samples from an ongoing study in Duffy-positive
and Duffy-negative individuals (Aim 2). This work will provide key insights into Pv pathogenesis
that will inform malaria control strategies and public health interventions globally. In addition to
the scientific training the trainee will gain, he has organized a group of scientific and clinical
mentors that will guide his professional development to become a unique clinical scientist at the
intersection of infectious disease and maternal health. His training in bioinformatics, clinical
practice, and global health research will allow for gains in the understanding of the immense
clinical burden of infectious disease in pregnancy, specifically malaria in pregnancy, and a
foundational education in his career as a physician scientist."

There is an unmet clinical need for accurate, minimally invasive strategies to diagnose endometriosis, a
debilitating disease which affects 10% of reproductive-aged women and frequently results in chronic pain,
infertility, or even cancer. Diagnosis is often delayed due to seemingly invisible and vague symptoms and the
lack of definitive diagnostic methods except invasive surgery. This project aims to study the uterotubal junction
(UTJ), the proximal, contractile segment of the fallopian tubes. Despite the protective role of the UTJ in retrograde
menstruation, and the fact that it is structurally altered in women with endometriosis, this region is understudied.
I hypothesize that there are structural and functional differences in the UTJs of women with and without
endometriosis, which can be visualized with three dimensional minimally invasive imaging. My goal is to
evaluate and compare these differences using optical coherence tomography (OCT), and to develop a miniature
endoscope to access the UTJ through the uterus. OCT is a novel, non-destructive imaging technique capable of
providing depth-based microstructural information at micron-scale resolution. Previous work has indicated the
ability of OCT to define the organization of smooth muscle and collagen in tissue, differentiate endometriosis
from normal tissue, and inform the functional status of tubal cilia in live mouse studies.
I propose the first comparative study of the structure and function of the UTJ in the setting of endometriosis using
high-resolution, volumetric imaging. Through Specific Aim 1, I will compare functional and morphological
measures of explanted UTJs from women with and without endometriosis on volumetric OCT images. I will
develop novel algorithms to extract quantitative measures, including texture features, the quantity and orientation
of collagen (structure), and ciliary beat frequency (function). In the short term, I aim to provide effective and
accurate diagnostic information which can differentiate individuals with endometriosis from controls, as well as
advance our current understanding of the understudied UTJ. Through Specific Aim 2, I will design, build, and
test a minimally invasive, miniature endoscope capable of providing depth-resolved structural-functional
information to demonstrate that OCT can be made suitable for imaging the UTJ. In the long term, I hope to prove
that a simple, low-cost office-based imaging procedure, using an OCT endoscope, can provide accurate
diagnostic information to identify endometriosis at an early stage. This device could overcome limitations in
current diagnostic methods by providing a means for repetitive surveillance, informing prognostic markers of
endometriosis susceptibility, and improving detection times and accuracy. The proposed research will generate
the preliminary data needed to design a larger in vivo study to prove the diagnostic capability of our endoscope."

there is a dearth of emergency medicine physician-scientists due to the relative youth of the field. The program
will greatly expand the cadre of emergency medicine physician-scientists capable of performing NIH-funded
research focused on neurological disorders commonly treated in the pre-hospital and emergency department
settings. The EMRCDP-NS will be collaboratively led by a multi-PD team consisting of Robert Neumar, MD,
PhD (University of Michigan), Opeolu Adeoye, MD, MS (Washington University), Gail D’Onofrio, MD, MS (Yale
University), and Clifton Callaway, MD, PhD (University of Pittsburgh), as well as a 15-member National
Advisory Committee comprising renowned basic science, clinical, and health services investigators who have
strong records of research and mentorship. EMRCDP-NS scholars will be selected from a nationwide cohort of
highly qualified candidates within their first or second faculty year subsequent to completing emergency
medicine residency or fellowship training and who practice clinically at academic institutions that support
emergency medicine research. Candidate applications will follow the NIH K format. The program will accept 3
new scholars each year over a 5-year period (15 funded scholars total). In Phase I of the program, scholars will
receive up to 3 years of financial support from the EMRCDP-NS, including dedicated research time (75%
effort). Scholars will undertake their career development and research plan at their home institution with
support from a local mentorship team. They will also participate in the in-person EMRCDP-NS Annual Meeting,
in-person and virtual site visits, and bi-monthly virtual research training seminars. In Phase II (years 4-5) of the
program, scholars will ideally be supported by their own NIH or similar funding, and they will be required to
have at least 50% dedicated research time guaranteed by their home department to support their transition to
independence. To ensure a robust and diverse candidate pool, a Pipeline Program will be implemented with a
focus on diversity to prepare potential scholar candidates to submit competitive K12 applications. In addition,
promising applicants who are not selected for funding will be offered ongoing mentorship by program leaders
and will be encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting and virtual seminars. The primary goals of the program
are that all EMRCDP-NS scholars and many non-selected applicants obtain subsequent, individual major NIH
awards (e.g., NIH K or R01-equivalent), have sustained careers of NIH-funded research, and mentor the next
generation of emergency medicine physician-scientists. Moreover, the EMRCDP-NS program will help build a

Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization (TPOT) platform that represents one of the very first and most widely used
open-source AutoML methods. A major benefit of this approach is that it makes machine learning accessible to
novice users because it takes the guesswork and complexity out of picking, running, tuning, and optimizing
machine learning algorithms and the various pre- and post-processing methods. Bringing this technology to the
clinical and translational research communities will open the door to broad adoption of data mining methods for
embracing the complexity of the relationship between multimodal substance abuse biomarkers and clinical
outcomes such as HIV progression and severity. We propose here novel algorithms to adapt and extend TPOT
for the large volumes of clinical data that are being collected on patients infected with HIV at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles. Specifically, we will first develop an ontology-based Addiction KnowledgeBase
(AddictionKB) tailored to HIV endpoints and clinical data derived from electronic health records (EHRs) and their
relationships with HIV infection and outcomes to inform the machine learning algorithms and assist with
interpretation (AIM 1). We will then develop a large language model (AddictionLLM) using Bloom to allow for
natural language queries of AddictionKB to perform knowledge-guided feature selection (AIM 2). We will extend
our TPOT AutoML (AddictionML) to include special operators to call the AddictionLLM algorithm for automated
knowledge-guided feature selection within machine learning pipelines (AIM 3). We will apply AddictionKB,
AddictionLLM, and AddictionML to the identification of substance abuse disorders and other clinical measures
that are predictive of HIV progression and severity (AIM 4). Finally, we will distribute and support AddictionKB,
AddictionLLM, and AddictionML as open-source software (AIM 5)."

The Human Genome Meetings (HGM) have been held annually since 1996. They are held in a different host
city every year and travel around the world. Since 2020, the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) has been
re-organized to include the Human Gene Variation Society (HGVS) and the Human Variome Project (HVP). Its
mission has always been to bring the benefits of the Human Genome Project to all, but HUGO’s focus is now
on ensuring this for those living in low and middle income countries (LMICs), by 1) holding its meetings in
LMICs every other or at least every third year to increase attendance, as well as including focused educational
efforts on genomic tools, variant interpretation, genome analysis, and genetic counseling; 2) working with
LMICs to increase capacity and infrastructure for genomics to both understand diversity and to enable genomic
medicine 3) to work with other international organizations to develop standard competencies for those
providing genetic counseling (regardless of formal training) and to work with those interested to bring formal
recognition of the profession to those countries that do not yet recognize it. HUGO also has a large and active
committee of ethics, law, and society (CELS) that works closely with other international efforts such as the
Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) regulatory and ethics workstream. The annual HGMs
include cutting edge science as well as focused educational workshops and the opportunity to network with
other scientists, both junior and internationally recognized senior investigators from around the world. This
purpose of this project is to fund travel awards for young investigators (graduate students, post-doctoral
fellows, and junior faculty) from LMICs to attend the HGM. Those selected must apply, have an abstract
accepted for platform or poster presentation at the HGM, and include a statement of financial need. A
committee that includes members of the HGM scientific organizing committee and the HUGO Executive Board
and Faculty of Scholars will select the best applicants for support by this grant. The awards will be used to
cover travel, housing, and registration for the meeting. Registration is greatly reduced for all from LMICs."

Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder with an incidence of 1 in ~10,000 girls
throughout the world. It is caused by a single gene mutation of the X-linked methyl-CpG-binding protein 2
(MECP2), a chromatin-associated gene product that is crucial for neuronal development. There is presently no
disease-specific treatment or cure. Despite its single-gene nature, finding a treatment for Rett Syndrome has
proven challenging. Previous studies showed that, in mice, restoring MECP2 expression using genetic
methods can reverse the disease symptoms. The reversal has provided hope that doing the same using
pharmacological methods could treat and possibly cure Rett Syndrome in patients. RTT girls carry one mutant
MECP2 allele and one normal allele. In half of their cells, the mutant copy is expressed while the normal copy
lies dormant because of X-chromosome inactivation. In the proposed project of this application, the laboratory
will employ an “X-reactivation” strategy (previously developed by the laboratory) to restore expression of
MECP2 from the inactivated X-chromosome. The strategy uses an antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) directed
against XIST RNA, the master regulator of X-chromosome silencing, combined with priming by a small
molecule inhibitor of DNA methylation. In the first funding cycle of R01-MH118351, research results show that
the X-reactivation technology can restore endogenous MECP2 protein expression in the brain and rescue RTT
symptoms in a disease-relevant animal model. The proposed research for cycle 2 will focus on (i) completing
PK/PD studies, optimizing dosing schedules, and determining an ideal intervention window in a mouse model,
and (ii) optimizing the human XIST ASO, performing toxicology studies, and nominating 2-3 development
candidates for IND-enabling studies."
10879378,"ABSTRACT
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the most frequent dementia in patients under 60 years old. Mutations in MAPT
(the gene encoding for the Tau protein), including the autosomal dominant R406W missense point mutation,
have been linked to FTD. Current evidence supports the concept that FTD neurodegeneration starts decades
before symptom onset, yet genetic FTD studies in young adults or minors are seldomly done, due to the
challenges of disclosing genetic condition and the burden of long-term testing. Defining when the pathological
processes begin will be critical to administer neuroprotective therapies before substantial neuronal loss and,
therefore, to prevent FTD onset. At the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) we currently
have 6 rhesus macaque carriers of an exact replica of the human MAPT R406W mutation. They are 3 adults
(19, 6 & 7 yrs.), a young adult (4 yrs.), a juvenile (2 yrs.) and an infant (0.6 yrs.); 3 more offspring are due
October/November 2023. These nonhuman primate (NHP) carriers provide a unique opportunity to longitudinally
and systematically assess biomarkers of FTD-tau. The overarching goal of this proposal is to identify the earliest
biomarkers of FTD and their timeline of onset across the lifespan of MAPT R406W rhesus, aiming to inform
clinical translation. Based on our preliminary findings, we hypothesize that prodromal FTD-tau begins during the
transition period of sexual maturation from juvenile to young adult. To test this hypothesis, we propose three
Specific Aims: 1) To characterize across the lifespan the onset of FTD-like cognitive, mood and motor behaviors
of rhesus MAPT R406W mutation carriers; 2) To identify early imaging predictors of brain neurodegeneration in
rhesus MAPT R406W mutation carriers. 3) To assay CSF and blood fluid biomarkers of FTD-tau linked to
neurodegeneration in rhesus MAPT R406W mutation carriers and assess their temporal relationship with
imaging and behavioral biomarkers. We will access databases at WNPRC for NHP normative rhesus data. To
facilitate harmonization between old and new datasets, additional MRI and biofluids assays will be collected from
animals of the WNPRC colony. We will maximize the translational value of the NHP resource, by comparing the
results to human datasets available through the Tau consortium. This rhesus study is timely due to the availability
of the MAPT R406W monkeys generated by the R61/R33 NS115103 award, and fulfills a gap in clinical research.
The NHP results will be enriched in the future by postmortem analyses, as more rhesus carriers become
available. The findings generated by this rhesus project will inform on the impact of the tau mutation in early
neurodevelopmental stages and assist in the design of future neuroprotective preclinical and clinical studies."
10879968,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Down Syndrome (DS) impacts approximately 1 in about 700 babies born in the United States. Language and
motor development in DS are significantly delayed in early childhood; however, little research has investigated
how language and motor skills interact and support each other. In response to the NIH INCLUDE Down
Syndrome Research Plan, the proposed study will address several gaps in our understanding of DS. First, we
will implement multiple methods, including technology, to measure language and motor development across
direct assessments, naturalistic measurements, parent reports, and free play observations. Second, we intend
to actively recruit and enroll over 60% of participants from racially/ethnically minoritized backgrounds. Finally,
we will collect longitudinal data to track measures that may be sensitive to developmental change. Using
multiple methods, we will track developmental trajectories of language and motor skills in infants with Down
Syndrome (DS) and typically developing infants over a 12-month period. The goal is to measure language,
communication, motor skills, and physical activity to better understand how these skills develop and interact
with each other over time. If funded, we will recruit 36 infants with DS (age 6 months – 18 months) and 36
typically developing (TD) infants (age 6 months – 18 months) and follow them for 12 months. We intend to
recruit at least 60% of our sample from racial/ethnic minority backgrounds (i.e., Hispanic/Latino, Black/African
American, Asian, Native American). Infants and their caregivers will complete standardized questionnaires and
assessments at study entry, then two more times, 6 months apart, for a total of three assessments in a 12-
month period of time. This research will provide critical data on the early development of racially/ethnically
diverse infants with DS to inform intervention strategies and supports."

7 Inverted LED Fluorescent Motorized Microscope which is set-up for Brightfield that allows for
Fluorescence studies with new fluorescence filter Sets Dapi/Fits/Texas Red. This instrumentation
will be an excellent addition for several biology faculty who are conducting biomedical research
with several diverse objectives. This will encourage students to take advantage of the opportunity
to gain experience and use highly sophisticated equipment and novel research techniques. The use
of this microscope for novel classroom assignments will add considerably to the comprehension
of biological phenomena. This excellent teaching tool will be used for a variety of courses and will
give the students knowledge of how the concept of fluorescence is used in biomedical research. It
is projected that at least 48 to 50 students can make use of this instrument during a semester. It is
excellent for use in biological studies by enhancing several components. There are six-positions
Motorized Filter Cube Turret DAPI - EX 375/28nm DM 415nm EM 460/50nm (NEW FILTER
SET), FITC - EX 480/35nm DM 505nm EM 535/40nm.
This microscope has features that elevates it above several instruments that are used to detect
fluorescence and as a tool for immunocytochemistry. It should also be noted that the selection of this
microscope was done with much concentration on the details of its salient features, and I cite that
most of these features have elevated this superb microscope above any other instrument of
comparable price ranges on the market today. For example, (1) lumencor SOLA white light LED
fluorescent light source (excitation range of 380nm to 660nm); (2) observer 7 brand is the newest,
current, and exclusive offering from Zeiss, thus, this microscope is top of the line in its
technological offerings; (3) new Filter Cubes for DAPI, FITC, and Texas Red dyes.
We will procure a colleague, Dr. Jan Blancato, Professor, Georgetown University, who has a great
deal of experience in the use, care and upkeep of a fluorescent microscope to lead an advisory
committee that will function in the maintenance of this instrument and use the “Piece of Mind”
concept designed by Zeiss for the most efficient use and upkeep of the microscope. Additionally,
we will have the microscope assembled by a representative from Zeiss using the most efficient and
comprehensive methods to convey the importance and necessity of the upkeep of this fine piece
of equipment."
10880110,"Project Summary
Given the persistently stark racial/ethnic disparities in perinatal health outcomes in the U.S. and the increasing
utilization of fertility treatment to achieve pregnancy, the overall goal of this study is to apply a health equity
framework to investigate the experiences and outcomes of women of color who receive fertility treatment and
achieve a live birth. Our specific aims are: 1) For fertile, subfertile, and assisted reproductive technology (ART)
groups, we will quantify racial/ethnic disparities among non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black (NHB),
Hispanic, Non-Hispanic Asian (NHA) and other groups in (a) maternal morbidity (based upon Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention definition) and mortality during birth hospitalization through the first year postpartum and
(b) infant health outcomes at birth and through the first year of life (e.g. mortality, re-hospitalizations, and
emergency room use) through analysis of the population based Massachusetts Outcome Study of Assisted
Reproductive Technology (MOSART) data system from 2004-2020, which includes data from the Society for
Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System (SART CORS) and the MA Pregnancy to
Early Life Longitudinal (PELL) data system (an ongoing longitudinally-linked population-based system that
includes birth certificates, death records, and hospital utilization data for MA birthing people and their infants).
We will also test whether the magnitude of racial/ethnic disparities in the ART group varies from fertile and
subfertile populations. 2) Among NHW, NHB, and Hispanic women who receive ART or other fertility treatments
and their infants, we will investigate the impact of racism and other individual-, healthcare-, and community-level
factors associated with adverse perinatal health outcomes, through linkages of the MA Pregnancy Risk
Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) with the MA PELL data system. PRAMS collects state-specific,
population-based data on maternal attitudes and experiences before, during, and shortly after pregnancy with
specific questions pertaining to receipt of fertility treatment. 3) Through qualitative interviews with NHB and
Hispanic women who have received fertility treatment and a live birth, we will identify facilitators and barriers to
successful navigation of fertility treatment and subsequent maternal and infant care that may lead to excess risk
for adverse maternal and infant health outcomes relative to their NHW counterparts with a focus on the
experience of racism. This proposal will provide a comprehensive investigation using quantitative and qualitative
methods that will inform the development of future policies and programs aimed at providing equitable perinatal
healthcare to those accessing and receiving ART and other fertility treatments."
10880056,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Although chronic pain (CP) affects over 20% of the U.S. population, little is known about associated
physiological consequences, which likely contribute to the patients’ functional limitations and high risk for
cardiovascular disease. It is therefore the goal of this project to explore the impact of CP on cardiovascular
function and to evaluate the potential and underlying mechanisms of an innovative pain management strategy
to improve circulatory control in this vulnerable patient group. Two disease-related characteristics predispose
CP patients to cardiovascular abnormalities during exercise. First, an enhanced responsiveness of sensory
nerve endings and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and the resulting high afferent feedback to medullary
cardiovascular centers may exaggerate the exercise pressor reflex (EPR; a sympatho-excitatory reflex). Second,
arterial baroreflex sensitivity (BRS), a sympatho-inhibitory reflex, may be decreased in CP. By studying both
patients with CP from lower limbs and well-matched controls, we will evaluate the impact of CP on these
neurocirculatory control mechanisms and associated consequences for the hemodynamic and neuromuscular
fatigue response to physical activities. We will use lumbar intrathecal fentanyl and both the Modified Oxford
method and the neck pressure/neck suction technique to evaluate the role of the EPR in determining the
hemodynamic response to exercise and to determine baroreflex function. We will also study the impact of
neuromodulation therapy (NMT), an innovative therapeutic approach that manages pain by electrically
stimulating the spinal cord or DRG and subsequently blocking sensory feedback from reaching the brain, on
muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) and the hemodynamic and neuromuscular fatigue response to rest
and exercise in patients with CP. We will use direct peroneal and radial nerve recordings to quantify MSNA
during handgrip and leg exercise. This will allow us to evaluate a) the direct effect of NMT (comparisons between
NMT turned on vs turned-off) on efferent sympathetic nerve activity, and b) whether NMT affects EPR-mediated
increases in sympathoexcitation during physical activity. Finally, ~40% of all CP patients suffer from clinical
hypertension. We will therefore conduct these studies in normotensive and hypertensive patients and determine
the efficacy of NMT to normalize the well-known hemodynamic abnormalities, including exaggerated MSNA and
BP, during exercise in hypertensive individuals. If this project can, as suggested by our preliminary data, confirm
a significant impact of CP on the circulatory and fatigue response to physical activity and that NMT can improve
these impairments, but also the hemodynamic abnormalities associated with hypertension, the proposed studies
will provide the scientific basis required to associate NMT with significant functional and cardiovascular health
benefits."
10880119,"Diabetes-induced retinal inflammation plays an important pathogenic role in diabetic retinopathy (DR).
Microglial activation is a key step in retinal inflammation in DR. The molecular mechanism for the microglial
activation in DR remains elusive. Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α (PPARα) is a ligand-activated
nuclear receptor and transcription factor. It is known to regulate lipid metabolism, and thus, PPARα agonists are
used clinically to treat dyslipidemia. Two large, prospective clinical studies independently reported a surprising
finding that oral administration of fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist, has robust therapeutic effects on DR in type 2
diabetic patients. However, fenofibrate has not been approved by US FDA for the treatment of DR, as many
questions remain to be addressed. In the prior grant period, we have shown that PPARα levels are decreased
in the retinas of diabetic patients and animal models, and that the therapeutic effect of fenofibrate on DR is
through a PPARα-dependent mechanism. In addition, we have shown that PPARα global knockout (KO)
exacerbated, while activation of PPARα by fenofibrate alleviated, retinal mitochondrial dysfunction in DR models.
Our recent studies reported that PPARα KO alone induced activation of cGAS-STING signaling in retinal and
circulating immune cells. Our preliminary studies showed that PPARα KO resulted in changed morphology and
increased density and migration of microglial cells in the retina. To exclude possible secondary effects of PPARα
global KO and define the function of PPARα in microglia, we have recently generated microglia-specific PPARα
conditional KO (PPARαMCKO) and PPARα transgenic (PPARαMCTG) mice. We found that PPARα ablation in
microglia alone increases the density and migration of microglia, and results in ERG decline, astrocyte
senescence and retinal pericyte loss in diabetes. Therefore, we hypothesize that diabetes-induced down-
regulation of PPARα in microglia results in metabolic dysregulation and subsequently, microglial activation and
inflammation, leading to dysfunction and paracrine senescence of vascular cells and astrocytes through inter-
cellular communications in DR. To address this hypothesis, we will determine if PPARα inhibits microglial
activation and retinal inflammation through regulation of microglial metabolism and mitochondrial function in
diabetes. We will compare microglial cell activation and polarization, metabolic profile, mitochondrial integrity in
diabetic PPARαMCKO and PPARαMCTG mice and controls. We will determine the role of fatty acid transporter
carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a and fatty acid-binding protein 3 in the regulation of microglial metabolism by
PPARα. We will also investigate how PPARα deficiency in microglia impairs retinal astrocytes and vascular cells
through a disturbed metabolic coupling. We will measure retinal function and structure, vascular permeability
and pericyte density in diabetic PPARαMCKO, PPARαMCTG and controls. The proposed studies will define the
function of PPARα in microglia and explore a new regulatory mechanism for microglial activation in diabetes.
This project will also elucidate the mechanism for the therapeutic effects of fenofibrate on DR."

related skin regeneration and wound healing through bioinformatics inference. The transcriptomics, DNA
methylation and chromatin accessibility data generated through this program project will be consistently analyzed
using state-of-the-art methods for next generation sequencing analysis implemented in Core B’s infrastructure
that provide rigorous quality control, mapping, and quantitation of genes and genomic regions with functional
roles in skin regeneration. Using established unsupervised and supervised multi-omics integrative approaches,
Core B will identify shared signals across experiments and work with program investigators to map key metabolic,
epigenetic and cell receptor stem cell pathways that drive age-related wound healing dysfunction. The results of
these analyses will be made available through an interactive web based visualization system for storage, retrieval
and exploration of the data generated by the program projects, enabling the achievement of the project aims and
facilitating formulation of new testable hypotheses beyond those stated."

Project 3 will test the central hypotheses that (1) ABCB5(+) dermal mesenchymal stem cells (DMSC) are
required for normal adult skin homeostasis and regeneration; (2) ABCB5(+) DMSC decline is responsible
for impaired skin homeostasis and regenerative wound healing during aging; and (3) ABCB5(+) DMSC
transplantation possesses therapeutic potential to restore age-related impairment of skin homeostasis and
regeneration. The overall significance of this study are the potential shifts in research paradigms resulting
from successful completion of this research: (1) The proposed experiments will answer a fundamental
question in stem cell biology and aging that has not been addressed as-of-yet in prospective studies – To
what extent is selective dysfunction in an adult stem cell compartment (vis-à-vis dysregulation of
differentiated tissues) responsible for organismal aging?; and (2) Documentation of the regenerative
capacity of ABCB5(+) DMSC along with demonstration of their decline as a cause age-related impairment
of skin regenerative capacity will lay the foundation for targeted employment of this candidate cell
therapeutic for the treatment of cutaneous wounds in aging patients."

The goal of the UM OAIC Research Education Core (REC) is to recruit, select, support, mentor, and train
junior faculty to become independent investigators in aging-related research and academic leaders in geriatrics
and gerontology within their respective disciplines. A key additional objective is to train the next generation of
investigators about the UM OAIC focus of how metabolic factors and inflammation interact with age-related
diseases and comorbidities to determine key health outcomes related to mobility and functional status.
Aim 1. Recruit, select, and train REC Scholars
We will support 4 REC Scholars per year of this award, two continuing and two new Scholars per year. The
REC career development award ensures Scholars can protect their time for career development and research.
Central to the training of each REC Scholar is a (1) a mentorship team with a primary mentor and at least one
other secondary mentor from the Pepper Center leadership, (2) mentored research project, (3) formal
seminars, (4) presentation of project results (works-in-progress in the Scholar’s first year and formal
presentation in year 2) and (5) participation in the annual mock NIH study section. The REC works closely
with the UM Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research (MICHR) to assist the Scholar in
understanding how to translate basic findings into clinical research or clinical findings into mechanistic studies.
Aim 2. Provide career development enhancement for REC Scholars and other UM junior faculty
In addition to training the REC Scholars, the Pepper Center will also serve as a rich resource for career
development and advancing aging research conducted by the UM research community, with a focus on UM
junior faculty development. The REC offers a seminar program in aging research, leadership, and career
development; conducting the annual mock NIH study section research retreat program; and contributing to
the annual Geriatrics Center-wide research symposium. REC career development enhancement activities
help the REC Scholar apply basic findings to clinical investigation, explore mechanisms underlying
clinical and epidemiological findings, and translate basic and clinical findings to a broader older adult
community. The REC has designed the career development program for the REC Scholars with the capacity
to include other UM junior faculty in aging research, such as PESC awardees.
Aim 3. Evaluate REC Scholar progress and mentorship
The evaluation plan begins with designing each Scholar’s career development plan, which consists of
discrete elements (regular meetings with mentors, writing, presentation at a national meeting, grant
writing) customized to each Scholar’s needs depending on area of research. The REC will monitor
publications and grant proposal output every 6 months, using the customized plan as the benchmark for
progress. This Aim includes structured and qualitative evaluation of the mentor and mentee interactions."

A well-defined and effective Leadership Administrative Core (LAC) that supports the rich activities of the
OAIC is already in place. The faculty and staff in the LAC have proven leadership and administrative skills.
The LAC will foster critical interactions among the OAIC Program Director, the OAIC Core Directors/Co-
Directors and the leadership structure of the Institution as a whole. These linkages are fostered by the proven
administrative structure, which requires meetings of the OAIC leadership on a regular and ongoing basis, and
of key advisory committees: the UM Geriatrics Center’s Research Operating Committee (ROC) and the
OAIC External Advisory Board (EAB). The ROC, led by two fellowship-trained geriatricians/physician
scientists (Yung, Mody) with complementary expertise and research interests, provides strategic planning,
coordination and oversight for all OAIC activities. The membership of the ROC includes the LAC Leader and
Co-Leader, the former OAIC Director, the ten other OAIC Core Directors/Co-Directors, and Geriatrics Center
administrative leaders.
The overarching goal of the LAC reflects that of the OAIC as a whole: to create, enhance and maintain a
cohesive intellectual, technological, and administrative environment to maximize geriatrics research that will
improve understanding of how metabolic factors and inflammation interact with age-related diseases
and comorbidities to determine key health outcomes related to mobility and functional status. The LAC
has four Specific Aims: 1. To oversee, encourage, stimulate and guide the development and review of OAIC
goals and policies by: integrating, monitoring and evaluating the activities of the OAIC’s components; and
assisting them in achieving the OAIC’s goals and objectives. 2. To manage and to develop resources to
effectively achieve the OAIC’s goals and objectives. 3. To ensure effective communication and bi-directional
interaction among members of the University community who are engaged in research and training in health
care problems of the older adults, and with the general public locally and nationally. 4. To recruit and develop
outstanding investigators to participate in the research and training missions of the OAIC; and to provide
leadership training to early-stage faculty who may become future leaders in geriatrics and aging-related
programs.
Taken together, the LAC will maintain an outstanding research and training environment and administrative
support structure to enhance recruitment of faculty into the OAIC. The LAC will provide experience and support
to develop future leaders in academic geriatrics through mentorship for leadership skills, and through
participation in formal committees and relevant administrative activities of the Geriatrics Center and the OAIC."

The goal of the Pilot and Exploratory Studies Core (PESC) is to provide support for studies that will develop
and test new research ideas of high relevance to the Center’s overall theme: improve understanding of how
metabolic factors and inflammation interact with age-related diseases and comorbidities to determine key health
outcomes related to mobility and functional status. The PESC will thus fund pilot research studies over a wide
range of disciplines, from basic, pre-clinical, clinical patient-oriented research through behavioral and health
services research. Each submitted proposal will first receive an evaluation for scientific merit by at least three
external reviewers and then be further evaluated by OAIC leaders for relevance to the Center objectives. The
PESC has made 155 pilot grants since its inception in 1989, mostly to junior faculty, many of whom have now
established themselves as productive independent researchers in geriatric medicine and cognate disciplines.
Five projects have been selected for 2020-2021 (Year 1 of the competing renewal), including: 1) Type 2
Diabetes Self-Management in Older African American Men: A Peer Leader Pilot Intervention; 2) Evaluate de-
escalation of biologic bDMARDs (biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) among older adults with
Rheumatoid Arthritis; 3) Home-delivered meals to prevent recurrent hepatic encephalopathy: The
BRAINFOOD randomized controlled trial; 4) Pathway to De-escalation: Characterizing antibiotic prescribing
cascade for older adults. 5) Age-associated alterations in protein translation dynamics. The PESC will be
directed by Drs. Lona Mody and Daniel Goldstein. They will work closely with the Research Education Core
(REC) and all the Resource Cores (RCs) to support implementation of innovative and promising projects
proposed by junior scientists, or more senior investigators new to aging research, increasing the likelihood that
projects will lead to externally supported research in aging."

The Biomechanics Core (BC) will facilitate the training of investigators in the conduct of new and expanded
research on how metabolic disease and inflammation interact with age-related disease to determine key health
outcomes. The Specific Aims include: providing interdisciplinary expertise, training and technical support for
the biomechanical and other physiological aspects of Research Career Development, a Pilot Exploratory
Study, a Developmental Project (DP) and 8 External Projects (EPs, Aim 1); providing individual guidance on
(Aim 2) and evaluating methods (Aim 3) related to mobility and functional status, the biomechanics of aging,
and to the training of geriatric physicians and other clinicians in the biomechanics relevant to impaired mobility,
falls and fall-related injuries, urinary incontinence and prolapse in the older adults; and assisting with computer
modeling and simulation related to the above goals (Aim 4). BC-supported investigators will have substantial
access to the UM Biomechanics Research Laboratory of the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the
Mobility Research Center at the UM Geriatrics Center. The DP will enhance a BC-invented uroflowmeter by
designing and testing a microsensor to measure mid-stream urine sodium in real time. This modification will
challenge the existing paradigm of needing an indwelling catheter to accurately measure urine output and urine
biomarkers, and the invention will help differentiate kidney failure from normal kidney function with low blood
volume. The EPs include improving the treatment of hip arthroplasty, urinary incontinence and pelvic organ
prolapse, preventing decubitus ulcers, and wearable sensors to determine real world physical activity and falls
in older adults. By structuring the BC as a separate Core, the OAIC achieves economic efficiencies in terms of
reduced equipment and service that would be duplicated if separate biomechanics components were pursued
by individual OAIC projects. Since its inception, the BC has served as a consulting service to faculty
performing multidisciplinary research on geriatric mobility problems. Consequently, the BC has positively
impacted the quality of the research conducted in and beyond the OAIC, as demonstrated by its productivity in
terms of peer-reviewed articles, the success of young investigators granted with K08, K12, K23, K99/R00
awards, and extramural research projects awarded by R03, R21, R01, P50 and RC2 mechanisms."

The principal goal of the Core Facility for Aged Rodents (CFAR) is to develop new mouse models that can
be used to evaluate the physiological and cellular factors that control the rate of aging and tie aging to late-life
diseases. New mouse models are often suggested by other scientists, at UM or at other institutions, and these
are evaluated as potential collaborations. CFAR resources are used for initial characterizations, often
including studies of lifespan, age-sensitive indices of health, and pathology, with a view towards producing
sufficient data to allow the new mouse models to be used in competitive applications for extramural support. In
keeping with the overall theme of the UM OAIC, many of the mouse systems developed depend on alterations
of metabolic and/or inflammatory pathways, whether by genetic changes, dietary interventions, or, more
recently, drugs. The specific mutants, diets, or drugs chosen each year depend on scientific discoveries and
interactions in each preceding year. Specific Aims: Aim 1 will support six externally funded projects (EPs) in
year 1, including work on serotonin receptor mutants, drug effects on gene expression patterns, effects of anti-
aging drugs on cancer cells, work on cap-independent translation of specific mRNAs, studies of adipose tissue
inflammation, and an analysis of over-expression of an enzyme that protect mitochondria from oxidative
damage. Aim 2 uses CFAR resources to maintain breeding colonies of special interest to mouse aging
research, including mutants with tissue-specific alterations in Growth Hormone receptor, the IGF1 binding
protein protease PAPPA, the mitochondrial redox protecting enzyme thioredoxin reductase 2, and two proteins
that promote cap-independent translation of mRNA subsets. Aim 3 focuses on training, consultation, and
professional education, so that CFAR can provide sophisticated perspectives on mouse aging models to PES
and REC applications, and to UM students, fellows and faculty, and contribute to development of national
standards for optimal use of rodents in biogerontology. Aim 4 involves selection of one or two new innovative

10900020,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Dilated cardiomyopathies are a frequent cause of heart failure worldwide, characterized by reduced
systolic function and left ventricular dilation. Dilated cardiomyopathy has been linked to various causes, including
viral infections, drug abuse, endocrine dysfunction, and genetic mutations. Reduced effective myocardial
contractility presents as a symptom early in disease progression of dilated cardiomyopathy. Studying the
molecular basis of decreased contractility by investigating the myosin motors that power contractions can provide
important insight and allow testing of potential therapeutic modulation. Current therapeutics for dilated
cardiomyopathy (e.g., ACE inhibitors, β-blockers, etc.) target symptoms but do not attenuate the underlying
source of contractile dysfunction. At the molecular level, force generation in cardiac muscle is determined by the
number of myosin motors that bind to the actin thin-filament during the systolic rise of calcium. Once myosin
motors bind, myosins hydrolyze ATP and undergo conformational steps to generate force. Recent attention has
focused on the myosin biochemical super-relaxed state, an energy-conserving, auto-inhibited state of cardiac
myosin that determines the proportion of myosin motors available. Thus, the amount of myosin motors in the
super-relaxed state modulates the magnitude of myosin motors available to generate sarcomere power upon
activation. The stability of the super-relaxed state can be modulated by phosphorylation of regulatory light chain
and myosin binding protein C. Additionally, as force increases, stress on the thick filament rises resulting in the
release of myosin heads, allowing greater force production. A decrease in available myosin motors as a result
of a shift towards the super-relaxed state is a potential mechanism of systolic dysfunction in human dilated
cardiomyopathy and has yet to be fully investigated. Therefore, our central hypothesis is that depressed
contractile force in dilated cardiomyopathy results from increased myosins in the super-relaxed state (Aim 1)
mediated by depressed regulatory protein phosphorylation (Aim 2), which may be able to be reversed with the
use of myosin activators (Aim 3). To test our hypothesis, we will utilize the fluorescent ATP pulse-chase
technique to quantify the proportion of myosins in the super-relaxed state and test the effects of myosin activators
at short and long sarcomere lengths. Also, using Phos-TagTM western blotting, we will measure the
phosphorylation status of regulatory proteins. This proposal will provide novel insight into the effects of myosin
activators on the super-relaxed state, demonstrate fundamental aspects of myosin biochemical states, and their
role in the molecular basis of human dilated cardiomyopathy."
10932398,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) kills 1 in 3 seniors (more than breast and prostate
cancer combined), increased by 16% during the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and
is the costliest condition with an expected $355 billion in healthcare costs in 2021
and $1.1 trillion in 2050. Although some effective treatments are available,
Alzheimer’s remains severely undertreated with several pharmacological
compounds failing in clinical trials and/or practice over the past three decades.
Focused Ultrasound (FUS), in conjunction with microbubbles, remains the sole
technique that can induce localized blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening
noninvasively, selectively and safely. Despite the fact that the technology was
initially intended to open the BBB for drug delivery, our group was the first to
report that BBB opening alone can lead to cognitive amelioration in primates. The
safe BBB opening enabled by FUS can lead to an immune cascade that is in turn
correlated with reduction of cognitive deficits and pathology. Prior to our studies
reported herein, the immunotherapeutic potential of the FUS-mediated BBB
opening was unknown. in this renewal study, we aim to determine 1) the
currently unknown neuroprotective and immunotherapeutic mechanisms of FUS-
mediated BBB opening as well as the duration of the aforementioned effects in
multi-session BBB opening, 2) link cognitive improvement and/or immune
response with synaptic density increase, 3) optimize the clinical FUS system for
accurate hippocampal targeting in humans, 3) assess neuroprotection efficacy in
asymptomatic AD subjects and 4) assess immunotherapeutic efficacy in
symptomatic AD subjects. The underlying hypothesis is thus that FUS-mediated
BBB opening alone leads to neuroprotective and immunotherapeutic with
sustained mnemonic amelioration in AD. The multi-disciplinary team
encompasses all critical specialty areas involved, such as ultrasound engineering
as well as MRI, PET and AD pathology, neuroimmunology, cognitive and
memory testing and mouse model development as they pertain to neuroscience
and neurology. Following the proposed studies, this entirely noninvasive and cost
efficient BBB opening technology will be translated in the clinical routine so as to
harness its clinical potential in the treatment of Alzheimer’s."
10929527,"Project Summary Abstract
 Researchers estimate an 832 percent growth in the number of Latinos with AD from 379,000 in 2012 to 3.5
million by 2060. While families frequently support the communication in people with Alzheimer’s Disease and
Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD), language differences can create particularly complex
situations for caregivers who must navigate a dominant English-language system for a family member who has
reverted to their first language. This issue is particularly acute for Latinos, given that the majority are bilingual,
and many families are (and will be) affected by complex caregiving needs. Frequently, the translation of materials
serves to promote service access for linguistically diverse groups. But to reflect underlying cultural nuances and
to identify the best secular phrasing and/or idiomatic expression in the target language, constructing valid
measures requires more than mere translation. Moreover, because language is communal, it is closely tied to
identity formation and acculturation, which can affect people’s social network formations and reinforce language
skills. Arguably, analyses of valid measures should also consider how the social (linguistic) context might
influence responses.
 We propose to enrich the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a longitudinal study of
older adults focused on social relationships, physical and mental health, cognitive, sensory, and motor function,
and medication use. NSHAP oversampled Latinos, collected data in English and Spanish, and interviewed
respondents in four rounds (2005-06, 2010-11, 2015-16 and 2021-22). However, these data have rarely been
used to study Latino older adults’ health and social lives. No research has been conducted that compares the
social networks of English- and Spanish-speaking Latinos and we know nothing about caregiving within these
networks. NSHAP lacks questions on language usage in daily life and contains few questions on how language
and cultural characteristics might impede access to health and other important institutions. To contextualize
aging and family caregiving of AD/ADRD among Spanish- and English-speaking Latino older adults we aim to
augment the NSHAP social network roster and caregiving questions, improve NSHAP Spanish-language
measures of caregiving and social networks, and administer the enhanced NSHAP protocols to Latino AD/ADRD
caregivers in Spanish and English."
10894724,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Mutations arise as a result of exogenous and endogenous processes that leave characteristic imprints or
signatures upon the genome. Systematic analysis of these mutational signatures led to the identification of >50
distinct types of single base substitutions (SBS) in human cancer genomes. Revealing the origins of individual
signatures is critical for understanding cancer etiology, with potential implications for cancer prevention and
therapy. Two of the most prevalent mutational signatures in cancer, termed SBS2 and SBS13, are present in
>78% of cancer types and 56% of all cancer genomes, with a particular prominence in breast, bladder, and
lung cancers. SBS2 and SBS13 are proposed to be caused by the endogenous APOBEC3 (A3) enzymes,
which target ssDNA and RNA of viruses and retroelements as part of the innate immune defense. Correlations
between A3 expression, driver gene mutations in A3-preferred contexts, and clinical outcomes suggest that A3
mutagenesis may play important roles in cancer etiology and evolution. Thus, there is strong rationale to
understand the mechanisms of A3 activity. However, reliance on engineered model systems and correlative
data have caused links between A3 enzymes, mutations in cancer, and cancer etiology to be poorly
understood. We have identified human cancer cell lines with endogenous A3 mutagenesis and developed a
workflow that enables us to quantify contributions of individual A3 members to mutations. Here, we propose to
leverage this workflow to accomplish the following goals: 1) Identify A3 mutator enzymes in cancer types where
A3 mutagenesis is prevalent and find biomarkers of their activity; 2) Investigate mechanisms modulating A3
mutagenesis; 3) Determine the functional relevance of A3 mutagenesis in therapy resistance and metastasis.
Aim 1 will expand upon our characterization of human cancer cells with active A3 mutagenesis to identify A3
mutators in breast, bladder, and lung cancers. In parallel, we will directly assess the unknown specificity and
sensitivity of assays to measure activities of individual A3 enzymes. These experiments may further confirm
the speculative A3-etiology of a large number of cancer mutations and quantify contributions of individual A3
enzymes, thus nominating them as putative targets for therapeutic pursuit. Aim 2 builds on our preliminary data
to investigate proposed modulators of A3 mutagenesis. These experiments have the potential to broaden the
scope of therapeutic opportunities focused on cancer cell evolution. Aim 3 will assess the links between A3
enzymes, therapy resistance and metastasis in breast, bladder, and lung cancer cell lines. These experiments
will test predictions from multi-dimensional associations that A3-mutagenesis is a disease-modifying process
that can be therapeutically exploited at various stages of cancer evolution. Taken together, these studies will
define the etiologies of highly prevalent mutational processes and identify strategies to elicit more durable
clinical benefits to targeted therapies and curb metastasis."

10872437,"ABSTRACT
 Despite advancements in targeted molecular therapies, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains one of the
deadliest malignancies worldwide, with an average 5-year survival rate of less than 18%. In 2007, the FDA
approved sorafenib as a first-line treatment for HCC, but it has only a limited response rate and an increase in
overall survival of only 2.8 months. Since 2018, FDA has approved several targeted therapies for advanced HCC,
including lenvatinib or atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab as first-line treatments, and cabozantinib
regorafenib, or nivolumab (or in combination with ipilimumab) as second-line treatments. Despite encouraging
results from these treatments, many patients still do not respond or acquire resistance to these drugs. This study
will focus on the mechanisms of resistance to cabozantinib therapy in HCC, which currently remains unknown.
Cabozantinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor. The FDA approved it as an effective second-line treatment for advanced
HCC patients who are previously treated with sorafenib or other systemic therapies in 2019. Despite its clinical
efficacy (it improved overall survival by 2.2 months, and the median progression-free survival of 5.2 months,
compared with 1.9 months for placebo), about 36% of patients did not respond to cabozantinib, and many
patients eventually developed resistance to cabozantinib after the initial response. Therefore, we plan to identify
the molecular mechanisms of resistance to cabozantinib therapy in HCC, which will provide new insight into the
mechanisms of drug resistance and tumor growth, and the development of new therapeutics to overcome
resistance to cabozantinib treatment.
 We have generated cabozantinib-resistant (CR) HCC cells and identified potential mechanisms for HCC cells
to acquire CR: EGFR hyper-activation. We found that EGFR is hyper-activated in CR cells and tumors. We also
demonstrated that both EGFR hyper-activation contributes to cabozantinib resistance in HCC. However, some
important questions remain to be answered. For example, what are the mechanisms by which EGFR is
activated in CR cells (Aims 1 and 2)? The goal of this research is to answer this question, which would provide
new insight into mechanisms of cabozantinib resistance and offer novel therapeutic strategies to treat HCC
patients."

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) expressed in the distal tubule and collecting duct
is responsible for the final regulation of sodium reabsorption by the kidneys. The
myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) plays an important role as an
adaptor protein between the anionic phospholipid PIP2 and ENaC. Both ENaC and
MARCKS are positively regulated by the protease cathepsin B. First, our preliminary
data demonstrate renal ENaC activity and MARCKS protein expression are positively
regulated by the circadian protein BMAL1. Second, our preliminary data show alpha-1
antitrypsin is increased in the BMAL1 knockout mouse kidney compared to the kidney of
wild-type mice sacrificed at the same time. Third, our preliminary data show alpha-1
antitrypsin is expressed in the kidney and it strongly inhibits cathepsin B activity and
contributes to blood pressure regulation. In this project we will test our hypothesis that
the association between renal ENaC and MARCKS, and their function at the apical
plasma membrane negatively correlates with alpha-1 antitrypsin expression in a
circadian dependent manner. We will perform experiments to investigate proteolysis
and apical membrane expression of ENaC and MARCKS, ENaC activity, sodium
handling, and blood pressure using male and female BMAL1 knockout mice, alpha-1
antitrypsin knockout mice, alpha-1 antitrypsin overexpressing mice, cathepsin B
knockout mice, and wild-type control mice. The successful completion of our proposed
studies for this project will reveal new mechanisms underlying the role of BMAL1 in the
regulation of renal ENaC and MARCKS and blood pressure control. Our long term goal
is to provide a better understanding for the pathogenesis of essential hypertension that
can potentially lead to novel drug targets and therapeutics."

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is an extremely prevalent condition consequent to the
hypoestrogenic changes in the genitourinary tract that affects up to 85% of perimenopausal and menopausal
women. Major symptoms of GSM include vaginal dryness, itching, discomfort, burning, and pain; thus, GSM
significantly impacts quality of life during everyday activities and severely impairs sexual function. Despite its
high prevalence and interference with healthy aging, current treatments for GSM are suboptimal, with many
issues related to accessibility or long-term efficacy. Despite an astoundingly low satisfaction of only 35% with
treatments for GSM, whether prescribed or over-the-counter, women continue to suffer from lack of better
options. Thus, there remains a need for a safe and accessible therapy for this morbid condition that can both
alleviate symptoms and restore a healthy vaginal phenotype. The proposed study will determine if a low-cost,
acellular, tissue-specific, and minimally invasive regenerative therapy can repair the atrophic vaginal tissue,
resulting in an accessible, high-impact intervention for GSM. Given our previous successes with tissue-specific
pro-regenerative biomaterials, we opine that a novel vaginal tissue-derived ECM hydrogel (vECM) will reverse
vaginal atrophy by inducing epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation as well as neovascularization when
delivered as a topical treatment, and by improving tissue elasticity and smooth muscle phenotype when delivered
via injection. Using a validated preclinical model of GSM and an array of diverse multi-scale tools, we will
comprehensively characterize alterations in vaginal structural and functional properties due to menopause. We
will then create a novel biomaterial designed specifically to women’s health and assess its efficacy in treating
GSM – a chronic and understudied condition that negatively impact lives of millions of women world-wide."
10875619,"Functional status—a summary of a patient’s physical, emotional, and social wellbeing—is a key index of disease risk, treatment outcome, quality of life, and overall healthcare usage across a wide range of clinical settings and patient populations. Especially in older patients with chronic pain, accurate functional assessments are critical for detecting age-related treatment side effects, disability, and decline. In older patients, pain is a leading, difficult-to-treat cause of disability that interferes with function and independence; however, many older patients lack access to or are unable to participate in traditional models of care. The lack of frequent, remotely available assessments of functional status is a clear barrier to improved patient care.  Digital devices promise to remotely capture real-time, real-world patient function and to inform clinical decisions in objective ways that are not now possible. Our team has shown that ubiquitous smartphones capture facets of functional status, but it is not known how separate measures might combine to form a concerted digital biomarker profile. Similarly, although 80% of Americans in their fifties and sixties own and use smartphones, the existing clinical ecosystem only uses these devices to coordinate face-to-face visits by teleconference. To impact and expand access to clinical care, a digital biomarker profile must demonstrate clinical utility (through scientific study) and usefulness (through engineered service design).  We have created the Pain Intervention and Digital Research (Pain-IDR) program, a research clinic designed to foster digital integration with clinical care. Overall, we present a unique opportunity for transformative work, providing a real-world clinical setting to develop and test workflows that maximize the utility of digital devices in two parallel aims: first, we will use patients’ own smartphones to define High-frequency Ecological Recordings of Mobility, Emotion, and Sociability (the HERMES phenotype). Second, we will partner with industry experts to engineer a clinical service design that implements the HERMES platform into the Pain-IDR workflow and will pilot decision support models in real-time, real-world patients.  To meet these research goals, I require formal training in longitudinal digital biomarker development, clinical program administration, and entrepreneurship. The primary mentoring team (Drs. Silbersweig, Insel, and Onnela) has extensive expertise in biomarker development, program administration, and entrepreneurship. Other key collaborators provide specific expertise in digital phenotyping (Dr. Baker) and health policy (Dr. Ahern), while consultants offer mentoring in program administration (Dr. Grossman), industry externships (Dr. Basu, Ms. Mazzone), and commercial digital health platform development (Mr. Barber and Mr. Whelan). Five years from now, we expect to deliver the HERMES phenotype as a candidate digital biomarker of functional status and, in parallel, the HERMES platform as viable toolset that integrates digital measures to support clinical decisions, to be further developed in future SBIR-supported projects."

Alterations and Renovations are proposed that will improve research laboratory facilities at three primarily
undergraduate network institutions in the Maine INBRE (ME-INBRE): the University of Maine Honors College
(UMHC), Southern Maine Community College (SMCC), and the University of Maine at Farmington (UMF). The
alterations and renovations will allow these network institutions to carry out INBRE-sponsored research
involving undergraduate students more effectively. To improve research facilities at UMHC, a darkroom will be
renovated to create a new confocal microscopy research and training laboratory that will be used by Honors
students who are conducting biomedical research as part of their pre-thesis and thesis research projects. The
200 sq. ft. laboratory, located in room 233 in Hitchner Hall, will house an Olympus FluoView FV1000 confocal
microscope in a modern space where Honors students can carry out research and receive individualized
training. The room is just down the hall from the Genomics Research Collaborative Laboratory where UMHC
students carry out team-based interdisciplinary research. Requested modifications include demolition,
carpentry, plumbing, HVAC, and electrical work to provide a functional microscopy room with adequate power
and cooling
. To improve research facilities at SMCC, a microscopy lab will be renovated. Currently, SMCC
students carrying out capstone research projects and independent projects for the microbiology course all rely
on light microscopes, housed in a
252 sq. ft. room
(MSC 112). The room is not optimal for this use, and
students observe extraneous vibration and motion in their experiments. To improve this facility, new thick black
epoxy resin topped counters will be installed with strong floor mounted brackets to increase stability. Additional
renovations include increasing the lab bench surface area to make more space available for student research
projects and installing open oak cabinetry in the storage areas for the light microscopes. To improve research
facilities at UMF, an 828 sq. ft. teaching lab (Ricker 222) will be renovated to make additional space for faculty
and student biomedical research. In its current configuration, the 36 x 23-foot space consists of six large,
moveable laboratory tables that seat three students per table. It is used as a lecture space for smaller, upper-
level courses and a laboratory space for field courses. To support faculty and student laboratory research,
these tables and some of the built-in storage cabinets will be removed and replaced with standing-height
laboratory benches that include benchtop storage shelves. Each of these laboratory benches will
accommodate a faculty member and two research students. The benches will be wired with GFI outlets, but
they will not be plumbed; an additional chemical resistant sink will be installed in the back of the lab."

analysis, and permit local upgrades of the instruments to meet specific needs. The institute is
fortunate to have a developer for custom software solutions in the LabVIEW program. LabVIEW is
widely used in virtually everyone of the laboratories described above. The programming environment
is icon driven as opposed to requiring sophisticated programming backgrounds. Therefore, it is easily

Improving health care for the medically underserved, including our Hispanic population, afflicted by
prevalent diseases, such as cancer, cardio-metabolic and infectious diseases, remains a major challenge.
Limited representation of racial and ethnic minorities in clinical and translational research is an important
challenge that limits the generalizability of results and contributes to the disproportionate disease burden in these
groups. There is a need to increase the representation of Hispanic research participants and researchers in
clinical and translational research to improve the generalizability and applicability of research findings and
identify ethnic-specific differences that could dictate changes in treatment guidelines and facilitate research in
this population. The Clinical Research Resources and Facilities Core of the Alliance is well positioned to address
the gap in the participation of Hispanic subjects in clinical research and increase the number of Hispanic
scientists participating in clinical and translational research, given their access to resident populations of both
underrepresented Hispanic participants and Hispanic scientists. The goal of the Clinical Research Resources
and Facilities Core (CRRF) is to facilitate and enhance safe and cost-effective clinical and translational
research, with an emphasis in health problems of Hispanics and medically underserved populations. The specific
objective is to provide a coordinated structure across a predominantly Hispanic IDeA jurisdiction to support
collaborative multi-and interdisciplinary clinical and translational research and increase the participation and
retention of Hispanic research participants. The rationale that underlies this proposal is that establishing and
integrating resources across multiple Hispanic-serving Institutions and groups, staffed by culturally consonant
investigators and staff, in a Hispanic US jurisdiction, will overcome many of the barriers that impact participation
of Hispanics in research, which in turn will translate into more studies and more data about diseases prevalent
in Hispanics. Our objective will be accomplished through three specific aims: 1) Establish an integrated network
of clinical and translational research resources and facilities to enhance cost-effective, multidisciplinary and inter-
disciplinary research, in health conditions prevalent among Hispanic populations; 2) Facilitate and increase the
recruitment and retention of research participants from underserved Hispanic communities; 3) Ensure that
clinical and translational research with human subjects is safe and of the highest quality. When these aims are
completed we will impact the representation of Caribbean Hispanics as study participants and as investigators."
10883796,"Abstract/Summary
Our understanding of individual and population health status, including the development of innovative
approaches to disease identification and treatment, is increasingly based on the availability and analyses of real-
world data (RWD) collected from environments where routine care is provided (e.g., electronic health records
(EHRs), claims and billing activities). When consolidated into clinical research data warehouses (CRDWs), RWD
become a critical source for medical data mining supporting clinical research/trials, as well as informing
healthcare in all facets of medicine. The goal of the Biomedical Informatics, Bioinformatics, and
Cyberinfrastructure Enhancement Core (BiBEC) is to strengthen and expand the tools and resources that supply
real world data specific to Hispanic populations, and develop programs that prepare skilled informaticians. In
addition, BiBEC is committed to increasing knowledge in biomedical informatics, bioinformatics, and health
informatics so that clinicians as well as clinical and translational researchers are informed consumer of said
services, understanding their applications in both clinical care and research environments. The central
hypothesis of the aims presented here is that informatics tools, and the necessary resources to fully utilize these
tools, can advance health and healthcare at all nodes along the clinical and translational research pathway. The
specific aims of BiBEC are to: 1) strengthen and expand existing health data infrastructure to improve clinical
care and best practices (electronic health records/clinical research data warehouse), 2) enhance the availability
and recruitment opportunities of Puerto Rican and other Hispanic populations into clinical and translational
research studies using technology-based innovations, and 3) develop training for clinicians and clinical and
translational researchers which will enable their use and application of available biomedical, bioinformatic,
and health informatics-related data and technologies. The innovation of BiBEC includes: 1) an operational,
secure clinical research data warehouse; 2) bilingual website that proactively supports the promotion of clinical
trial opportunities, with a community-facing web portal, where individuals may register as a volunteer in clinical
trials; 3) FISMA and HIPAA-compliant web-based data collection tools; and 4) training and continuing education
in biomedical informatics, health informatics, and bioinformatics that helps clinicians and clinical researchers be
informed consumers of biomedical and bioinformatics information and tools."
10883798,"Capacity building is necessary for supporting research on issues affecting human health in under-resourced
communities such as Puerto Rico. The Technologies and Resources for Research Laboratories Core (TRRCL)
is a component of the Hispanic Alliance for Clinical and Translational Research (the Alliance) composed of the
University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus (UPR-MSC), the Ponce Medical School Foundation
(PMSF), and the Universidad Central del Caribe (UCC). TRRCL services to clinical and translational
investigators in Puerto Rico has increased steadily from 2014 until 2019. Under the newly conceived Alliance,
the TRRCL team proposes to continue developing the capacity of TRRCL to fulfill the needs of clinical and
translational investigators who require specialized laboratory equipment and services to conduct their research.
It is expected that continuous access to cutting-edge technologies and laboratory resources facilitated by the
TRRCL will motivate more investigators to conduct clinical and translational research successfully and increase
the institutional capacity to address health issues impacting underserved Hispanic populations in Puerto Rico
and the rest of the US. The TRRCL´s main goal for this project is to improve shared research facilities for
investigators, and to improve access for investigators to these facilities. The objective of TRRCL is to ensure
that investigators that require laboratory space and technical support receive access to core laboratory services
thereby allowing for the timely completion and publication of their research projects. The central hypothesis is
that the TRRCL will catalyze an increase in active clinical and translational research projects in the Alliance
institutions. The TRRCL will achieve this by: 1) supporting the training of researchers in the Alliance institutions
and increasing researchers´ access to TRRCL cores and highly trained staff; 2) providing investigators the
technical expertise and infrastructure they need to produce reliable data that is of publication quality, and; 3)
enhancing the impact and outreach of the TRRCLby establishing collaborative agreements with other institutions
and by participation in community engagement activities. As the TRRCL usage increases, the team expects to
satisfy the increased demand by collaborating INBRE and COBRE research cores in Puerto Rico and in other

Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is characterized by the involuntary loss of skeletal muscle and adipose
tissue mass. This multifactorial syndrome is driven by the combination of reduced food intake and altered
systemic metabolism. Approximately half of all cancer patients present with complications associated with
cachexia, leading to increased mortality, functional impairment, and reduced quality of life. Effective therapies
to treat cancer-associated cachexia are currently lacking, with treatment focused on nutritional support and
symptom mitigation. Resolution of cachexia is optimally achieved through treatment of the underlying disease.
Targeting the metabolic alterations that drive cachexia to identify novel drug targets remains an area of active
inquiry.
Treatment of cachexia has remained elusive due to disease heterogeneity. Emerging evidence has suggested
there are multiple subtypes of this complex disease, which may explain the lack of consensus in the criteria
used to describe cancer-associated cachexia. Additionally, these definitions are further muddied in the context
of obesity, which can confound diagnoses of cachexia based upon body-mass index and hide loss of skeletal
muscle mass. While recent work has described the catabolic changes in metabolic organs such as skeletal
muscle, adipose tissue, and liver that occur with cachexia, as well as identified inflammatory mediators that
can drive these processes, further studies are needed to more comprehensively identify systemic physiological
changes that occur in CAC. This innovative proposal will address major gaps in our understanding of CAC:
 1) Do common cancer mutations modulate the development of CAC?
 2) How do dietary interventions impact the course of CAC?
Prior studies have been limited by lack of tractable, in vivo models of CAC that develop in an autochthonous
setting. Using genetically engineered mouse models, we identify a novel model of CAC that is driven by tumor
genetics and dietary intervention. Based upon characteristics of this model, we will identify novel potential drug
targets specific to subsets of cancer-associated cachexia."

Depression is the most common neuropsychiatric manifestation following stroke and current treatments are
largely ineffective. Depression has both direct and indirect effects on response to rehabilitation treatment, thus
subjects with post-stroke depression (PSD) are routinely excluded from rehabilitation trials and treatment options
for these individuals are extremely limited.
We propose to determine the efficacy of combining two known anti-depressant treatments shown to be effective
in non-stroke depression, aerobic exercise (AEx) and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), on
post-stroke depressive symptoms. Further, we will determine 1) the potential for AEx to enhance the effects of
rTMS to treat depression; and 2) whether successful reduction in depressive symptoms is associated with
improved recovery. This project is based on the scientific premise that depression negatively affects the potential
to adapt in response to treatment such that rehabilitation may not produce the same changes that it does in non-
depressed individuals. We hypothesize that effective treatment for PSD will result in a virtuous cycle whereby
reducing depression enhances response to rehabilitation, thereby facilitating functional gains. That is, effectively
treating depression will enable individuals to better recover from stroke. Furthermore, in addition to its beneficial
effects on depression, AEx is known to improve post-stroke motor recovery, thus providing an attractive option
for treating depression as well as an established vehicle to study the effects of PSD on response to rehabilitation.
The experiments proposed as part of this project are designed to address critical questions related to: 1) the
combined effects of AEx and rTMS (versus AEx or rTMS alone) on depressive symptoms; 2) the potential for
PSD to limit response to rehabilitation; and 3) the relationship between baseline subject attributes and response
to treatment."
10872767,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Chronic low back pain associated with disc degeneration is a leading cause of chronic pain and has a substantial
economic impact in the United States. Treatments for discogenic low back pain exhibit poor long-term efficacy
highlighting an important unmet medical need. However, efforts to improve pain management are hampered by
limited knowledge of the mechanisms underlying low back pain. Improving our understanding of the mechanisms
driving these chronic pain states is hampered by a lack of well characterized and validated preclinical models.
The current unmet need is a model of chronic low back pain that robustly mimics human presentation and
etiology. To develop a robust model of chronic discogenic low back pain, this proposal brings together experts
in orthopedics and animal models (Wachs) with neuroscience and behavioral measures of chronic pain (King).
The overarching goal of this proposal is to reproduce and validate a recently published rat model of disc
degeneration induced low back pain developed in Dr. Wachs’ lab. For the R61 portion of this proposal, we will
establish that this model can be reproduced in a second laboratory (King lab) to demonstrate external replication
of this new model of discogenic low back pain. To ensure consistency, Dr. Wachs and her veterinary surgeon
will both go to the King lab prior to the study start to train the King lab in the surgery and assays. Concurrent
animal studies will then be performed in the Wachs and King labs using the single puncture method in both sexes
of animals over an 18-week time course. Real-time disc degeneration will be monitored using either µCT or high-
speed x-ray. Pain-like behavior will be assessed using grip strength (evoked) and open arena (non-evoked)
testing. Post-processing will include histological analysis of disc degeneration, nerve growth, and inflammation.
Quantitative measures will be used to compare results between the Wachs and King labs to ensure robust model
reproducibility and provide tangible milestones for progression to the R33 phase. The R33 phase will consist of
external validation to establish face, construct, and predictive validity. Concurrent studies will be performed in
the Wachs and King labs over an 18-week time course. In this phase, we will increase resolution, frequency, and
quantification of assays to more accurately compare to human disease. For example, MRI will be used to
examine changes in disc degeneration and water content over time which, although more expensive, is more
directly comparable to the gold standard in human disease assessment. In addition, we will perform behavioral
analyses every three weeks to compare with the time course in humans. Histological analyses will be broadened
to include more robust analysis that will determine specific localization of nerves, blood vessels, and
inflammatory cells to allow comparison to previously published data of human biological features of discogenic
pain. Finally, we will use conditioned place preferences (CPP) testing in conjunction with administration of anti-
inflammatories to test predictive validity. The outcomes of this work have the potential to create a robust model
of discogenic pain with high translational potential."

This conference centers on the development and application of aquatic animal models to study various
aspects of human disease. Specifically, this meeting has focused on emerging systems in which to study
developmental mechanisms and tools to approach biomedical and clinical research. Many aquatic animals
have advantages and attributes that make them complementary and, in some cases, superior choices
compared to mammalian models to investigate complex scientific questions. As such, the current arsenal of
aquatic animal models plays important roles in advancing our understanding of the origins of human
disease and contribute to the study of drug targets and tests associated with the diagnosis, prevention and
treatment of disease. The Aquatic Models of Human Disease Conference (AQMHD) is the only conference
that brings together discussion of multiple common and emerging models used to investigate the full range
of human disease. The AQMHD meeting presents a wide range of innovative studies that leverage on
unique aquatic models, methods and technologies that improve the conceptual understanding of the
complexity of human disease. This year’s addition will focus on “Discovery Through Diversity” and will use
this theme to both recruit new and more diverse investigators as well as new and more diverse models.
Texas State University and the Xiphophorus Genetic Stock Center will host the 11th conference in this
series in October 2024, bringing together researchers from the U.S. and around the world to engage in a
program designed by recognized leaders in the field to provide state-of-the-art information on advances in
the use of aquatic animals in biomedical research. This is an important opportunity to host this aquatic
model conference in one of the United States fastest growing epicenters for biomedical research, the Texas
IH-35 corridor. The dissemination of information, formal and informal engagement in discussion, and
collaborative exchange of ideas will be achieved through a series of platform presentations, workshops, and
poster sessions. New investigators, women investigators, investigators with disabilities and under-
represented minorities will be actively recruited to participate in this meeting through mechanisms such as
travel awards and a dedicated workshop. An important outcome of this meeting is to provide new
investigators with ideas, background, and mentoring required to improve the quality of grant applications
submitted to multiple NIH institutes, and to promote the building of novel tools for development of therapies
and an understanding of disease etiology."
10904510,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The goal of our program, Promoting Underrepresented and Marginalized Populations’ Advancement in the
Sciences (PUMAS), is to increase the number of well-trained biomedical research scientists from groups that
are traditionally underrepresented in the field. We propose to do this by providing twelve summer research
opportunities in Gladstone labs for community college students from such backgrounds. When students from
underrepresented and marginalized populations (URMs) gain first-hand experience in state-of-the-art labs such
as those at Gladstone, they are more prepared for success in their pursuit of science, technology, engineering,
or math (STEM) degrees when they transfer to a four-year institution, and more likely to pursue advanced
degrees in biomedical research. This then increases the number of URMs who apply for graduate school and
diversifies biomedical research. For nine weeks each summer, the PUMAS participants are paired with a
scientific mentor at Gladstone to work on a specific research project in a number of biomedical fields including
cardiovascular disease and pulmonary diseases. They spend 75% of their time doing biomedical research,
including independent research activities, receiving one-on-one mentoring and attending laboratory meetings,
scientific lectures, seminars and journal clubs. They spend the other 25% of their time participating in
supplementary educational activities, which include a week-long biotech boot-camp and a series of professional
development workshops geared to inspire students and develop them as scientists, better prepared to pursue
undergraduate and graduate degrees in the sciences. The PUMAS program culminates with a poster session in
which students describe their research, hypotheses and findings to the scientific community at Gladstone,
allowing them to increase their self-identity as scientists. The PUMAS program recruits students who are
currently enrolled in a community college, have successfully completed at least two semesters of college-level
science courses with a lab component (chemistry and molecular biology preferred, but not required), and who
intend to transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a baccalaureate degree in STEM. We do this primarily by
marketing the PUMAS program to 27 community colleges through their science professors and directors of
programs like Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) within the Bay Area. We also do wider
outreach via webinars, podcasts, career fairs and diversity conferences to reach community college students
with a strong STEM interest. We chose to focus on community college students because this population is often
overlooked and has the highest percentage of URM students both by race/ethnicity and by economic
disadvantage enrolled across systems of higher education in our state."
10902580,"Loss-of-function BRCA1/2 mutations lead to defective homologous recombination (HR) activity, a
frontline DNA damage repair pathway that accurately addresses double-strand breaks. In the absence of
sufficient HR activity, BRCA1/2-deficient cancers are suggested to activate a non-canonical DNA maintenance
mechanism dependent on the oncoprotein cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A). CIP2A
colocalizes with the genome stability factor TOPBP1 at sites of DNA damage during mitosis. This complex is
suggested to physically tether fragmented chromosomes and centromere-bearing counterparts to ensure proper
division and cancer cell survival. After mitosis, chromosome fragments can undergo chromothripsis, a large-
scale error-prone genomic rearrangement. Chromothriptic fragments also rely on CIP2A for proper division in
the next cell cycle to ultimately potentiate oncogenesis. CIP2A knockdown is lethal in BRCA1/2-deficient cancers
but does not harm HR-proficient cells, indicating CIP2A to be a unique therapeutic vulnerability. However, a
bonafide CIP2A inhibitor has not yet been produced via standard drug discovery efforts and may require
innovative strategies. Recent chemoproteomic analyses identified nucleophilic cysteine residues in CIP2A that
can be covalently labeled (“liganded”) with electrophiles. While lead fragments provide starting points for further
development, these scaffolds also non-selectively engage other proteins. Furthermore, the functional
consequences of labeling CIP2A are unknown. The proposal will therefore achieve chemical inhibition of CIP2A
using covalent degraders (e.g., PROTAC) and focuses on the following aims: (1) Identify potent and selective
covalent ligands for CIP2A. (2) Develop heterobifunctional probes and evaluate proximity-dependent
degradation of CIP2A. (3) Analyze chemical inhibition of CIP2A in BRCA1/2-deficient cells. Encouragingly,
preliminary data indicate the proposed ligands label CIP2A in both cellular and in vitro settings. Building on these
results, the first aim will synthesize a focused probe collection based on computational guidance and then assess
target engagement using a state-of-the-art chemoproteomic workflow. In the second aim, selective ligands will
be converted into heterobifunctional degraders and characterized for CIP2A degradation in BRCA1/2-deficient
cells. The third aim will then evaluate the cellular activity of covalent degraders by tracking phenotypes indicative
of CIP2A inhibition and defective mitosis. This proposal will provide valuable chemical tools to probe CIP2A
function and lay the foundation for therapeutics to treat BRCA1/2-deficient cancers. During this fellowship, I am
grateful to be mentored by multiple professors from the Rockefeller University: Tarun Kapoor, my advisor, a
master in chemical probe design and cell division biology; Jiankun Lyu, an expert in computational chemistry;
Ekaterina Vinogradova, a leader in chemoproteomics. Their mentorship will be supplemented with additional
training both within Rockefeller and in the broader academic community. This fellowship represents an essential
step towards my goal of performing independent research at the interface of chemical and cancer biology."

PROJECT SUMMARY
Up to 45% of all cervical cancer screening in the United States is considered to be overuse, despite consensus guidelines and strong evidence of the limited benefit and potential harm of low-value screening. Overscreening for cervical cancer includes screening more frequently than is recommended or outside the recommended age groups. Overscreening can lead to increased false positives and psychosocial harms, cause unnecessary treatment of cervical abnormalities that would likely resolve on their own, and result in excess financial and opportunity costs. While there are several implementation strategies shown to be effective for increasing cervical cancer screening, it is largely unknown how best to decrease overscreening in routine care. As such, there is a critical need to develop effective strategies for ensuring de-implementation of outdated screening practices. To help fill this gap, this study will 1) test the independent and combined effects of patient- and clinician-directed de-implementation strategies on rates of cervical cancer overscreening in comparison to usual care, and 2) evaluate contextual mechanisms contributing to the success or failure of each de-implementation strategy using coincidence analysis. To achieve these aims, a 2x2 randomized controlled trial with approximately 200 clinicians and 2,400 patients will be conducted in primary care and gynecology clinics affiliated with a large healthcare system with high rates of cervical cancer overscreening. The highly efficient factorial and pragmatic design will enable assessment of independent and combined effects of each strategy. Drawing from systematic evidence of the effectiveness of nudge strategies to increase guideline adherence and an integrated theoretical model, the specific de-implementation strategies to be tested are: 1) theory-based messaging shown to be effective at decreasing overscreening intentions (patient nudge strategy); and 2) point of care reminders alerting clinicians if patients are not due for screening (clinician nudge strategy). The primary de-implementation outcome is reduction in the rate of cervical cancer overscreening among females who are not due for screening based on evidence-based guidelines. Secondary de-implementation outcomes, including reach, acceptability, and feasibility, and implementation costs, and clinical outcomes including rate of abnormal results, false-positives, and diagnostic  procedures will also be measured. Following the trial, a stratified, embedded cohort of patients and clinicians will be surveyed and interviewed to evaluate contextual factors contributing to the success or failure of each strategy using coincidence analysis. This innovative project responds directly to the call by the National Cancer Institute to develop and test de-implementation strategies in cancer control. Further, the proposed low-touch strategies are designed to support widespread and equitable implementation across diverse settings, and, if successful, be translated to address other forms of overuse across primary and specialty care. This work will also help to broadly advance causal theory in de-implementation science by evaluating underlying contextual mechanisms that contribute to the effectiveness of strategies among diverse populations."

Odors are capable of potently influencing emotional and behavioral responses. The ability to detect odors and
assign them hedonic value, or valence, is essential to navigating a world filled with rewards and dangers.
Olfactory sensory loss is correlated with changes in emotional responses, reductions in memory, lack of appetite,
and overall apathy. Despite strong evidence that odors acquire appetitive and aversive valence, the neural
circuitry underlying odor valence learning is unknown. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) acts as a hub for the
integration of multisensory information, including olfactory input, with aversive and appetitive outcomes. While
there is ample compelling evidence that the BLA encodes for positive (reward) odor valence encoding, whether
the same holds true for negative (aversive) odor valence learning is not clear. This is especially true given that
studies to date used mildly aversive quinine, which could obscure the firing dynamics associated with more highly
aversive outcomes. Dopamine is a potent neurotransmitter that influences cellular plasticity and learning in the
BLA, but its influence on odor-valence behavioral learning is unclear. In the proposed F31 NRSA, I will test the
hypothesis that through learning, BLA neurons represent the full spectrum of odor valence, both positive and
negative, and that the display of learned odor valence behaviors is regulated by dopamine. I will use a
combination of electrophysiological and computational methods, optogenetic stimulation, and site-specific
pharmacology as mice engage in a go/no-go behavioral task wherein odors are either rewarded or punished.
The results from Aim 1 will demonstrate that BLA neurons encode the full spectrum of learned odor valence
while the results from Aim 2 will determine the influence of dopamine within the BLA on odor valence learning
behavior. Overall, these findings will enhance our understanding of how the brain processes and assigns
emotional significance to odors. Furthermore, the results from this project will expand our understanding and
appreciation for the role of dopamine in olfactory processing, and has implications for human disorders
characterized by disturbed affective regulation."
10903193,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory bowel disease of the large intestine, impacting millions worldwide. UC
patients commonly experience significant weight loss, diarrhea, bloody stool, decreased quality of life, and
susceptibility to colon cancer. Current medications for UC include antibiotics, corticosteroids, and biological
drugs, which can have deleterious off-target effects that contribute to increased susceptibility to severe infections
and chronic immunosuppression. Thus, there is a need to develop safe and effective strategies to treat UC.
Although the pathogenesis of UC is vague, evidence suggests that disrupted interactions between the host
immune system and the gut microbiome play a role in the disease initiation and progression. Indeed, most UC
symptoms are believed to be caused by an imbalance between mucosal immunity and intestinal microbiota
resulting in excessive intestinal inflammation. Similarly, microbial metabolites have been implicated as key
regulators of the intestinal barrier contributing to UC pathogenesis. Thus, improving the immune, microbiome,
and metabolite signatures may improve clinical outcome for UC patients. Natural products have been the most
significant source of drugs and drug leads in history and have shown promise in treating UC with fewer side-
effects. We have identified that panaxynol (Pax), a bioactive component of American ginseng, can suppress
colitis and improve disease severity. My data demonstrates that Pax-treated mice display 1) improved disease
activity index, 2) better endoscopic scores, 3) greater intestinal barrier function 4) reduced crypt distortion, 5)
decreased goblet cell and mucus loss, 6) enhanced differentiation of Tregs, and 7) suppression of pro-colitis gut
bacterial populations in a mouse model of colitis. Its exact underlying mechanism, however, remains unclear.
Under the auspices of this F31, I will expand my current findings to examine immune, microbiome, and metabolite
signatures as potential mediators of the benefits of Pax in colitis. Thus, the primary purpose of my proposed F31
is to understand the mechanisms whereby Pax improves gut resilience in colitis. To accomplish this, I will utilize
multiple models of colitis, a clinically attainable Pax dose, both male and female mice, immune, microbiome,
metabolite profiling, and mechanistic approaches (immune and microbiome ablation strategies). My central
hypothesis is that the beneficial effects of Pax in colitis are mediated via its actions on the host immune system
and the gut microbiome and metabolites. To test this hypothesis, I propose two related but independent aims: 1)
Characterize the immune profile following Pax treatment in colitis; 2) Determine whether the microbiome
contributes to Pax-mediated improvements in colitis. The proposed studies align with my training aims and will
provide me with the opportunity to gain expertise in immune profiling and ablation strategies, assessment and
manipulation of the microbiome, and examination of microbial metabolites and omics in the context of natural
products and colitis. Further, the professional development training will promote advancement to the next step
in my path to research independence – a postdoctoral position in the field of gut health."

Our research has identified a murine intercalated cell deficiency model that is susceptible to pyelonephritis. We have also demonstrated that human and murine intercalated cells produce and secrete antimicrobial peptides. Others have demonstrated that intercalated cells act as the first site in the kidney that responds to Gram-negative organisms via pattern recognition receptor signaling pathways. Thus, surmounting evidence suggests that intercalated cells perform a critical role in the innate defense of the kidney. 
In prior studies we performed single cell mRNA sequencing on human kidneys following stimulation with uropathogenic E. coli.  “Phagosome maturation” was a key intercalated cell pathway. We then developed methodology to visualize bacteria phagocytosing bacteria and demonstrated this function in real-time. We hypothesize that intercalated cells employ the processes to phagocytose bacteria that they utilize to regulate acid-base balance and that this phagocytosis may be enhanced during UTI. We know that intercalated cells can phagocytose bacteria. We will explore the role of carbonic anhydrase and V-ATPase in intercalated cell phagocytosis using real time imaging in live mice (Aim 1a), complementary flow cytometry studies (Aim 1b) and on pyelonephritis susceptibility (Aim 1c) 
Our long-term research goal is to develop new pyelonephritis treatment strategies that reduce antibiotic exposure and preserve renal function in populations at risk. The proposed research will provide the foundation to include modulation of intercalated cells in pyelonephritis management, thereby expanding treatment scope beyond antibiotics. "
10902859,"SUMMARY
Regulated exocytosis is a conserved eukaryotic process that is essential for numerous cellular functions,
making it a prime target for exploitation by both infectious and non-infectious diseases. Indeed, various
malignancies, viruses, bacteria, and protozoa commandeer this pathway to promote disease progression.
Numerous studies have interrogated the molecular players of regulated exocytosis that are modulated in
cancer formation, including the conserved second messengers, calcium (Ca2+) and sphingosine-1-phosphate
(S1P). However, far less is known about the mechanisms that intracellular bacterial pathogens employ to
exploit this process. Human granulocytic anaplasmosis is an emergent disease caused by the obligate
intracellular vacuolar-adapted bacterium, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap). Ap is a tick-transmitted pathogen
that exhibits an unusual tropism for neutrophils. A primary function of neutrophils is to destroy microorganisms
through degranulation, a form of regulated exocytosis. Intriguingly, both Ap-infected neutrophils and ticks
exhibit prolonged degranulation and increased exocytosis, respectively. We recently published that the Ap-
containing vacuole (ApV) resembles a host multivesicular body (an organelle that undergoes regulated
exocytosis) and that late-stage ApVs mobilize to and fuse with the plasma membrane to release Ap into
extracellular milieu for reinfection. Our preliminary results indicate that intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i),
sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1 [produces S1P]), and S1P are increased late in Ap infection and that inhibition of Ap
protein synthesis prevents these phenomena as well as ApV exocytosis. These data suggest that Ap
manipulates regulated exocytosis for egress. We also uncovered a potential mechanistic role for the Ap
effector, P130, in this process. P130 is upregulated during late Ap infection and localizes to the cytosolic face
of the ApV membrane. We discovered that P130 interacts with host calcium and integrin-binding protein 1
(CIB1), which, to date, has been indirectly implicated in regulated exocytosis. CIB1 also localizes with P130 on
exocytosing ApVs, further supporting its role in Ap dissemination. In Aim 1, we will interrogate the relevance of
[Ca2+]i and S1P to ApV exocytosis and infectious progeny release using in vitro and in vivo approaches. In Aim
2, we will identify the P130 domains necessary for its interaction with CIB1 and its promotion of ApV exocytosis
as well as determine the relevance of CIB1 to ApV exocytosis in vitro and in vivo. This work will advance our
fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that intracellular bacterial pathogens utilize to facilitate their
release and potentially define novel roles for CIB1 in host cell biology and infectious disease."

Heat shock protein (Hsp) 104, from budding yeast, belongs to the AAA+ (ATPase associated with various cellular
activities) family of Hsp100 protein disaggregases, and plays vital roles in protein homeostasis and cell stress
response. Hsp104 collaborates with the Hsp70 molecular chaperone system to target and solubilize amorphous
and amyloid aggregates. These aggregates are associated with toxic phenotypes and, in humans, are
associated various neurodegenerative diseases. Our lab and others discovered how Hsp104 utilizes an ATP
hydrolysis-driven ‘hand over hand’ substrate translocation mechanism to solubilize aggregates. However, the
contribution and interaction mechanisms of the Hsp70 molecular chaperone system in initiating and enhancing
Hsp104’s activity remains poorly understood. Using cryo-EM, we determined the first substrate-bound structures
of Hsp104, which reveal how large conformational changes of the two-nucleotide binding AAA+ domains can
facilitate processive translocation while simultaneously maintaining substrates in an unfolded state along the
central channel. While previous work has indicated that Hsp70 binds the Hsp104 middle domain to facilitate
substrate loading, a recent cryo-EM study proposes that Hsp70 promotes substrate re-folding downstream of
Hsp104 activity through these same interactions. Here, my goal is to dissect the exact mechanism of the
substrate-loading model by defining the structure and mechanism of the Hsp70 molecular chaperone system’s
contribution to assisting Hsp104 in substrate targeting and disaggregation. To achieve this, I will employ a
biochemical proteolysis assay to allow substrate disaggregation, but prevent potential refolding by the Hsp70
molecular chaperone system, thereby assessing specifically the substrate loading model. Additionally, I will utilize
single-particle cryo-EM to determine the precise interaction between Hsp70 and Hsp104 and how this affects
Hsp104’s substrate-bound conformations. Capturing a high-resolution structure of Hsp104 interacting with
Hsp70 has proven challenging due to Hsp104 flexible domains and transient interaction with Hsp70. However,
through our collaboration with Dr. James Shorter at the University of Pennsylvania, we have access to various
Hsp104 mutants that can stabilize interaction with Hsp70. I plan to utilize these mutants to form a stable
interaction between Hsp104 and Hsp70, thereby allowing me to capture novel substrate-bound Hsp104
conformations and resolve transient interactions. These planned studies will significantly advance our knowledge
of how AAA+ disaggregases interact with other chaperone proteins, thereby permitting targeting and
disaggregation of toxic amyloid aggregates, shedding light on essential processes underlying protein
homeostasis and neurodegenerative diseases."
10880657,"ABSTRACT
Glaucoma is a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, but the mechanisms of damage are not fully
understood. The retinal ganglion cells (RGC) and their axons transmit visual information from the retina to the
brain, and these axons pass out of the eye through the scleral canal at the optic nerve head (ONH), which is
spanned by a fenestrated connective tissue structure known as the lamina cribrosa (LC). The preponderance
of evidence suggests that the RGC axons are damaged in the laminar region of the ONH in glaucoma. One of
the most consistent glaucoma risk factors is elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), although the “safe” IOP
threshold varies widely among individuals. While there is some evidence that IOP fluctuations contribute to
glaucoma, prior studies have been hampered by the absence of continuous IOP measurement. Retrobulbar
cerebrospinal fluid pressure (CSFP) surrounding the optic nerve partially counteracts IOP at the LC through
the translaminar pressure (TLP=IOP-CSFP). Retrospective clinical studies have suggested that higher CSFP
(and low TLP) is protective for glaucoma and low CSFP (and high TLP) increases glaucoma risk, after
accounting for the effects of IOP. In addition, since the LC bears the bulk of the pressure load in the ONH due
to its high stiffness relative to the surrounding neural tissues, LC thickness plays a critical role in the
distribution of TLP in the ONH via the translaminar pressure gradient (TLPG = TLP/LC thickness), adding a
morphological component to TLP. Hence, the goal of this project is to test the hypotheses that IOP, TLP, and
TLPG fluctuations independently contribute to eye-specific susceptibility to glaucoma onset and progression
after accounting for differential mean IOP in fellow eyes, and confirm the recent finding that CSFP and IOP are
coupled via neural pathways. In this project, we will perform mechanical compliance testing to quantify LC
deformations in vivo in response to controlled acute TLP challenge, in an animal model of unilateral glaucoma
instrumented with continuous IOP, CSFP, TLP, and TLPG telemetry. We will then determine the relationships
between axonal and visual function loss per unit of differential mean IOP in fellow eyes and 1) transient and
diurnal IOP fluctuation, 2) TLP and TLPG (mean and fluctuation) and 3) LC deformations in response to acute
TLP challenge, measured while the eye is normal and after glaucoma onset and progression. Impact: If results
show that IOP fluctuations, TLP and/or TLPG contribute to glaucoma pathogenesis and progression in addition
to mean IOP, new therapeutic approaches could be developed to modulate these factors to treat glaucoma."

economic mobile health interventions for risky alcohol users. The applicant has a multifaceted and productive
background in behavioral economics and clinical psychology, with F31 and T32 funding from NIAAA since
2014. The overall goal of this K23 is to support Dr. Coughlin in pursuing training and research experiences to
integrate mobile intervention development methods with behavioral economics to address risky alcohol use in
underserved populations. Career Development Plan: Dr. Coughlin’s career development plan builds on her
clinical psychology training and addiction research experience, filling gaps in her professional development to
establish the knowledge base, skills, and professional collaborations to become a leader in the field of mobile
alcohol use interventions for rural populations. Her comprehensive training plan involves participation in
scientific conferences, methods workshops, coursework, and mentorship from leaders in the field, Drs.
Frederic Blow and Inbal Nahum-Shani, along with a team of contributors. These activities will develop her
expertise in: 1) early alcohol use interventions for rural risky drinkers, 2) mobile collection and analysis of
intensive longitudinal daily-level data to inform interventions, and 3) preparation, optimization, and evaluation
of mobile multicomponent interventions. These training experiences interface with the proposed research aims
with the overall goal of improving the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of behavioral interventions for alcohol
misuse, consistent with the NIAAA’s mission and strategic plans. Research Plan: Dr. Coughlin will use skills
gained through training activities in her complementary research plan, guided by the Multiphase Optimization
Strategy (MOST) framework, to develop a mobile multicomponent behavioral intervention to reduce alcohol
use in rural risky drinkers. She will refine two promising intervention components based on behavioral
economic theories of addiction for remote, text message-based delivery prior to 3-waves of field testing of the
intervention components and focus testing interviews to incorporate iterative end-user feedback from rural risky
drinkers (N=15) recruited from primary care (Aim 1). In the same population and using a randomized factorial
trial, Aim 2 will ensure intervention preparation through assessment of acceptability and technical feasibility of
the intervention components alone and in combination (N=75), along with preliminary evaluation of candidate
behavioral economic mechanisms of change. Consistent with the MOST framework, Aim 2 outcomes will
inform a subsequent R01 submission to optimize the mobile behavioral economically informed (mBE)
intervention in rural risky drinkers. Over the long-term, data from this study will strategically inform behavior
change interventions that directly target behavioral economic constructs and alcohol use outcomes in a
population with significant health disparities in access to care."

chronic phase of infection. On the other hand, while women exhibit similarly effective levels of viral suppression
on antiretroviral treatment (HART), they do bear a greater burden of non-AIDS comorbidities than men. These
observations likely result from a complex interaction between a number of viral, hormonal and immunological
factors, including the increased production of type I interferons (IFN) in women which can simultaneously
cause immune activation as well as restriction of viral replication. In order to understand the molecular basis of
these sex-based differences, we propose three Specific Aims:
Aim 1: Assess sex-specific differences in immunological and transcriptional profiles of CD4+ T cells in
early infection.
Aim 2: In ART-suppressed women and men, define the landscape of immune cell activation, the nature
of the latent reservoir, and its potential for reactivation in the presence and absence of sex hormones.
Aim 3: Define the mechanism and cell source of sex hormone modulation of viral replication in vitro.
The proposed experiments will fill a significant gap in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying
observed differences in HIV-1 disease course and comorbidities between men and women, an important
question at a time when sex differences are clearly defining distinct disease outcomes in various disease
settings."

The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the U.S. is expected to reach 12.7 million by 2050 if successful
disease-modifying treatments are not identified. Without a better understanding of the genetic and neuronal
mechanisms that drive AD progression, the development of new therapeutics to enhance cognitive longevity
will remain limited. Alternatively, therapeutic strategies to promote cognitive resilience in the face of AD
pathology are potentially effective methods to lessen the impact of AD. To identify gene candidates of
resiliency I quantified neurodegeneration in the brains of the translationally-relevant AD-BXD mouse model of
AD via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and used these imaging outcomes to complete genetic mapping. Using
this approach, I identified Leucine Rich Repeat And Fibronectin Type III Domain Containing 2 (Lrfn2) as a
potentially causal gene modifying AD-related cortical neurodegeneration. I hypothesize that Lrfn2
overexpression will rescue AD-related cortical neurodegeneration, synaptic dysfunction, and cognitive decline
in the 5XFAD model of AD. I will test this hypothesis by developing a novel Lrfn2 overexpression transgenic
mouse and evaluating the impact of changes in Lrfn2 expression on AD progression in three aims. Aim 1) I will
measure the extent of cortical neurodegeneration in 5XFAD and nontransgenic mice with and without Lrfn2
overexpression in both male and female mice at 6 and 14 months of age. Results will indicate whether Lrfn2 is
truly a causal modifier of cortical neurodegeneration. Aim 2a) To test the impact of Lrfn2 overexpression on
synaptic plasticity I will perform ex vivo whole-cell current-clamp electrophysiology recordings in a separate
cohort of mice. I will determine if overexpression of Lrfn2 in excitatory forebrain neurons rescues long-term
potentiation deficits in 5XFAD animals. Aim 2b) To investigate the effect of Lrfn2 on synaptic structure, I will
image dendritic spines to assess changes in spine morphology and density as a complementary measure of
synapse stability and synaptic function associated with cognitive performance. Aim 3) To evaluate the role of
Lrfn2 as a potential resilience factor to cognitive decline, I will execute mouse behavioral tasks measuring
working, short-term, long-term, and working memory in the same mice used in Aim 1. To our knowledge, this
will be the first study to evaluate Lrfn2 expression in the context of aging, AD, and cortical neurodegeneration.
With the successful completion of these aims, I will achieve my long-term goal for this project by determining
whether Lrfn2 modulation is a novel resilience therapeutic for AD treatment. The proposed work will facilitate
the achievement of my training goals to acquire new skills and knowledge related to IHC, imaging,
electrophysiology, dendritic spine characterization, behavioral assays, general wet-lab techniques, and
professional development. Overall, the guidance of Drs. O'Connell and Kaczorowski; access to the outstanding
core resources at The Jackson Laboratory; and the experience gained from this fellowship will be a significant
step toward achieving my long-term career goal of becoming an independent academic scientist."
10903548,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Culturally competent assessment tools are a crucial component in providing bilingual Latinx
children with a free and appropriate public education. However, many assessment tools used with
culturally and linguistically diverse children are based on WEIRD norms. Health disparities occur
when children’s linguistic skills are measured up against WEIRD norms rather than practices from
their own linguistic and cultural communities. This research will (1) provide documentation of
storytelling practices and styles for bilingual Latinx children and (2) compare the utility of using
measures derived from within the linguistic community with measures derived from WEIRD language
norms. Ethnographic observations, interviews, and surveys will serve as the main methods to gather
what storytelling practices bilingual Latinx children with DLD are typically exposed to. Narrative
sample analysis will be utilized to analyze children’s narratives. Two scoring systems will then be
used: one derived from the data gathered in (1) and the other will be based on extant, traditional
measures of narratives. By documenting the storytelling practices of bilingual Latinx children with
DLD, we can utilize culturally and linguistically appropriate descriptions of linguistic backgrounds for
linguistically minoritized children with disabilities. By comparing performance based on
community-generated measures with extant measures of narratives, we can learn which methods best
fit culturally specific ways of telling stories in narrative performance. This will allow us to understand
normal linguistic processes in culturally and linguistically diverse communities that we can then use
to understand disordered linguistic processes in these communities, thereby reducing health
disparities. This fellowship includes mentorship and training opportunities with researchers across
California, including a data collection site in Santa Ana, CA. The training goals for this fellowship
include training in qualitative research methods and psychometrics."
10890976,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare, highly aggressive, neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Notably,
approximately half of all MCC patients with advanced or metastatic disease respond to anti-PD1/PD-L1 as a
first-line immunotherapy treatment, making it one of the most responsive solid tumors to immune checkpoint
blockade (ICB). The initial response rate strongly suggests that immune system function is critical for recognizing
and attacking MCC cells and perhaps can be restored and activated. Another interesting feature of MCC is that
there are two distinct disease etiologies. In a majority of MCC tumors, there is clonal integration of Merkel cell
polyomavirus (MCPyV) and expression of the viral antigens small T antigen (ST) and a truncated large T antigen
(tLT) that drive oncogenesis. The nonviral subset of MCC (MCCN) is driven by UV damage and has a high
mutational burden. In polyomavirus-positive MCC (MCCP), the viral antigens allow investigation into the adaptive
immune response in a cancer setting. Indeed, studies have extensively characterized the CD8+ and CD4+ T
cells that recognize large T antigen peptides in MCCP. Some MCC studies indicate that the presence of
circulating and tumor infiltrating MCPyV specific T cells can improve overall survival. However, there is conflicting
data to support that overall survival and response to immunotherapy are strongly correlated to CD8+ T cell
infiltration. Therefore, other immune cells in the tumor microenvironment of MCC may be contributing to
an antitumor response either directly through effector functions or indirectly through modulating T cell
activity. Recently, tertiary lymphoid structures, whose formation is driven by the recruitment of B cells, were
identified in both MCCP and MCCN subtypes and were associated with a favorable prognostic outcome. Aside
from their documented presence in MCC tumors, the role of B cells in MCC is not well understood. Tumor-
infiltrating B cells (TIL-Bs) are an emerging area of interest in cancer immunology. TIL-Bs can have pleiotropic
roles in tumor immunity that affect overall survival and immunotherapy response in many cancer types. However,
what defines the pro or antitumor role of B cells in the tumor microenvironment may depend on which B cell
subsets are present, their frequency, and where they are localized in the tumor microenvironment. Given that
both subtypes of MCC are highly responsive to ICB and that immune activation is potent in MCC, I
hypothesize that TIL-Bs in the tumor microenvironment will have characteristics of antitumor immunity
and will have a direct antigen-specific response to drive antitumor immunity. I will investigate this
hypothesis with the following aims: 1) Determine the landscape of B cells in the tumor microenvironment of MCC
and 2) Characterize the antigen specific responses of B cells in MCC."
10904132,"Economic choice is specifically disrupted in mental and neurological disorders such as major depression,
frontotemporal dementia, and drug addiction. Established literature links this behavior to the orbitofrontal cortex
(OFC). In recent years, my lab has examined neuronal activity in the OFC of monkeys and mice choosing
between different juice types. Our studies revealed the presence of different cell groups: offer value cells
encoding the value of individual offers; choice outcome cells encoding the identity of the chosen offer or the
chosen action; and chosen value cells. In a computational sense, these variables capture both the input (offer
value) and the output (choice outcome, chosen value) of the choice process, suggesting that the cell groups
identified in OFC constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Indirect evidence supports this hypothesis.
However, the anatomical organization of this circuit and the contributions of different cell groups are not known.
Consequently, the decision mechanisms remain poorly understood. To shed light on these fundamental
questions, we developed a preparation in which mice perform economic choices while we record from OFC
using two-photon (2P) calcium (Ca2+) imaging through a GRIN lens. Longitudinal recordings showed that the
encoding of specific decision variables by individual cells is very stable. Moreover, the representation of
decision variables differs significantly across cortical layers: input variables populate mostly layers 2/3 (L2/3),
while spatial and output variables populate mostly layer 5 (L5). These results support the notion of a stable
decision circuit and provide a glimpse of its anatomical organization. However, to truly unravel the decision
mechanisms, one needs to have a detailed understanding of how different cell groups connect with each other,
how they influence each other’s activity, and how the activity of each cell group affects choices. Here we
propose to address these questions using a combination of 2P imaging and single cell optogenetics. In Aim 1,
we will assess the effective connectivity between cell groups. Mice will (a) be implanted with a GRIN lens
accessing L2/3 and/or L5, (b) express a green Ca2+ indicator and a red shifted channelrhodopsin (ChR), and
(c) perform choices under the microscope. In each mouse, we will image ~500 cells. First, we will assess the
variable encoded by each cell. In separate sessions, while animals rest, we will holographically stimulate one
specific cell group while imaging the entire population. Measuring the activity evoked by the stimulation, we will
assess the effective connectivity between different cell groups. In Aim 2, we will use the same preparation, but
we will deliver the stimulation while mice perform choices (in half of the trials). We will measure how optical
stimulation affects performance, and thus assess the causal links between individual cell groups and choices.
Relevance to R21. These experiments are innovative and technically challenging (high risk), but they can
potentially provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms underlying economic decisions (high reward).
The proposal is exploratory, but we have the background and expertise to successfully conduct this research."
10899504,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Distinctive host-pathogen interactions and adaptations are the cornerstones of co-evolution between eukaryotes
and their viral pathogens. Given the rapid replication and mutation rates of RNA viruses within their host,
understanding these intra-host interactions in their native tissue context is central to developing next-generation
anti-viral and vaccines. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to thwart eradication due to SARS-CoV-2
Variants of Concern (VoC), where even minor changes to the spike protein can affect cellular entry, antibody
neutralization, vaccine efficacy and immune responses, thus leading to immune escape. Why do these variants,
along with other Severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs), differ in their
host pathogenesis, and how do they achieve that? Are there differential host factors or responses that
influence tissue-specific tropism? These questions need to be answered with controlled experimental
approaches to dissect and deconvolute the coevolutionary viral-host interactions in situ. This proposal seeks to
combine powerful reverse genetics systems, next-generation tissue imaging platforms and robust animal models
towards the systematic determination of host immune responses, virus evasion strategies and both inter- and
intra-host viral dynamics. We propose to use these powerful methodologies to first determine host tissue
responses to individual VoCs within human COVID-19 autopsies and non-human primate necropsies. Next, we
seek to combine spatial-lineage tracing with tagged SARS-CoV-2 VoCs and other SARSr-CoVs that use ACE2
for entry in the humanized ACE2-K18 mouse model. To recapitulate intra-host viral variation in vivo, we will
engineer these viruses to include a short sequence of peptides encoding unique barcodes. Each set of barcodes
corresponds to a specific virus strain or variant. Infection of humanized ACE2 mice with a pool of these barcoded
viruses, coupled with antibody or hybridization-based spatial readouts and single-cell characterization of host
immune responses, will enable a methodical approach towards the systems-level investigation of intra-host viral
variation and competition dynamics. The spatial framework and conceptual advances resulting from this work
are applicable to a broad myriad of other biological systems and diseases, thus paving the way to better-
designed therapeutics and rapid responses to understand, control and eventually eradicate new biological
threats."

While microbes are single-celled organisms, they naturally form densely packed communities known as biofilms.
Biofilms pose a major public health challenge as they often cause difficult-to-treat infections that exhibit
properties such as antimicrobial resistance and persistence even with long courses of antibiotics. Since
microbiology research has often been conducted using domesticated strains under controlled laboratory
conditions where biofilms do not form, there is a need for understanding emergent behavior that only exists in
biofilms. Integrating bacterial gene regulation and metabolism with biofilm morphology and behavior requires a
model system with sufficiently mapped genetic and metabolic pathways, established genetic tractability, and
known biofilm growth conditions. For these reasons, Bacillus subtilis is considered a model organism for biofilm
studies. Bacillus subtilis biofilms are composed of a network of resident cells and tightly regulated extracellular
matrix. Initial biofilm formation and matrix expression is controlled by the expression of master regulators that
respond to traditional quorum-sensing molecules. However, newly appreciated ion-based signaling in Bacillus
subtilis is critical for community level fitness by coordinating nutrient sharing within a biofilm. This discovery
highlights signaling pathways that are critical for the formation and overall fitness of biofilms yet remain
undiscovered. To help close this gap in knowledge, we will focus on discovering the synthesis genes for
acetylcholine and acetylcholine-based cell-to-cell signaling phenotypes. Our leading hypothesis is acetylcholine
acts as a signaling molecule in cell-to-cell communications within biofilms. Aim 1 will identify acetylcholine biofilm
signaling phenotypes using microscopy and Aim 2 will identify the genes responsible for acetylcholine synthesis.
The overarching goal of this project is to provide the first description of genetic, metabolic, and physiological
mechanisms for acetylcholine in all bacterial species. Additionally, the function of and synthesis gene(s)
responsible for acetylcholine production will provide the scientific community with the foundational knowledge to
explore bacterial homologs in other species and how signaling within bacteria may also impact complex systems
like the human gut-brain-axis in development and disease."
10899708,"Autoimmunity occurs due to a breakdown in immunological tolerance, leading to uncontrolled adaptive immune
responses against self-tissues. There are an estimated 50 million Americans that suffer from autoimmunity,
which encompasses 100+ different disorders, which collectively effect virtually every organ and tissue. With
~16% of the US population suffering from autoimmunity, in 2001, annual estimated costs for their treatment
calculated were greater than $100 billion. While every autoimmune disease is associated with immune
dysregulation, no universal treatments exist. This proposal aims to generate a novel, cost-effective, universal
off-the-shelf adoptive cell therapy (ACT) that can be used to treat autoimmune disease by enhancing
immunological tolerance. Our strategy is to harness the power of endogenous CD4+Foxp3+ T regulatory cells
(Treg) to enhance immune tolerance thereby dampening immune responses to self-tissues. Treg suppress
immune-mediated inflammatory responses making them a strong therapeutic target for the treatment of
autoimmunity and other inflammatory diseases. In clinical trials, transiently increasing Treg numbers was
deemed safe and showed some efficacy. However, Treg cellular therapy faces a number of challenges that
need to be overcome. To that end, we propose capitalizing on our recent discovery of a new B cell subset that
induces the proliferation of Treg. These B cells were named B cell IgDlow/- (BDL) because their expression of
low/neg IgD is the defining characteristic used for their purification and study. BDL are distinct from all other B
cells subsets and play an essential role in Treg homeostasis. We have conducted proof-of-concept studies that
BDL could be genetically engineered to enhance and sustain Treg numbers long-term thereby attenuating the
severity of inflammation. This proposal outlines a strategy to develop a first-of-its-kind ACT for the treatment of
autoimmunity utilizing BDL regulatory mechanisms. Our ACT is designed to be off-the-shelf and able to be
universally administered to any patient that could benefit from increased Treg-induced tolerance. This will not
only transform how autoimmunity is treated, but will greatly reduce the cost of treatment."

Altered cerebrovascular health is strongly associated with aging. PET and MRI studies have found age
dependent reductions in resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) and neurovascular coupling (NVC) that correlate with
poorer cognitive function and higher risk of dementia. Yet paradoxically, brain energy consumption is close to
normal. If there is sufficient O2 delivery to support metabolism, how do reduced CBF and neurovascular coupling
impact function? Answering this question is critical for interpreting MRI data available via research efforts such
as the Human Connectome Project on Aging (HCP-A), and for developing novel in vivo MRI metrics of brain
health. To address this question, we recently developed and validated a novel computational Homeostatic
Modeling (HoMod), which integrates for the first time NVC with neurometabolic coupling (NMC) – i.e., the
increase in proton and lactate production from glucose and glycogen metabolism. Using MRI or PET data,
HoMod allows calculation of regional brain tissue and capillary blood levels of not just fuels (glucose, O2), but
also metabolic waste products (pH, CO2, lactate). Extensive behavioral and EEG/MEG studies have found
cognitive function is highly dependent on homeostasis of these products. Using HoMod we showed for the first
time that, in healthy young adults, both resting state CBF and the large increase in NVC during activation, are
crucial for maintaining homeostasis of pCO2, pO2, and pH.
 Motivated by these findings, our objective is to use HoMod to test our general hypothesis: reduced resting
CBF and NVC in the elderly impair brain function via loss of pCO2, pO2, and pH homeostasis. Preliminary findings
from human brain PET and MRI group datasets strongly support this hypothesis, however same subject
measurements of OEF, NVC, and NMC are needed for validation and extension to resting state fluctuations. Our
approach pursues prospective calibrated fMRI and fMRS studies in young and elderly subjects, and extends and
further validates HoMod, through the following aims. Aim 1: Use HoMod to calculate pCO2, pO2, and pH maps
in young and elderly subjects from resting awake OEF maps measured with calibrated fMRI at 3T to determine
if there is loss of homeostasis in elderly subjects. Aim 2: Use fMRS and calibrated fMRI at 7T to determine if
there are age associated reductions in NMC and NVC during visual stimulation, and use HoMod to assess impact
on homeostasis. Exploratory Aim: Measure amplitude of calibrated fMRI resting state fluctuations at 3T, calculate
NVC, and estimate possible age associated homeostasis alterations during fluctuations. Achieving these aims
is highly impactful for brain aging research and beyond because HoMod is an emerging methodology that allows
for the first time assessing whether abnormal NMC and NVC lead to loss of pCO2, pO2, and pH homeostasis.
Such an opportunity is potentially critical to determine the impact of homeostasis on brain cognitive health in
aging, as well as to guide potential interventions to improve or preserve brain health in aging and in other
neurological conditions such as dementia, stroke, traumatic brain injury and cancer."

The noradrenergic (NA) and serotonergic (5-HT) networks of the brainstem are highly regulated and necessary
components of the respiratory homeostatic network. Dysfunction of these systems has been linked to many
congenital respiratory disorders including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a leading cause of
neonate death and is thought to occur, in part, by the failure of the neonate autoresuscitation reflex. Previous
data have informed our understanding of how these systems modulate protective respiratory responses to life
threatening challenges independently, but limited information is available on the potential interplay between
these two key systems while previous studies lack a more finessed manipulation provided by our methodology.
In the following aims, I will test the hypothesis that the 5-HT and NA systems are integrally linked in regulating
the autoresuscitation reflex and that different combinations of 5-HT and NA perturbation and stimulation will
result in additive positive and negative outcomes in autoresuscitation. Aim 1. Determine the separate and
combined functional and cellular effects of serotonergic activation and noradrenergic inhibition on the
autoresuscitation reflex and respiratory network dynamics in response to hypercapnic anoxia. Aim 2. Determine
the effect of serotonergic inhibition and noradrenergic activation on the autoresuscitation reflex. Aim 3.
Determine the effect of serotonergic inhibition and noradrenergic inhibition or serotonergic activation and
noradrenergic activation on the autoresuscitation reflex. To test these aims, I will utilize compounded
recombinase and effector lines to access and manipulate the activity of the 5-HT and NA systems. For example,
the Pet1::Cre; F_hM4D line bred to a DBH_FLPo; P_hM3D line will produce mice that, upon clozapine-N-oxide
(CNO) application, will concurrently excite the 5-HT system (Pet1::Cre + P_hM3D) while inhibiting the NA system
(DBH_FLPo + F_hM4D). For functional characterizations, the mice will be challenged with repeated bouts of
hypercapnic anoxia to test their autoresuscitation reflex. For network activity characterization, cFos staining will
be carried out on brainstem tissue in mice that have been challenged with sublethal hypercapnic anoxic
exposures after excitation or inhibition of the 5-HT or NA systems. Understanding if these systems are
independently regulating autoresuscitation will provide valuable information for future therapeutic investigations.
This study will progress the field by expanding our understanding of interplay between the 5-HT and NA systems
in health and disease as well as informing on the use of intricate genetic manipulations in the study of these two
key respiratory systems. This work will significantly advance our understanding of the neural networks involved
in respiratory regulation and disease. The training plan and environment that accompany this proposal will
provide a solid foundation for a transition to research independence. Training includes scientific and professional
development courses, workshops, and seminars while the environment includes cutting edge technology and
equipment with training offered in house at BCM."

Long-lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) have been associated with declining malaria infections in Sub-Saharan
Africa, but recently several threats have emerged that may be undermining their continued efficacy. These
include emerging insecticide resistance, human behavior such as inconsistent use, and possible changes in
mosquito behavior. Among these three, attention has primarily been focused on insecticide resistance. To
mitigate against resistance, LLINs have been modified to include an insecticide coupled with a synergist
(piperonyl butoxide, PBO) which restores metabolic sensitivity in otherwise resistant vectors. In mid-2021, PBO
LLINs were distributed in a pilot program in three counties in Kenya, including within our existing longitudinal
cohort in Bungoma County. Preliminary data from our cohort indicates high initial uptake followed by a sharp
decline in use. Initial feedback from the community points towards some concerns with these PBO-LLINs. The
objective of the proposed work is to study the efficacy decay of the PBO-LLINs in an implementation phase over
a period of five years. We will leverage our long-standing community-based cohort of more than 500 people
which includes monthly active- and passively-detected cases of malaria, weekly collections of vectors, and
monthly surveys of bednet use and quality. Given the rich longitudinal data pre- and post-adoption of PBO-LLINs
and the close engagement with community participants, our study offers an important setting in which to
understand the human, entomological, and parasitologic impacts of these bednets in African settings. In Aim 1,
we describe changes in ITN use over time, including pre-and post-PBO LLIN distribution, coupled with qualitative
data collection to further explore contextual and human behavioral factors affecting ITN utilization. We will also
monitor PBO-LLIN integrity and bioefficacy over time. In Aim 2, we will quantify changes in malaria vector
populations before and after PBO-LLINs, including species distribution, feeding success, and insecticide
resistance, using an archive of more than 5,000 female anopheles’ samples. To understand aspects of mosquito
behavior that impact the effectiveness of PBO nets, we will target exophilic/exophagic vectors using outdoor
trapping techniques. To monitor for emergence of resistance to the PBO synergist, we will conduct standardized
phenotypic assays using field caught mosquitoes. In Aim 3, we will correlate individual and household-level
differences in malaria infection and disease with coverage and use of conventional LLINs vs PBO-LLINs.
Generalized linear models that incorporate the longitudinal structure of the data will be used to elucidate how
the complex relationship between malaria and type of net is affected by vector abundance, vector species,
insecticide resistance and human behavior. This study will generate evidence on contextual factors contributing
to PBO LLIN efficacy decay and correlate this with both parasitological and entomological indicators. This could
inform co-interventions that will maximize benefits from the next generation LLINs."

Early life adversity (ELA) induces long-lasting chronic low-grade inflammation and increases the risk for
chronic inflammatory diseases (CIDs) like obesity, diabetes, and atherosclerosis later in life. Current literature
on the adult immune phenotype following ELA has shown hyperinflammatory leukocyte signaling as a driver of
chronic inflammation. However, the intracellular mechanisms through which ELA alters definitive
hematopoiesis and developmentally programs leukocyte inflammatory signaling remain unclear. Mast cells
(MCs) are well-established orchestrators of immune responses and leukocyte recruiters, and their heightened
activity is unsurprisingly characteristic of ELA associated diseases. Using murine and porcine models of ELA,
we have previously demonstrated the MC as an effector cell of the inflammatory and behavioral responses to
acute and chronic stress. We used the murine ELA model of neonatal maternal separation with early weaning
(NMS) to perform a preliminary characterization of the ELA-associated, MC inflammatory phenotype. Bone
marrow resident hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors from adult NMS and normally handled (NH)
control mice of both sexes were differentiated in culture into primary bone marrow derived MCs (BMMCs). In
comparison to BMMCs from NH mice of the same sex, BMMCs from NMS mice exhibited greater IgE-mediated
release of dense core secretory granule (DCSG) proinflammatory mediators and LPS- and IL33-induced
release of de novo synthesized cytokines. Our preliminary data revealed that BMMCs from NMS mice
exhibited upregulation of cholesterol-related genes, with greater pathway upregulation in NMS females.
Further, inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis coincided with decreased DCSG mediators. The primary
objective of this proposal is to define the mechanisms through which ELA alters MC programming, specifically
focusing on cholesterol metabolism, to developmentally heighten the MC inflammatory phenotype and
enhance host susceptibility to disease. Our primary hypothesis is that ELA modulates the long-term MC
inflammatory phenotype and MC programming through the upregulation of intracellular cholesterol metabolism,
which is critical for increased granulogenesis and MC proinflammatory activity. To test this hypothesis, we will
utilize primary BMMC cultures and tissue MCs from NMS and NH mice of both sexes as in vitro and in vivo
models, respectively, of the functional and developmental effects of ELA on immunity. Aim 1 will investigate the
impact of ELA on MCp and MC cholesterol metabolism and their link to granulogenesis, while Aim 2 will
examine the role of cholesterol metabolism and granulogenesis in the ELA-heightened MC inflammatory
phenotype. These experiments will define intracellular cholesterol metabolism as a target mechanism driving
the long-term effects of ELA on MC programming and MC inflammatory phenotype. This proposed research
has far-reaching implications for understanding how ELA alters normal HSC-derived MC programming to drive
persistent MC hyperactivity and associated risk for CIDs."

flame retardant plus additional risk factors (e.g. dietary factors) later in life modulate obesity. The liver- and
intestine-enriched pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) are novel regulators
for obesity. Intestinal inflammation, as triggered by dysbiosis of the gut microbiota, is an early mediator of obesity
and type-II diabetes. In the previous grant cycle, we have demonstrated that: 1) early life exposure to the PBDEs
and TBBPA produces a pro-inflammatory/pro-obese microbial signature later in life; 2) PXR and CAR are
necessary in maintaining the basal healthy gut flora to prevent the blooming of pro-inflammatory microbes; 3)
the presence of gut microbiome promotes immunotolerance in the liver, whereas early life exposure to PBDEs
produced gut dysbiosis associated with enhanced immune cell hepatic mobilization, reduced PXR/CAR signaling,
and predicted liver injuries in adulthood; Early life exposure to an industrial PBDE mixture persistently disrupted
the microbial tryptophan metabolism. We also showed that the microbial tryptophan metabolite indole-3-
propionic acid (IPA) mimicry FKK6 compound protected against intestinal inflammation associated with
increased anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and the SCFA-producing microbes. Building on our
findings, the objective of the renewal is to determine how the host nuclear receptors, gut microbiome, and early
life flame retardant exposure interact to modulate the adult onset of obesity and type-II diabetes. Our central
hypothesis is: early life flame retardant exposures upset the physiological functions of PXR/CAR, leading to pro-
inflammation and pro-obesity microbial metabolites and elevated AhR signaling, which augmented obesity
following a 2nd hit (e.g. a high fat diet [HFD]) later in life; whereas the microbial mimicry is a novel remediation
strategy. We will test this hypothesis in 3 Aims: Aim 1 will determine to what extent PXR and CAR modulate the
inflammation- and obesity-related host and microbial signatures following early life exposure to PBDEs and
TBBPA. Aim 2 will determine how early life flame retardant exposure and PXR/CAR interact to modulate the
high fat diet-induced obesity later in life. Aim 3 will determine how gut microbiome mechanistically contributes
to the divergent roles of PXR and CAR in obesity following the “two-hit” exposure paradigm. The overall impact
of this research is that we will determine how TBBPA vs. PBDE exposure in early life, especially in the
combination of a high-risk obesogenic adult diet, results in adult obesity. This perspective will be shown through
the lens of the important host nuclear receptors, which are well-established mediators of endocrine response."

Lack of reliable assessment tools is a major obstacle to validating novel treatments for chronic graft-versus-
host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of long-term morbidity and mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HCT) to cure life-threatening blood diseases. Skin erythema is a key cGVHD
biomarker, but standard of care in-person evaluations are subjective, prone to error, and costly. We will
validate an artificial intelligence (AI) technology for accurate, efficient, and easily deployable measurement of
cGVHD erythema from photographs in diverse patient populations.
In our preparatory study, AI technology achieved human-level performance under controlled photography
conditions. We propose to refine and validate this AI technology in a multicenter cGVHD patient cohort of
unprecedented size, leveraging experts in dermatology, transplant medicine, medical imaging, artificial
intelligence, biomedical informatics, and data science. A unique database of over 11,000 photographs and
clinical information from ethnically and phenotypically diverse patients will be assembled from five major
cancer centers: Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, University of
Pennsylvania, and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Accuracy to measure cGVHD erythema will be
determined relative to expert dermatologist-level assessments. We will quantify and overcome potential biases
for the AI including skin tone, gender, photography conditions, and disease severity. We will compare the
prognostic value of AI and human assessments as biomarkers of mortality. Finally, we will prospectively
benchmark the accuracy of AI measurements against standard in-person clinical trial assessments (NIH Skin
Scoring) for patients recruited at all five cancer centers.
The proposal could improve patient care and telemedicine through: consistent cGVHD scoring equivalent to
specialist examination; visualizing cutaneous changes for quality assurance in observational and therapeutic
studies; enabling frequent longitudinal monitoring at home or in clinic; and relieving the burden of time-
consuming skin area assessment on patient care providers.

Joint damage caused by trauma can proceed to post-traumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Published data from us
and literature demonstrated the importance of the CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and its ligand CCL2 in OA.
CCL2 is the most abundant ligand in humans, and we reported that high serum CCL2 is associated with
radiographic knee OA onset at 5 year followups and correlates with cartilage damage following ACL
reconstruction. Animal studies showed that PTOA progression can be slowed by pharmacological CCR2
targeting or by early ccr2 gene deletion in chondrocytes or osteoblasts. We and others have reported a major
role for CCR2 in chronic and acute pain. Macrophages play a role in OA onset, progression and pain and CCL2
is a powerful chemoattractant for macrophages. However, it is unknown how macrophage infiltration correlates
to PTOA damage and how CCL2/CCR2 contributes to macrophage activation vs an inflammatory phenotype.
Therefore, in the efforts to identify PTOA treatments that can impact multiple tissue degeneration, inflammation,
and pain, targeting CCL2/CCR2 axis may represent an ideal choice. Muscles absorb the loads of articular joints
and muscle dysfunction may precede and expedite cartilage deterioration. Literature and our preliminary data in
PTOA showed a decreased expression of critical genes required in muscular excitation/contraction, followed by
loss of muscle strength. However, how muscle changes relate to PTOA is unclear. We hypothesize that, following
injury, the CCR2-mediated tissue damage (in cartilage, bone and synovium) and increased inflammation (in
joints as well as systemically) can be reduced by treatment with the RS antagonist, alleviating pain and improving
muscle strength. In order to develop therapeutic methods for efficient CCR2 targeting in PTOA, our proposal
will establish: 1) the molecular events leading to the tissue degeneration and macrophage activation induced by
CCR2 and how they correlate to pain and muscle damage; 2) the CCR2 contribution to macrophage polarization
vs an inflammatory phenotype (M1) at different disease stages; 3) the interconnection among joint structure,
muscle strength and pain; 4) two efficient drug delivery systems for tissue targeting, avoiding extended high-
dose exposure while protecting the drug from degradation. To accomplish these objectives, we will use an inter-
disciplinary combination of in-vivo studies in a rat PTOA model in the following aims: in Aim 1 we will determine
the therapeutic potential of intra-articular CCR2 targeting on joint degeneration, inflammation, muscle weakness,
and pain during PTOA using biodegradable microplates for sustained local release. In Aim 2 we will specifically
target activated macrophages systemically and assess their contribution of to PTOA and pain; moreover, we will
use activated macrophages to systemically deliver RS to inflamed tissues to determine its contribution to
macrophage activation and phenotype while improving joint structure, muscle strength and pain. We will also
determine CCR2 downstream pathway changes in joint and muscle tissues. Moreover, the results obtained in
this work could be extended to other instances of PTOA or chronic OA."

Immune dysfunction associated with co-infection and AIDS-related cancers is commonly observed in
HIV-infected individuals. In particular, gene expression programs in the immune system are often
abnormally regulated in these individuals. We and other groups have recently discovered that the
positive transcription factor b (P-TEFb), a critical cellular factor required for productive elongation of
transcription, is severely down-regulated in quiescent and aberrant T cells. In resting CD4+ T cells,
representing major latent HIV reservoirs, the expression of the cyclin T1 (CycT1) subunit of P-TEFb is
diminished post-transcriptionally via currently unknown mechanisms, this being a main cause of HIV
latency and tumor-specific T cells' defective response to check-point inhibitors and/or CAR-T cell
therapies. Since increasing CycT1 is a prerequisite and mandatory step for optimal HIV reactivation
and proper immune response against other pathogens and tumor cells, understanding the
mechanism of CycT1 down-regulation is crucial. We have recently demonstrated that P-TEFb
assembly regulated by phosphorylation determines the stability of CycT1. Also, we have identified all
key players, including E3 ligases, involved in CycT1-degradation. Therefore, we hypothesize that
increasing CycT1 proteins in resting and aberrant CD4+ T cells by manipulating cellular pathways to
regulate P-TEFb assembly will reverse HIV latency and improve immune functions in HIV-infected
individuals. In the proposed study, we will manipulate the cellular pathways regulating P-TEFb
assembly and CycT1 stability to control HIV latency and improve immune functions. We will also
identify previously uncharacterized ""CycT1-degradation complexes"", which will serve as new
therapeutic targets. Successful completion of the proposed study will result in a new concept of T cell
regulation modulated by the protein level of a master transcriptional regulator."

Mitochondria are critical for generating energy. Recently a new role for mitochondria in controlling metabolic
signaling through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has come to light. ROS has also recently come
into the spotlight as being a critical signaling axis for limb regeneration, and while mitochondrial signaling has
been well-established in cell homeostasis, the role of mitochondrial generated ROS and its downstream
mechanisms in controlling regeneration is not clear. Using the established mouse digit tip amputation
regeneration model, spatial transcriptomics, and unique transgenic mice, we uncovered a unique role for two
mitochondrial regulatory proteins, BNIP3 and NIX, in regeneration. Our preliminary findings support that
regeneration is dependent on the mitochondrial regulation protein BNIP3, and that this protein supports ROS-
generated, directional morphogenetic signaling gradients from the wound epithelium. Further, our preliminary
data support that a second mitochondrial regulatory protein, NIX, serves to support blastema maturation and
differentiation, a structure critical to regenerating the bone and soft tissue. We hypothesize that BNIP3 and NIX
function in a spatially distinct relationship where NIX supports differentiation in the blastema in response to
adjacent signaling gradients generated by BNIP3 in the wound epithelium. This project would provide the first
evidence of a BNIP3/NIX signaling access in injury, implicating mitochondrial function and mitophagy as spatial
regulators of the regeneration process, and giving a broader context to a mitochondrial homeostasis mechanism
that is salient to many fields."

Understanding the mechanisms of dental epithelial progenitor cell fate decisions will help to lay the long-term
groundwork for clinical applications of stem cell biology in human dentition. In the continuously growing mouse
incisor, cycling progenitor cells orchestrate incisor epithelium renewal during both homeostasis and injury-
induced regeneration. The swift and well-orchestrated balance of progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation
into either enamel-producing ameloblasts or non-ameloblasts supports the continuous growth of the tooth.
However, the mechanisms that control these rapid fate decisions remain unclear. To understand mechanisms
of cell fate decisions, this proposal will examine how Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), through
trimethylation of lysine 27 on Histone 3, represses gene expression to drive fate commitment of progenitor cells.
This proposal will establish the role of PRC2 catalytic subunit Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) in the incisor
epithelium and its specific chromatin targets during progenitor differentiation. Aim 1 will examine how EZH2
contributes to incisor epithelial progenitor cell fate decisions during homeostasis and injury-induced
regeneration. This will be achieved by determining how loss of Ezh2 in progenitor cells affects cell fate decisions,
such as changes to differentiation, self-renewal or apoptosis. Aim 2 will elucidate the specific targets of EZH2
in progenitor cells during homeostasis and injury-induced regeneration. Chromatin states of incisor
epithelial cells during both conditions will be determined using state-of-the-art single-cell Assay for Transposase
Accessible Chromatin sequencing (scATACseq) and Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease
(CUT&RUN) technologies. These analyses will show whether PRC2 targets in the incisor epithelium are similar
to those in other self-renewing tissues. They will also identify the dental epithelial tissue-specific targets that
contribute to ameloblast and non-ameloblast fates.

applicant’s career as a dentist-scientist. The training includes structured mentorship from a highly qualified
clinician-scientist sponsor, as well as scientific and technical training through attending seminars, journal clubs,
classes, laboratory meetings, conferences, and more. Research and training will take place at the University of
California, San Francisco, which offers both an outstanding research environment and an excellent dental school

10883774,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
Children with tracheostomy and home ventilation have an annual mortality rate of 5%, and have the highest
healthcare utilization and costs of all U.S. children, with annual hospital charges that exceed $2.5 billion. ARIs
are the #1 cause of death and hospitalization in this very high-risk population of healthcare superutilizers. Yet,
little is known about the pathophysiology of these ARIs, the mechanisms underlying their severity, and no
treatment pathways exist. Our long term goal is to address these knowledge gaps by refining the “one
pathogen-one disease” ARI paradigm to a more ecosystem-wide approach to ARI pathobiology in order to
develop more precise ARI treatment strategies for this population. The objective of this study is to determine
the dynamics – within the airway ecosystem – of the microbiome and host response during viral ARI and their
contribution to ARI severity. The rationale is that while most ARIs are viral, viruses infect airways colonized
with functional bacteria. In a previous tracheostomy study we found blooms (i.e., higher relative abundance) of
a colonizing bacterium during a viral ARI. However, it remains unclear if these blooms represent infections
requiring antibiotics or are associated with ARI severity. Our cross-sectional results and those of others show
children with dominance of specific microbiota compositions are associated with increased viral ARI severity.
We now extend this work by applying metatranscriptomic (microbial function) and transcriptomic (host
response) approaches to tracheal aspirates collected longitudinally over an 18-month period from children with
tracheostomy and home ventilation. In the first 6 months of our 1-year R56 AI163013 (Mansbach, PI) high-
priority award, site teams at 11 U.S. hospitals will complete enrollment of 300 children with a tracheostomy and
home ventilation. In late February 2022, these children will begin 6 months of specimen collection. With the
expertise of the Emergency Medicine Network (EMNet) and the support of the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury &
Sepsis Investigators (PALISI) network, we now seek to complete the remaining 4 years of work, including 12
more months of specimen collection. Using tracheal aspirates collected ~1 week before and at the onset (i.e.,
day 1) of ARI, we plan to complete 3 Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will determine if specific bacterial blooms are
related to higher viral ARI severity. In Aim 2 we will determine the mechanisms underlying colonizing bacteria
becoming pathogenic and how bacterial blooms contribute to viral ARI severity. In Aim 3 we will determine if
bacterial blooms are related to the airway host response and viral ARI severity. Our pilot data demonstrate
compelling support for our hypotheses. This study has >80% power for all aims, validates the results in a
generalizable independent cohort, and creates a robust biorepository from multiple body sites to test future
hypotheses. Results from this study will provide fundamental insights into ARI pathophysiology and
mechanisms underlying ARI severity including how the airway microbiome relates to bacterial blooms and host
responses in this very high-risk population. Ultimately, these results will inform ARI treatment strategies."

The use of preventive cardiovascular medications among nursing home residents with Alzheimer's disease
and Alzheimer's disease related dementias (AD/ADRD) presents a clinical conundrum. On one hand, the
majority of nursing home residents with AD/ADRD have a history of cardiovascular disease, or are at high risk
of events. On the other hand, residents with AD/ADRD are at higher risk for medication-related adverse events
and have less opportunity to benefit from preventive medications such as aspirin and statins. This has led
some patients and their providers to consider deprescribing. Deprescribing is the process of stopping a
medication when it is no longer useful, or when the risks outweigh the benefits. Despite the thousands of
randomized controlled trials that have been conducted for starting cardiovascular medications, only a handful
have been conducted for deprescribing. The effects of deprescribing cardiovascular medications, and which
patients could benefit, is unknown. The goal of this renewal application is to provide novel, unparalleled
evidence on the effects of deprescribing cardioprotective medications in patients with and without AD/ADRD.
We will build upon our prior successful cohort of nursing home residents (nearly half of whom have AD/ADRD)
to conduct this research in approximately 150,000 residents aged 65 years and older in Veteran's Health
Administration (VA) nursing homes. The VA is the only feasible setting to execute this research because of the
ability to link inpatient and outpatient data with data from the nursing home. Moreover, unlike data from the
Centers from Medicaid/Medicare, the VA includes data on vital signs, laboratory measurements, and bar-coded
medication administrations. We will start with descriptive epidemiology regarding the frequency of
deprescribing as well as the common precipitating events and characteristics of residents whom are commonly
deprescribed cardiovascular medication. This will identify which drugs are the most important targets for further
research, and the populations in which there is clinical uncertainty. Traditional clinical trials are challenging in
residents with AD/ADRD due to their care complexity and often impaired decision-making capacity. Thus, we
will next implement target trial emulation of deprescribing cardiovascular medications; this is a method of
estimating trial effects using observational data. This approach applies a structured analytic process to address
common biases in observational research and leverages causal inference statistics to address confounding by
indication. We have successfully applied this approach to study the effect of changes in antihypertensives in
older residents with and without AD/ADRD. In this renewal application, we will study the effects of
deprescribing multiple cardioprotective medications, specifically, antiplatelets including aspirin, statins, and
anticoagulants in nursing home residents with and without AD/ADRD."

A major dichotomy in comparative biology is the divergence of visual specializations in different species.
This is prominently observed in rodents and primates - the former specialized to detect movement in low light
conditions while the latter specialized to detect fine spatial patterns and color. A large body of research on
these visual systems points to fundamental differences in structural, functional and genetic makeup of neural
circuits in the early visual pathway. This makes it difficult to understand how different features of the visual
world are selectively processed in the retina and in the brain. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of
higher visual processing requires an understanding of visual processing in not just rodents and primates but
also in other species. This also calls for the use of novel technologies for probing and translating findings
across different visual systems. Tree shrew is a small animal at the phylogenetic midpoint of rodents and
primates, with highly developed retina and visual cortex. Because of their diurnal and excellent color vision,
tree shrews have been extensively used as a model system for understanding color processing in the
mammalian visual system. This proposal will combine advanced techniques such as large-scale
measurements of neural population activity, genetic screening and viral tracing to achieve detailed functional
characterization of retinal ganglion cells and their connectivity to the LGN. In aim 1, we will use a high-density
multi-electrode array for recording activity of large populations of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), to reveal how
morphologically and functionally distinct RGC types encode distinct visual features in their responses. To
determine the diversity of gene expression in functionally distinct RGCs, in aim 2, we will employ high-
throughput single-cell RNA sequencing of RGCs. We will also test for the presence of well-established
molecular markers for RGC types, in the tree shrew retina. Finally, in aim 3, we will use viral labeling to
determine the precise pattern of convergence from the retina to the LGN. By measuring the response of
optogenetically stimulated RGCs, we will establish the lamina specific LGN projections of functionally distinct
RGC types. These experiments will provide a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of
neural circuits in the early visual pathway, that produce distinct visual specializations in different species. This
study will establish tree shrew as a model system for comparative studies on visual processing in higher
mammals and provide novel insights into the pathologies of vision."
10866194,"PROJECT SUMMARY: Poor sleep has been identified as a major behavioral risk factor for Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias (ADRDs) as well as a possible pathogenic factor driving disease progression. However,
the molecular mechanisms linking healthy sleep to healthy brain aging remain elusive. Furthermore, we are yet
to identify any drug that promotes healthy sleep or slows the progression of Alzheimer's disease. This is largely
because the molecular mechanisms which govern both processes are yet to be fully understood. This project
proposes to investigate the mechanisms that link sleep/wake regulation to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.
To improve drug discovery for ADRDs, our lab has focused on targeting both age-associated and neuron-specific
toxicities simultaneously. To this end, I established a drug screening pipeline to identify small molecules that
delay aging and protect against neuronal cell death; we refer to these drugs as GeroNeuroProtectors (GNP).
Using this pipeline, I identified CX08005 – an inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) – as a
candidate GNP which extends lifespan in C. elegans and protects hippocampal neurons from Alzheimer's
disease-associated oxidative cell death. Notably, in addition to its anti-aging and neuroprotective effects, I find
that CX08005 consolidates fragmented sleep/wake patterns in aged Drosophila. Thus, CX08005 may serve as
a useful pharmacological tool to investigate the mechanisms that link sleep/wake regulation to Alzheimer's
pathophysiology. In the proposed project, I will test the hypothesis that PTP1B activity is a central driver of
Alzheimer's disease related sleep fragmentation and neurodegeneration. During the K99 phase, I will determine
whether PTP1B inhibition improves Alzheimer's disease-associated outcomes and characterize the mechanisms
of PTP1B signaling in modulating Alzheimer's disease related sleep disturbance. Aim 1 will determine whether
PTP1B inhibition by CX08005 improves sleep/wake patterns, neuropathology, and cognitive performance in AD
mouse models. Since the mechanisms of PTP1B-mediated geroneuroprotection are unknown, Aim 2 will apply
CRISPR screening and tissue clearing and whole-brain labeling technologies to identify the genetic targets and
brain regions modulated by CX08005 then determine which genes modulate sleep and lifespan. A portion of
both aims will carry over into the independent R00 phase of the award. This work will lay the foundational
groundwork necessary for future studies to investigate the translational potential of targeting protein
phosphorylation and sleep to treat Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The successful execution of the
proposed training plan will prepare me to lead an independent research program."

CRC) of the University of Southern California (USC) was established in 2020 to treat patients
with PASC symptoms. Keck CRC operates under an interdisciplinary, collaborative care model,
and brings together a primary care physician, occupational therapist, physical therapist, social
worker, respiratory therapist, medical assistant, nurse (RN) navigator, and support coordinator.
Keck CRC is well positioned at Keck Medicine of USC and in LA County to accomplish goals to
expand and optimize clinical care of PASC, as well as to be a center for dissemination of
education and project findings across LA County and nationally across other similar clinics.
Through this funding opportunity, the Keck CRC will establish the Keck COVID Recovery Clinic,
Optimal Outcomes for Patients in a Comprehensive Assessment and Management Program
(Keck CO-OP CAMP). This program will pursue four main goals, in alignment with the eight
characteristics of Long COVID clinics specified in the Funding Opportunity “Purpose of the
NOFO” (RFA-HS-23-012):
Goal 1: Improve current care delivery and system model within Keck CRC (NOFO 1, 2, 3,
4). Activities under this goal will optimize and update the current Keck CRC care model through
expanding dedicated staff time and roles, creating and adapting clinical workflows, improving
care coordination, establishing mechanisms for oversight, and utilizing data collection and
analysis.
Goal 2: Establish new models of service to expand services to more patients
experiencing PASC, including those who may be limited from ongoing care through the
clinic due to insurance or geographic limitations (NOFO 1, 2, 3, 5). Activities under this goal
will include creating additional consultation services in-person and virtually, connecting with
clinics that may benefit from our resources, adding a support group, and educating patients,
caregivers, and healthcare workers.
Goal 3: Create multidisciplinary education resources for internal and external providers
(NOFO 5, 6, 8). Activities under this goal will include creating clinical workflows, educational
materials, and resources, and connecting with clinics that may benefit from Keck CRC
resources.
Goal 4: Implement consistent and standardized data collection on patient and clinic
outcomes, with regular periodic assessment of data, to inform ongoing modifications in
care delivery. (NOFO 7, 8). Activities under this goal will include utilizing and adapting
technology for data collection, assessment of data, interpretation of data, and dissemination of
findings."

complementary expertise in biomedical research, who place a priority on collaborative team science and
translational research. However, one challenge is limited access to consolidated state-of-the-art and rapidly
advancing research resources, education, and technologies. The NNE-CTR now provides innovative and
integrated shared technical resources at partner institutions to cost-effectively support approaches with
education and training for optimal use by investigators and trainees in academic medical centers, practice-
based research networks (PBRNs), and industry throughout the region. We have consolidated strategic core
facilities by leveraging expertise in genomic/epigenomic, proteomic, lipidomic, and imaging technologies with
emphasis towards molecular diagnostics/precision medicine. Building upon our success, the goals of the
Translational Research and Technologies Core (TRTC) are to provide investigators with support for research
based on genomics, proteomics, lipidomics, cell and tissue analyses, molecular diagnostics and novel mouse
models for preclinical studies. Our secondary goal is to advance collaborative partnerships among scientists,
behaviorists, and physician investigators to foster discoveries and support the career development of
biomedical researchers with an emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Coordinating with the Community
Engagement and Outreach Core, the TRTC will expand educational efforts to facilitate bidirectional
communication and to foster collaborations and discovery in translational and clinical research. This research
infrastructure, with expanded faculty development in translational and clinical research, will also strengthen the
interactions and engagement with the NNE-PBRN and other clinician investigators to support mechanistic and
clinical investigations of cancer, cardiovascular disease, substance abuse and other diseases prevalent in the
northern New England rural population. Furthermore, the TRTC will build upon established IDeA Networks of
Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE) programs and multiple Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence
(COBRE), to effectively leverage resources established by these programs for the enhancement of young and
established investigators. A singular important impact of the TRTC to the region was exemplified by its
unparalleled support for rapid and reliable Covid-19 testing using a single-step preparation for PCR analysis. It
is also currently supporting the development of genomic and cellular imaging-based diagnostics for future
public health challenges. TRTC will also support Department of Health initiatives in partnering states and
private sector endeavors that likely will require molecular diagnostics. In summary, the TRTC, by integrating
unique and essential biomedical research expertise, technologies, and services, will enhance research
capacity, credential research programs, and increase the competitiveness of investigators in the region for the
benefit of northern New England institutions and the people they serve."
10870185,"The overarching aim of the Northern New England Clinical and Translational Research (NNE-CTR) Network is
to sustain a research infrastructure that supports and ultimately improves community health outcomes for
residents in this largely rural region. To achieve this ambitious aim, NNE-CTR leadership and staff will
continuously assess progress and identify opportunities for mid-course corrections, as needed. The Tracking
and Evaluation Core (TEC) will provide the requisite infrastructure and expertise to ensure that the NNE-CTR
is both efficient and effective in achieving its stated goals. Led by a multidisciplinary team with strong
evaluation expertise, the TEC will: 1) oversee data collection, monitor implementation efforts and inform
decision-making; 2) assess accomplishments, identify challenges, and focus on outcomes and overall impact;
and 3) share lessons, best practices, and promote learning. Working collaboratively across the partner
institutions, TEC staff will continue to use a flexible and participatory approach to ensure the engagement of all
Cores in the formative and summative evaluation. The TEC activities will be grounded in the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention evaluation framework, which applies a population health model ideal for
evaluating the health and systems-level outcomes of clinical and translational research. Key features of the
evaluation include the use of logic models, quality improvement techniques applied in tandem with traditional
evaluation methods, annual core-specific performance milestones with accompanying targets, and validated
tools to assess the overall initiative based on outcomes captured at the investigator, community, and regional
levels. Through these activities, the TEC will facilitate transparency and promote data-informed decisions
regarding the management of the initiative’s many components, thereby ensuring the ultimate success of the
overall program."
10870187,"The northern New England region constitutes a unique public health landscape with challenging needs for its
residents, particularly prevention, early detection, and intervention of chronic diseases. The Pilot Projects
Program (PPP) successfully provided support to clinical and translational investigators to conduct public health
research addressing health inequities in urban, rural and underserved communities that face sizable barriers to
healthcare access. The PPP worked with all the NNE-CTR Cores over the first four years to develop and
implement 29 projects with clinical, translational, and Covid-19 implications. Those pilots enhanced healthcare
delivery as well as accelerated the career trajectory of several pilot project awardees. Building upon our
considerable accomplishments, the current aims of the PPP will support a three step process to enhance
further pilot success while simultaneously improving our mentoring program in collaboration with the
Professional Development Core. In Aim 1 of this three-stage process, we will expand researcher recruitment
and support concept development to incentivize and build meaningful interdisciplinary collaborations. We will
disseminate PPP opportunities through our NNE-CTR website, newsletter, and social media, and support
young, early-stage and established investigators during concept development in collaboration with the
Professional Development (PDC) and the Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Research Design (BERD) Cores. In
Aim 2, we will help investigators prepare Pilot Project applications by providing mentorship in study design and
data analysis, and by engaging navigators from the Community Engagement and Outreach (CEO), PDC, and
BERD Cores. We will encourage consultation with Core leadership, community representatives, and content
experts to enhance design feasibility. In the final stage, Aim 3, we will mentor pilot project awardees during the
post-award phase by providing scientific and professional development guidance to awardees via quarterly
meetings. We will assist awardees to develop extramural grant proposals, including holding mock “study
sections” in partnership with the PDC, to ensure competitive proposals. For those whose external applications
fell below the payline, we will return to the first stage and support further concept development for subsequent
applications. We will also ensure all research conducted through the PPP is continually aligned with principles
of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We will leverage our existing partnerships with CTSAs, State Departments of
Health, the Northern New England Practice-Based Research Network, and the Rural Health Communications
Network. By restructuring our pilot awards, we will support an array of projects, ranging from multistage clinical
and translational studies to community-specific public health initiatives. This should provide pilot awardees
with the opportunity to enhance their academic careers while serving the rapidly shifting public health needs of
our communities."
10870211,"DIDACTIC INTERACTIONS – PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT 
The Didactic Interactions component of the National Center of Neuromodulation for Rehabilitation (NC NM4R) 
provides researchers the fundamental building blocks they need through a multi-layered and progressive 
program of didactic and experiential learning opportunities supported by complementary components in 
mentored collaborations and pilot funding. We offer interactions for researchers with no prior knowledge of 
neuromodulation, as well as advanced courses for those with some experience but who desire increased 
expertise. Building on the outstanding success of our workshops in the first phase of this grant, the NM4R 
Didactic Interactions leadership group have refined guidelines for all learning content for the new grant period. 
All sessions, regardless of level, must: 1) be rigorously evaluated for continuous improvement of future offerings; 
2) include a hands-on, experiential learning component aimed to increase research rigor and reproducibility; 3) 
include a focus on underlying mechanisms of action so that investigators understand why to use a technique 
and not just how to do so; and 4) include promotion of synergistic research resources, pilot funding, and follow 
on mentored collaboration. Didactic Interactions has three Specific Aims. AIM 1. Provide foundational learning 
opportunities in NM4R techniques, methodology, safety, and rigor. Level 1 workshops are the primary tool 
for this aim. Adapting to NM4R community needs, we have evolved the curriculum and approach for Level 1 
opportunities as new technologies and methods have emerged. The format combines lectures, laboratory 
experiences, case discussions centered on key rehabilitation problems, and skills testing leading to enhanced 
safety and rigor in research conduct. AIM 2. Develop in-depth and practical knowledge of NM4R approaches 
through advanced workshops that include extensive hands-on training based on the participants’ 
research questions. Building on the knowledge gained from Level 1, Level 2 workshops will focus on in-depth 
topics in NM4R – determined by the research interests of the national community. In addition to the advanced 
didactic content, participants will bring their own research questions and co-learn with leaders and colleagues to 
hone their hypotheses, skills, and methods to assist in translating their approach into an evidence-based 
neurorehabilitation intervention. AIM 3. Develop unique interdisciplinary training opportunities that 
stimulate the NM4R community’s technology development, creativity, and clinical translation. We will 
develop symposia, with didactic, and hands-on learning, to bring investigators from diverse fields together to 
explore novel and advanced applications of NM4R approaches to address priority areas identified in the RPR."
10870212,"MENTORED COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES – PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The purpose of the Mentored Collaborative Opportunities (MCO) component is to provide expert consultative
services and short-term opportunities for rehabilitation researchers to gain hands-on research experience
working with experts in the National Center of Neuromodulation for Rehabilitation (NC NM4R) at the Medical
University of South Carolina (MUSC). This component hosts our most specialized resources to train investigators
to be successful NM4R researchers who will in turn advance the Center’s overarching goal to impact multiple
NIH Research Plan for Rehabilitation (RPR) priorities by increasing rehabilitation research workforce access to
NM4R approaches and supporting rigorous clinical research to translate them into effective, evidence-based
rehabilitation interventions. NM4R is a teachable expertise – one that MUSC and the NC NM4R have a proven
history of exporting to colleagues in the field – and we will continue building upon the mentoring infrastructure
developed over the first five years. The majority of our past and current MCO mentees arise from workshop
attendees who develop a relationship with a NC NM4R faculty member and choose to pursue additional training
under the mentorship of that faculty. The second recruitment vehicle is the promotion and dissemination activities
at important national conferences, symposia, and seminars where we are the organizers, or where we host NC
NM4R booths, sponsored talks, and live demonstrations. In the next grant period, we will implement two Specific
Aims. AIM 1. Provide mentored, advanced hands-on training in NM4R. The application of neuromodulation
methods has a steep learning curve. One of the best ways to nurture research in this area is for less experienced
scientists to link with an established research group, visit their labs, learn their methods and acquire the theory
and practical skills needed to start high quality research. The MCO component will facilitate advanced hands-on
training experiences (1-4 weeks) either in our NC NM4R laboratories at MUSC, or through novel virtual training
sessions using in-laboratory videoconferencing (or a combination of the two). The sessions may focus on skills
acquisition or serve as a springboard to hone scientific questions or approaches, but always have specific pre-
determined learning objectives necessary for project success. What develops are collaborative relationships that
persist after learning sessions, often evolving into ongoing regular meetings and collaborative grant applications.
AIM 2. Provide expert consultative and navigation services to support NM4R research. To develop
successful NM4R grant applications, some investigators need to consult with NM4R experts at MUSC and
supporting areas (neuroimaging, biostatistics, grantsmanship et al.), as well as for navigation to established
colleagues and resources in the field. The NC NM4R web portal assures timely consultations by facilitating
submission of requests, automated scheduling, and central collection of quality and outcome metrics."

Biomaterial technologies have the potential to greatly impact human health by addressing various diseases. Yet,
their full benefits remain untapped due to the disconnectedness among academic researchers and limited
engagement with emerging disciplines. To address this, we propose the establishment of the Humanity
Unlocking Biomaterials (HUB) as an NIBIB Biomaterials Network Technology Development Coordinating Center.
The HUB will address the barriers to clinical translation and commercialization of biomaterials technologies by
creating a collaborative community and providing resources and roadmaps to the community for faster
dissemination, technology transfer, and education. The specific aims include nucleating a diverse community of
biomaterials researchers via annual meetings, facilitating collaboration and coordination through virtual
infrastructure, promoting a culture change that leverages computational modeling and simulation, disseminating
advances and outreach materials, engaging the community, and providing funding, via NIBIB Opportunity Funds,
to accelerate the development and translation of biomaterials. Led by a team of distinguished scientists and
engineers, the HUB will revolutionize biomaterials translation, promoting cross-disciplinary collaboration and
innovation to advance cutting-edge technologies for clinical applications."
10891136,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is known to cause subtle changes in language production years before diagnosis, yet
current behavioral tests take limited advantage of linguistic tools to diagnose AD at early stages. Most
language tasks focus on single word production (e.g., picture naming), missing many critical aspects of
language. Some tasks focus on connected speech (e.g., picture description), but they heavily rely on complex
computational modeling methods, thus are hard to implement in clinical settings. Addressing these issues,
autocorrection is a type of error produced in connected speech that is easy to elicit, easy to analyze, and is
sensitive to AD biomarkers. Thus, the long-term goal of this proposal is to maximize this sensitivity, facilitating
the development of the autocorrect task as a non-invasive, simple, and low-cost diagnostic tool for early
detection of AD. Our proposed study will lay foundation to achieve this goal through investigating the
underlying cognitive mechanisms that drive the sensitivity of autocorrection to AD. In the autocorrect task,
participants read aloud short paragraphs in which some words are replaced by unexpected words that are
similar in form (e.g., Think about they concept replaced the concept). Participants are told to read exactly what
they see, but occasionally, they automatically correct the unexpected words and produce the expected words
instead, i.e., they produce an autocorrect error (e.g., say the concept instead of they concept). Participants with
AD or preclinical AD (i.e., those at risk for AD based on CSF biomarkers) produce more autocorrections than
healthy controls, especially with function word targets with rich syntactic properties (e.g., the, and). This is
probably because 1) AD decreases attention thus eliciting more misperception, 2) AD increases monitoring
difficulty thus making it more difficult to detect planned errors, and/or 3) AD makes it more difficult to overcome
competition from syntactically well-formed expected targets. We will combine behavioral and eye-tracking
measures to test each account. In Aim 1, we will investigate the attention and monitoring accounts by
manipulating the font color of autocorrect targets: they will be either in black or red font. We hypothesize that
the red font will reduce sensitivity to AD, and skipping rate and regression rate in eye movements will reveal
whether the effect is driven by facilitating attention or monitoring or both. In Aim 2, we will investigate the
monitoring vs. syntactic constraints accounts. The autocorrect targets and their corresponding expected words
will either match (e.g., much/more are both adverbs) or mis-match (e.g., then/that is an adverb/pronoun pair) in
syntactic category. Mismatching pairs elicit greater syntactic anomaly than matching pairs, and thus should be
harder to produce but be easier to monitor. This contrast, combining with regression rates in eye movements,
will differentiate the syntactic constraints vs. monitoring account. The proposed project will be the first that
combines the analysis of autocorrect errors with eye-tracking in preclinical AD, shedding light on how complex
aspects of language production are affected by AD in its earliest stages in a simple way."
10891137,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Secreted and membrane proteins are important for cell survival and crosstalk. The rough endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) is a dynamic organelle that adjusts to changes in protein folding demand by regulating secretory
protein throughput. While recent studies examined transcriptional regulation of genes encoding secretory
proteins in the heart, post-transcriptional regulation of protein expression remains largely unstudied. Here,
post-transcriptional regulation genes encoding secretory proteins will be studied, which we found to be an
important layer of gene expression control. ER-associated RNA-binding proteins that bind targeting elements
in transcripts may orchestrate post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression at the ER. Our pilot data
identified ribosome-binding protein 1 (RRBP1) as a novel protein that binds RNA at the ER of cardiac
myocytes, which we found to be necessary for secretory protein expression. We demonstrated that RRBP1
increased in cardiac disease settings that affect the ER secretory capacity. We also revealed that RRBP1
expression decreased during postnatal development, coordinate with decline in ER secretory capacity. When
RRBP1 expression was increased in cardiac myocytes, transcripts encoding ER-targeted proteins increased
and cardiac structure and function after myocardial infarction improved. Our concept is that RRBP1 localizes
specific mRNAs that encode secretory proteins to the ER, and that this localization is important for the
synthesis of proteins that improve ER secretory capacity, as well as secreted proteins. This has led to the
hypothesis that RRBP1 mechanistically links post-transcriptional control of secretory protein expression and
ER secretory capacity, which we posit to be adaptive in the heart. This hypothesis will be addressed in three
specific aims: 1) Assess the effects of RRBP1 on mRNA metabolism, 2) Examine the effects of RRBP1 on
secretory protein synthesis and cellular crosstalk, and 3) Determine the protective potential of increasing
RRBP1. These studies will be performed using an innovative molecular strategy for endogenous re-expression
of a gene that is downregulated specifically in cardiac myocytes to mechanistically dissect roles for RRBP1 as
a regulator of gene expression and response to injury. Impact: Coupling this strategy with cardiac myocyte-
specific RNA profiling and ribosome profiling will enable us to determine the effects of RRBP1 on all aspects of
RNA metabolism dynamics in cardiac myocytes, in vivo. These studies will reveal previously unappreciated
roles for RRBP-1 mediated post-transcriptional regulation of ER-localized mRNAs in cardiac myocyte viability
and cardioprotection."
10892053,"All organisms sense and adapt to changes in their environment. Alterations in organismal state can lead to
epigenetic changes that dramatically influence how an animal interacts with its environment. How organisms
acutely alter sensation based on their behavioral state is not well understood. Octopuses are incredible sensory
specialists that use ‘taste by touch’ chemotactile sensation to interact with their environment. This sensory
system is mediated by specialized chemotactile receptors (CRs) that detect poorly soluble molecules, such as
those secreted by prey. If prey is unavailable for prolonged periods, do octopuses adapt to become more
sensitive predators? One mechanism octopus might deploy to adapt is epigenetic adenosine to inosine (A-to-I)
editing. Octopuses readily diversify their proteomes through editing mRNA transcripts by swapping adenosine
for inosine, which is interpreted as a guanosine during translation. This process allows a single gene to produce
multiple different translated proteins with potentially new functions. I will test the hypothesis that manipulation of
organismal state biases preferential A-to-I editing to transiently alter protein sequence and function and modulate
the detection of environmental signals most salient to the specific organismal state. Such a mechanism could
tune the unique octopus chemotactile sensory system to be more sensitive to prey molecules when hungry. This
project will utilize a multifaceted approach spanning from RNA biology to animal behavior, providing me with
ample opportunity to learn new concepts, techniques, and establish an independent trajectory following my
postdoctoral training. My diverse advisory team will provide expert guidance in cell physiology (Nicholas Bellono),
RNA biology (Amy Lee), channel structure-function (Ryan Hibbs), and animal behavior (Venkatesh Murthy). In
these studies, I will use molecular and biochemical approaches to identify which CRs are targets of RNA editing
or are preferentially translated in response to distinct organismal states, such as starved versus fed (Aim 1). Our
preliminary data demonstrate that octopuses edit protein-coding regions of CRs during periods of starvation.
After identifying the spectrum of CR variants, I will characterize the biophysical properties of recoded CRs against
unedited CRs to determine the functional consequences of state-dependent editing (Aim 2). I will focus my
analysis on ligand sensitivity and ion permeation, which could account for increased sensitivity to prey molecules
or altered neural signaling. Finally, I will leverage these discoveries to understand how the acute editing of
individual proteins affects adaptive organismal sensation (Aim 3). I will carry out behavioral assays to test
whether specific changes in protein function correlate with altered behavior across starved and fed octopuses.
For example, if starvation-induced RNA editing of CRs alters sensitivity to prey molecules to enhance prey
detection, I will test the threshold for chemically induced arm movement in behaving octopuses. Investigating
how organisms can acutely regulate protein structure and function to alter behavior is novel and will provide
fundamental insight into mechanisms of translation, signal transduction, and evolution."
10892058,"Project Summary
 Hormone-mediated modulation of gene activation or repression through transcription factors is central to all
organisms. AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) transcription factors are critical modulators of plant growth
and provide an ideal model for exploring hormone control of gene activation and repression. Of the 23-member
ARF family, five are considered transcriptional activators and 18 are considered transcriptional repressors,
allowing for study of both of these activities in a single family.
 Under low auxin concentrations, Aux/IAA proteins repress ARF transcription factors via direct interaction
and recruitment of chromatin remodeling factors. When auxin concentrations are high, a co-receptor complex,
comprised of an F-box protein from the TRANSPORT INHIBITOR REPONSE1 (TIR1) family and an Aux/IAA
repressor protein, directly binds auxin. The F-box protein participates in a Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin
ligase, which targets the Aux/IAA protein for degradation. This degradation event relieves ARF transcription
factor repression, allowing auxin-regulated transcription. This receptor-ligand interaction allows a very short
signal transduction chain to facilitate rapid transcriptional responses to auxin.
 To understand the molecular underpinnings of ARF-ARF and ARF-Aux/IAA interactions, our lab solved the
structure of the domain driving these interactions, finding that it folds into a Type I/II Phox and Bem1 (PB1)
domain. Within this domain, there is a positively charged and a negatively charged electrostatic face on
opposing sides, creating a Janus-like protein fold. This allows for front-to-back ARF oligomerization (similar to
a set of bar magnets) in the packed crystal, in solution, and in the plant.
 In addition to the well-studied repression – derepression mechanism of regulation, our lab has discovered
that activity of a subset of ARFs can be regulated by protein phase transition driven by the combination of PB1
oligomerization and an intrinsically disordered region. Phase transition of these ARFs appears to modulate
responsiveness to auxin in a developmentally relevant context. We have further found that many ARFs are
regulated by proteasomal degradation and have identified an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in this process.
Finally, ARF interactions can be easily manipulated using PB1 domain point mutations, allowing us to direct
ARF interactions for study. Using ARFs as a model will allow us to interrogate transcription factor function in an
easily manipulated system to yield broad insight into many transcription factors.
 We are aided in our efforts by our multidisciplinary approach, extensive auxin-related molecular toolkit, and
unique reagents generated by our lab. Our lab's expertise in genetics and biochemistry/biophysics, combined
with our recent discoveries of ARF condensation and proteasomal degradation, makes us well positioned to
drive forward our understanding of phase transition and other mechanisms in regulation of transcription factor
activity."

Episodic memory is the ability to recall details about prior experiences. Researchers have historically relied on
controlled item-recognition paradigms, in complement to autobiographical recall tasks, to investigate the
biological substrates of episodic memory. Contemporary theories posit that episodic memory is supported by a
constellation of neocortical regions, in concert with the hippocampus and medial temporal cortices. Of these
neocortical regions, the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) stands out because it is reliably observed in
neuroimaging studies of episodic memory and demonstrates engagement that is sensitive to memory strength.
Although a large literature indicates that the PCC is critical for episodic memory, very little is known about its
unique role in memory or cognition more broadly. Meta-analyses of functional neuroimaging studies that have
investigated the relationship between memory tasks and PCC activations provide some insight as to the region’s
role. Strikingly, while item-recognition tasks are associated with activity in the dorsal subregion of the PCC
(dPCC), autobiographic recall tasks are uniquely associated with activity in the ventral PCC subregion (vPCC).
This functional divide mirrors similar cytoarchitectural and network-connectivity differences found along the
dorsal-ventral axis of the PCC. Furthermore, the dPCC is consistently implicated in decision-making studies,
while the vPCC has been found to be involved in the representation of specific features and semantic
associations of retrieved memories. Synthesizing across previous observations suggests that the dPCC serves
as a putative accumulator of mnemonic evidence during memory-based decisions, while the vPCC serves to
support the retrieval of details about previous episodes. However, progress in clarifying the contributions of PCC
subregions to episodic memory have been stymied due to the location of the region within the medial surface,
making it challenging to isolate the dynamics of PCC signals using traditional electrophysiological recording and
neuroimaging methods. The use of cutting-edge techniques can help overcome previous limitations in
spatiotemporal precision that have prevented advances in understanding the function of the PCC: high-resolution
functional neuroimaging and invasive electrophysiological recordings of population and single neuron activity.
An openly-available, high-resolution neuroimaging dataset containing thousands of item-recognition trials per
participant will be used to isolate the functional organization of item-recognition response patterns in the PCC.
Population responses collected via intracranial electrodes will be analyzed in order to temporally isolate tightly
coupled memory-decision and memory-retrieval processes across the PCC. Additionally, single unit recordings
from the PCC will be collected and used to test whether memory-selective and visual-selective units can be
identified in the PCC, underlying population level signals observed in response to memory decisions and
retrieval. Results from this work will provide a significant advance to our understanding of functional organization
in the PCC, helping map the ways memory deficits can progress in healthy aging and disease."
10892192,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The transition from drug use to abuse and, eventually, to dependence may be mediated by biological factors
that are present prior to drug use. Although chronic exposure to drugs of abuse is known to disrupt many
signaling pathways, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that mediate addiction susceptibility. There
is considerable interest in identifying early biomarkers for addiction susceptibility to improve addiction
prevention strategies. Most studies have been conducted in substance-dependent individuals where the
dissociation between ‘susceptibility’ and ‘consequence’ is ambiguous. I have recently identified a behavioral
phenotype in rats that reliably predicts future drug-taking behaviors and identified three proteins as potential
mediators of addiction susceptibility: sorting nexin 1 (SNX1), ryanodine receptor 2 (RYR2), and ataxin 2-like
(ATXN2L). These proteins are involved in intracellular trafficking, calcium signaling and cytoskeleton
reorganization, and have been previously linked to addiction. Precisely how differences in expression of these
proteins impact the signaling cascades underlying addiction susceptibility is not known. The overarching goal
of this proposal is to determine the functional and molecular role of proteins that mediate addiction
susceptibility and investigate how these factors are mechanistically linked to genetic and/or environmental
components of risk for addiction. To accomplish this goal, the proposed research will combine sophisticated
behavioral and computational assessments with viral, proteomic and bioinformatic approaches. In Aim 1 I will
use an inducible and reversible viral construct to bi-directionally manipulate expression of SNX1, RYR2, and
ATXN2L and also determine how changes in expression of SNX1, RYR2, and ATXN2L alter
methamphetamine self-administration and protein signaling mechanisms. In Aim 2 I will determine if variation
in the expression of SNX1, RYR2, and ATXN2L is altered in a model of genetic addiction susceptibility and is
associated with increased addiction risk. In Aim 3 I will determine if variation in expression of SNX1, RYR2,
and ATXN2L is altered in a model of environmental addiction susceptibility and is associated with increased
addiction risk. Completion of these aims will generate new insights into the signaling mechanisms of addiction
susceptibility that could identify early biological markers of risk for addiction and improve current strategies for
addiction prevention. The Principal Investigator will receive mentorship and technical training in viral and
proteomic technologies by experts in cell signaling and cellular mechanisms, and viral technologies in
motivated behaviors. Yale University and the Department Psychiatry provide exceptional facilities and
resources for completing the proposed experiments, as well as having an exceptional reputation and track
record for mentoring and transitioning early-stage investigators in to independent investigators. The proposed
training, education and research will provide the PI with the technical and professional training to become a
successful, independent addiction investigator."

Understanding kidney disease relies upon defining the complexity of cell types and states, their associated molecular profiles, and interactions within tissue neighborhoods. We pioneered the development of novel tissue processing methods in the KPMP that uses a limited amount of human kidney biopsy tissue for single nucleus (sn) omics and spatial technologies across institutions while allowing parallel histological evaluation. Using our TISAC-approved snRNA-seq assay on reference, AKI and CKD biopsies, we generated a snRNA atlas from 200K nuclei covering cortex to papilla and revealed 53 healthy and 47 altered cell states. These represent cycling, degenerative, adaptive/maladaptive and transitioning cells in tubular and interstitial compartments. We augmented these efforts by integrating these data with newer technologies that measure RNA and epigenome in the same nucleus and defined key transcription factors associated with gene expression changes in transition of healthy cell to altered cell states. In a collaborative effort in KPMP and HuBMAP, we integrated snRNA-seq, scRNA-seq, SNARE-seq2, two different spatial transcriptomic technologies and 3D cytometry. From this we were able to define biologically meaningful cell-cell interactions, cognate molecular interactions and genes associated with adaptive states that correlate with worse CKD outcomes. Deeper sampling and integrated analyses ensuring tissue economy of AKI and CKD biopsies is still needed to overcome gaps in clinicopathological-molecular determinants, and to assess effect of race, sex, ethnicity, clinical attributes, mechanisms of gene regulation, shifts in cell states, and characterization of biologically relevant niches. To this end we will use paired snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility) to define mechanisms associated with altered state transitions, which will enable discovery of potential causative epigenetic factors driving RNA or protein changes in disease (Aim 1). To further define the spatial contexts of injury niches for biological insights, we will evaluate and implement highly multiplexed spatial transcriptomics technologies (Aim 2) and integrate knowledge from our transcriptomic and epigenomic atlas with other orthogonal technologies in the KPMP and other consortia (Aim 3). This collective effort will enable the creation of a high resolution spatial molecular atlas of healthy and diseased kidneys that can be used as a benchmark to interrogate and interpret molecular information in a single patient’s biopsy that can inform clinical care."

Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of ill health and was the leading infectious cause of death in 2019, a burden
felt disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries. To accelerate progress towards the World Health
Organization’s ambitious goal to cut TB deaths by 95% and cases by 90% by 2035, new tools to prevent TB
are essential. New and repurposed vaccines against TB hold promise to fill this gap: after decades of research,
two TB vaccines have emerged from Phase II clinical trials with positive efficacy results. The existing BCG
vaccine, currently given at birth, is being reconsidered for use (‘revaccination’) in adults after a Phase IIb trial
showed 50% efficacy in preventing TB infection in adolescents. In a separate Phase IIb trial, subunit vaccine
M72-AS01e was shown to be 50% efficacious in preventing TB disease in adults. The overarching objectives of
this K01 are to (1) estimate the potential epidemiologic impact of new and repurposed TB vaccines; and (2)
identify and assess potential vaccination strategies targeting high-risk groups. We will do this using data from
the GlobalMix study, which will provide detailed country-specific social contact and mobility data from four
countries – Mozambique, Guatemala, India, and Pakistan – with diverse TB epidemic profiles. Understanding
potential differences in vaccine impact across countries can guide the design of further vaccine trials and
inform strategies for introducing new and repurposed TB vaccines into immunization programs. This K01
project will provide Dr. Nelson with skills in conducting international field work as well as building, fitting, and
analyzing TB transmission models to address questions with practical implications for TB vaccine policy and
implementation. The mentoring team, Drs. Ben Lopman (Primary Mentor), Neel Gandhi (co-Mentor), Ted
Cohen (co-Mentor), and Rob Breiman (co-Mentor), will provide Dr. Nelson with training in how to build and
analyze models of TB transmission to estimate vaccine impact, the design and conduct of vaccine trials, and
the role of modeling in development of evidence-based national and global vaccine policy. Home to the Emory
Vaccine Center and the Center for TB Research, Emory University offers abundant resources for young
investigators engaged in TB vaccine research, providing an ideal setting to carry out the proposed work. The
TB vaccine modeling framework developed in this K01 will form the basis of a future NIH R01 proposal aiming
to quantify country-level vaccine impact and develop country-specific recommendations for TB vaccine
implementation in conjunction with TB vaccine experts and policymakers. The skills Dr. Nelson will develop
have broad applicability to other infectious diseases, building a foundation for a career in infectious disease
dynamics which will address vaccine implementation challenges for emerging and endemic infections."

effectiveness in improving eating and physical activity behaviors, and reductions in obesity prevalence among
low-income, diverse children. As part of our recent 12-month R34 grant (R34DE026245), we integrated oral
health lessons and activities into the existing K-2 CATCH program. The new program, called CATCH Healthy
Smiles, was successfully tested for feasibility with K, 1st and 2nd grade children in two low income Houston
elementary schools. Of the 113 children with dental assessments, 54% of children in Kindergarten, 62% in grade
1 and 73% in grade 2 had caries experience defined by any untreated caries or at least one filled deciduous or
permanent teeth. These results, and those of prior studies, warrant the need for evidence-based school health
curricula for oral health promotion. Our primary aims are: 1) In the UG3 one-year planning period (2019-2020),
our primary aim is to finalize measurement protocols, study databases, CATCH Healthy Smiles intervention
content and delivery framework, school and staff training, and recruit schools for a 26 school cluster-RCT
(CRCT). 2) In Years 2-6 (UH3, 2020-2025), our primary aim is to conduct a school-based CRCT to determine
the efficacy of CATCH Healthy Smiles in reducing the incidence and progression of dental caries as measured
at the tooth (d2,3mft/D2,3MFT) and tooth surface level (d2,3mfs/D2,3MFS) among children starting in
kindergarten and following through 2nd grade enrolled across 26 schools serving low-income, ethnically-diverse
children. We hypothesize that, at 3-year follow up (end of 2nd grade), as compared to children in the control
schools (n=13 schools; 533 children), those in the intervention schools receiving CATCH Health Smiles (n=13
schools; 533 children) will demonstrate significantly reduced incidence and progression of dental caries. Process
evaluation data will be collected throughout to monitor intervention dosage, reach and fidelity. Our secondary
aims are, 1) to quantify the impact of CATCH Healthy Smiles on child behavioral, psychosocial and
environmental outcomes, including child oral health behaviors, diet, and school nutrition environment, and 2) to
examine the extent to which these child behavioral, psychosocial and environmental factors (tooth brushing, diet,
oral health related quality of life) mediate the intervention effects on child caries risk. The suite of CATCH pre-K
to high school programs are licensed by UTHealth to a public charity, the CATCH Global Foundation. This project
is significant because if found to be effective, a platform for scalability, sustainability and dissemination of CATCH
already exists, and opens a new line of research in school oral health."

The U.S. continues to face barriers to advancing biomedical innovation. Ongoing challenges include an
insufficient number of individuals from underrepresented backgrounds entering biomedical training and high
attrition from the research training path. To address these barriers, we are developing a multi-track post-
baccalaureate research scholars program: the Duke Preparing Research scholars In bioMEdical sciences-Post-
baccalaureate Research Education Program (PRIME-PREP), which leverages Duke University's training
expertise, a strong multiple-PI leadership team composed of individuals with overlapping expertise in research
and mentoring, an internal and external advisory board with demonstrated commitment to training, equity and
inclusion and a cohort of diverse, experienced and passionate mentors with demonstrated commitment to
training and diversity. To ensure inclusive and productive mentoring relationships, research mentors have been
identified based on their mentorship records and their established, funded independent research programs.
Prospective mentors will complete mentor training before placement of scholars in their laboratories, promoting
a culture of effective and supportive mentoring necessary for the success of the next generation of biomedical
scientists from diverse backgrounds. Drawing on the Diversity in STEM Coalition (DISC) – a coalition of regional
undergraduate and minority-serving institutions – to identify and recruit strong candidates from underrepresented
backgrounds, PRIME-PREP will seek to enhance students’ success in entering and completing research-
focused doctoral degree programs. PRIME-PREP Scholars will participate in a tailored professional development
curriculum that prepares them for successful entry into PhD and MD-PhD programs. In addition to peer
networking within the PRIME-PREP cohort, scholars will have access to a community of peers, near-peers, and
leaders across Duke University. The one-year PRIME-PREP will place students in laboratories, where a
mentored research experience will comprise 75% of their time. Professional development activities and
workshops will comprise 25% of their time, including a 6-week summer bridge program at the beginning of the
year, training in community engaged research and professional development workshops. By implementing and
adapting evidence-based PREP frameworks, PRIME-PREP will place at least 75% of participants in PhD or MD-
PhD programs within two years of program completion."

This proposal will address the most timely and important issues in statistical analysis of big imaging data. Our
project is motivated by ""The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study”, which is the largest
long-term study of brain development and child health in the United States and is funded by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH). Innovative aspects of this proposal are: 1) We develop a new Bayesian image-on-
vector regression model with novel sparse and smooth Gaussian process priors. It enables to perform
association analysis between high-resolution images of brain activity and high-dimensional vectors of social
environmental factors and clinical variables. To the best of our knowledge no existing methods can efficiently
and jointly analyze high-resolution images and high-dimensional vectors of covariates simultaneously under a
systematic modeling framework; 2) We develop a new Bayesian scalar-on-image neural network model with
sparse, smooth, and spatially-varying coefficients. This new model has great potential to make better
predictions about the risk of an adolescent initiating substance use compared to all existing methods; and more
importantly, it will identify important imaging biomarkers that are associated with substance use patterns. This
will provide a better understanding of the pathology of substance use initiation; 3) We propose a Bayesian
model for high-dimensional mediation analysis of multimodality imaging data by combining image-on-vector
regression and scalar-on-image regression with modifications. Under the potential outcome framework, !
we will define the direct effects of environmental factors/electronic health records on psychopathology, as well
as their indirect effects that are mediated through the changes in brain functions and/or structures. 4) We
develop scalable posterior computation algorithms for all of the proposed models. These efficient computation
tools will enable the possibility to apply the statistical methods in the clinical and translational research and
applications. Our methods can address two key questions about adolescent brain cognitive development: 1)
they will identify important childhood experiences and social environmental factors, such as sports, video
games, social media, unhealthy sleep patterns, and smoking, that affect brain development; 2) understand the
inferences of brain development on the risk of substance use initiation and patterns, including detailed quantity,
frequency, route of administration, and co-use patterns. !

Alcohol misuse exacerbates cognitive aging. Prospective studies associate problem drinking to increased risk
and earlier onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementia (ADRD). On the other hand, studies of
mainly social drinkers reported no or mitigating effects of alcohol use on cognitive functions. Thus, alcohol use
may influence the risks of ADRD and the impacts likely depend on the severity of alcohol consumption.
 Whereas the progression of ADRD is typically described in six stages in correlation with accumulation
of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads in the cortex and hippocampus, other studies have implicated
functional and structural changes, including neuronal loss, in the locus coeruleus (LC) in early stage AD. LC
degeneration occurs during healthy aging, and longitudinal studies have suggested the LC as a critical
structure of cognitive reserve, in support of LC noradrenergic (NA) circuit dysfunction in the development of
ADRD. Alcohol misuse may cause allostatic changes in NA signaling and accelerate LC circuit dysfunction
during aging. A substantial body of studies provide evidence for the impact of alcohol misuse on central NA
circuits and NA dysfunction as a critical mechanism linking alcohol misuse and ADRD.
 In support of this mechanistic link, we showed that LC neuromelanin imaging signals decreased more
rapidly with age in heavy as compared to light drinkers. Further, the prefrontal cortex and other structures of
the default mode network, which receives heavy NA projections from the LC, also showed significantly steeper
age-related changes in responses to cognitive control and during resting state in heavy vs. light drinkers.
Building on these data and a literature supporting hippocampal function in emotion memory, we propose to
combine MRI and longitudinal assessments of 120 old adult heavy and non/light drinkers (n=60 each, half
women, age matched) to address three aims: 1) Examine whether age-related changes in LC neuromelanin
signals vary with alcohol use and cognitive impairment and whether LC signals mediate the inter-relationship
between alcohol use and cognitive status; 2) Examine whether and how LC circuit connectivities in response to
cognitive control and emotional memory vary with alcohol use and whether the connectivity strength correlates
with LC neuromelanin signals; and 3) Examine whether and how LC neuromelanin signals and LC circuit
connectivities predict the decline in cognitive function and the potential transition from healthy aging to MCI or
from MCI to early stage AD. We will also perform exploratory analyses to examine sex differences and the
influences of other modifiable risk factors for dementia on the development of MCI and AD.
 The overarching goal of the study is to investigate the effects of alcohol misuse and NA dysfunction on
the development of ADRD. We believe that the findings would not only address a critical mechanism of ADRD
but also shed light on the etiologies of other neurodegenerative conditions that implicate NA dysfunction."

Three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting is a rapidly emerging technology that has the potential to quickly print
customized, functional, biological tissues. In recent years, much progress has been made in modifying traditional
printing systems for 3D bioprinting. However, their printed tissues often lack the resolution and complexity
necessary to achieve the essential functions, physiological conditions, and anisotropic properties found in native
tissues. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop next-generation 3D bioprinting instruments that address
the following three key technologic limitations: (1) the inability to control internal cell positions in printed matrix
material voxels and achieve the desired cell-cell spacing (i.e., cell proximity resolution < 10 µm) that is critical to
ensure proper tissue functions from the cellular level and studying cell-cell interactions in the 3D
microenvironments; (2) the inability to print tissues with high local cell densities (>109 cells/mL) as observed in
vivo; and (3) the inability to perform scaffold-free printing of large-scale tissues with multiscale biomimetic cellular
architectures (e.g., cell pattern and alignment), which are essential to achieve desired anisotropic tissue
properties and key functions that depend on multiscale cell arrangements. Over the last ten years, we have
developed a series of acoustofluidic (i.e., the fusion of acoustic and microfluidic) technologies, which are
excellent candidates to address the bottlenecks above. In particular, we have recently developed acoustofluidic
holography, an acoustics-based, biocompatible, and high-resolution cell manipulation technology that allows one
to pattern, rotate, and concentrate cell seeded matrix materials before polymerization. Building upon this
technology, in this R01 project, we propose to develop and validate an acoustofluidic 3D bioprinting prototype to
print functional tissues with high cell proximity resolution (<10 µm) and complex features (such as biomimetic
cellular architectures, controlled anisotropic properties, and high cell densities) in a biocompatible, fast, and
scalable manner. Our acoustofluidic 3D bioprinter will be validated by printing vascularized tumor spheroids with
stroma and anisotropic, innervated, vascularized skeletal muscle tissues. Compared to current 3D bioprinting
instruments, our acoustofluidic 3D bioprinter will have multiple advantages including: (1) ability to control internal
cell positions of printed matrix voxels and achieve high cell proximity resolution (< 10 µm); (2) ability to print
tissues with high local cell densities (>109 cells/mL) and controlled density distributions; (3) ability to print tissues
with multiscale cellular architectures and control tissues’ anisotropic properties without using scaffolds; and
(4) high biocompatibility (>95% viability). With these advantages, the proposed acoustofluidic 3D bioprinting
technology has the potential to significantly exceed current standards and address unmet needs in the 3D
bioprinting field. We expect that our acoustofluidic 3D bioprinting technology will be of tremendous value to
biomedical research communities working on fundamental in vitro and in vivo studies, cancer research, cell-cell
interaction studies, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and drug screening."

The overarching goal in this project, both in the funded award and in this renewal, is to advance the
structural biology method of X-ray footprinting mass spectrometry (XFMS) in capability and accessibility
such that it becomes a premiere biophysical tool for biomedical investigators around the country. XFMS
is a solution state method used to map solvent accessible regions in macromolecules on a timescale of
microseconds, yielding information on conformation, protein-protein dynamics, and bound water
location and dynamics. It has been used to obtain useful structural information on a diverse range
biological systems, from small proteins to large complexes, as well as membrane proteins, and for
mapping interaction regions in antibody-target complexes. As part of the original award, we made
substantial progress towards our main goal by developing a unique high-throughput and automated
XFMS instrument, enabling use of the method to researchers nationwide. In this proposed renewal, we
plan to build on this success to implement new capabilities in keeping with the original goal of the grant.
Specifically, we plan to integrate fluorescence and Raman spectroscopies, fast mixing with jet delivery
capability, and size exclusion directly inline with the XFMS instrument. The integration of these
technologies into the XFMS instrument will enable even more challenging biological systems to be
studied using the method. While the new specific aims are ambitious, they build naturally from our
proven track record in developing complex instrumentation and the successful research team we built
during the first grant period. Proof of principle for these technologies is presented, along with
preliminary data, and the proposal outlines the significant technical challenges involved and how they
will be overcome. The resulting technologies will be a significant gain to the biomedical research
community and will be used to meet the increasing demand for access to the XFMS method."

Aging is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and women who experience premature or early
menopause have a 50% greater risk for CVD-related death compared with women who experience
menopause at the typical age. Indeed, CVD increases aggressively after menopause and is the leading cause
of mortality in women in the US. Autonomic and blood pressure (BP) dysregulation, often demonstrated in
postmenopausal women, is associated with CVD. Although literature suggests that estrogen is cardioprotective
for premenopausal women, little is known regarding how the early loss of sex hormones in premature and early
menopause effect BP regulation. This application for a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award
(K01) is designed to advance knowledge important for understanding mechanisms contributing to increased
CVD in aging women and support the career of Dr. Manda L Keller-Ross, DPT, PhD, an Assistant Professor in
the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, in the Medical School at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Keller-
Ross is the PI of the Cardiovascular Research and Rehabilitation Laboratory, where the proposed research will
take place. The long-term objectives of this proposal are to determine mechanisms that contribute to greater
risk of CVD in premature and early menopausal women. Specifically, Dr. Keller-Ross aims to determine
mechanisms driving autonomic BP regulation in premature and early menopausal women near the age of
menopausal onset (Aim 1). She will then determine mechanisms driving autonomic BP regulation in women
who have lived ≥10 years without functioning ovaries to determine the long-term effects (Aim 2). This proposal
is in line with the mission of the NIA, to understand the nature of the aging process in women and how the loss
of sex hormones contributes to the number one killer in women, CVD. Dr. Keller-Ross has a clinical research
background and seeks mentored training and skill development to enhance her knowledge on biology of aging,
women’s health specific to the cardiovascular system and menopause and advanced techniques to measure
autonomic function. She will accomplish her career development goals through a combination of formal
coursework, mentored skill and technique development for microneurography to measure muscle sympathetic
nerve activity and noninvasive measures of baroreflex function and the empirical research described above.
Dr. Keller-Ross has established an interdisciplinary mentorship team to guide her in these research and
training activities. This committee has senior-level expertise in aging research in females, autonomic regulation
of BP research and biostatistical analysis. They are eminently qualified and fully committed to assisting Dr.
Keller-Ross to further her training, research and career path and achieve her career objectives. With this
training, Dr. Keller-Ross is poised to become a leading scientist in cardiovascular health in aging women,
producing research that is directly translatable to clinical practice devising strategic preventative and
rehabilitative therapies to improve cardiovascular health, specific to aging women."

This continuing application requests five years of support for three in-person and two virtual
conferences on time use, family inequality, and well-being. The application builds on the 2018
and 2020/1 conferences supported by NICHD and the sixteen-year history of successful time
use conferences sponsored by the Maryland Population Research Center. Proposed
conferences are critical venues for advancing knowledge and developing a diverse research
community who have expertise in time use, family inequality, and well-being over contexts and
groups. Facilitating research how COVID-19 has affected daily behaviors, interactions, and well-
being is an urgent new need. There are also critical needs to advance knowledge on
underexplored topics, including time as a pathway for racial-ethnic differences in time use and
health and time use as a social determinant of health across life stages and contexts. Building
the research community and facilitating innovative research on daily behaviors (parenting, food
behaviors, physical activity, sleep), social interactions, and life experiences (well-being), which
are key pathways between social factors and health, is needed to address persistent and
emerging individual and population health disparities. The aims of the proposal are to 1) provide
a forum for interdisciplinary research and dialogue by showcasing exemplary research and
providing opportunities to engage with and develop innovative interdisciplinary research on time
use and population health disparities; 2) identify underexplored and emerging issues in time use
research by providing an inclusive environment to surface and target critical gaps in knowledge
on time use, health, and well-being; 3) facilitate high-impact time use research and publications
by providing opportunities to form collaborative research projects and facilitate effective policy
communication on ways to apply time use and health research knowledge to improve
effectiveness and scope of public policies and programs; 4) expand and support the research
community by developing interest and expertise in using time use data to answer crucial
questions about the health and well-being of families and children among diverse scholars and
enhance substantive and methodological expertise among early career scholars from
underrepresented groups to cultivate the next generation of time use researchers. To address
these aims, the proposed conferences will provide a high-profile platform for innovative research
and methodological approaches and facilitate scientifically rigorous, policy-relevant research on
these topics across the life course, over time, and across policy contexts."

Health Sciences (EHS) entitled: “Translational Research Training Program in EHS” (T32-ES019851) at the
University of Pennsylvania (Penn). This training grant is the only dedicated mechanism to support formalized
EHS research training at the pre- and post-doctoral level at Penn and meets a significant need based on trainee
interest in the environment and its health impact and biomedical work force need. The mission of the T32
Training Program is to train the next generation of environmental health scientists to identify the
mechanisms by which environmental exposures cause disease and to translate these findings into
effective prevention and treatment and improvements in public health. The research training reflects the
translational research themes of Penn’s P30 Environmental Health Sciences Core Center, the Center of
Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET). These themes include: Air Pollution and Lung Health,
Environmental Exposures and Cancer, Windows of Susceptibility and Environmental Neuroscience. These
themes are underpinned by exposure assessment, adverse outcomes, and translation to human subjects,
communities and policy. Training is provided through course work from the Certificate Program in Environmental
Health Sciences which includes a mandatory Community Environmental Health Rotation, by conducting a full-
time translational research project co-mentored where possible by a basic-scientist and clinician-scientist to
generate new knowledge in EHS. The 48 distinguished Training Grant (TG) faculty come from Penn and
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, 22 are clinician-scientists and 21 are women. The TG supports common
experiences including a research club, a dedicated seminar series, an annual symposium dedicated to a
translational research theme, and optional externships at US EPA, the Silent Spring Institute, the Research
Institute for Fragrance Materials and a Science Policy Institute so that trainees are exposed to alternative career
options. The T32 award currently supports three predoctoral fellows to conduct dissertation research on an EHS
topic and four postdoctoral fellows to perform mentored EHS research. Predoctoral trainees are supported for a
total of three years (2nd year completion of the Certificate Program in EHS and two years dissertation research)
and postdoctoral trainees are supported for two to three years. Trainees are prepared for a suite of careers in
the employment sector e.g. academia (in EHS, Pharmacology and Toxicology), government agencies (e.g. US-
EPA, CDC, FDA, NTP, NIEHS); and industry (drug, food, cosmetic and nanotechnology). In the last two cycles
the Training Grant has supported 29 trainees, who have published 108 papers and alumni have continued with
scientific careers in academia and industry. Since the last competitive renewal 38% of the trainees were
underrepresented in science and 56% were women."

The purpose of this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to promote the candidate's
development as an independent health disparities researcher, with a focus on primary care interventions
to address disparities in food insecurity and social isolation among adults with chronic conditions. Dr.
Thompson-Lastad will use mixed-methods research to study the effectiveness and implementation of
primary care interventions in order to meet her long-term career goal of advancing health equity in
diverse communities. Towards this end, the proposed mentored research for this K01 award is to assess
an innovative model of care that provides prescriptions for fresh fruit and vegetables with or without
group medical visits (GMVs) to ethnically and linguistically diverse, low-income patients. To support this
research and Dr. Thompson-Lastad’s goal of independent health equity research, this K01 proposal
includes formal, mentored training through coursework and tailored tutorials in quantitative methods for
practice-based research, measurement of social needs in health care settings, community-engaged
methods, and responsible conduct of research. This training will be applied to research with two specific
aims: (1) Assess the implementation of produce prescriptions and group medical visits at nine clinics
using a longitudinal process evaluation; and (2) Examine changes in food insecurity and social isolation
among 400 adults with diabetes receiving produce prescriptions with and without GMV participation.
This research leverages interventions implemented by a USDA-funded partnership which includes a
network of Federally Qualified Health Centers, county government, and local farms. The partnership will
design and implement the intervention. University of California, San Francisco is an ideal environment
for the proposed training because it provides access to experts in health disparities, social needs, and
diabetes. Completion of the proposed research and career development activities will inform the
development of an R01-level clinical trial focused on how group medical visits with food access
components influence social connectedness, health outcomes, and social needs over time among FQHC
populations. Completing the K01 will ensure Dr. Thompson-Lastad’s ability to conduct independent
research on primary care interventions to advance health equity among ethnically diverse, multilingual
populations."
10867373,"Project Summary for The Development and Experimental Verification of Computational
 Methods to Design Therapeutic Proteins
 Therapeutic proteins are an important tool in modern medicine, and their use in treating serious illnesses
such as cancer and autoimmune diseases continues to grow annually. Antibodies are one of the most important
classes of therapeutic proteins. They occur naturally in the immune system, where they bind strongly and
specifically to foreign molecules, acting as flags to the rest of the immune system by indicating the presence of
materials that should be eliminated from the body. The use of antibodies by medical professionals allows them
to guide patients’ immune responses to improve their health outcomes.
 Although antibodies offer tremendous benefits, they are not without their limitations. They are large, delicate
proteins that are relatively expensive to produce, difficult to formulate at high concentrations, and sensitive to
the conditions at which they are stored. Additionally, the experimental methods that are currently used to
develop new antibodies are time consuming and while they can control the molecule the antibodies bind (i.e.
antigens), it is extremely difficult to target specific regions (i.e. epitopes) of those molecules. Finally, there are
many experimental and clinical applications where antibodies are currently used despite not being the most
appropriate protein for the purpose because there are not convenient alternatives available.
 Advances in computational protein design over the last decade are poised to revolutionize the development
of antibodies and other therapeutic proteins. Recently, the Pantazes Lab at Auburn University has created
software capable of designing antibodies or any of 50+ other binding proteins in as little as a few minutes on a
personal computer to bind any target epitope of any desired antigen. Preliminary experimental results of this
method appear very promising. Over the next five years, the lab plans on building on this foundation to create a
therapeutic protein development workflow with unprecedented flexibility. Proposed research includes: 1)
Improving the computational design and selection criteria to enhance experimental viability, thereby providing
end users confidence that what they design will function as predicted; 2) Expanding the design capabilities to
include specific interactions, permitting the design of pH-sensitive binding proteins and enzymes; 3) Extending
the design principles from binding proteins to peptides, enabling the design of any amino acid based binding
moiety; and 4) Designing a synthetic binding protein with all of the benefits of antibodies and none of the
drawbacks. Each project will involve both computational development as well as experimental validation.
 Altogether, this research will allow for the rapid design of an optimized binding protein for therapeutic
applications. Whether it is developing personalized cancer treatments, fighting an antibiotic-resistant bacteria,
or countering an emerging pandemic, doctors will be able to develop novel treatments in a timely manner."
10867377,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by two major chromosome abnormalities, loss of 3p
and gain of 5q, which occur nearly universally in this disease. Here we focus on the unique insights these defects
provide into activities at the nexus of chromatin and cytoskeletal biology: coordinated activity of chromatin
remodelers on spindle microtubules needed for the integrity of mitosis. Colocalized on chromosome 3p
are the chromatin remodelers SETD2, PBRM1, and BAP1 and the E3 ligase VHL. Our groups together have
pioneered the concept that SETD2 and PBRM1 have active roles on the cytoskeleton that regulate mitotic fidelity,
with impacts on genomic integrity that are only now being revealed. SETD2 is a methyltransferase for both
histones and spindle microtubules. Using mutant alleles, we isolated loss of microtubule methylation as
underlying the genomic instability tied to SETD2 loss. We further discovered that PBRM1, a substrate
recognition member of the PBAF chromatin remodeler, specifically recognizes the SETD2 methyl mark on
microtubules, and like the mark it “reads”, is required for genomic stability. Finally, we identified the mitotic
kinase AURKA as a new target for VHL-mediated degradation, linking this canonical protein (VHL) to complex
regulation of mitotic spindle assembly in ccRCC. In Preliminary Data, we find in addition to VHL loss stabilizing
AURKA, AURKA regulates SETD2 via phosphorylation on S2080, connecting VHL and SETD2 for the first time
in a common oncogenic pathway. We have also discovered another chromatin remodeler, the chromosome 5q
histone methyltransferase NSD1, is also acting at the spindle, and excitingly scores in a CRISPR synthetic
lethality screen with SETD2 loss.
Our Overarching Hypothesis for this application is that VHL and RCC-associated 3p and 5q chromatin
remodelers coordinately regulate methylation of spindle microtubules to maintain genomic stability,
which when defective, offers unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention. To address our
Overarching Hypothesis, we offer three Specific Aims: We will 1) dissect the convergence on the mitotic spindle
of 3p and 5q ccRCC chromatin remodelers, 2) define the features of their interactions at the molecular and
biochemical levels that promote mitotic integrity or failure, and 3) mechanistically evaluate points of intervention
that lend insight into the controls governing mitotic spindle integrity. To accomplish these aims, we will use
innovative tools and strategies that precisely evaluate combinatorial mono- and bi-allelic loss of 3p and 5q genes
that occur during progression of ccRCC, as well as a rich pipeline of primary ccRCC organoids.
The classic genomic features of ccRCC provide new insights on how cytoskeletal activities of chromatin
remodelers converge to maintain genomic stability, the principles of study are broadly applicable to many other
cancers and have important ramifications for the development of targeted therapies for this disease."
10867477,"Project Abstract
Decades after extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was first used to support children with severe
pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS), pediatric intensivists lack both prospective studies of
long-term outcomes in ECMO for PARDS and well-powered studies comparing the impact of ECMO initiation
strategies on mortality and morbidity. While clinicians lack the equipoise necessary to randomize ECMO in
dying children, there is uncertainty on if and when it is best to initiate ECMO to preserve survival, functioning,
and quality of life. To answer the question, if and when ECMO should be initiated in children with severe
PARDS, it is necessary to compare the long-term outcomes in ECMO supported children to otherwise similar
children who did not receive ECMO at the same threshold if at all.
An opportunity to address this question is provided by NHLBI-funded Prone and Oscillation Pediatric Clinical
Trial (PROSpect) and the ECMO registry, Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). PROSpect is a
randomized clinical trial testing the impact of supine/prone positioning and conventional mechanical
ventilation/high-frequency oscillatory ventilation on short and long-term clinical outcomes in 1,000 children with
severe PARDS. PROSpect manages subjects with a rigorous protocol that reserves ECMO for protocol failure.
The ELSO Registry includes children receiving usual care ECMO, initiated at the discretion of the intensivist.
ASCEND (ARDS in Children and ECMO initiation strategies impact on Neuro-Development) will harmonize
PROSpect and ELSO data collection and prospectively measure long-term functional status and quality of life
in 550 children with severe PARDS from ELSO sites. ASCEND will then match children in both groups on their
propensity to receive usual care ECMO. ASCEND combines real-world observational data (from ELSO) and a
randomized clinical trial (from PROSpect) by matching similarly critically ill children treated under usual care
ECMO or a rigorous ventilation protocol that reserves ECMO for protocol failure. Our specific aims include:
Aim 1: We will test the hypotheses that one year after children receive usual care ECMO for PARDS, there will
be a decline in long-term functional status and health-related quality of life as well as an increase in the
proportion of children receiving respiratory support.
Aim 2: We will test the hypotheses that 90-day mortality, one-year functional status, and one-year health-
related quality of life are not equivalent for children with usual care ECMO (in ELSO) and PROSpect's
protocolized therapies."
10867481,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The rationale for this application is to fill the current void in clinical research training for the emerging discipline
of fetal-neonatal neurology. The rapid development of the fetal and newborn brain, and the unique genetic and
environmental factors that threaten such development, make the immature brain distinctly different from that of
even older infants. Yet, despite the growing recognition of the lifespan impact of events during this critical
period, clinical and research training in neurology of the fetus and newborn remains remarkably inadequate.
The objective of this program is to provide multidisciplinary training in clinical neuroscience research within the
context of the fetal/neonatal environment. Trainees will enter a two to three year program with an MD, DO,
PhD or MD/PhD. The primary site for the Clinical Research Training Program for the Fetal Neonatal Brain
is the Children’s National Health System (CNHS) in Washington, D.C. Training will be provided in the
responsible conduct of research, the acquisition of high-throughput ‘bedside’ clinical data in the NICU, and the
processing and analysis of data using sophisticated neurodiagnostic techniques. Two NIH-funded Principal
Investigators with complementary clinical and research expertise will be supported by neuroscience
preceptors (neurology, neuroradiology, neurogenetics), and mentors/subject matter experts from neonatal
intensive care, neonatal cardiac surgery, and clinical research methodology. The mentorship team is
assembled from Children’s National and the George Washington University (GWU). Children’s National is well
positioned to lead this program, based on (i) its strengths in translational and clinical research, and mentorship
in the central areas of inquiry; (ii) its formal funded research collaboration (CNICA Program) with Inova
Women’s and Children’s Hospitals, and (iii) the strength of its fetal and neonatal medicine programs. Each
trainee will develop special expertise in an advanced neurodiagnostic technique, complete a Master’s of
Science in Health Sciences Clinical (MSHS) at GWU or equivalent, and will design and implement a
research project overseen by her/his mentorship team. By graduation, the trainee will have presented his/her
data to at least one national research meeting, submitted one or more manuscripts to external peer-reviewed
journals, and have a well-formulated plan for a grant application. The program will prepare trainees with the

The human genome is organized in 3-dimensional (3D) space, with spatially-distinct nuclear regions creating
higher-level order that controls essential processes. For example, DNA replication occurs within nuclear foci that
are spatially-separated from transcription condensates that contain active gene promoter and enhancer
elements. Indeed, replication and transcription exhibit remarkable coordination ensuring genetic and epigenetic
information are conserved upon cell division. Transcription condensates are temporally dynamic and undergo
reorganization throughout S phase. How this level of control is achieved is poorly understood, and thus, it is
unknown how replication and transcription remain spatially separated to prevent transcription-replication conflicts
(TRCs) that destabilize the genome. We are uniquely positioned to answer this question given our recent
progress uncovering ATR (ataxia-telangiectasia and rad3-related), a DNA damage checkpoint kinase, as a key
regulator of transcription condensate function. ATR accumulates within condensates during S phase, signals a
change in condensate composition, and alters the RNA polymerase II transcription cycle. Moreover, acute
inhibition of ATR increases TRCs suggesting its function in transcription condensates is critical for coordinating
replication and transcription. Interestingly, we have observed a subset of ATR-regulated condensates to co-
localize with histone locus bodies, where the replication-dependent histones are transcribed and the resulting
pre-mRNAs are processed coupling histone biosynthesis to S phase. Intriguingly, loss of ATR deregulates
multiple steps of histone production and elevates histone levels correlating with a shutdown of replication and
the appearance of markers of global replication catastrophe. This raises the question as to whether disruption of
histone biosynthesis is a key driver of replication catastrophe upon loss of ATR signaling. We will answer this
question and uncover the ATR-dependent mechanisms that couple histone biosynthesis within nuclear bodies
to S phase. Our exciting progress stands in contrast to the classical view of ATR signaling as predominantly a
driver of the replication stress response and implicates ATR as a key regulator of nuclear dynamics in 3D space
during S phase. Finally, we will develop a novel 3D chromatin conformation technology to study how replication
of transcriptionally-active regions impacts promoter-enhancer contacts. We will use the technology to elucidate
the mechanisms that promote re-establishment of 3D interactions post-replication and ensure faithful
transmission of 3D genome organization and the transcriptional identity of cells across S phase. In sum, my
research program over the next five years will lead to important discoveries as to how cells maintain
transcriptional states and genome organization during the highly dynamic period of S phase."

The Network for Data-Intensive Research on Aging (NDIRA) will support an emerging interdisciplinary
community of scientists using novel collections of cross-sectional, longitudinal, and contextual data for research
on population aging. NDIRA will bring established scholars of aging together with scholars new to the field and
introduce them to data that are fundamental to understanding health outcomes at older ages. By fostering
communication and collaboration, as well as providing hands-on assistance in data management and analysis,
we will contribute to both the talent pool and the data resource pool for addressing the demography and
economics of aging.
Innovative NIA-supported data infrastructure projects are opening new opportunities for
understanding trends and disparities in population aging, the impact of early life experiences on later life
outcomes, and the effect of changing economic, familial, environmental, geographic, cultural, and institutional
contexts on the older population. Many of these new data sources pose significant challenges for researchers
because of their large scale, complex structure, or restricted access. NDIRA is designed to mitigate these
challenges by fostering a community of scholars that will draw on novel data sources for research on aging. The
Core will promote research that addresses key priorities of the NIA’s Division of Behavioral and Social Research.
NDIRA will (1) build a broad community of researchers engaged in data-intensive research on aging; (2) identify
and address common problems faced by those researchers; and (3) engage new users and increase the diversity
of the research community."

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), the most common childhood behavioral diagnosis, is a
heterogeneous disorder linked to poor adult outcomes. The challenge of ADHD treatment and the limitations of
current approaches are exemplified in the results of the most comprehensive, NIH-funded study (Multimodal
Treatment of ADHD) in which, at 8-year follow up, individuals in all four treatment arms showed the same high
rates of psychiatric hospitalizations, traffic citations, illicit drug use, and arrests. These results call for a need to
explore innovative therapeutic option such as circuit-based noninvasive neuromodulation. Here we propose to
use accelerated (i.e., >1 session/day) intermittent theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) to target
the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA), a brain region affected in ADHD and involved in the abnormal
response inhibition observed in this disorder. The proposed target engagement will focus on neurophysiologic
and behavioral measures. The rationale of the proposal is based on preliminary data showing that transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) inhibitory network biomarkers can be
modulated by pre-SMA iTBS. We hypothesize that pre-SMA iTBS can modulate inhibitory network biomarkers
(R61 phase) and behavioral response inhibition (R33) in ADHD. In the R61 phase, we will deliver sham-
controlled accelerated pre-SMA iTBS (2 iTBS sessions per day) to 40 ADHD adolescents (12-17 years old) to
detect whether TMS-quantified (cortical silent period, short-interval intracortical inhibition; Aim 1) and EEG-
based (alpha and beta-band power; Aim 2) inhibitory biomarkers can be modulated. For Aim 3 (R33 phase),
we propose to recruit 50 ADHD adolescents and deliver 5 consecutive days of sham vs active accelerated pre-
SMA iTBS (total 10 iTBS sessions) and quantify iTBS effects on stop-signal reaction time. Completion of this
project will provide the basis for designing a large sample clinical trial for the treatment of ADHD. Furthermore,
this study will provide crucial tolerability and safety data for accelerated iTBS in the pediatric population and
promote repetitive TMS research in other pediatric neuropsychiatric disorders."
10868464,"Project Summary/Abstract
Suicide rates have nearly doubled among adolescent girls over the past decade. During this same time period,
social media sites (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook) have become ubiquitous, with nearly 97% of youth
now using social media. Social media offers both risks and benefits for adolescent development. However,
there is likely a vulnerable subset of youth for whom social media use influences suicidal thoughts and
behaviors (STBs). The primary goal of this study is to examine how and for whom social media use contributes
risk for STBs, so that we may better identify and intervene with youth most at risk. A multi-method approach,
integrating computational psychiatry and experimental techniques, will be used to investigate the specific
mechanisms by which social media use affects STBs. Data will be collected from both an existing dataset (n ~
2,000) and a recruited sample (n = 90 adolescent females, ages 14-17, with lifetime history of STBs). To
identify specific, directly observable social media experiences that heighten risk for STBs, digital trace data
(i.e., social media content and meta-data) will be collected directly from adolescents’ social media pages and
analyzed using machine learning techniques. In addition, an innovative laboratory paradigm with eye-
tracking/pupillometry will be used to examine cognitive and affective responses to social media use that
increase vulnerability to STBs. Participant STBs will be assessed at baseline, 3-month-, and 6-month follow
ups. The aims of the study are well-aligned with the candidate’s long-term career goal of becoming an
independent investigator of adolescent social media use and mental health. To purse this research agenda
going forward, the candidate proposes training in four key areas: (1) machine learning methods for analyzing
digital trace data, (2) experimental eye tracking/pupillometry paradigms, (3) mechanism-based translational
research in adolescent suicide risk, and (4) professional development, with an emphasis on training in effective
interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethics of social media research. A team of mentors and consultants from
multiple disciplines will facilitate the candidate’s training, including experts in youth suicide risk, machine
learning and natural language processing, and experimental peer interaction paradigms. The diverse
resources available at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will ensure successful completion of the
project and foster the development of the candidate’s research program. The proposed study has the potential
to contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of social media in adolescent suicide risk. Completion
of the proposed research and training goals will uniquely position the candidate to become a leader in the field
of adolescent social media use."

 Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be used to generate 3-dimensional lung organoid
structures. However, most lung organoid studies have focused on human iPSC-derived lung epithelial subtypes.
They have not to date included human iPSC-derived endothelial cells and systematically addressed the critical
role of lung vascular endothelial cells and vascular perfusion itself in the generation and maturation of lung
organoids which model human lung structures. The alveolar units consist of two predominant cell types –
epithelial cells (EpiC)(40-45% of total cells) and endothelial cells (EC) (45-50% of total cells). Our key
Supporting Data support the critical and heretofore underestimated role of human lung vascular endothelial
cells in guiding differentiation of human lung epithelial progenitor cells and formation of vascularized human lung
organoid. We propose to use this novel platform generated by integration of hiPSC-derived epithelial and
endothelial cells to address the following aims: Aim 1 tests the hypothesis that endothelial cell-derived
angiocrine signals in lung organoids activate Wnt signaling and mediate the maturation of lung alveolar units and
the corollary hypothesis that reciprocal epicrine signaling of EpiC regulates lung EC fate, generation of recently
described specific lung EC populations and lung microvessel patterning at the level of alveoli. Aim 2 will test
the hypothesis that the vascularized and perfused human lung organoid serves as a translationally relevant
reductionist model for teasing apart the elusive signaling and molecular mechanisms of inflammatory injury at
the level of the alveolar unit and resolution of injury. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that lung EC signaling through
the upregulation of ACE2 in alveolar Type II epithelial cells promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection of lungs.
Together the proposed studies through their focus on lung EC and vascularization of human lung organoid and
incorporation of alveolar epithelial cells in this system will uncover fundamental mechanisms of how the
vascularized alveolar unit functions in health to maintain homeostasis and how defective cross-talk between EC
and alveolar epithelial cells contributes to inflammatory lung disease."
10906131,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
 This is a submission for a National Institutes of Health R21/R33 award aiming to develop and validate a
context-appropriate, inexpensive mobile phone-based pediatric reflectance pulse oximeter compatible with an
interoperable hypoxemia surveillance system (R21 period), and then to evaluate the field implementation of a
mobile phone reflectance pulse oximeter and hypoxemia eHealth system using a cluster, randomized
controlled trial (R33 period). Lower respiratory infections (LRIs) are the leading infectious cause of death
globally among children below five years of age in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).
Hypoxemia, a low oxyhemoglobin saturation, is a key indicator of elevated LRI mortality risk. Pulse oximeters
are devices that non-invasively measure the peripheral oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) to identify
hypoxemia, but are not widely available in LMICs for children, especially at primary healthcare clinics where
children first access care. Although oxygen is potentially a life-saving treatment for hypoxemic LRIs, health
systems in LMICs do not have well established oxygen systems to appropriately match supply with demand to
optimally benefit children.
 We aim to develop, validate, and rigorously evaluate the implementation of an innovative, inexpensive
mobile phone-based reflectance pulse oximeter, embedded within an electronic health DHIS2 platform for real-
time hypoxemia diagnosis and surveillance of children in LMICs. We hypothesize that the pulse oximeter's
performance will be valid and that its implementation within a DHIS2 electronic health platform will address key
implementation endpoints in a conceptual framework and theory of change construct for improving pediatric
LRI mortality in LMICs. To accomplish our overall project goal we will build upon our prior successful pediatric
pulse oximeter development work in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia using an innovative, multidisciplinary
product development process called human centered design. During the two-year R21 period we will apply the
human centered design approach to develop a mobile phone-based reflectance pulse oximeter and eHealth
system (Aim 1). The device will be validated in a breath-down laboratory and field tested in various clinical
settings with a range of practitioners in Cape Town, South Africa. We will then implement the pulse oximeter
and DHIS2 system within a large township in Cape Town, South Africa and conduct a cluster, randomized
controlled trial to evaluate implementation fidelity as the primary outcome (Aim 2), as well as secondary
outcomes of implementation acceptability and feasibility.
 Successful completion of the research described in this application could lead to broader scale-up of an
affordable, sustainable interoperable hypoxemia eHealth system with advanced but accessible mobile phone
technology contextually appropriate for LMICs, where most pediatric deaths from hypoxemic LRIs occur."

Prompt, high-quality emergency care saves lives. Despite this, formal trauma and emergency medical systems
are rare in most LMICs. In this application, we propose to establish “Rwanda912” as an innovative mHealth
platform to improve the existing prehospital system by accurately locating patients and facilitating communication
between dispatch, ambulance and emergency triage staff. We will conduct this study in two phases: an R21
phase to establish baseline outcome measures, and develop and test the intervention, and an R33 phase to
evaluate the intervention using a type 2 hybrid effectiveness/implementation design. In the R21 phase, we will
establish baseline prehospital care time-based outcomes using a pilot software application to collect time data
and exploratory clinical outcomes for trauma patients using the existing WHO Trauma Registry in Kigali, Rwanda.
Then will develop the innovative Rwanda912 mHealth platform using the accelerated-create-to-sustainment
(ACTS) model and assess for accuracy, reliability and stakeholder acceptability through a mixed-methods
approach. In the R33 phase, we will implement and optimize the Rwanda912 platform for the clinical setting
again using the ACTS model and then evaluate the implementation to determine acceptability, feasibility and
fidelity using the Proctor framework. We will determine effectiveness based on an anticipated 10% reduction in
total prehospital time with 90% power using a Type 2 hybrid implementation/effectiveness design. We will use
an interrupted time series statistical design to evaluate the primary outcome based on one year of ambulance
deployments pre and post implementation (n=6600). This project will leverage our established collaboration in
this setting, foster mHealth development and research capacity in four Masters student, one PhD student and
four software developers in Kigali. This will create a foundation for future funding applications to develop,
implement and evaluate additional platform features such as a public interface. Study findings will serve as a
model for developing a similar communication platform to support pre-hospital emergency care in other LMIC
settings."
10876705,"Project Summary
Strong epidemiological evidence linking cannabis use to depression and suicide suggests that the
endocannabinoid (eCB) system plays a key role in its pathophysiology. Understanding the neurobiology of
depression and suicide in young people is critically needed to identify new therapeutic targets for prevention
and treatment.
Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of eCBs such as
anandamide setting the tone of the eCB. In humans (periphery and postmortem) previous studies have
shown some evidence of altered eCB in depression. We present preliminary clinical data showing
relationships between FAAH and mood symptoms/guilt/resentment/impulsivity and aggression and trauma
(below age 6) and significant sex effects (higher FAAH in females). Preliminary postmortem data suggesting a
potential increase in FAAH protein expression in MDD who died by suicide (intermediate response in MDD) in
prefrontal Cortex (PFC), consistent with recent reports of reduction anandamide levels (likely high FAAH) in
suicide attempters. In addition, FAAH inhibition and the elevation of anandamide has been proposed as
treatment for depression/anxiety. Furthermore, anandamide can inhibit synaptic reuptake of neurotransmitters
implicated in depression. However, no study has investigated brain FAAH, the eCB gatekeeping enzyme,
in-vivo in brain in depression with and without suicide attempts, compared to healthy controls.
Our team has synthesized [11C]CURB and demonstrated its excellent properties for selective and reliable
PET brain imaging of FAAH (72). We also established the safety, validation and dosimetry of [11C]CURB
as well as its reproducible quantification (75, 76). Thus, the overall aim of our proposal is to use a novel and
validated radiotracer, [11C]CURB, to quantify the eCB rate limiting enzyme FAAH using Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) with a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) in young adults with current unipolar
(non-psychotic) major depression with a recent suicide attempt within the last 6 months with a lethality score of at
least 3 (D+SA), compared with similar age/sex matched depressed patients without life history of a suicide attempt
(D-SA) and age/sex matched Healthy Volunteers (HV). Our study will be the first to investigate the contribution of
the eCB (FAAH) in depression and suicidal behaviors, perhaps usable as a novel molecular target amenable for
more physiological intervention (i.e. FAAH) to regulate eCB in depression and suicide.
The PI and her colleagues have a considerable track record of performing complex molecular PET imaging
studies in vulnerable youth (34, 73-82). The high-resolution PET scanner, well characterized radiotracer
and the infrastructure for neurobiological research in depression and suicide are novel aspects of the
project that will provide a fundamental basis for future studies of pharmacologic interventions in depression
and suicidal behavior focused on the eCB."

Enteric helminth infections remain a significant global health problem. Although infections by these parasites are
generally not fatal, they are associated with high rates of morbidity, with chronic infection often leading to anemia
and malnourishment. Infections are strongly associated with protective type-2 immune mediated intestinal
inflammation, observed across species, including mice and humans, and characterized by innate lymphoid cell
(ILC2), T helper 2 (Th2), and eosinophil recruitment and tissue injury. Mouse models of infection with intestinal
parasites have been established to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of type-2 immune responses
in greater detail: Helminths, such as Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and Heligmosomoides polygyrus, and certain
protists of the order Trichomonadida induce acute host type-2 immune defense responses in the small intestine
upon infection. Type-2 immune responses are initiated by parasite sensing interleukin-25 (IL-25) producing
epithelial tuft cells, resulting in the activation of IL-13 producing ILC2 that in turn signal back on epithelial cells.
This feedforward IL-25-ILC2-IL-13 circuit amplifies type-2 immune responses and initiates massive tissue
remodeling including tuft- and goblet cell hyperplasia, and mucus production resulting in the containment of
intestinal parasites.
Despite the previous advancements in our understanding in immune-tissue crosstalk in type-2 mediated
inflammation, we lack a complete understanding of the detailed processes underlying parasite-induced type-2
immune responses in epithelial cells. This limits effective treatment options to enteric parasitic infections. The
goal of this proposal is therefore to generate new tools to study epithelial-cell intrinsic regulation of type-2 immune
responses. In aim 1, we will generate an epithelial-cell specific conditional knock-out mouse model using
CRISPR/Cas9. In aim 2, we will validate the new mouse model in Nippostrongylus brasiliensis and
Heligmosomoides polygyrus helminth infection models. These findings may provide rational approaches to
modulate type-2 inflammation to enteric parasite infections in humans."

 Relapsed/refractory cancer is a principal cause of cancer-related death. Targeted therapies, which
represent a new generation of cancer therapies, have advanced the treatment for relapsed/refractory patients.
However, treatment effects are still heterogeneous. Only a fraction of patients who are treated with these new
therapies experience clinically beneficial outcomes. Therefore, it is critical to identify new predictive biomarkers
that can further stratify patient into subgroups that are most likely to yield a favorable or unfavorable treatment
effect. Analysis of non-randomized phase II clinical trial data to identify predictive biomarkers is particularly
important because such information is crucial to guide efficient subsequent randomized phase II or enriched
phase III trials and improve the success rate of clinical drug development. In non-randomized phase II trials,
progression-free survival (PFS) has been increasingly considered as an important clinical endpoint. As these
trials do not have an independent control arm, the PFS on the most recent prior treatment on which the patient
had experienced progression has been suggested to serve as the patient-specific control. The ratio of paired
PFSs on the new versus prior treatments is used to evaluate treatment efficacy. The PFS ratio has become an
important endpoint in the era of precision oncology. However, using paired PFS data to identify and evaluate
predictive biomarkers from non-randomized phase II trials has been hampered due to major challenges in
statistical methods. First, the identification of predictive biomarkers is typically achieved by testing the
interaction effects in multivariable models, which usually requires large sample sizes. As phase II trials usually
have small sample sizes, detecting interaction effects is challenging. Second, it is challenging to deal with high-
dimensional candidate biomarkers. Third, the PFS ratio endpoint is dependently censored, which creates a
challenge for accurate statistical inference because traditional methods for censored data require independent
censoring assumption. Fourth, there is a lack of clinically meaningful statistical measures to evaluate and
compare the accuracy of predictive biomarkers. To address these challenges, we propose to a) develop novel
semiparametric statistical models to identify and combine predictive biomarkers; and b) develop new clinically
meaningful statistical measures to evaluate and compare the accuracy of predictive biomarkers based on
paired PFS data from non-randomized phase II trials. We will implement the statistical methods into an R
package as well as a web-based application. We will also apply these new methods to three precision
medicine clinical cohorts. Our new methods will establish a systematic and effective framework to advance the
predictive biomarker analysis based on paired PFS data from non-randomized phase II trials, which will have
direct impact on drug development by facilitating more informed design for further validation in randomized
trials."
10866983,"PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT
Cancer nanomedicine is a rapidly growing area of medical research which may overcome the intrinsic limits of
convention cancer therapies for more effective and safer cancer treatment. Yet, the challenge remains in the
development of cancer nanomedicine owing to the inability for nanoparticles (NPs) to efficiently deliver
therapeutic agents into solid tumors. It has been well documented that delivering NPs into biological fluids results
in the formation of NP-protein corona which endows NPs a biological identify by unpredictably altering the
uptake, biodistribution and toxicity of NPs, thus hindering the therapeutic potential of nanomedicines. Therefore,
the objective of this proposal is to use artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to take into account NPs-interactions
protein corona fingerprints into the prediction model to improve the delivery efficiency of NPs to tumor. Our
hypothesis is that the proposed AI-based computational model will be capable of precisely predicting the
pharmacokinetic profiles of NPs and NPs libraries with desired optimal targeting efficiency by considering the
distinct protein corona fingerprints. Our methodology proposed herein can find a general use for reducing the
number of nanomedicines that need to be tested at the early-stage preclinical trials and could identify a targeted
library of novel NPs with desired delivery efficiency to tumor. Two Specific Aims of this proposal were formulated
to test the hypothesis. Aim 1: To establish a generative adversarial network (GAN) model for the predictions of a
protein corona fingerprint corresponding to physicochemical properties of distinct NPs. Aim 2: A neural ordinary
differential equation (NODE)-driven pharmacokinetic model will be developed to predict the temporal
biodistribution and tumor delivery efficiency of the protein corona-NPs complex. This design is necessary
because the protein corona patterns, which are dependent on the physiochemical properties of NPs, can
significantly change the in vivo fate of NPs. Experimental data for the AI model training are from our recently
published Nano-Tumor Database, in which tumor delivery efficiency and time-course pharmacokinetic profiles
in different tissues were evaluated. The models will be made available as a user-friendly interface, through AI-
guided design, to assist the discovery of the novel nanomedicine libraries with desired tumor delivery efficiency.
The proposed research is significant as this study addresses possible solutions to the unmet need for understanding
the interaction between protein corona and NPs that impacts their targeting to tumor. This project has broad
impacts because, upon successful completion, the AI-based system can provide proof-of-art technology for the
design of smart nanomedicines to select an optimized nanomedicine library displaying maximum efficacy at
tumor sites. Additionally, since our computational approach can be extended to different NPs and species, this
work points towards a novel way of designing and optimizing nanomedicines for a wide variety of applications."
10870042,"Prenatal ethanol exposure (PE) leads to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), which consist of many
cognitive/behavioral deficits including learning disabilities, attention and executive function deficits,
increased addiction risk, and mood disorders. FASD is the most preventable neurodevelopmental disorder,
yet the prevalence is still high which is at least 2-5% in the US and the world. Therefore, developing effective
interventions is an important goal for FASD research.
 Persistent synaptic dysfunctions including immature synapses are critical cellular mechanisms mediating
cognitive/behavioral deficits in FASD. Currently, the underlying mechanisms for these effects are not clear. We
have shown PE leads to microglial activation and aberrant endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling during adulthood.
Both microglia and eCB signaling play a critical role in the maturation, maintenance, and regulation of synaptic
functions in the brain. Furthermore, increased eCB release from activated microglia has been reported to
counter neuroinflammation. We have also observed that reducing microglial activation is associated with
normalized eCB signaling, synaptic functions, and behaviors in PE animals. These observations lead to our
central hypothesis that PE-induced persistent microglial activation leads to aberrant tonic eCB signaling, which
contributes to long-lasting impairments in synaptic maturation/dysfunctions and behavioral deficits. This
hypothesis will be verified using the ventral tegmental area dopaminergic (VTA DA) neurons as a model
system because these neurons represent an excellent approach for studying eCB signaling and synaptic
functions. Furthermore, persistent microglial activation, aberrant tonic eCB signaling, and impaired synaptic
maturation/dysfunctions have been observed in the VTA. The PE-induced synaptic dysfunctions of VTA DA
neurons are also associated with a clearly defined behavioral deficit - increased addiction risk. There are three
Specific Aims utilizing multidisciplinary approaches to systematically verify the central hypothesis.
 Aim 1 will thoroughly characterize the dose and sex effects of PE-induced impairments in tonic eCB
signaling, synaptic maturation/homeostasis, and microglial activation. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that PE-
induced aberrant tonic eCB signaling is caused by increased eCB synthesis/release from activated microglia.
Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that reducing microglial activation in PE animals can restore synaptic
dysfunctions and behavioral deficits.
 The results of the proposed studies will lead to important understanding in the cellular mechanisms
mediating the persistent cellular and cognitive/behavioral deficits of PE. The results also fill a knowledge gap
regarding how PE impacts the neuron/microglia interaction, a new exciting area of research. Lastly, the
approach employs various methods aiming at reducing microglial activation to rescue cellular and behavioral
deficits induced by PE. Therefore, the results can be readily translated to intervention strategies for FASD."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) carries significant morbidity as a result of red blood cell (RBC) sickling and
hemolysis. Stroke is one of the most devastating sequelae of SCD. Chronic transfusion therapy (CTT) reduces
stroke risk by (1) supplying normal, non-sickle RBC to circulation, thereby reducing the percentage of
endogenous sickle RBC in circulation, and (2) maintaining a higher hemoglobin (Hb), thereby suppressing
erythropoiesis of new sickle RBC. While the efficacy of CTT in stroke prophylaxis is well-established, nearly
45% of children continue to have silent or overt strokes despite CTT. The failure of CTT to prevent stroke
events may be related to inadequate reduction of circulating sickle RBC and erythropoiesis. The amount of
circulating sickle-RBC is related to the survival kinetics of both transfused RBC and endogenous sickle RBC. In
a large, longitudinal analysis of CTT in SCD, we found wide variation in the survival of donor RBC following
transfusion, with faster clearance associated with patient immune features (historical RBC alloimmunization
and spleen presence) and with donor RBC glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. To better
understand the roles of patient and donor factors in the survival and clearance of transfused RBC, we propose
a mechanistic, clinical trial during chronic transfusion episodes in patients with SCD, in which a small aliquot of
each transfused unit is labeled with biotin conjugated to RBC surface proteins, to safely identify and measure
the in vivo survival of donor RBC. Aim 1 will examine the relationships of the recipient’s immune system (past
alloimmunization, splenic volume, and markers of reticuloendothelial system function) on the post-transfusion
survival of biotin-labeled donor RBC. Aim 2 will examine the relationships of donor RBC G6PD levels and
donor RBC metabolomics with the in vivo survival and changes in donor RBC senescence markers.
Completion of these aims will increase our understanding of mechanisms for the variability in RBC survival
during CTT, identifying donor and recipient risk factors for decreased RBC survival. Ultimately this knowledge
will inform the management of CTT to improve the prevention of strokes in SCD. The applicant, Dr. Yee, is a
pediatric hematologist and an emerging clinical researcher in SCD, with a master’s degree in clinical research
and experience with pilot and prospective studies of patient-oriented research in SCD. Dr. Yee has identified
an exceptional mentorship team with expertise in RBC survival studies and biotinylation, donor RBC
metabolomics, and clinical research in SCD. The candidate's short-term career goals for this K23 application
are to 1) Develop formal expertise in transfusion medicine; 2) Expand expertise in conducting prospective,
interventional clinical research in pediatric SCD and transfusion medicine; 3) Learn the use and interpretation
of biotinylation of RBC transfusion to study transfusion survival in vivo. The candidate's long-term career goals
are to improve transfusion and cellular therapies with a personalized approach to blood transfusion in children
and adults with SCD and to improve the clinical outcomes of transfusion and other SCD therapies while
decreasing toxicity and adverse events."

 Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) infections are important causes of human disease for which no vaccine exists.
An important gap in our knowledge is how this obligate intracellular vacuolar bacterium establishes a privileged
niche--a membrane bound compartment termed the inclusion. Chlamydia encode a distinctive family of secreted
effectors, the Incs (Inclusion membrane proteins), which are translocated from the bacteria through the type III
secretion system and inserted into the inclusion membrane. We have discovered that an early expressed Inc,
IncE, binds to two different host cell protein complexes that are involved in trafficking, sorting nexins (SNX)5 and
6 as well as two closely related Q-SNARES, Syntaxin(STX)7 and STX12, which are involved in late and early
endosome trafficking, respectively. Our results support a model wherein IncE directly binds SNX5/6, which
redirects the ESCPE-1 complex (SNX5/6 together with SNX1/2) to the inclusion membrane, potentially disrupting
ESCPE-1-mediated trafficking. In preliminary experiments, we have defined the regions of IncE that are
necessary for binding to STX7/12 and discovered that IncE encodes an additional distinct short motif separate
from the SNX5/6 cargo binding motif that mimics the zero layer motif (ZLM) of the VAMP3 family of R-SNARE
proteins, known binding partners of STX7/12. This exciting observation suggests that IncE may modulate
STX7/12 vesicle fusion with the inclusion, either by stimulating it, inhibiting it, or functioning as a tether. Using
RNAi, we have discovered that STX7 and STX12 serve distinct non-overlapping roles in Ct infection. We have
created an IncE null mutant and complemented it with informative IncE variants. This heroic application of Ct
genetics will allow us to separate IncE binding to SNX5/6 from its binding to STX7/12, and to test the role of a
single Inc in an animal model of Ct genital tract infection. In this grant, we propose to employ a combination of
Ct genetics, cell biology, advanced microscopy, and biochemistry to: Aim 1. Determine the role of IncE in the
pathogenesis of Ct infections. We will characterize the phenotypes of the IncE in-frame deletion mutant strain
and informative isogenic complemented derivatives using (A) cell-based assays and (B) a mouse model of upper
genital tract infection. Aim 2. Understand the molecular mechanism and consequences of IncE:STX7/12
interactions. Using informative IncE mutant strains and proteins, we will (A) determine whether IncE:STX7/12
interactions modulate fusion, using live cell microscopy that employs novel fluorescent lipid probes (B) determine
if IncE, and specifically its ZLM, is sufficient to modulate STX7 vesicle fusion, using an in vitro liposome fusion
assay; (C) test the hypothesis that the IncE ZLM binds directly to STX7 and/or STX12, using purified proteins;
ad (D) Test whether IncE can bind simultaneously to STX7/12 and SNX5/6; Aim 3. Decode the roles of
STX7/12 in regulating the Ct intracellular lifecycle. We will investigate (A) how STX12 contributes to
homotypic inclusion fusion; (B) how STX7 contributes inclusion formation and production of infectious progeny.
Our studies will increase our knowledge of host cell biology and reveal how microbes subvert these processes."

phosphorylates residues in the endothelial VEGFR2 cytoplasmic domain to augment VEGF signaling output.

significantly reduced in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVEC) from PAH patients. Most

10867942,"PROJECT SUMMARY
According to the developmental comorbidity framework, listening difficulties in children (despite clinically normal
hearing) may occur due to multiple sources of deficits. Hence, in this study, key auditory processing, cognitive, and
linguistic factors are conceptually integrated to model how listening ability in noise relates to a crucial language outcome,
i.e., sentence comprehension in school-age children. Deficits in speech perception in noise (SPiN) are salient
characteristics of children diagnosed with auditory processing disorder and those with a history of recurrent childhood
middle ear infection. Furthermore, the majority of children with parental and teacher concern of listening difficulties have
coexisting impairments in language, attention, and learning. Existing theories suggest that lexical knowledge and working
memory (WM) capacity are crucial for children's listening in adverse situations. However, a direct test of these models
within the same study is absent in children. In this study, we will model the relationship between listening in noise ability
and sentence comprehension ability in school-age children, controlling for individual differences in attention and with
lexical knowledge as a mediator and WM capacity as a moderator. We chose sentence comprehension as the dependent
variable because it is a strong predictor of reading comprehension and academic success. Children (7- to 11 years old;
N=130) representing a continuum of listening abilities will participate in this prospective cross-sectional study that
employs standardized measures with strong psychometric properties. Based on the Lexical Restructuring model and the
previous literature, we hypothesize that lexical knowledge as a mediator will explain the causal relationship between SPiN
and sentence comprehension (i.e., why better SPiN ability may be positively associated with better sentence
comprehension skills). Based on the Ease of Language Understanding model, we predict that WM will moderate the
relationship between SPiN and sentence comprehension because this relationship is expected to be stronger for children
with high WM capacity than those with low WM capacity. In addition, we predict that WM will moderate the relationship
between lexical knowledge and sentence comprehension. This study will fill a significant gap in the developmental
literature on the nature of the relationship between listening in noise ability and language comprehension. This is
important because many children with listening concerns are reported to have failure in at least one academic area that
may not be fully explained by other diagnoses. Study findings will have direct clinical implications to assess listening in
noise abilities in a significant number of children. Results will guide long-term intervention objectives on targeting
mechanisms such as SPiN and lexical abilities in children taking into consideration WM capacity/cognitive load, to
improve their speech perception in realistic situations. This project aligns with NIDCD priority areas across Hearing and
Language to understand the influence of auditory perception in realistic listening environments."

I am an early-stage investigator and recent KL2 scholar who has used econometric and spatiotemporal meth-
ods to examine the propagation of C-19 in vulnerable populations. The focus of this R03 is to build on this work
to examine the interaction between two devastating public health emergencies: the COVID-19 (C-19) pan-
demic and climate change-amplified extreme heat events (EHEs). Although coronaviruses in general survive
longer in environments of lower humidity, temperature, and sunlight, C-19 propagation has surged in summer
months. A proposed explanation is that SARS-COV2 remains stable in hotter, humid environments, and that C-
19 transmission is promoted by heat-avoidant behavior that increases indoor physical proximity and air condi-
tioner use. EHEs adversely affected one in five Americans. Thus, EHEs may intensify C-19 propagation, partic-
ularly among more individuals and subpopulations vulnerable to both C-19-related and EHE-related morbidity
and mortality – older aged individuals with medical comorbidities, socioeconomically disadvantaged individu-
als, and minorities. An examination of this interaction will provide the first evidence of the association between
climate-amplified EHEs and C-19, providing important data for future pandemic preparedness and climate-am-
plified infectious disease propagation – a critical area of inquiry as described by several institutions, including
the Federal Government. This proposal’s central objective is to examine the relationship between EHEs and C-
19 propagation, providing data that can subsequently be translated into future tools for pandemic prepared-
ness in the age of climate change. My central hypothesis is that EHEs increase C-19 risk by increasing house-
bound populations and promoting SARS-COV2 transmission dynamics, particularly in areas with higher pro-
portions of older aged individuals, racial/ethnic minorities, and other socioeconomically disadvantaged individu-
als. I will test this hypothesis by employing multivariable spatiotemporal models with quasi-experimental de-
signs on several secondary data sources from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center (daily, nation-
wide, county-level C-19 outcomes) and patient-level data from the NCATS National COVID Cohort Collabora-
tive (N3C), combined with area-level socioeconomic data from the US census, and environmental data from
the National Weather Service (NWS) from 2020-2022. The aims are: 1) To examine the association between
EHEs and county-wide C-19 risk from a national perspective; and 2) Identify adult individual-level demo-
graphic, clinical, and area-level socioeconomic characteristics associated with increased risk of C-19 related
hospitalization after EHEs. This work is highly relevant to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Strategic
Framework for Climate Change and Health Initiative. In addition to supporting my pathway to independence as
a translational physician-scientist, findings from this proposal will lay the foundations of future work focused on
infectious disease epidemiology and climate change in a future R01 submission to the NIEHS or NIAID.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a major public health challenge in the USA and the world. In the National Survey
on Drug Use and Health (2018), 14.4 million adults aged 18 and older had AUD. This included 9.2 million men
and 5.3 million women. Furthermore, in 2014, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities accounted for 9,967 deaths in
the USA. Despite its importance, not much research has been done to identify the predisposing biological
factors that may lead to the development of AUD. While predictive models have been successful in
distinguishing between individuals with AUD and healthy controls, models identifying in advance if an individual
is prone to develop AUD, as well as the biomarkers indicating a predisposition for AUD, are still unclear. To
address this, the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) of European American (EA) and
African American (AA) has recruited subjects aged 8-68, who are longitudinally followed and evaluated for
AUD over 30 years. The subjects were also assessed in terms of electrophysiology (EEG), single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP), psychosocial and psychiatry evaluation and demographic questionnaires. The goal of
our proposed study is to conduct secondary analyses of COGA’s rich multimodal longitudinal data to develop
predictive models that can accurately predict vulnerability to AUD before an individual actually develops the
disorder. Machine learning (ML) methods hold particular promise to address this problem. Over the last
decade, ML methods applied to complex biomedical data have generally outperformed classical regression
approaches, suggesting that multi-dimensional modeling of genetic, biological and psychosocial data may best
reflect the underlying pathophysiology of AUD. Thus, in this project, we will leverage innovative ML methods,
especially those based on deep and ensemble learning, and the rich COGA data to develop multi-modal
predictive models of vulnerability to the disorder. Furthermore, the majority of the AUD predictive modeling
work has been conducted in EA populations, necessitating increased studies among underrepresented groups,
including AA and females, so that the benefits of precision medicine can reach all populations. Therefore, we
will conduct our predictive modeling analyses in subgroups stratified by age, sex, and ancestry (AA, EA). We
will also rigorously evaluate the developed predictive models in an independent validation set, stratified based
on the same criteria. Finally, we will employ systematic interpretation strategies for the models to identify EEG,
genetic (SNP, polygenic risk scores), psychosocial, psychiatric and demographic features that contribute most
strongly to accurate AUD prediction. At the conclusion of the secondary analysis-oriented work outlined in this
proposal, we expect to have identified an accurate, generalizable multi-modal predictive model of vulnerability
to AUD, as well as identified features that are associated with this serious disorder. Our work is likely to
contribute to a deeper understanding of this major public health challenge, as well as its personalized
diagnosis and treatment."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects about 25% of the general population and is associated with
other common conditions including kidney stone disease. The amount of oxalate excreted in urine is a significant
risk factor for developing calcium oxalate kidney stones and may also play a role in the progression of chronic
kidney disease. Previous studies have shown that about 50% of the urinary oxalate pool is derived from
endogenous oxalate synthesis. Ascorbic acid (AscA) turnover and glyoxylate metabolism are important
components of endogenous oxalate synthesis. A recent report demonstrated in human steatotic liver biopsies
that mRNA levels of various genes regulating oxalate synthesis from glyoxylate, including alanine gloxylate
aminotransferase (AGXT), are downregulated in NAFLD. Furthermore, urinary oxalate was positively associated
with the severity of hepatic steatosis in overweight or obese children and adolescents with biopsy-proven
NAFLD. Oxidative stress which is prevalent in those with NAFLD could promote the conversion of the anti-
oxidant, AscA to oxalate. The turnover of AscA to oxalate may be heightened in NAFLD, as the progression of
NAFLD is marked by increased inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as decreased plasma AscA. Thus,
increased endogenous oxalate synthesis from both glyoxylate and AscA could be a major driver of kidney stone
risk in those with NAFLD. This proposal will test the central hypothesis that endogenous oxalate synthesis
increases with the severity of NAFLD in non-kidney stone forming adults. Leveraging our expertise in controlled
dietary studies and utilization of carbon-13 precursors to study metabolism, as well as the large pool of patients
with NAFLD cared for at UAB, we will test the mechanistic hypotheses that AscA turnover and the metabolism
of glycolate (a glyoxylate precursor) to oxalate are increased in individuals with more severe forms of NAFLD.
We expect this pilot and feasibility study will generate important preliminary data for a future multi-
disciplinary/multi-institutional NIH R01 application focused on mechanisms underlying endogenous oxalate
synthesis in calcium oxalate kidney stone formers with and without NAFLD."

Maintenance of neurovascular health is critical for a properly functioning central nervous system (CNS).
Neurovascular disorders not only affect the CNS vasculature – accompanying damage to CNS tissue can lead
to neurological dysfunction, compromised quality of life, and even death. Brain arteriovenous malformation
(AVM) is a human neurovascular disease characterized by enlarged, tortuous, often tangled vessels that shunt
blood directly from artery to vein and promote abnormally high-velocity and high-pressure blood flow. Effective
clinical treatments for brain AVM are limited to invasive surgical procedures; thus, there is a critical need for
prevention and treatment strategies that can be delivered to patients pharmacologically. Recent sequencing
data from a mouse model of brain AVM and from human brain AVM tissue independently showed increased
Adrenomedullin (encodes a secreted vasodilatory peptide) expression in endothelial cells (ECs) from brain
AVM, as compared to controls. This proposal will test whether inhibition of Adrenomedullin signaling, using a
small molecule inhibitor in vivo and in vitro, can prevent EC abnormalities and features of brain AVM.
We will use in vivo and in vitro approaches to examine whether Adrenomedullin signaling is required for
vascular abnormalities associated with Rbpj-deficient brain AVM in mice and for cellular perturbations caused
by RBPJ deficiency in cultured human brain ECs. The rationale is as follows: (i-ii) using a genetically inducible
mouse model of brain AVM (endothelial deletion of Rbpj from postnatal day (P) 1) and an siRNA based in vitro
system for cultured human brain ECs (si-RBPJ), we recently showed that endothelial Rbpj/RBPJ deficiency
upregulates Adrenomedullin in both mouse (isolated at P14) and human brain ECs; (iii) we showed that Rbpj
occupies chromatin regions mapping to Adrenomedullin, suggesting that Adrenomedullin is a direct binding
target of Rbpj; (iv) published sequencing data from another lab showed increased Adrenomedullin expression
in human brain AVM tissue. We will test the hypothesis that pharmacological inhibition of Adrenomedullin
signaling prevents molecular and cellular abnormalities, including those that contribute to brain AVM, in
Rbpj/RBPJ-deficient brain ECs. This hypothesis will be addressed in two specific aims that will determine
whether inhibition of Adrenomedullin signaling, via in vivo or in vitro administration of the small-molecule
inhibitor NSC16311, (Aim 1) attenuates brain AVM formation in endothelial-Rbpj deficient mice and (Aim 2)
prevents cellular abnormalities in cultured, RBPJ-deficient human brain ECs.
These studies will advance our long-term research objectives, which are to understand molecular and
cellular mechanisms of brain AVM pathogenesis, including how different signaling molecules are involved, and
to identify molecular targets that may lead to new, highly effective, pharmacologically based treatments for
brain AVM. Our hope is to offer therapeutic options that alleviate symptoms of brain AVM, including
neurological complications associated with this neurovascular disease."

Living cells have a complex and often precise organization in space and time. Determining the three-
dimensional structure of proteins and other biomolecules, as well as understanding how they form functional
networks in vivo, is a major goal of modern biology. Answering these questions is paramount to understanding
both the normal functions of proteins, as well as their dysfunctions. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and
cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) are powerful imaging tools that enable visualization and structural
determination of native macromolecular complexes in vitro and in situ. Researchers use cryo-EM to resolve
isolated (macro)molecules at near-atomic or atomic resolution, whereas cryo-electron tomography can
visualize macromolecules and organelles inside unperturbed cells with molecular to near-atomic resolution.
Together, cryo-EM and cryo-ET have the potential to reveal a more comprehensive and detailed (atomic-level)
picture of the spatiotemporal organization and inner workings of cells. However, to fully realize the potential of
cryo-EM/ET imaging techniques, we need new tools and approaches that can address outstanding technical
limitations, such as radiation damage of frozen-hydrated biological specimens and the localization of specific
molecules in cryo-tomograms. Therefore, we will develop a new sample preparation strategy that can reduce
electron-induced radiolysis of frozen-hydrated specimens, thereby improving the resolution of cryo-EM/ET
images and/or the speed of structure determination (Aim 1). Additionally, we plan to develop a cloneable,
hyper-bubbling protein tag that would allow the precise localization of target proteins in otherwise noisy, and
difficult-to-parse, cryo-tomograms (Aim 2). We will then apply these new tools to biological model systems (i.e.
rapidly frozen and cryo-FIB milled E. coli and yeast cells) as proof of principle. The successful fulfillment of our
research aims will further enhance the revelatory power of cryo-EM/ET techniques and illuminate the complex
and dynamic relationship between molecular structure and function."

The goal of this project is to utilize omics approaches in conjunction with machine learning tools to develop novel
prognostic and monitoring biomarkers for Adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), the most common adult neurologic
variant of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD). X-ALD is an inherited disorder due to mutations in the ABCD1
gene. All males with a mutation and half of all females who carry a mutation in ACBD1 develop progressive
neurological symptoms affecting gait, and bowel/bladder function, and there is currently no existent therapy.
While several therapeutic strategies are rapidly emerging, the implementation of clinical trials is severely
challenged by slow and variable disease course and lack of validated monitoring and prognostic biomarkers.
Building on our prior research,
cutting edge omics techniques
the overall hypothesis of this new proposal is that by generating and integrating
evaluating metabolites and micro RNAs in patient blood plasma samples, it is
possible to identify both monitoring biomarker(s) that correlate with disease severity and prognostic biomarker(s)
that either individually or in aggregate as a biomarker signature precede clinical changes allowing the prediction
of AMN disease progression. We will test this hypothesis by in two phases in this milestone driven project. During
the initial R61 Phase, we plan to identify monitoring and prognostic biomarkers signature in longitudinal plasma
samples obtained from a cohort of AMN subjects whose blood and clinical information has already been collected
by the investigators. The identified miRNA and metabolite signature along with clinical outcome measures will
be used to create a machine learning based prediction tool. Then if successful, in the next phase, the R33 Phase,
we will validate clinical utility of monitoring and prognostic AMN biomarkers and the machine learning tool in a
new prospective multicenter cohort of AMN patients. We will accomplish our goals through a multi-disciplinary
approach which will bring together molecular biologists, neuroscientists, clinical leukodystrophy experts,
statistical experts and computer engineers with machine learning expertise. If successful, the outcome of this
research is expected to represent a necessary vertical advancement to the field and we will have (1) a clinically
assessed miRNA and metabolomic biomarker platform that is able to verify AMN disease severity as compared
to age and sex matched controls and (2) a novel machine learning based prediction tool of disease progression
in AMN."

 Rates of the disease human vibriosis caused by Vibrio infections are steadily rising world-wide, correlating
with rising ocean temperatures and increased Vibrio abundance and broader distribution in marine
ecosystems, coastal waters, and aquaculture farms. Multi-drug resistant Vibrio isolates are becoming more
prevalent, limiting the efficacy of traditional antibiotic therapy in this rapidly progressing acute disease. Thus,
there is an urgent need to develop alternative and combinatorial therapeutics for treatment of Vibrio infections.
In Vibrio species, the major pathway that controls pathogenesis is quorum sensing: cell-cell chemical
communication that bacteria use to control gene expression in response to changes in the number of bacteria
around them. In all pathogenic Vibrios, the central quorum sensing regulator LuxR/SmcR is necessary for
virulence in hosts and controls genes critical for pathogenesis: proteases, hemolysins, cytotoxins,
siderophores, and biofilms. Thus, LuxR/SmcR proteins are promising targets for drug development to directly
inhibit quorum sensing and prevent Vibrio pathogenesis. Thiophenesulfonamide compounds such as PTSP (3-
phenyl-1-(thiophen-2-ylsulfonyl)-1H-pyrazole) are potent, stable, fast-acting, specific inhibitors of LuxR/SmcR
proteins, but do not affect Vibrio cell growth or viability even at high concentrations. PTSP compounds block
protease and hemolysin production and protect shrimp from Vibrio infection in vivo. Thus, the long-term goal of
this research program is to develop PTSP and its derivatives into anti-quorum sensing therapeutic compounds
that treat vibriosis disease in humans. The primary causative agent of acute illness, morbidity, and mortality
from human vibriosis disease is Vibrio vulnificus. The proposed research aims to assess the efficacy of these
compounds at preventing colonization, decreasing virulence, and treating established V. vulnificus infections.
To accomplish these goals, the research team will employ a novel ex vivo human skin infection model for
wound infections. Pilot experiments demonstrated rapid V. vulnificus colonization and degradation of the
dermal-epidermal tissues, which are similar to phenotypes observed in the clinic. The proposed research will
apply the three-dimensional (3D) imaging technique called MiPACT to the ex vivo skin model to visualize V.
vulnificus cells in situ. The powerful combination of the ex vivo skin infection model and 3D-imaging method
will enable the research team to accomplish two primary aims: 1) examine the role of core virulence factors
during early infection and 2) assess the efficacy of PTSP treatment on V. vulnificus colonization. Collectively,
the proposed research will enable ex vivo studies of human skin reactions to V. vulnificus colonization and
provide a broad platform for observation of virulence factor effects via 3D-microscopy, in order to evaluate
thiophenesulfonamide compound efficacy against V. vulnificus skin infections."

achieved by modernizing the research base. The stakeholders identified flow cytometry and
cell sorting, confocal microscopy and microdissection, and animal behavior as facilities that
would increase investigator capacity while building the research base. These technologies are
required to be located close to the research base, since samples are difficult to send to
commercial suppliers. This technology also has limited availability in ND and is not available at
the PUIs or TCUs. The facilities are accessible to all investigators in ND and the PI of the ND

10876944,"Project Summary/Abstract
Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a progressive X-linked neurological disorder with unpredictable variation in
expression. During childhood, about 1 in 3 boys develop rapidly progressing cerebral ALD with brain
inflammation and myelin destruction. Although existing treatments stop progression of cerebral ALD when
detected at an early stage, no current assessments can identify which boys will develop cerebral ALD or when
it will begin. Newborn screening programs that identify ALD at birth offer an opportunity to provide earlier
treatment that avoids irreversible neurocognitive decline while new treatments may present safer alternatives
to standard stem cell therapy. This K23 Career Development Award aims to provide the PI with the necessary
training to become an independent investigator proficient in cross-modal methodologies to measure subtle
brain changes in children with ALD and apply those methods in clinical research protocols. With mentorship
from a team of experts at the University of Minnesota, the applicant proposes the following training objectives:
(1) to obtain knowledge and experience in acquisition and analysis of neuroimaging data; (2) to learn statistical
and computational methods for validation of novel neurocognitive tests; and (3) to acquire the expertise to
design and execute clinical trials. The overall research objectives are designed to identify early neurocognitive
and neuroimaging markers of cerebral demyelination and enhance the capacity of clinical trials of newer
therapies to define robust endpoints for boys who receive early treatment. The central hypothesis is that
deterioration in white matter fiber integrity and associated loss of interhemispheric function involving the corpus
callosum mark the onset of cerebral ALD, and begin prior to the appearance of a lesion on MRI. To test this
hypothesis, the PI will test several methods designed to measure changes associated with demyelination. The
specific aims will use longitudinal neurocognitive testing (Aim 1) and longitudinal diffusion MRI studies (Aim 2)
to identify functional and microstructural markers of cerebral ALD in boys with early stage disease, and test for
presence of these markers during the critical pre-emergent stage in at-risk boys. The neurocognitive findings
will also be compared to MRI metrics of disease progression. The successful completion of these Aims will
identify reliable indicators of disease onset and early progression. The proposed research is significant
because detection and quantification of subtle progressive brain changes in boys with ALD will allow earlier
and more effective intervention to reduce the neurocognitive morbidity. The training objectives will support the
applicant's career goals to lead a long-term program of research to identify sensitive markers of brain
dysfunction in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, with the goal of informing timing and
efficacy of interventions to achieve better patient outcomes."

Cells have evolved intricate enzymatic machineries that help them exist and survive redox stresses in their
microenvironment. Enzymatic redox sense, signal, and response mechanisms are critical for a diverse set of
physiological processes in all forms of life ranging from bacteria and plants to humans. Unlike other cellular
signaling processes, redox signaling involves highly reactive reagents such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon
monoxide (CO), and reactive oxygen species that raise concerns regarding the potential of these reagents for
participation in other non-specific reactions. Yet, such side reactions are uncommon under physiological
conditions suggesting high specificity and selectivity of enzymatic redox signal transduction pathways. In turn,
we ask the following two pertinent questions: a) What makes redox signaling pathways so specific? and b) Can
we rationally and systematically rewire redox signal transduction pathways to re-instate/disrupt cellular redox
balance? These questions have been largely overlooked from the chemical biology and bioinorganic chemistry
perspective, despite the fact that redox imbalances are responsible for a variety of diseases ranging from
neurological disorders to cancer. Our lab focuses on these paradigm shifting questions and the long-term goal
of our research program is to develop molecular strategies that rewire sensing/signaling mechanisms of
biological redox reagents involved in human health and disease. In this proposal, we focus on DosS-DosR
enzymatic signaling pathway in mycobacteria that senses NO/CO in its microenvironment and signals cellular
transition into a non-replicating, dormant state. The DosS-DosR system has three components – a heme iron
sensing domain that binds to NO/CO, a zinc-dependent signaling kinase domain that communicates the binding
event and a response domain that binds to DNA and turns on dormancy. Using our combined expertise in
metalloprotein structure-function, protein engineering, enzymology and spectroscopy, we will devise mutagenic,
metal-substitution and peptidomimetic-based approaches to rewire DosS-DosR sense, signal and response
domains. Proof-of-concept studies conducted in our laboratory have demonstrated successful rewiring of DosS-
DosR redox sensing function via structure-guided rational protein design. Future work will unravel the molecular
mechanisms of redox rewiring and its implications on cellular physiology and phenotypic responses. Our findings,
will not only provide a fundamental understanding of cellular redox sense/signal/response mechanisms, but also
inform future methodologies for treatment and prevention of redox-related diseases.
Health Relevance: Maintenance of a normal intracellular redox status is crucial for regulating physiological
responses. Any imbalance in this status results in a variety of acute and chronic degenerative diseases such as
cancer, cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Our research program aims to design molecular approaches
that rewires the ability of cells to sense and signal redox changes in their environment. These approaches could
be applied to re-instate cellular redox homeostasis in diseased states."

Germline cancer genetic testing has become a standard evidence-based practice, with risk reduction and
cancer screening guidelines for genetic carriers. Yet, many at-risk patients do not have access to genetic
services, leaving many genetic carriers unidentified. Given increasing precision medicine applications, and a
limited and geographically restricted workforce of genetic providers, innovative delivery models for genetic
services that are responsive to the needs of geographically and sociodemographically diverse patient
populations in their local health care systems are needed. Suboptimal access to genetic services is an acute
problem for childhood cancer survivors, who have high rates of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN).
Studies indicate that >10% of survivors carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutation in cancer
susceptibility genes (eg. TP53, BRCA ½). In order to identify high-risk survivors for early surveillance and
intervention, NCCN and Children's Oncology Group Guidelines recommend that survivors with a personal
and/or family history of cancer be referred for genetic services. However, <15% of these survivors have access
to genetic counseling services and both survivors and their Primary Care Providers (PCPs) are largely
unaware of their health risks and thus, adherence to high-risk surveillance guidelines is low. Our studies in
adult patients with a personal or family history of cancer suggest that remote telegenetic services (by phone or
videoconferencing) may increase access to genetic services and identification of genetic mutation carriers. Yet,
our current studies have examined these models partnering on-site with community oncology practices, limiting
scalability. This is of particular importance for childhood cancer survivors, who are widely distributed nationally
and >85% are receiving their care with PCPs. Thus, our premise is that our adapted in-home, collaborative
PCP model of remote telegenetic services can provide a scalable model that will result in increased uptake of
evidence-based recommendations for cancer genetic services in survivors. We propose a 3-arm randomized
Hybrid 1 effectiveness and implementation study in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) to evaluate
the effectiveness of our in-home, collaborative PCP model of remote telegenetic services to increase uptake
of cancer genetic testing in childhood cancer survivors compared to usual care (Aim 1), to evaluate the
effectiveness of videoconferencing to provide greater increase in knowledge, and decrease in distress and
depression as compared to remote phone services (Aim 2a), the moderators of patient outcomes (Aim 2b), and
a cost evaluation of the three study arms (Aim 2c). Also, we will conduct a multi-stakeholder mixed-methods
implementation evaluation to understand patient, provider and system factors associated with uptake of our
remote telegenetic services model, facilitators and barriers to uptake, and recommendations for future
adaptation and sustainability (Aim 3). We expect our findings will provide critical data for the basis for further
dissemination of these services among cancer survivors and other populations in need of genetic services."

Over the past 40 years, dramatic advances in the understanding of HIV infection and its therapy have
transformed HIV into a highly treatable, chronic disease. Along with this evolution, critical questions have
arisen about how basic research and clinical trials can best be linked to clinical epidemiology and outcomes
research, both in the U.S. and internationally. The goal of the Program for AIDS Clinical Research Training
(PACRT) — which has successfully trained multiple generations of leading HIV clinical investigators for the
past 30 years — is to provide training in quantitative research methodologies with a focus on HIV clinical
research to pre-doctoral PhD students and physician investigators at the most formative stages of their
careers. This training has prepared both groups to conduct clinical research of the highest quality and of direct
relevance to the prevention and treatment of HIV infection. These young investigators have made important
and substantive contributions to the scientific literature and to HIV clinical care and policy, and a large majority
have developed into successful independent investigators. In the next grant cycle, the PACRT trainees will
receive two years of research training under the close supervision and mentorship of one or more of the 14
diverse and experienced program faculty members. Trainees will receive didactic training at the Harvard T.H.
Chan School of Public Health or other Harvard University sites. Primary performance sites for the five post-
doctoral fellows will be the Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Brigham
and Women's Hospital, Boston Children’s Hospital, and Harvard Medical School. The primary site for the two
pre-doctoral fellows will be the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
This program has three specific aims for its trainees:
 1) To acquire a sufficient body of knowledge of quantitative methods to conduct independent research
 in: clinical epidemiology, outcomes research, implementation science, cost-effectiveness analysis,
 and/or clinical trials in HIV.
 2) To foster the creation of important scientific contributions with the close and longitudinal mentorship
 of program faculty.
 3) To develop a primary research focus and broad understanding of the various aspects of HIV disease
 for novel interdisciplinary investigation, leading to a successful career focused on HIV research."

 Methadone is an effective treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) that is delivered in the U.S. through
specialized Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs). Since the inception of the OTP system many decades ago,
federal regulations have required frequent clinic attendance to monitor patients’ response to treatment and
reduce the risks of methadone diversion. Patients can only ‘earn’ take-home methadone after significant time
in treatment while demonstrating rigid standards for adherence and stability. However, these classic
regulations are not grounded in strong empirical evidence.
The COVID-19 pandemic transformed service delivery practices at OTPs. To reduce crowding in clinics,
SAMHSA regulators swiftly issued regulatory exemptions that gave OTPs unprecedented discretion to provide
take-home methadone doses and deliver counseling via telehealth. OTPs were suddenly permitted to dispense
up to 14 days of take-home methadone for ‘less stable’ patients, and 28 days for ‘stable’ patients. More
recently, SAMHSA reaffirmed the regulatory exemptions and announced intentions to pursue permanent
regulatory reform for OTPs. However, research is needed to examine the scope and impact of these major
changes to care delivery.
This study will (1) characterize practice changes at OTPs following the COVID-19 pandemic and the issuance
of regulatory exemptions, (2) Examine the relationship of two major practice changes (expanded take-home
methadone and telehealth practices) and patient outcomes, (3) develop a prediction model to inform decision-
making about when patients can safely receive take-homes without increasing risk of negative outcomes, and
(4) examine the relationship between expanded take-home methadone and methadone overdose deaths at a
population level.
The study will use clinical and administrative data from BayMark Health Services, the largest provider of
outpatient OUD treatment in the U.S., with 100 OTPs in 23 states. Advanced analytical methods will be applied
to answer the research questions, including multilevel generalized linear mixed modeling, predictive modeling
and simulation methods, and interrupted time series. All analyses will consider behavioral health equity and
examine disparities with respect to patients’ sex, race, and ethnicity.
 This study will provide critical data for regulators, OTP administrators, and practitioners. It will yield highly
novel data to support evidence-driven regulatory reform, and could shape methadone treatment delivery over
the next decade and beyond. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated federal exemptions offer an
unprecedented opportunity to evaluate long-held assumptions about how methadone treatment should be
structured to maximize its benefits while safeguarding patients and the public from unintended harm."

Recent progress in the genetics of complex diseases, including neuropsychiatric diseases, has revealed that
the bulk of disease heritability is explained by the action of many common non-coding variants. Most of these
variants exert individually tiny effects on disease risk, but collectively they contribute most of the measurable
genetic risk for most diseases and typically account for between a third and half of twin estimates of heritability.
These observations motivate three important questions concerning the biology underlying phenotypic variation:
First, how do individual non-coding variants associated to disease impact biological function? A growing
number of studies, including those published by the Key Personnel of this renewal application, provide
statistical analyses that link genetic and epigenetic data to identify regulatory elements active in cell types that
are key to disease biology. However, the mechanism of regulatory action is understood just for a few examples
of genetic associations to disease.
Second, how do the causative variants conspire together to perturb genes, biological pathways and networks
and induce a disease phenotype? Despite the body of knowledge on genes and functional modules
accumulated by decades of experimental research, we lack understanding of specific gene programs and
networks through which the thousands of causative variants act to impact disease phenotypes.
Third, how is genetic variation associated to common neuropsychiatric diseases stably maintained in the
population given the loss of fitness associated to these disorders? Established population genetics models
applicable to rare diseases are inconsistent with recent data on common disease genetics.
We propose to develop new statistical and computational methods to generate biological insights from
genomic data and to apply these methods to genome-scale genotype-phenotype datasets.
We will design new strategies to combine functional genomic and molecular phenotype data with disease
association results to shed light on the proximal regulatory function of non-coding variants. We propose new
statistical methods to interpret genetic association data at different levels of biological organization ranging
from individual regulatory interactions to genes, pathways and networks. We will use population genetics
models to address conceptual issues of the origin of allelic architecture of common disease and, in particular,
neuropsychiatric diseases. Our collaboration has an extensive publication record and a record of producing
widely-used open-source software in the previous funding cycle. We have extensive computational and
statistical expertise, but our approach is always rooted in data. All proposed method development will be
guided by available large-scale genetics datasets and functional genomics datasets spanning over 2 million
samples."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) kills more than 50,000 Americans each year. Fluorouracil-based therapy remains the
standard of care and there have been no targeted therapies approved for use in CRC in the past half decade.
Mutational activation of the KRAS oncogene – which occurs more than in 40% of cases – is a major source of
intrinsic and acquired resistance to both conventional and targeted therapies in CRC. Since there are no
effective therapies that directly or indirectly target K-Ras or its downstream effector pathways, KRAS mutation
is the single greatest barrier to medical treatment for CRC.
 Large scale sequencing of cancer genomes has revealed that, among those 40% of CRCs that express
mutant K-Ras, the diversity of KRAS alleles is greater than in any other type of cancer. Epidemiological studies
demonstrate that survival and response to therapy varies depending on the KRAS genotype of the patient's
cancer, suggesting that different mutant forms of the K-Ras oncoprotein could exhibit distinct oncogenic
properties. Experimental validation of allele-specific behaviors has never been achieved, however. We will use
primary human and mouse organoids and genetically engineered mouse models to address three key
questions relating to K-Ras oncogenicity: (1) Are different mutant forms of K-Ras equivalent in their ability to
promote colorectal cancer initiation and progression? (2) Are genetic interactions between KRAS and other
genes allele-specific? (3) How do mutant forms of K-Ras influence the tumor microenvironment in a non-cell-
autonomous manner to promote cancer progression?
 The ultimate goal of this work is to decipher the “KRAS Allele Code” in order to identify therapeutic
strategies that are effective for cancers expressing specific K-Ras mutants. Precision medicine, where a
physician tailors a patient's therapy to the genes that are mutated in his/her cancer, requires this level of
understanding, especially for mutant oncoprotein that, like K-Ras, cannot be targeted with direct inhibitors."
10880419,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Bladder cancer (BC) is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S., has one of the highest recurrence rates of
all solid cancers, and is the most expensive cancer to treat from diagnosis to death. There are significant
unmet needs for biomarkers and molecular diagnostic tools to better inform decision making across all stages
of BC. This includes prediction of treatment response in patients with non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and
muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC), as well as improving diagnostic yield in patients undergoing screening
cystoscopy for hematuria. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes for BC patients through the
development and application of molecular biomarkers that facilitate personalized approaches to
detection and treatment.
Urine is an attractive source for development of BC diagnostics and we recently developed a novel strategy for
detecting urine tumor DNA called urine tumor DNA Cancer Personalized Profiling by Deep Sequencing
(uCAPP-Seq). Our preliminary data indicate that uCAPP-Seq has outstanding sensitivity and specificity for
detection and surveillance of BC. In this project we will prospectively collect urine and other biospecimens from
patients with or at risk for BC and will test the potential clinical utility of uCAPP-Seq in different clinical
scenarios. We will also test if augmenting uCAPP-Seq with analysis of urinary RNA or DNA methylation further
augments performance. Our central hypothesis is that uCAPP-Seq will enable monitoring of BC
responses during and after treatment for NMIBC and MIBC. Furthermore, we hypothesize that
combining analysis of urine DNA mutations, DNA methylation, and urine RNA will allow ultrasensitive
and specific early detection of BC. We propose three specific aims: 1) To assess the value of urine tumor
DNA for non-invasive response assessment and monitoring in patients with high risk NMIBC treated with
bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunotherapy; 2) To determine if urine tumor DNA analysis can predict
pathologic complete responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with MIBC; and 3) To develop a
Bladder Cancer Interception Assay (BCIA) which integrates utDNA mutations and methylation with urinary
RNA for ultra-sensitive detection of bladder cancer.
Successful completion of the studies proposed here will serve as a foundation for incorporating our novel
urine-based biomarkers into prospective clinical trials. We foresee that our approach will allow personalization
of treatment strategies to improve outcomes for BC patients. Importnatly, our work will serve as proof-of-
principle for an approach that could also be applied to other genitourinary cancer types."

Charlotte Farewell, PHD, MPH is a behavioral health scientist whose overarching career goal is to implement
well-being promotion programs during critical periods to reduce inequities in perinatal mental health outcomes
among low-resourced individuals. The research she proposes entitled, “Mothers Optimizing Resources
Everyday (MORE): Buffering Mental Health Inequities in Low-resourced Perinatal Populations,” aligns with
numerous NIMHD research strategies including strengthening analytical models to identify critical periods of
malleability to mitigate the intergenerational transmission of disparities, advancing understanding of how multi-
level protective factors impact health, and building the science of adapting behavioral health interventions.
Candidate: Dr. Farewell is an Assistant Professor of Community and Behavioral Health at the Colorado
School of Public Health. The proposed career development plan includes four training goals: 1. Advance
expertise in latent growth modeling; 2. Gain skills in adaptation of perinatal mental health-related research and
practice to address health inequities; 3. Enhance training in evidence-based psychological capital
interventions; and 4. Increase proficiency in dissemination and implementation science and integration of care.
Research: Perinatal mood disorders are prevalent.
Individuals who are able to acquire and maintain personal
and social resources are better situated to cope with the demands associated with the transition to
motherhood
. Psychological Capital Interventions (PCIs) are evidence-based approaches that promote mental
health and well-being. Adaptation of a multi-level PCI that seeks to foster combinations of resources across the
perinatal period may serve as an important yet underexplored strategy to optimize perinatal well-being among
low-resourced communities. Aim 1 will investigate point-estimates and trajectories of psychological capital
across the perinatal period in 300 individuals experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage. Aim 2 will identify
cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between psychological capital trajectories, social resources and
mental health outcomes. Aim 3 will consist of interviews, data integration, and an iterative adaptation process,
resulting in a multi-level PCI for perinatal populations experiencing socioeconomic disadvantage.
Summary: The innovation of MORE is threefold: 1) identification of a constellation of multi-level protective
factors that support perinatal mental health, 2) application of a life course perspective and longitudinal modeling
to investigate resources across critical, malleable periods, and 3) adaptation of PCIs that may reduce stigma by
offering support without pathologizing, thus increasing access to mental health supports. Although the root social
and economic factors must be addressed to eliminate health inequities, psychosocial interventions that bolster
resources to better cope with stress may be cost-efficient and effective strategies to reduce socioeconomic
inequities in health. This award will provide preliminary data for an R01 to implement MORE during specific
critical periods to specific subgroups in order to reduce the intergenerational transmission of health inequities."

Streamline assessment of early lethal phenotypes in the mouse
Although the generation of a loss of function allele at every locus in the mouse genome is well underway, there
is a gap in established pipelines for assessment of early lethal phenotypes (as stated in PAR-17-005). Here we
propose to continue our efforts to characterize up to 150 early lethal phenotypes occurring between fertilization
and organogenesis. As described within, we have instituted an efficient strategy to analyze early lethal
phenotypes and have already analyzed more than 100 novel phenotypes. We will provide a tremendous amount
of novel data to the scientific community and foster collaborative efforts towards functional annotation of the
mammalian genome. The proposed work capitalizes on techniques that our groups perform and publish
routinely, maximizing the data generation by eliminating training/troubleshooting steps as well as boosting our
individual research programs by providing novel phenotypes of interest. Characterization of knock-out alleles
will be invaluable towards understanding genetic pathways and predicting mechanisms of diseases/phenotypes
found in adults – in both heterozygotes and homozygous knockouts of genes in gene/protein networks or
pathways. We will provide detailed morphogenetic characterization for each mutant phenotype.
Characterization of novel gastrulation and preimplantation phenotypes will complement and extend our current
morphogenetic understanding of early developmental events.
Our proposal dovetails perfectly with existing phenotyping efforts and fills an essential need to characterize early
lethal phenotypes towards functional annotation of the genome."
10889961,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Heart failure is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world, and the leading cause of
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is coronary artery disease. The mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK) are an essential signal transduction cascade that play a central role in both cell
growth and cell death. The MEK1-ERK1/2 branch of the MAPK pathway has been shown to promote both
physiologic and pathologic growth in the heart, as well as protect against apoptotic cell death after
ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We have previously demonstrated that the transcription factor ETS2, a
member of E26 transformation-specific sequence (ETS)-domain family, is phosphorylated and activated by
Erk1/2 upon hypertrophic stimulation. Going forward, our preliminary data reveal that cardiomyocyte-
specific loss of ETS2 results in increased susceptibility to ischemic injury in both I/R and permanent ligation
(myocardial infarction) models of heart failure. Connexin43 (Cx43), the predominant gap junction channel-
forming protein in cardiomyocytes, has been suggested to play a role in both ischemic damage and ischemic
preconditioning. Our preliminary data show that ETS2 activates Cx43 transcription and that Cx43 is
downregulated in the absence of ETS2. We will test the hypothesis that the ERK1/2/ETS2 pathway protects
against I/R injury in part through the upregulation of Cx43.
Aim 1: To determine the role of the ERK1/2-ETS2 pathway in I/R injury. Our preliminary data suggest
a model in which ETS2 protects against I/R injury. We will confirm and extend this using loss- and gain-of-
function approaches in vivo and in vitro. We will track the timing of ETS2 activation by ERK and the response
of each acutely and in long-term remodeling.
Aim 2: To determine the impact of ETS2 on Cx43 expression and function in I/R injury. Our data
suggest that Cx43 plays a protective role in ischemic injury. Our preliminary data also suggest that ETS2 is
a direct transcriptional regulator of Cx43 gene expression. We will confirm and extend these findings using
both loss- and gain-of-function approaches. We will also determine the role of ETS2 in Cx43-mediated
cardioprotection in IPC.
Aim 3: To determine the downstream targets and interactors of ETS2 under conditions of cardiac
stress. We will profile genome-wide cardiac gene expression using RNAseq and ChIPseq to determine
ETS2 downstream gene targets in both acute and long-term I/R injury. We will use immunoprecipitation and
mass spectrometry to unveil novel protein interactions."
10888800,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a core component of the neural circuitry that drives goal-directed
behaviors and a primary target of drugs of abuse. Although generally regarded as a dopaminergic
nucleus, many VTA neurons can signal through release of the neurotransmitters GABA and glutamate.
These neurons are also targets of drugs of abuse but much less studied. Like VTA dopamine neurons,
activity in VTA GABA and glutamate neurons can profoundly shape motivated behaviors. Furthermore,
sub-populations of VTA neurons release more than one of these recycling transmitters, including
neurons that co-release dopamine and glutamate, or glutamate and GABA. A major goal of this
proposal is to identify how these three major transmitters released from VTA act on postsynaptic
neurons to alter behavioral reinforcement. And to assess the contribution of non-dopamine VTA
projection neurons and inputs to VTA in opioid-induced behaviors."

Candidate: I am an epidemiologist in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley
School of Public Health, and I completed my Ph.D. in Epidemiology in August 2022 at UC Berkeley. Since my
graduation, I have worked with the Center for Targeted Machine Learning and Causal Inference (CTML) to
apply cutting-edge biostatistical and causal inference methods to pressing COVID-19 research questions using
data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). I led a group of CTML epidemiologists and
biostatisticians in the NIH Long COVID Computational Challenge (L3C) competition, where we were honored
with third place for our ensemble machine learning model that accurately predicted the risk of Long COVID
diagnosis based on individual electronic health record (EHR) data in N3C. I aim to become a leader in the
application of innovative biostatistical, causal inference, and machine learning methods to impactful research
questions related to infectious disease epidemiology.
Environment: In order to attain my career goals, my training and mentorship plan will focus on recent
advances in biostatistics, causal inference, and data science methods (Targeted Machine Learning) as well as
immunology and infectious disease epidemiology. I have assembled an interdisciplinary team of expert
biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and clinicians who will support my training. Alan Hubbard (primary mentor)
and Mark van der Laan (co-mentor) will provide expert guidance and mentorship on biostatistics, data science,
and causal inference. Rena Patel (co-mentor) and Jack Colford (scientific advisor) will provide mentorship and
guidance in infectious disease epidemiology and immunology.
Research: Researchers and clinicians have made enormous progress in understanding, preventing, and
treating acute COVID-19 infection, but there is considerable uncertainty regarding the factors associated with
long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infection. Although vaccination is a key strategy for COVID-19 epidemic
control, little is known regarding the role of COVID-19 vaccination timing relative to COVID-19 infection (i.e.,
up-to-date vaccinations and boosters) in preventing long-term sequelae of infection, and the lack of objective
Long COVID biomarkers hampers our ability to evaluate, prevent, and treat Long COVID. In Aim 1, I will
evaluate the relationship between vaccination timing and Long COVID diagnosis in order to determine an
optimized vaccination schedule to minimize Long COVID. In Aim 2, I will assess the relationship between
COVID-19 vaccination timing and individual long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infection. In Aim 3, I will assess
mediation of the relationship between acute COVID-19 infection and Long COVID via interleukin 6 (IL-6) to
evaluate a biological mechanism of interest. I will apply Targeted Machine Learning methods to achieve these
aims, which will prepare me for an R01-level application to apply these methods to research questions in
infectious disease epidemiology."
10870214,"TECHNIQUES DEVELOPMENT – PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The overarching goal of the National Center of NM4R is to impact multiple RPR priorities by increasing
rehabilitation research workforce access to NM4R approaches and supporting rigorous clinical research to
translate them into effective, evidence-based rehabilitation interventions. A critical element to achieve this is to
develop, test and share new techniques and enhanced technologies in neuromodulation for rehabilitation (NM4R
– the mechanisms and use of non-invasive brain stimulation and operant conditioning of brain and spinal cord
networks integrated with rehabilitation principles). The Techniques Development component seeks to develop,
adapt and/or validate core research techniques, tools and other resources designed to improve the accessibility,
applicability, utility, validity and feasibility of these approaches for the NM4R research community. It is our
primary research vehicle to translate promising NM4R approaches into effective, evidence-based rehabilitation
interventions. The field of NM4R research is dynamic with methodology continually being refined. To advance
techniques and technology in NM4R, we have the following Specific Aims. AIM 1.Increase rigor in NM4R
design, methods and clinical trials through methods and technology development studies. Very important
methods and technology development studies are rarely “flashy” enough or large enough on their own for NIH
funding. Yet they are crucial for the translation of neuroscience ideas into rehabilitation treatments, especially in
the context of clinical trials. Tech Development currently acts as a catalyst for NM4R research by addressing
pressing questions in the field such as how to develop TMS neurophysiological techniques most relevant to the
leg when studying gait and balance. AIM 2. Perform key research to translate NM4R approaches into
evidence-based interventions. Translating promising approaches into effective treatments usually requires key
research studies to move beyond concepts. An example is the ongoing tech development project to determine
how to individually dose tDCS studies, in the same way individual motor threshold is used to dose rTMS studies.
AIM 3. Develop emerging NM techniques into NM4R tools. Currently rehabilitation lags behind psychiatry in
developing new NM based tools. We propose to introduce emerging techniques into tools for NM4R much more
quickly. Successful examples include taVNS and combined TMS-fMRI-EEG techniques."
10870215,"PILOT STUDIES – PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
The Pilot Studies component provides critical support for the NM4R community by funding new research that
will: 1) Increase rigor in NM4R design, methods and clinical trials; 2) Perform key research to translate NM4R
approaches into evidence-based interventions; or 3) Develop emerging NM techniques into NM4R tools.
Preliminary data obtained from pilot studies enable research teams to develop competitive NM4R research-
based NIH K-series and R-series (or equivalent) grant applications, as well as to support important dissemination
activities (e.g., peer reviewed publications, conference presentations, published abstracts). To accomplish its
mission, the Pilot Studies component has two Specific Aims: AIM 1. Broadly solicit, rigorously evaluate, and
selectively fund promising NM4R-focused pilot studies – especially those related to RPR priorities. We
will prioritize and fund high impact pilot studies. The ultimate goal is to provide important resources and training
for investigators to develop sufficient preliminary data to prepare competitive NIH K-series and R-series (or
equivalent) research grant applications. We will continue our to-date successful goal of funding a wide-range of
NM approaches, conditions, and populations to increase the diversity of NM4R focus areas within rehabilitation.
Research can be performed at home institutions or at MUSC, whichever would be of the most benefit to the
investigator for study conduct and preparation of competitive future funding applications. All applicants become
members of the NM4R Community, whether or not their application is funded, and are given access to the full
complement of services available through the NC NM4R (e.g., mentored collaborative consults, Level 1 [Basic
Skills] and Level 2 [In-Depth] workshops and hands-on training, and archived material available via the web
portal). AIM 2. Influence the field of NM4R through interactions with the awardees before submission and
after award. Two integrated components work hand-in-glove with the Pilot Studies component: Didactic
Interactions and Mentored Collaborative Opportunities. All three components represent entry points into this
program. Researchers attending didactic workshops engage in active discussions of their emerging research
hypotheses and are encouraged to submit pilot. The Mentored Collaborative Opportunities component serves
as an important pipeline resource for pilot applications, and once funded, continues to provide expert
consultations related to neuromodulation-based research methods and technologies. Through pre-submission
interactions with investigators and by acting as mentors or consultants during the study, the NC NM4R has
multiple opportunities to influence study design, rigor, technology application, data interpretation, translational
potential, and grantsmanship – all of which increases the likelihood of extramural funding success for the
investigator and expands capacity for NM4R across the wider Network."
10891145,"ABSTRACT: Approximately 15-20% of children experience persistent or chronic pain. However, compared to
adults, we know relatively little about the mechanisms of pediatric pain development. A basic understanding of
nociceptive processing in the immature nervous system is therefore crucial in order to develop more
appropriate treatments for pain in children. The developing peripheral nervous and immune systems are
functionally distinct from adults. These systems are vulnerable to effects of early life injury which can influence
outcomes related to nociception following subsequent injury later in life (i.e. “neonatal nociceptive priming”).
We have found that macrophages are a key player in both early life nociception and neonatal nociceptive
priming responses after incision injuries. Macrophages were found to retain an epigeneetically driven memory
of early life injury that leads to a more pro-inflammatory state such that re-injury causes a prolonged behavioral
and physiological responses in the peripheral nervous system. Observed changes in the PNS that underlie
neonatal nociceptive priming are blocked by genetic targeting of the nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor, p75,
in macrophages, one of the key factors found to be part of the epigenetic memory. New pilot data suggests
that mast cells (MCs) may be the source of NGF that sustains the pro-inflammatory state created by the
epigenetic memory in macrophages. In addition, sensory neurons also appear to generate an epigenetically
driven memory that contributes to the pro-inflammatory environment in the muscles after injury leading to
prolonged hypersensitivity. The main goal of this proposal is to determine how the epigenetic modifications in
this novel neuro-immune circuit regulates neonatal nociceptive priming. Specific Aim 1 will use our novel ex
vivo somatosensory recording preparations and pain-like behavioral assays along with cell specific transgenic
approaches to determine the additional epigenetically modified factors in macrophages (e.g. parvalbumin) that
regulate neonatal nociceptive priming. Specific Aim 2 will test whether knockdown of neuronally produced
cytokines (e.g. interleukin 34) modulates neonatal nociceptive priming using similar approaches with nerve
targeted gene knockdown strategies. Finally, Specific Aim 3 will use behavioral analyses and/or ex vivo
recording to determine the influence of MCs and MC produced NGF in neonatally incised mice on the
prolonged effects to subsequent adolescent incision. These aims will be complemented by calcium imaging
analysis of human iPSC derived sensory neurons treated with media from macrophages or MCs to enhance
translational potetinal of these studies. These experiments will allow a better understanding of the unique
mechanisms by which neuroimmune signaling contributes to neonatal nociceptive priming. These studies will
facilitate understanding of the transition from acute to chronic pediatric post-surgical pain, and will allow us to
determine the utility of targeting immune cell or sensory neuron memories as a pain therapy for children."

Maternal opioid addiction is a significant public health concern, impacting the health and well-being of both
mothers and their developing child during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Crucially, factors shaping
maternal opioid use trajectories during pregnancy and after birth are not well understood. Emerging research
indicates that elevated levels of psychosocial stress during pregnancy and the first year postpartum may
explain increased risk for opioid relapse, consistent with a larger body of research that has documented the
role of stress in the initiation and maintenance of addiction generally, and an emerging body of work focusing
on parenting stress and addiction specifically. In the current application, we will employ a short-term
longitudinal design to probe the biobehavioral mechanisms of psychosocial and parenting stress in pregnant
women receiving medication assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorder and demographically-matched
pregnant women not receiving MAT. In pregnancy we will measure psychosocial stress and maternal tolerance
of infant distress alongside characterizing craving and withdrawal symptoms. After delivery, mothers will
complete monthly batteries of assessments to further characterize psychosocial and parenting stress and
addiction symptoms. Additionally, mothers will complete neuroimaging assessments at 1 and 4 months
postpartum to identify neural mechanisms of responding to infant (and non-infant) distress cues. Our
biobehavioral characterization of psychosocial and parenting stress will then be employed in the prediction of

Visuomotor transformation (VMT), a vital process by which the brain converts vision into action, requires precise
synaptic connectivity between sensory and motor neural circuits. Impaired visuomotor processing has been
associated with a wide range of neurological disorders. Developmental and molecular origins of a VMT remain
elusive due to the lack of experimentally tractable model systems. I address this knowledge gap by interrogating
the visuomotor interface of Drosophila, where transcriptomics, connectomics and physiology can be integrated to
causally link genes and molecules with circuit structure and function. My recent work uncovered a completely new
wiring strategy underlying a VMT: visual space coordinates are transformed into synaptic weights. Such synaptic
gradient mechanism found in Visual Projection Neurons (VPN) emerges through within-cell-type synaptic
specificity. Individual neurons belonging to the same VPN cell type connect to different postsynaptic partners,
which elicits multidirectional motor programs in response to differentially localized visual stimuli. Aim 1 of my
research during the K99 phase will build on these findings and identify the transcriptomic signatures of synaptic
gradients. I hypothesize that within-cell-type synaptic specificity is achieved through transcriptomic uniqueness of
individual neurons of the same type (i.e., molecular gradients of wiring genes). In collaboration with my co-mentor
Dr. Y. Kurmangaliyev, I will test this hypothesis and generate a developmental transcriptomic atlas of the fly
visuomotor interface featuring 20 VPN cell types. Single-cell RNA-seq profiling will be followed by the validation of
candidate gene expression patterns using genetics and spatial transcriptomics. This will generate a molecular
model of synaptic gradients. Aim 2, pursued in collaboration with my co-mentor Dr. C. von Reyn, will functionally
test this model using genetic perturbation screening. Candidate genes will be misexpressed in VPNs and their
postsynaptic partners, and the effects on synaptic gradients will be assessed using electrophysiology. This work
will provide causal relationships between molecular gradients of wiring genes and within-cell-type synaptic
specificity. The mentorship I will continue to receive from Dr. Zipursky, and the training in single-cell data analysis
and electrophysiology I will acquire during the K99 phase will facilitate my transition to an independent research
program. Aim 3, to be pursued during the R00 phase, will investigate the gene regulatory networks of synaptic
specificity in visuomotor circuits. I will examine the role of global extrinsic regulatory programs (e.g., spatially graded
Wnt signaling and neural activity) in establishing synaptic gradients using a combination of Perturb-RNA-seq and
chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) analysis in VPNs. This approach will link extracellular signals with transcription
factor mediated differential gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner. I will generate models of global and local
regulation of synaptic gradients. These models will be subsequently validated and refined using electrophysiology-
based analysis. My work will bridge the gaps between genes, circuits, and behaviors, thereby providing fundamental
insights into the molecular logic of wiring a VMT."
10867333,"Summary: Both retrospective and longitudinal cohort analyses strongly associate HIV infection with the
premature initiation and progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Improving long-term
pulmonary outcomes and longevity in people living with HIV (PLWH) will require a better understanding of how
cigarette smoke accelerates COPD in this patient population. We know that exposure to cigarette smoke causes
proliferative and oxidative responses in airway epithelial cells that promote HIV-related COPD. Our prior studies
showed that the HIV protein Tat and chronic smoke exposure both reduced lung levels of the RNA binding
protein human antigen R (HuR), which regulates the balance between decay and translation of multiple mRNA
targets. Similarly, we determined that prolonged smoke exposure reduces HuR levels in primary human airway
epithelial cells (HAECs) isolated from COPD subjects and in lung tissue sections from COPD airways. The loss
of HuR is important since we found that chronic smoke exposure worsened airflow obstruction in airway specific
HuR knockout mice. Moreover, our RNA-seq studies discovered that knocking down HuR in HAECs dysregulates
cell proliferation and reduces antioxidant gene expression. Another line of evidence indicates that the proto-
oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase c-Src negatively regulates HuR expression. We identified enhanced c-Src
activation in HAECs from COPD subjects and in the lungs of EcoHIV infected mice. Thus, we hypothesize that
chronic smoke exposure and HIV induce c-Src to down regulate HuR and thereby impair airway epithelial repair
mechanisms in COPD. This loss of HuR alters the airway transcriptome to promote airflow obstruction in PLWH.
We will test the hypothesis in three aims:
Aim 1: We will use transcriptomic analysis to determine how HIV and cigarette smoke induce COPD by
altering gene expression in human airway epithelial cells from healthy, COPD and HIV/COPD subjects
Aim 2. We will employ in vivo HIV COPD models to ascertain how HuR in the airway epithelium counters
the oxidative damage that promotes airway injury and airflow obstruction in HIV.
Aim 3. We will employ in vitro and in vivo HIV COPD models to determine how c-Src regulates HuR to
alter oxidative and proliferative responses that promote airway injury and airflow obstruction in HIV.
These studies will set the stage for novel pharmacologic interventions that restore HuR expression to counter
the airway epithelial injury that impairs lung function and tissue integrity in HIV infected COPD subjects."

 Relevance to public health. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN, neutrophils) release reactive
oxygen species (ROS) to combat infection, but this inflammatory response can also initiate and propa-
gate lung damage. Acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) that is fatal in 40% of patients, are characterized by accumulation of albumin-rich fluid in the
pulmonary air spaces. Drug therapies focused on downstream cytokine actions have failed to improve
morbidity or mortality; we hypothesize, and offer evidence, that targeting the human voltage-gated pro-
ton channel (hHv1) at early steps can be more effective. We propose to target hHv1 because (i) the chan-
nel in PMN initiates and sustains the inflammatory response, (ii) C6, a unique blocker of hHv1 sup-
presses human PMN ROS production, and (iii) C6 suppresses lung compromise in an ALI mouse model.
 Brief background. This application builds on advances in the last period when we created the first
high-affinity and specific direct blocker of hHv1 (C6 peptide) and used it to show, first, that human
sperm require hHv1-mediated H+ efflux to initiate capacitation, allowing the acrosomal reaction, and
oocyte fertilization and, second, that hHv1 in human PMN is required to produce and sustain release of
inflammatory agents, including ROS and proteases, during the innate immune inflammatory response.
 Unique features and innovation. Our pilot data reveal a second target in the pathway: albumin
(Alb) is required to activate hHv1 in human PMN and we describe a peptide (L*) that blocks Alb-activa-
tion and ROS production. Supporting our driving hypothesis, we show here that both C6 and L* inhibit
hHv1 in human PMN, decreasing ROS production, and that C6 protects in an ALI mouse model, restor-
ing lung compliance, and decreasing ROS, proinflammatory cytokines, protein, and PMN in bron-
choalveolar lavage fluid. We employ our novel membrane tethered (T-peptide) method to speed struc-
ture-function studies and peptide design, show a bivalent C6 (C62) that fully inhibits open hHv1 chan-
nels, benefit from advanced biophysical and in vivo methods, and two expert collaborators.
 Three specific aims. (1) Alb activation of hHv1 seeks the structural and mechanistic basis for the
action of Alb and a more potent natural metabolite. (2) Alb regulation of the PMN inflammatory re-
sponse seeks to delineate the role of hHv1 in PMN using C6, C62 and L* and the basis for peptide action.
(3) Inhibiting acute lung injury with Hv1 inhibitors studies an ALI model in WT and Hv1 KO mice.
 Significance. This work addresses an unmet medical need, recently made more apparent by the ad-
vent of COVID-19-related ALI/ARDS and has broader influence because Hv1 in PMN and other phago-
cytes is complicit in additional acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. We propose to apply unique
hHv1 inhibitors and innovative methods to understand and suppress this pathophysiology."
10867339,"ABSTRACT
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor and one of the most lethal of all cancers. The main
challenge in treating GBM is the quickly developing resistance to all kinds of treatments by tumor cells. Whereas
our partial understanding of GBM biology is a major roadblock to elucidate the underlying resistance
mechanisms. Our laboratory recently uncovered that GBM greatly alters lipid metabolism to gain sufficient lipids
for its rapid growth. We identified that sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), a master
transcription factor that controls fatty acid synthesis, is highly expressed in GBM and is essential for tumor
growth. Our findings were recently validated by multiple groups showing that SREBP-1 is also elevated in various
other cancers. However, whether the dramatically altered lipid metabolism facilitates tumor resistance is
completely unknown. Moreover, the mechanism that upregulates SREBP-1 expression in cancer cells remains
elusive. Interestingly, we recently found that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and 13-cis-RA could significantly
reduce the expression of SREBP-1 and lipogenic enzymes in a dose-dependent manner in GBM cells. These
retinoic acids are effective drugs in treating acute promyelocytic leukemia and have also been used to treat GBM
and other solid tumors, but tumor resistance has been very challenging. To date, both their antitumor and
resistance mechanisms remain poorly understood. We examined the expression of their binding partner, retinoic
acid nuclear receptor α (RARα) in GBM patient tissues and found it to be highly expressed in tumor tissues and
positively correlated with SREBP-1 expression, while inversely associated with poor patient survival.
Interestingly, our data further show that 13-cis-RA and ATRA treatment significantly increased the expression of
carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), a key enzyme shuttling fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation
and energy production. Pharmacological inhibition of CPT1A combined with retinoic acid treatment resulted in
marked GBM cell death. Together, these novel preliminary data strongly support the hypothesis that 13-cis-RA
or ATRA can significantly alter lipid metabolism in GBM and promote fatty acid oxidation to support tumor cell
survival and resistance. We further hypothesize that retinoic acid treatment in combination with suppression of
SREBP-1 activation or fatty acid oxidation will effectively inhibit GBM growth and overcome tumor resistance.
The goal of this study is to identify the previously unreported roles and mechanisms of retinoic acids and RARα
in lipid metabolism regulation and GBM growth (Aim 1), and to develop effective combination approaches to
target GBM (Aim 2). Completion of this study will uncover the underlying mechanism upregulating SREBP-1
expression and lipogenesis in GBM, provide great insights into understanding the antitumor and resistance
mechanisms of retinoic acids, and identify novel strategies to target GBM and overcome retinoic acid resistance."
10867360,"Dementia, the loss of cognitive and behavioral abilities, is one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Lewy body dementia (including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia), are the most common causes of dementia. Currently, there are several diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for these diseases. Validated biomarkers of neurodegeneration, especially at premanifest stages, do not exist. Further, there is no available treatment to slow down or arrest the progression of disease. Thus, there is a huge need of biomarkers able to detect neurodegeneration early in the cascade.
Brainstem imaging holds great promise in assessing Lewy body dementia in elderly humans, when Lewy bodies (i.e. neuro-degeneration due to the accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein in the brain) are expected to affect the brainstem and the olfactory bulb, before spreading to other brain areas during symptomatic stages. Brainstem-based biomarkers can fill the currently existing holes in diagnosing the early synucleinopathy stages when treatment can be most effective in delaying the development of full- blown neurodegeneration. However, existing imaging methods are incapable of resolving details of tiny deep brainstem nuclei in living elderly humans, limiting the development of brainstem-based biomarkers of premanifest Lewy body dementia.
To fill this gap, the central aim of the proposed research is to create a probabilistic atlas of twenty arousal and motor brainstem nuclei in healthy elderly subjects by ultra-high field (7 T) MRI. The atlas will be used to evaluate brainstem-based biomarkers of premanifest Lewy body dementia (LBD) assessing the integrity of brainstem nuclei microstructure and connectivity pathways. To do so, we will map the brainstem nuclei atlas to both advanced (e.g. 7 T) and clinical (e.g. 3 T) neuroimages of controls, premanifest LBD, as well as de novo manifest LBD; crucially, we will test the hypothesis that brainstem microstructure and/ or connectivity pathway are altered in premanifest LBD compared to controls, and that these changes become stronger and affect more brain regions in de novo manifest LBD.
Thus, our project will provide two important new tools, a structural atlas of brainstem nuclei and brainstem-based biomarkers of premanifest LBD. The generated brainstem nuclei atlas will be a useful tool in research and clinical studies of elderly populations able to automatically identify the location of brainstem nuclei in both advanced and clinical MRI of elderly subjects. The developed brainstem- based biomarkers of premanifest LBD will improve our understanding and the diagnosis of early stage Lewy body dementia and the development of better treatment for early stage patients before they manifest cognitive and behavioral symptoms."

The detection of sound in the cochlea requires hair cells and their mechano-sensitive organelles, called
stereocilia. The long-term goal of this laboratory is to study how stereocilia grow and how their integrity is
maintained over a lifetime. These are critical processes and are commonly disrupted in hereditary forms of
human hearing loss. In this proposal, we investigate a molecular motor called myosin 15 (MYO15A) that sets
the size of the actin filament core that is the structural foundation within each stereocilium. Mutations in the
MYO15A gene cause human hereditary hearing loss, DFNB3. Our initial experiments have revealed a novel
mechanism that allows MYO15A to control the actin core, and we hypothesize that the hair cell regulates
stereocilia architecture using different MYO15A isoforms. To test this, we will investigate the molecular properties
of MYO15A to understand how it influences growth of the actin core, reveal how these activities are regulated
within the hair cell, and examine how mutations cause hearing loss in a mouse model. In Aim 1, we use purified
proteins and spectroscopy / single-molecule assays to extensively characterize how MYO15A accelerates actin
polymerization. As part of this, we will introduce mutations to explore candidate regions within MYO15A that
underlie this activity. In Aim 2, we expand our study to different isoforms of MYO15A and use biochemical assays
and cryo-electron microscopy to investigate key differences in their enzymatic activity and how these are
regulated. In Aim 3, we characterize a mutant mouse where a novel MYO15A isoform has been removed using
CRISPR genetic engineering, and study how these animals lose their hearing using a combination of high-
resolution electron and light microscopy. Overall, our proposal will provide critical new information into basic
mechanisms of stereocilia plasticity, in addition to revealing the distinct pathologies that cause deafness in
patients suffering with DFNB3."

10867364,"Abstract: Smoking is the leading risk factor for preventable morbidity and mortality, and smoking cessation
remains the primary goal for population-based tobacco and cancer control. Many smokers lack resources to
initiate and sustain a successful quit attempt. For the last decade we have been testing innovative approaches
for delivery of pharmacotherapies that allow smokers to try evidence-based cessation medications and self-
determine their goals and pace for cessation. Medication sampling is a brief, concrete, and easily understood
exercise that often induces attitudinal shifts in favor of quitting smoking, and more importantly promotes quit
attempts and actual cessation. Medication sampling is also favored by healthcare providers, augmenting their
brief advice as per clinical guidelines. We have conducted three trials of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)
sampling (N=157, 849, 1245), all of which were remote, and some of which have been applied within medical
settings. Each trial demonstrated increases in cessation behavior. Our prior work on NRT sampling creates a
compelling question as to whether varenicline sampling would have similar, or potentially better, effects.
Varenicline is inarguably the most effective single cessation medication available, superior to other
monotherapy options. As a prescription medication, whether varenicline is suitable for sampling is unclear but
worth testing empirically. On one hand, unstructured use, over a brief time, may not deliver sufficient
pharmacologic benefit. Prescription delivery incurs its own barriers to widespread dissemination (which can be
overcome). On the other hand, much like NRT sampling, it could provide a tangible cue to action that provides
psychological engagement (motivation, confidence, autonomy) to sustain subsequent use and ultimately
enhance cessation. A trial of varenicline sampling is not merely a routine extension of NRT trials, yet the
significance is even more compelling given evidence of its unique benefits. We therefore propose a
randomized clinical trial with primary aims to determine the 1) use, 2) consequences (on cessation), and 3)
mechanisms of varenicline sampling. A demographically diverse sample of 648 smokers will be recruited
across South Carolina and randomized (2:1:1) to receive I) a 4-week sample of varenicline, II) a 4-week supply
of NRT, or III) nothing. Thus, our design is strengthened by both active and inactive comparison groups.
Outcomes will be assessed through 6 months of follow-up. We employ innovations in mobile health
technologies throughout to enhance methodological rigor, including remote biological verification of smoking
behavior. If varenicline sampling were to show promise through this and future trials, this would offer great
dissemination appeal to physicians, quitlines, etc in that, much like our NRT work, varenicline sampling could
be a pragmatic strategy to engage more smokers in better treatments, sooner. Ultimately, the population
impact of medication/varenicline sampling could be profound, offering a significant and measurable opportunity
to lessen the impact of tobacco on public health and to reduce the risk, incidence and mortality of cancer."
10867468,"SUMMARY
A major barrier to HIV cure is the reservoir of latently infected cells that persists in patients treated
with highly potent antiretroviral treatment (ART). Activation of these latently infected cells can lead
to HIV rebound in the absence of ART. In clinical trials, HIV exhibits widely different dynamics
after ART cessation. HIV rebounds rapidly in most individuals, whereas in a small fraction of
individuals, prolonged HIV remission or post-treatment control (PTC) is achieved. Despite
intensive research, we lack a clear and coherent understanding of the determinants of viral control
or the duration of HIV remission after ART, which hinders the development of effective therapeutic
strategies to achieve a ‘functional’ cure and ultimately a sterilizing cure.
This grant addresses this gap in knowledge. Our central hypothesis is that PTC is not solely driven
by a single factor; rather, it is a phenomenon emerging from complex nonlinear interactions
between the immune response and the latent reservoir, including both the replication competent
reservoir and the defective reservoir. Understanding this dynamical interaction will be key to
develop effective interventions to achieve favorable clinical outcomes. We will first delineate the
roles of these interactions in determining viral control through integration of recent biological
findings into a mechanistic mathematical model. We will validate this model using clinical data
from post-treatment controllers and non-controllers, correlate estimated model parameters with
measured biological and immunological markers to identify patient characteristics that predict
PTC. Further, we will estimate the mode of action and quantify the efficacy of a next-generation
latency reversing agent (LRA), AZD5582, and a class of promising bispecific antibody-based
immunotherapeutics, the Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting molecules. Finally, we will integrate models
of how these agents work with a model of the interaction of the latent reservoir with the immune
system to evaluate and predict the impact of combinations of LRAs and immunotherapeutics on
the reservoir and on clinical outcomes.
Altogether, our work will provide a theoretical foundation for 1) understanding HIV control and
rebound dynamics after ART, 2) identifying patients who are likely to achieve PTC, 3)
estimating/predicting the impact of therapeutic interventions such as LRAs and/or
immunotherapeutics, and 4) suggesting effective interventions to achieve a ‘functional’ cure
according to patient characteristics."

This application aims to discover and validate small-molecule inhibitors of the Rac guanosine-nucleotide
exchange factor (GEF) kalirin, a major signal transduction hub in dendritic spines in the cerebral cortex.
Our long-term goal is to translate knowledge about dendritic spine plasticity and synaptic small GTPase
signaling, into treatments of neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs). Dendritic spines are the sites of most
excitatory synapses in the brain, and play central roles in the development and plasticity of neuronal circuits,
and ultimately in learning, memory, and behavior. Conversely, abnormalities in dendritic spines are
extensively involved in NPD pathogenesis. Molecular pathways mediated by small GTPases such as Rac,
direct upstream activators (GEFs), and their downstream targets are major pathways that govern dendritic
spine plasticity. Furthermore, genetic and postmortem studies demonstrate a key role for these pathways
in the pathogenesis of NPDs. Kalirin is the most abundant Rac-GEF in dendritic spines in the cerebral cortex
and hippocampus, plays central roles in spine plasticity and pathology as shown by knockdown and
knockout studies, and has been implicated in NPDs by genetic, postmortem, and functional studies. Hence,
in order to study the role of kalirin in cortical plasticity and NPD pathogenesis, and of Rac-GTPase signaling
in general, here we aim to develop novel, potent, specific, inhibitors of kalirin with biological activity in
neurons. We have established a collaboration between experts in synapse biology and NPDs, high-
throughput screening and computational pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, and crystallography, and
performed extensive preliminary studies that demonstrate the validity of our hypothesis and the feasibility
of our approach. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Hit discovery by HTS to identify small
molecules binding to kalirin's DHPH domain and inhibiting its GEF activity. 2) Hit validation in cellular
and neuronal assays. 3) Characterization of the mechanism of action of hit compounds. 4) Medicinal

Core B will provide antibody-coated nanoparticles (NPs) and FRCs for in vivo administration to reprogram the
LN microenvironment towards a regulatory milieu that promotes transplant tolerance. These strategies
represent cutting-edge approaches which have been set forth only by the teams here, and hence they
represent a radical departure from the traditional approaches to induce tolerance. These techniques provided
by Core B lay the groundwork for developing first class of therapeutics aimed towards reprogramming the
microenvironment of the LN. In addition to the applications of these data to transplantation, they can also have
a major impact in other immune conditions in which the LN plays a central role in the pathogenesis (e.g.,
autoimmune diseases and tumor immunity). This Core will fully characterize and synthesize large quantities of
MECA-79-conjugated carriers of anti-laminin α5 (LAMA5) and anti-CD40L mAbs (Project 2 - Bromberg), as

FRC-specific markers. These cells will be provided to Project 1 for experiments that assess their impact on
downregulating LN fibrosis and its deleterious effects on transplant tolerance.

10868758,"Abstract
Lymph nodes (LNs) are the quintessential organs of immunity. Our understanding of how LNs control
alloimmune responses has evolved significantly with recent advances which highlight the function of specific
cellular and stromal components of the LN. Presentation of donor alloantigen to recipient T cells in the LN is
fundamental to the priming of allo-reactive T cells and subsequent allograft rejection. A recently recognized,
new dimension to this pervasive concept is that the LN is also critically important for transplant tolerance.
These multifaceted functions reflect the status of LNs as extremely specialized organs with unique
microvasculature, and a stromal compartment that is molded and regulated by resident mesenchymal cells
known as fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs). The overall hypothesis of this project is that sustained activation
of FRCs in the draining LN (DLN) following transplantation results in their transformation to scar-forming pro-
inflammatory myofibroblasts, which further promote alloimmunity. Our studies will focus mechanistically on the
importance of the LIGHT/HVEM signaling pathway to the differentiation of FRCs into proinflammatory
myofibroblasts in the LN following transplantation. Our corollary hypothesis is that restoration of the native
function of FRCs through targeted drug delivery to LNs will enhance their immunoregulatory function and
promote tolerance. We are proposing three AIMS as follows: In AIM 1, we will examine the role of the
LIGHT/HVEM pathway in regulating the function of FRCs, controlling extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation,
and mediating transplant immunity. Using global LIGHT and HVEM knockout mice, and mice with conditional
knockout of HVEM on FRCs, we will gain mechanistic insights into how the LIGHT/HVEM pathway controls the
differentiation of FRCs and transplantation outcomes. In AIM 2, we will study the importance of senescence in
determining the balance between the pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory properties of FRCs. We will use
a number of innovative conditional knockout mice to decipher the mechanisms by which senescent FRCs
promote alloimmunity following transplantation. In AIM 3, we will determine whether delivering healthy FRCs
and senolytic agents to the DLN will restore its microarchitecture and regulate alloimmunity following
transplantation. The data from these studies will lay the groundwork for the first time to develop innovative
therapeutic strategies aimed at manipulating the microenvironment within LNs. This provides a unique
opportunity to direct the alloimmune response following transplantation towards tolerance. This proposal
establishes a multidisciplinary collaborative team to produce novel mechanistic data, which will provide the
basis for highly innovative and selective therapeutic strategies for transplantation. Therefore, this proposal can
make transformative advances in the field of organ transplantation."

My laboratory has contributed chiefly to the better understanding of the mechanisms by which lymph node (LN)
stroma controls transplant tolerance. We have devoted much effort to defining specific compartments of the
LN where Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are induced and activated. We showed that during tolerance
induction by costimulatory blockade, naïve T cells migrate to the LN, but not the spleen. During tolerance
induction, naïve T cells specifically home to the cortical ridge (CR) of LN, entering via the nearby high
endothelial venules (HEV). In the CR they are stimulated by alloantigen-presenting plasmacytoid dendritic cells
to differentiate into induced Treg (iTreg).
Our data indicate that in tolerogenic conditions iTreg are mostly formed within the CR region, whereas T cells
which enter the medulla of LN experience anergy. More specifically, the ratio of stromal laminin α4:α5 (referred
to as LAMA4/LAMA5) of the CR region critically determine the response to alloantigen and iTreg formation. A
high LAMA4/LAMA5 ratio promotes tolerance, whereas a low LAMA4/LAMA5 ratio promotes transplant
immunity. Mechanistically, LAMA4 promotes CD4 migration to the CR, promotes Foxp3 expression and iTreg
maturation, and inhibits effector T cell differentiation. In contrast, LAMA5 inhibits migration of CD4 cells into
HEV, yet costimulates T cell proliferation and maturation to inflammatory Th17. Abrogating this interaction with
neutralizing antibodies enhances iTreg migration to the CR region and significantly prolongs heart allograft
survival. Our overall hypothesis is that the LAMA4/LAMA5 ratio of the CR critically determines the fate of
iTreg formation and transplant tolerance. Our overall goal is to define the key cellular (FRC) and molecular
(LTβR) mechanisms which control the laminin composition of LN and thereby leverage this microstructure to
manipulate immunity toward transplant tolerance. To investigate this hypothesis, we propose the following
AIMS:
Aim 1. Define the role of LN stromal cells in controlling the balance of LAMA4 and LAMA5 during
alloimmune responses.
Aim 2. Define the role of LTβR activation of FRC as a key pathway in inducing formation of LAMA5.
Aim 3. Targeted delivery of costimulatory molecule anti-CD40L mAbs and anti-laminin α5 Abs to the LN
to promote tolerance.
Overall, key signaling molecules that regulate FRC function to remodel LN laminins and the LAMA4/LAMA5
ratio dictate the immune response toward inflammation and immunity (low ratio) or toward suppression and
tolerance (high ratio). These Aims will achieve our overall goal to define the key cellular (FRC) and molecular
(LTβR) mechanisms which control the laminin composition of LN. These data lay the groundwork for
developing highly innovative targeted therapies to reprogram the microstructure of LN to promote transplant
tolerance."
10868431,"Project Summary/Abstract
 Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg) are required for transplant tolerance, however, where and when they
are induced and activated remains uncertain. During costimulatory blockade induced tolerization, naïve T cells
migrate to the lymph node (LN), but not the spleen, where they are stimulated by alloantigen presenting
plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC), and differentiate into induced Treg (iTreg). We have identified the adhesion
and chemokine molecules which orchestrate tolerance by directing the localized accumulation of Treg in the
cortical ridge (CR) of the LN where the high endothelial venules (HEV) are present. HEV are the main
gatekeeper of T cell trafficking. Overall, naive T cells migrate to the CR and become iTreg, while T cells that
become anergic or apoptotic migrate to other regions of the LN. Thus, a unique LN domain is required for the
generation and activity of tolerogenic iTreg. The overall hypothesis is that this domain is required for tolerance,
and the goal is to define the key events that regulate this structure and can be leveraged for tolerization.
 In this specialized LN domain the stromal fiber laminin α4:α5 ratios determine the response to
alloantigen. Laminins surrounding the HEV and CR act as gatekeepers for T cell fate by directly instructing T
cell entry, conversion to iTreg, and the fate of later T cell cohorts, with a high laminin α4:α5 ratio favoring
tolerance. Laminin α4 (termed 411 for αβγ chains) promotes CD4 and CD8 T cell motility and transendothelial
and interstitial migration into the HEV and CR, promotes Foxp3 expression and iTreg maturation, and inhibits
effector T cell differentiation. In contrast, laminin α5 (or 511) inhibits migration into HEV, yet costimulates T cell
proliferation and inflammatory Th17. T cells recognize laminin α5 using both integrin α6 and α-dystroglycan
(αDG) receptors, and αDG-laminin α5 specifically induces Th17. Antibodies to these receptors prolong graft
survival and enhance iTreg migration to the CR. We generalized these concepts in other models (colitis, tumor
immunity, chronic rejection, vaccination), and in each case immunity correlated with decreased laminin α4:α5
ratios, while tolerance required an increased ratio.
 Altogether, our new data indicate that stromal cells regulate the LN laminin α4:α5 ratio and control the
fate of the immune response to inflammation and immunity (low ratio) or to suppression and tolerance (high
ratio). Our specific hypothesis is that LN stromal cells integrate immune cues and thus regulate laminin
structures, and this integration is a final common pathway that channels the immune response and allograft
outcomes. Thus, remodeling of laminins is a facet of innate immunity whereby immune cues stimulate stromal
cells (FRC, LEC, BEC) to modify LN structure, which subsequently determines adaptive immunity. The
corollaries are: 1) laminins regulate the response to inflammation and immunity, which results in pro-
inflammatory LN structures or even the pathologic response of immunologic scarring; and 2) laminins regulate
the response to suppression and tolerance and result in homeostatic and pro-tolerogenic LN structures."

This K99/R00 award will prepare Dr. Genoa Warner for an independent research career, with the main goal of
providing Dr. Warner with all the technical and profession skills necessary for her to become a successful
independent investigator and leader in the field of reproductive toxicology. Dr. Warner has extensive training in
endocrine disruption and sustainable chemistry and is currently a postdoctoral fellow in reproductive toxicology
at the University of Illinois under the mentorship of Dr. Jodi A. Flaws. This award will enable Dr. Warner to expand
her research training in reproductive biology and allow her to draw from her diverse scientific background in
chemistry and biology to investigate important research questions in environmental health. These goals will be
accomplished with the support of Dr. Warner's exceptional mentoring team, composed of Dr. Flaws, Dr. Susan
Schantz, Dr. Heather Stapleton, and Dr. John Katzenellenbogen. The research proposal and career
development plan created by Dr. Warner with the guidance of her mentoring team will provide Dr. Warner with
new experimental techniques and skills needed to establish an independent research program. In the research
training component of this proposal, Dr. Warner will investigate the mechanisms by which phthalates, a group of
endocrine disrupting chemicals with ubiquitous human exposure, cause ovarian follicle toxicity. Further, she will
investigate the metabolism of phthalates by ovarian tissue because phthalate metabolites mediate phthalate-
inducted toxic effects, contributing to infertility and premature ovarian failure. In the prosed studies, Dr. Warner
will use environmentally relevant concentrations of six phthalates as a mixture and individually. Specific Aim 1
(mentored phase) will identify how phthalates partition into ovarian tissue during culture via mass spectrometry
and imaging methods using chemically modified phthalates. Specific Aim 2 (mentored and independent phases)
will determine how phthalate toxicity varies between cell types of the ovary by culturing populations of each cell
type found in the ovarian follicle with phthalates. Finally, Specific Aim 3 (Independent Phase) will identify the
genomic localization of phthalates in the ovary by adapting the biochemical technique of chemical affinity capture
paired with massively parallel DNA sequencing (Chem-seq) to provide information on the genes and proteins
targeted by phthalates. Overall, the proposed studies will provide novel chemical and mechanistic insight into
causes of phthalate-induced toxicity in the ovary that contribute to female infertility and premature ovarian failure.

10868434,"PROJECT SUMMARY: In reperfused myocardial infarction (MI), approximately 50% of cell death is due to
reperfusion injury, which still lacks clinical therapies. There is an urgent need to fill in this knowledge gap and to
develop novel therapies for this. Initial appropriate mitochondrial quality control is critical for cardioprotection
following ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Mitochondrial homeostasis is tightly regulated by two processes: mitophagy
(degradation of damaged mitochondria by autophagy) and mitochondrial biogenesis. Autophagy, an
evolutionarily conserved process required for cellular constituent recycling (including mitochondria), is impaired
during I/R. Mitochondrial biogenesis is regulated in part by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
coactivator-1 alpha (PGC1). Importantly, mitochondria biogenesis is not increased by I/R injury in the kidney
and brain, despite induction of PGC1. These results suggest that impaired autophagy/mitophagy
following I/R contributes to the attenuation of mitochondrial biogenesis. Enhancing autophagy and
mitochondrial biogenesis simultaneously during I/R may therefore restore mitochondrial homeostasis.
Consistent with this, our unpublished data show that specific induction of autophagy with Tat-Beclin peptide at
the time of reperfusion reduces infarct size in mice, and augments PGC1 expression and mitochondrial
biogenesis (dependent on the autophagy). Similarly, pharmacological activation of autophagy at the time of
reperfusion (using the FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor, SAHA) induces autophagy and PGC1 and reduces
infarct size >40%. Moreover, SAHA plus PGC1 overexpression further increased mitochondrial biogenesis.
Studies in the brain have identified Parkin and PARIS as the regulator of PGC1 expression. To study
Parkinson’s disease, mouse models, and small molecules enhancing Parkin activity are available.
Hypothesis: Activation of autophagy confers cardioprotection during I/R through the combined removal of
damaged mitochondria and subsequent replacement via PGC1-dependent mitochondrial biogenesis, in a
Parkin-PARIS dependent manner, and enhancing both processes will afford more effective cardioprotection.
Aim 1. To determine whether autophagy is both necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial biogenesis
under basal conditions and during cardiac I/R.
Aim 2. To define whether autophagy-mediated mitochondrial biogenesis and cardioprotection during I/R
are dependent on the Parkin-PARIS-PGC1 signaling axis.
Aim 3. To establish whether simultaneous enhancement of autophagy/mitophagy and mitochondrial
biogenesis during cardiac I/R will augment cardioprotection.
Significance and novelty. This study will determine whether autophagy and PGC1-dependent mitochondrial
biogenesis is critical for reperfusion injury. Clinically, inducing autophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis during
the reperfusion is pharmaceutically feasible, which may lead to novel therapies for reperfusion injury.

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs in nearly one third of women of reproductive age, causing significant problems
for sexual and reproductive health. Women with BV are predisposed to pregnancy complications including
amnionitis and preterm delivery. Gardnerella spp. are major players in the BV dysbiosis, displacing
Lactobacillus spp. and forming a robust biofilm supporting the growth of multiple anaerobes. The biofilm also
serves as the infectious form for transmitting bacterial vaginosis between people. Gardnerella make a number
of putative virulence factors including multiple pili, lipases, sialidases, and the pore-forming toxin vaginolysin. It
has been difficult to study Gardnerella virulence factors due to the inability to make targeted mutations or
introduce genetic constructs. We discovered a way to make targeted insertion mutations using suicide
plasmids in Gardnerella spp., and we propose to further develop these methods to produce a full set of tools
for Gardnerella genetic manipulation. First, we will improve methods for making insertional mutants by
determining factors affecting transformation frequency and insert stability, and by developing use of a counter-
selectable marker to allow for creation of selectable unmarked mutations such as deletions and point
mutations. Furthermore, we will test different methods of insert replacement to optimize creation of unmarked
mutations. Second, we will develop methods and constructs for gene expression from the Gardnerella
chromosome in order to produce constitutive or regulated complement gene expression, transcriptional fusions
to Gardnerella ‘lacZ, or translational fusions to the FLAG epitope. The usefulness of the methods will be tested
with mutations in the vaginolysin gene."

Healthcare workers’ (HCWs’) willingness to report to work in pandemics and other public health emergencies
and disasters is a foundational prerequisite for national, regional and global health security amidst an ever-
broadening array of natural and manmade emergent threats. Well-documented case reports and research point
to significant and concerning gaps in response willingness toward public health emergencies and disasters,
including among low- and middle- income country (LMIC)-based HCWs. Further, research to date in LMIC
and other settings has highlighted HCWs’ self-efficacy as leading predictor of their willingness to respond
(WTR) during such crises. Higher levels of self-efficacy positively influence motivation, willingness to respond
and take action, and to persevere when challenges are encountered, including exhibiting teamwork,
expressing sensitivity, managing politics and handling pressure. Prior studies by membership of the research
team have been accompanied by training interventions that yielded significant increases in self-efficacy, and
attendant WTR, among frontline HCWs. However, this training was designed to be in-person and several
hours long, which presents a difficult logistical challenge for busy Emergency Department HCWs. Could
mobile health (mHealth) technology offer an efficient approach to training and support to enhance self-efficacy and
increase WTR among LMIC-based HCWs? To the very best of our knowledge, there has never been a mHealth
product or intervention to address self-efficacy and WTR. Accordingly, this gap presents an opportunity to
generate a novel mHealth application to enhance frontline LMIC-based healthcare workers' self-efficacy and
WTR during public health emergencies and disasters. By extension, such a mHealth intervention could
strengthen staffing surge capacity in resource-challenged health systems in LMICs, and thus shore up critical
gaps in health security.
The study's purpose is first to assess the feasibility of strengthening self-efficacy and response willingness
toward public health emergencies, including pandemics, and disasters in emergency department clinical
personnel in a LMIC setting (R21); and, if feasible, carry out a trial to confirm the effectiveness of the approach
on outcomes (R33) [see below] in Karachi, Pakistan. Our R21-component specific aims (SA) are:
SA1: Characterize and measure LMIC-based emergency medicine healthcare workers' (HCWs') baseline self-
efficacy toward fulfillment of work-related roles and expectations in pandemics and other public health
emergencies and disasters, and their attendant perceptions regarding willingness to respond in such contexts.
SA2: Develop and pilot-test a novel mHealth intervention (iRise [""intervention (for) response in significant
emergencies""]) among a group of LMIC-based emergency department HCWs to determine its acceptability,
reliability, and perceived usefulness in a culturally sensitive and appropriate manner for busy emergency
department HCWs in LMIC settings.
SA3: Develop local LMIC-based partners' mHealth research capacity and prepare for an effectiveness trial.
Under this aim we would focus on strengthening mHealth-based research capacity among health professionals
to support conducting trials, digital data collection, and disaster preparedness in Pakistan.
If found feasible, the following are our R33 specific aims:
SA4: Gauge short-term (1-month), medium-term (6-months), and longer-term (1-year), impacts of this novel
iRise mHealth app on LMIC-based HCWs' self-efficacy and willingness to respond during public health
emergencies and disasters.
SA 5: Further refine the mHealth app to enhance its attitudinal and related impacts on LMIC-based HCWs’
self-efficacy and response willingness in public health emergencies and disasters."
10868265,"Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is the leading cause of the dry eye disease which affects 6 to 7 million people in the
United States. The Meibomian glands in MGD dry eye patients are unable to secrete oily lipids resulting in loss of the lipid
layer on the surface of tears, leading to an increase in tear evaporation. Current treatments for patients with MGD include
warming of the glands to temperature higher than melting point of the meibomian in MGD patients to increase secretion of
the lipids, which will increase tear volume and reduce dry eyes symptoms. Most commercial therapies for the warming-
treatment heat eyelids from the outside even though the glands are located close to the inner surface of the eyelids in contact
with tears. Warming from outside requires heat to be applied at about 45 oC which can cause discomfort and burns.
Additionally, heat supplied to the eyelids can reach the cornea which can also damage the cornea, particularly in conjunction
with applied massage. We are proposing a novel approach for warming the eyelids from inside by designing gold
nanoparticle loaded contact lenses (GoldInLens) which can be warmed by exposure to a low intensity light source due to
the absorption of light by gold nanoparticles due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. To use the GoldInLens
treatment, patients will insert the lens, and then keep their eyes open while the lens is exposed to the light source for about
10 s to increase lens temperature to the targeted 40 oC. The patients will then close the eyes to warm the Meibomian glands.
The lens will cool during this phase and so after certain time, which will be determined in this study, the patients will open
eyes for subsequent exposure to the light source to warm the lens. This cycle of warming of lens during open eyes followed
by warming of the glands during closed eyes will be repeated for 10 min. To eliminate the potential for cornea damage, we
will design a piggyback system by placing the GoldInLens on top of a low thermal conductivity polymethyl methacrylate
contact lens which will act as an insulator to minimize exposure of the cornea to the elevated temperatures. Additionally,
gradient lenses with gold nanoparticles located only near the front surface will be prepared to produce the benefits of the
piggyback design but with a simpler manufacturing process. Lenses will be tested extensively in vitro for transparency,
warming, and proof-of-concept in vivo studies will be conducted in rabbits to explore feasibility. The overall hypothesis of
this study is that gradient or piggyback lenses of gold nanoparticles will warm the inner eyelid preferentially, relative to the
ocular surface. The hypothesis will be tested in the following two aims. 1) To design gradient and piggyback lenses for
unidirectional delivery of heat to the eyelids. 2) To test directional delivery of heat in vivo in the rabbit. Successful
completion of this research will lead to the development of a novel platform for providing affordable, at-home warming
therapy for treating MGD. In future, we will expand the platform to include directional release of anti-inflammatory drugs
to the eyelid while minimizing corneal toxicity.

10868336,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) has been a leading center for the study of diabetes, obesity,
atherosclerosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and associated disorders for more than two decades. The
success of the research efforts by Columbia faculty has been anchored by the building and maintenance of a
scientific infrastructure that permits state-of-the art analyses by scientists with widely varying areas of focus. The
Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center has been central in building this infrastructure, and the NIH-funded Diabetes
Research Center (DRC) has helped staff and maintain the varied facilities. Visualizing and quantifying tissue and
cellular pathologies are central to understanding the pathogenesis, progression and complications of metabolic
disease and related disorders, and to monitor the effectiveness of treatment. Performing these studies in an
efficient, cost-effective and timely fashion is critical for the productive study of metabolic disease and related
disorders at Columbia. The Advanced Tissue Pathology and Imaging (ATPI) Core of the Columbia DRC provides
investigators with access to confocal microscopy needed to image wide range of cells and tissues that regulate
glucose homeostasis and energy balance. This application proposes to maintain that infrastructure and to grow
its capabilities with the purchase of a Zeiss LSM 900 with Airyscan 2. The system will be overseen by Dr. Lori
Zeltser and will be incorporated into the existing ATPI facilities and management system supported by the Naomi
Berrie Foundation and the Columbia DRC.
The needs for ATPI Core microscopy have evolved substantially in the past 5 years, which reflect major
advances in techniques to visualize RNA/protein expression in subcellular structures and in thick sample
preparations. The total amount of confocal imaging by DRC Users increased from ~2,400hr to ~3,500hr per year,
which vastly exceeds the ~1,900hr available for use during regular working hours. The proposed equipment will
replace a slower Zeiss LSM 710 system, for which parts are no longer guaranteed. In consultation with the
Steering Committee of the ATPI, the Zeiss LSM 900 with Airyscan 2 was selected because of the following
features: 1) it is very versatile and can accommodate a wide range of sample formats and approaches to visualize
structures at the subcellular, cellular and whole-tissue levels; 2) its detectors provide enhanced sensitivity and
super-resolution imaging that is critical for the research of several Users; and 3) the combination of high
sensitivity and accessories that streamline processes to set up and acquire images will cut the length of
microscopy sessions times in half. Thus, the proposed equipment will not only replace an aging system that is
heavily used, but it will enhance the capabilities of the ATPI to meet new and growing demands for microscopy."

This application is the fifth competing renewal of the sole training grant supporting the Integrative Molecular
and Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program (IMBS) at Baylor College of Medicine. The IMBS Program was
funded on a commitment to excellence in research, with strict guidelines for both student and faculty
participation in the program. The Program currently involves 106 participating faculty from multiple institutions
throughout the Texas Medical Center. This dynamic mix of established investigators and newly recruited young
faculty with diverse research interests allows IMBS students to train with world-class scientists and select from
a wide spectrum of exciting research possibilities. During the 24 years of funding, 250 students have entered
the program, with 80 students currently enrolled. Of the 170 trainees who have left the Program, 122 received
their Ph.D., 17 received Master's degrees, and 31 withdrew or transferred. We have consistently attracted high
caliber students to the Program using active recruitment strategies. Increased institutional support during this
funding period has allowed us to increase the entering class size over the past four years from 9 to 16 students
per year. We continue to emphasize a rigorous graduate education program, combined with intensive,
personalized mentoring throughout all stages of IMBS graduate training. The research productivity of IMBS
students has been exceptional, as measured by both the number and quality of student-authored publications.
Students who graduated from the Program, between 2009 and 2013, have extremely strong publication
records. These 44 students published, on average, 3.4 papers resulting from their thesis research, 1.4 of which
were first author papers, with an average impact factor of 8.8 per publication. An additional notable
achievement during the last funding period has been our continued success in both recruiting, and retaining,
underrepresented minority (URM) students, with 11 URM students (14%) currently enrolled in the program. In
addition, our current URM IMBS students include some of the top students in the College with regard to
academic achievements. During the previous training period, 10 predoctoral positions were funded through this
award. We are requesting an increase to 12 funded positions in the current renewal, based on our established
track record of recruiting and training top students who take science leadership positions in academia, industry
and government. We plan to maintain an enrolled student body of ~80 students, an optimal size for scientific
interactions and mentoring by Program faculty."
10869871,"The objective of this program is to train physician-scientists in basic, translational, and clinical
biomedical research focusing on infectious diseases. The training program will use the
resources of 3 allied institutions, co-located on the east side of Manhattan: Weill Cornell
Medicine as the primary institutions, with collaborators at The Rockefeller University and Sloan-
Kettering Cancer Institute. The program's faculty are well-funded scientists with independent
research support who are committed to research and training. They are complemented by 3
international collaborators from Brazil and Haiti. The faculty share the view that the physician-
scientist truly is an endangered species and are committed to address this issue by establishing
long-term mentoring relationships with postdoctoral trainees.
The broad areas of research training are: immunology, malaria, mycobacteriology, virology, and
translational/clinical research, including bacteria, fungi, HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases
of global importance. Trainees and mentors will develop an individual development plan (IDP)
that can include, for example, additional formal courses in the Weill Cornell Graduate School
(e.g. immunology, molecular biology) or enrollment in a K30 Master in Clinical Investigation
program.
During the funding period (1999-2019), 48 trainees were appointed and 48 (100%) completed
their training (5 continue in the program). Twenty-three (53%) of 43 who completed the program
received NIH K Awards and one other is reapplying for a K23. Research subject areas included:
drug-resistant bacteria, HCV, HIV, KSV-HHV8, malaria, schistosomiasis, and tuberculosis. A
total of 74% hold current appointments at academic institutions and over 75% currently conduct
research. In total, 23 (48%) of all T32 trainees were women, 8 (17%) were racial/ethnic
minorities, and 2 (4%) were from disadvantaged backgrounds.
The program will continue to recruit physicians who have completed their clinical training
(medicine, pediatrics, pathology) and are seeking academic investigative careers. This training
grant will provide developing physician-scientists with the opportunity to make the transition
from clinical training to basic, translational, or clinical research."
10870160,"People with HIV (PWH) are facing increased morbidity and mortality due to non-infectious heart, lung, blood,
and sleep (HLBS) disorders. Many questions remain unanswered regarding HLBS conditions in the current era
including the role of emerging risk factors such as COVID-19, newer antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications,
non-traditional risk factors such as social determinants of health, and the increasingly complex interactions of
HLBS conditions with each other. CFAR Network of Integrated Clinical Systems (CNICS) is an ideal cohort to
address questions on the complex interactions of HLBS conditions as it is a large, well-characterized, gender,
and racially diverse 8-site cohort with >37,000 PWH. This proposal leverages our prior successful project to
incorporate centralized adjudication protocols in CNICS for myocardial infarction (MI), including both type 1 MI
due to atheroembolic disease and type 2 MI due to oxygen demand-supply mismatch such as with sepsis; and
venous thromboembolism (VTE). We established that MI types in PWH should not be combined, that half of
MIs among PWH were type 2 MI, and that affected individuals, risk factors, and mortality differ by MI type. We
will build on this work to add new validated outcomes such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and atrial
fibrillation (AF). We will compare and validate OSA screening tools using WatchPAT home sleep apnea tests
to identify best approaches for implementing widespread brief OSA screening approaches into HIV care. We
will also continue to adjudicate HLBS conditions such as MI, VTE, and stroke so that we can tackle important
gaps in understanding the complex inter-relationships between individual HLBS conditions. Our
multidisciplinary team is uniquely poised to leverage CNICS resources to address important gaps in
understanding of HLBS conditions in PWH by pursuing 4 aims. Aim 1 is to compare OSA screening
approaches among PWH to improve OSA screening in HIV clinical care. Aim 2 is to determine rates of OSA,
AF, MI, VTE, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in PWH in the current era and
associations with traditional and HIV-specific risk factors. We are particularly interested in the role of emerging
risk factors such as newer ART regimens and COVID-19 infection in the setting of an aging population. Aim 3
is to examine the inflammatory burden of OSA and inflammatory risk factors for AF. Aim 4 is to determine the
complex interactions of social determinants of health and HLBS diseases on other HLBS conditions as well as
to examine the impact of HLBS conditions on COVID-19 outcomes among PWH. New and timely knowledge
about the increasing complexity of HLBS conditions among PWH including screening, risk factors, and
complex interactions of HLBS conditions with each other and other syndemic conditions will inform clinical
decision-making and improve understanding of the mechanisms that increase the frequency of HLBS diseases
and risk of poor outcomes in PWH in current clinical care."
10866786,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Algal blooms - the rapid growth of photosynthetic organisms in water - endanger human health,
but there is a stunning lack of data regarding effects on children. The algae K. brevis blooms in
the Gulf of Mexico almost annually, causing `red tides' that last for months to years. K. brevis is
fragile, breaking in the surf and releasing potent brevetoxins (natural poisons that are odorless
and tasteless) into the water and marine aerosol that can be carried inland by wind, potentially
being inhaled by thousands of children living in coastal areas. Additional exposure routes include
the ingestion of contaminated seafood and seawater. Epidemiologic studies of adults have linked
brevetoxin exposures to gastrointestinal inflammation, respiratory irritation, and neurological
problems. Because children have smaller body sizes, inhale more air, and consume more food
and water than adults, it is very likely they encounter higher doses of brevetoxin exposures. In
addition, protective bodily systems for detoxification are not fully developed, leaving children at
increased risk for brevetoxin-induced illnesses. However, no study to date has investigated the
impacts of brevetoxin exposures among children. Without epidemiologic data specific to this
population, scientific knowledge required for tailoring risk communication and public health
interventions remains incomplete, allowing any health risks to children to persist. To address this
critical gap, we are proposing the first population-based study of health effects from residential
brevetoxin exposures among children. Our interdisciplinary team is well-suited to conduct this
work given our complementary expertise in environmental epidemiology, pediatric health, emer-
gency medicine, and marine sciences. By spatiotemporally linking K. brevis monitoring data from
the Gulf of Mexico with emergency department records for children aged 0-18 years residing in
southwest Florida from 2012 through 2019, this work will leverage established resources to cost-
effectively assess residential brevetoxin exposures as a trigger for seeking emergency healthcare
and identify the bodily systems most affected. In addition, this work will produce maps of K.
brevis concentrations in Gulf waters by residential areas, providing a valuable resource for future
epidemiologic studies. Finally, the findings of this work will serve as a basis to improve
brevetoxin exposure assessment methods and design a prospective cohort focused on the health
effects of ocean-related exposures. Ultimately, the goal is for this project and related future
proposals is to catalyze research at the intersection of oceans and human health, fostering the
development of improved risk communication and policies to promote healthy lives."

Greater than 90% of individuals with Parkinson disease (PD) experience significant vocal communication
deficits that appear early in the manifestation of the disease, negatively impact quality of life, and are refractory
to current therapeutic approaches. PD pathology occurs in both the central and peripheral nervous systems
and differs according to sex, but how this affects vocal communication is unknown and presents a critical gap
in knowledge, limiting current patient treatments. This research will elucidate how vocal dysfunction manifests
at a biological and functional level. The long-term goal and primary objective of this work is to understand,
prevent, and/or reverse vocal communication deficits in individuals with PD. To accomplish this, a validated rat
model of PD, Pink1-/-, will be used. Male and female Pink1-/- rats show early, progressive vocal deficits with
brainstem and laryngeal pathology that recapitulate the communication deficits observed in human PD. Based
on preliminary data, this research will address the hypothesis that the neuroanatomical biochemistry of
vocalization pathways in Pink1-/- rats is significantly different compared to wildtype control rats
(Specific Aim 1). The rationale for this study is the need for basic, mechanistic information on sex-specific
vocal pathways and respective connections that will be key targets to improve and/or modulate vocal behavior
over time. By applying retrograde tracers into the vocal fold, the peripheral (larynx) to central (brainstem)
connections will be assessed in Pink1-/- and control rats. Using 3D modeling, differences in the distribution and
density of neurons within central nervous system vocalization pathways will be quantified. Because current
treatments for PD voice deficits are insufficient, the second goal of this proposal is to address the hypothesis
that currently approved therapeutics will be identified and validated for the treatment and modulation
of PD vocal communication deficits (Specific Aim 2). The rationale for this work is the need for drugs that
effectively modulate vocal production for future human PD clinical trials. Using gene targets from Pink1-/-
larynx and brainstem datasets, a list of biologically relevant drugs will be generated using drug-repurposing
catalogs. The application of selected drugs to in vitro Pink1-/- larynx as well as brainstem cell cultures will
generate significant alterations in the gene transcript as quantified with single cell RNA-sequencing. To confirm
efficacy, these therapeutics will be administered to Pink1-/- rats to measure in vivo vocalization improvements.
The simultaneous administration of new drugs to both biological (cellular) and functional (animal) platforms
provides distinct yet integrated information that is unable to be obtained from the human patient population.
This approach is innovative because it incorporates new techniques and theory from molecular, physiological,
and communication sciences and will provide in-depth knowledge of sex-specific PD vocalization deficits. This
proposal is significant because it targets a voice research platform that addresses a clinically relevant,
undertreated question and will directly impact the treatment of PD voice dysfunction."

Caregivers of persons living with dementia (PLwD) do not act in isolation and are typically involved in broader
networks of family and friends who also assist with care, and yet this expanded caregiver network is largely
neglected in research. Theories of mutual influence and empirical work suggest that caregivers’ stress and
mental health have a negative impact on both caregivers and PLwD, yet recent reports and meta-analyses
suggest disappointingly small effects of care-related behavioral interventions. Given that PLwD typically have
broad networks involved in care, an exclusive focus on a primary caregiver may be missing the mark. This
study aims to fill this immense gap by 1) Classifying dementia caregiver networks into profiles based on
compositional and psychosocial facets of the care network, 2) Examining the association between dementia
caregiver network profiles on PLwD’s well-being and important healthcare utilization, and 3) Identify the
association between changing care needs of PLwD and how dementia caregiver networks change over time.
We will first identify a sample of PLwD in the nationally representative National Health and Aging Trends Study
(NHATS), which conducts annual interviews with age-eligible Medicare beneficiaries by pooling unique data
from the 2011, 2015, and 2017 waves with additional waves forthcoming (2021 and moving forward annually).
To characterize care network profiles, we will use information about caregivers from NHATS and additional rich
detail from the associated National Study of Caregiving (NSOC), which interviews up to 5 caregivers per
eligible NHATS participant. Latent class analysis models will be used to characterize and cluster networks
based on similar patterns of compositional and psychosocial characteristics. Measures of between and within-
network variability (e.g., average care stress in network, variability of stress within network) will be included.
We will then explore the association of care network profiles, and individual components of network profiles,
with key health outcomes for PLwD including sleep quality, depression and anxiety symptoms, and important
health care utilization (potentially preventable hospitalization, Emergency Department visits, and long-term
care stay) through linked NHATS respondent-level Medicare claims. Finally, taking advantage of the
longitudinal nature of NHATS and NSOC, we will follow care networks over time to examine the association of
network changes with change in PLwD’s self-care needs. This work is significant as results will substantially
improve understanding of these caregiver networks and how they may increase risks for negative outcomes for
PLwD such that future interventions may target those networks with potential for adverse influence. In line with
NIA priorities to improve assessment of caregiving processes and understand connections between family
dynamics and patient health and well-being, this understanding of care networks can fundamentally shift the
paradigm of caregiving research by establishing the importance of considering family and network systems for
research and intervention development, moving beyond the standard focus on a sole, primary caregiver."
10870171,"Nearly 30% of people recovering from critical illness requiring tracheostomy placement experience respiratory
infections - termed tracheostomy associated tracheobronchitis (TATB) for this proposal. Our understanding of
TATB comes from those with acute critical illness, and does not extend to the recovery phase of critical illness.
Poor understanding of TATB may contribute to antibiotic overuse and limits testing of interventions. Our objective
is to define the natural history and outcomes of TATB, as well as to identify changes in the airway bacterial
populations and host innate immune response that predispose to TATB. To accomplish this goal, we will
assemble a longitudinal cohort of participants with tracheostomies within a Long-Term Acute Care Hospital
(LTACH). In Aim 1 we will assemble a longitudinal registry cohort of people admitted with a tracheostomy to test
the hypothesis that tracheobronchitis episodes in the LTACH have clinical impact on long term
outcomes. Within the cohort, we will determine the event rate of TATB, measure the effect of diagnosis of TATB
on outcomes, including respiratory recovery rate, mortality and healthcare utilization, and determine clinical
predictors of being diagnosed with TATB. Although TATB is treated with antibiotics, we do not know how often
episodes are caused by active bacterial infections. Alternative causes include viral infections and other reasons
for increased respiratory secretions in a population that is colonized with at least one pathogenic organism. In
Aim 2 we hypothesize that infectious TATB episodes are caused by a bloom of an existing pathogen with
an acute inflammatory response. We will use shallow metagenomics (shotgun sequencing) to determine the
bacterial kinetics of infection down to the strain level during episodes. Shallow metagenomics will allow us to
distinguish episodes of new pathogen invasion vs a bloom or genetic change in the existing pathogens within
the microbiome. We will determine which episodes of TATB are associated with either a local airway
inflammatory response or a systemic inflammatory response. Alternatively, viral infections may trigger TATB or
trigger pathogenic bacterial growth. We will conduct a nested case-control study to determine if infection with
respiratory viruses is associated with TATB. Together, these data will determine clinical endotypes. In Aim 3, we
will examine how inflammation promotes the growth of pathogenic bacteria through the release of micronutrients
needed for bacteria growth. We will test the hypotheses that breaches in local mucosal immunity or local
inflammatory response increase the odds of TATB diagnosis. The nutritional environment in the sputum will
be assessed through measurement of bacterial nutrients such as metals and carbon sources, the nutritional
environment will be correlated with odds of TATB diagnosis, and the local inflammatory state prior to diagnosis
of TATB will be assessed through cytokine profiling. The results from these studies will allow us to target specific
phenotypes of TATB in future intervention or scientific studies."

 Individuals with autism experience challenges in developing language that impact their long-term social,
academic, and vocational success. Previous research has identified several predictors of language in children
with autism, but even when these predictors are considered, a large amount of the variance in language
remains unexplained. Importantly, many children with autism still do not develop “useful speech” or language
ability, despite receiving interventions that target these previously-identified predictors. Thus, there is a
pressing need to identify novel predictors of language in children with autism.
 It has been proposed that differences in sensory responsiveness may emerge early in life from altered
brain states and impact a child's ability to engage with others in their environment, thereby producing
“cascading effects” on language acquisition in children affected by autism. If this is the case, intervening upon
early sensory responsiveness may translate to improved language outcomes, by influencing brain states and
boosting engagement in this population. Although intuitively appealing, given our understanding of the
precedence and possible “foundational” nature of early sensory development relative to the emergence of
“higher-level” language skill, evidence for the cascading effects theory to date has been rather limited.
 A primary challenge to establishing the aforementioned links is that autism cannot always be reliably
diagnosed in the earliest stages of life (i.e., in infancy and toddlerhood). A potential solution is to prospectively
follow infants and toddlers known to be at high likelihood for a future diagnosis of autism and language
disorder. The Sensory Project in Infant/Toddler Siblings of Children with Autism (Project SPIS) scales up a
prior NIDCD-funded R21 (R21DC016144; PI: Woynaroski) in a comprehensive test of the cascading effects
framework in infant and toddler siblings of children with autism (Sibs-AUT), approximately one-third of whom
will go on to be diagnosed with autism or language disorder, and infants at relatively lower, general population-
level likelihood of these conditions (younger siblings of typically developing children; Sibs-TD).
 NOVELTY AND IMPACT: This innovative and interdisciplinary project is expected to further elucidate
the nature of longitudinal links between a potentially tractable, but relatively understudied factor (early sensory
responsiveness) and language in infants at elevated and lower, general population-level likelihood of autism. If
our hypotheses are born out, findings of the study will lay the foundation for a clinical trial that will examine the
efficacy of a targeted treatment of sensory function for distal effects on language as mediated by more
proximal effects on resting brain states and engagement in infants at high likelihood for autism. This work is
expected to facilitate earlier identification of language impairments and point towards novel targets of early
“preventative” interventions, thereby improving the long-term outcomes of children who are diagnosed with, or
at heightened risk for, autism and language disorder."
10871694,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The autoimmune regulator (Aire) gene, a key transcriptional regulator expressed in medullary thymic epithelial
cells (mTECs), has been shown to be crucial for central tolerance by inducing tissue specific antigen (TSA)
expression in mTECs. Interestingly, Aire is also found in extrathymic Aire-expressing cells (eTACs) in the
secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes. We previously found that eTACs are
hematopoietic antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and consist of two similar cell types: CCR7+ Aire-expressing
migratory dendritic cells (AmDCs) and an Aire-high population co-expressing Aire and retinoic acid receptor–
related orphan receptor γt (ROR γt) that we termed Janus cells (JCs). Functionally, eTACs are capable of
enforcing deletion and anergy on self-reactive T cells, and self-antigen expression in eTACs is sufficient to
prevent autoimmunity. The transcriptional, genomic, and functional symmetry between eTACs (both JCs and
AmDCs) and mTECs potentially identifies a core program driven by Aire that may influence self-representation
and tolerance across the spectrum of immune development. However, the lineage relationship of eTACs, what
role Aire plays in these populations, and how extrathymic Aire and eTAC subsets contribute to immune
homeostasis are still unknown. This proposal will test the hypothesis that Aire is inducing a tolerogenic
phenotype in eTACs and that extrathymic Aire and eTACs are important for enforcing peripheral immune
tolerance. Aim 1 of this proposal will define the lineage relationship between eTACs subsets, their antigen
processing and presentation functions, and their migratory abilities. Aim 2 will define the cell-intrinsic functions
of Aire in eTACs at both the transcriptional and chromatin level. Aim 3 will investigate the contribution of
extrathymic Aire and eTACs in maintaining normal immune homeostasis. This proposal will be carried out using
a variety of methods including single cell multiomics, flow cytometry, and functional approaches such as ex vivo
co-cultures and in vivo monitoring of autoimmunity utilizing novel genetic mouse models. By characterizing
eTAC subsets and investigating the functional roles of extrathymic Aire and eTACs, this work will help
further elucidate the function of Aire and define basic peripheral tolerance mechanisms. Furthermore,
understanding the biology of these tolerogenic populations may have significance for a range of clinical
applications from autoimmunity to tumor immunity to maternal-fetal tolerance. This research project and
fellowship training will be conducted at a top-funded research institution, the University of California,
San Francisco (UCSF), in the laboratories of Dr. James Gardner and Dr. Mark Anderson. Dr. Gardner has
expertise in studying peripheral Aire/eTACs and the generation of genetic mouse models. Dr. Anderson is a
world expert on Aire biology, thymic selection, and immune tolerance, and a highly respected mentor and leader
in the field of immunology. These mentors and institution will provide a rich training environment for completion
of this research and development of professional skills necessary for a career in academic research."
10870190,"The nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily of ligand regulated transcription factors has proven to be a rich source of
targets for the development of therapeutics for a wide range of human diseases. Endogenous small molecule
regulation of these allosteric proteins control processes central to most aspects of mammalian physiology. Our
lab has focused on synthetic ligand development and structure-function analysis of the NR1F subfamily of NRs
known as the retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors or the RORs. This subfamily contains three genes
that are involved in but not limited to regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, bone growth, and immune
functions. In this proposal we seek to expand our understanding of ligand-dependent regulation of NR1F3 (RORγ;
gene name RORC), in the context of the intact full-length receptor. There are two isoforms of RORγ, RORγ1 and
RORγ2, that differ in only their N-terminal sequence. RORγ1 is broadly expressed, and in the liver it plays an
important role in circadian rhythms and glucose and lipid metabolism. The expression of RORγ2 or RORγt, is T
cell specific and has been shown to be the key lineage-defining transcription factor to initiate the differentiation
program of TH17 cells making RORγt an essential regulator for TH17 and Tc17 differentiation. Importantly, these
cells that have demonstrated anti-tumor efficacy and RORγt controls gene programs that enhance immunity and
decrease immune suppression. We have reported sterols and oxygenated sterols as high affinity endogenous
ligands and others have confirmed these findings and provided key evidence that they are indeed physiological
RORγ ligands. Although in certain experimental paradigms RORγ can recruit coactivators without addition of
exogenous ligand, suggesting the receptor may be constitutively active. Recent evidence clearly demonstrates
that RORγ is dependent on ligand binding for activation.
While extensive structural studies on isolated domains of the receptor have provided important insight into high
affinity ligand binding for both agonists and antagonists, there is a lack of information on how the modular
domains of RORγ act together in the context of the intact full-length receptor. Given the importance of RORγ as
a therapeutic target, it is surprising that we have an incomplete understanding of how small molecules modulate
its activity. The mechanism for “turning off” RORγ activity appears straightforward; however, we have an
incomplete understanding on how the receptor is “turned on.” We hypothesize that ligand-dependent structural
perturbations manipulate the localization and PTM status of the receptor influencing its coregulator and DNA
interactions to modulate of the RORγ transcriptome. To provide the groundwork to test this hypothesis, we
propose to develop and validate an integrated structural model of intact full-length RORγ/DNA complex to
expand our understanding of ligand-dependent regulation of RORγ. Illuminating RORγ activation mechanisms
will help develop better tools to study its pharmacology and may lead to new therapeutic strategies by designing
functionally selective ligands."

Recent advances have shown that dysfunctions prevalent in epigenetic factors play an important role in the
developing human diseases, including developmental disorders and cancers. Therefore, understanding the roles
of these epigenetic factors may aid in identifying new epigenetic prognostic markers or targetable biomarkers
that could contribute towards the establishment of novel therapeutics. Histone H2A lysine 119 ubiquitination
(H2AK119ub) is one of the most functional histone marks that plays an essential role in establishing repressive
chromatin domains and mediating Polycomb induced transcriptional repression during development. The
evolutionarily conserved H2AK119ub histone modification is mainly catalyzed by the Polycomb repressive
complex 1 (PRC1) and deubiquitinated by Polycomb repressive-deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex (also known
as the BAP1 complex in mammals) that antagonizes PRC1’s function. In mammalian cells, the BAP1 complex
functions as a multi-protein complex, containing as many as ten different subunits, which are responsible for the
chromatin recruitment, protein stability, and enzymatic activity of BAP1. Mutations and dysregulations within
subunits in the BAP1 complex are found in patients with developmental diseases, neuronal disorders, and
cancer. Therefore, it is critical to understand the molecular basis of how genes are turned on/off by the
BAP1/PRC1 epigenetic balance. Our previous studies have characterized a functional epigenetic axis comprised
of both BAP1 and Bromodomain and Extraterminal (BET)-containing protein 4 (BRD4), which are physically
bridged together by the scaffold protein ASXL3—the largest subunit within the BAP1 complex. Genetic depletion
of the linker, ASXL3, dramatically attenuates the establishment of the BAP1/ASXL3/BRD4 epigenetic axis
machinery at active enhancers, leading towards a significant reduction in the enhancer-nearby gene expression.
In our current studies, we have employed biochemical, molecular, and small-molecule screening approaches to
mechanistically understand how the ASXL3/BAP1/BRD4 epigenetic axis regulates transcription and determines
cell fate and differentiation ability. Our first goal for this study is to uncover the BAP1/ASXL3 sub-complex’s role
at active enhancers and assess the impact of the BAP1/ASXL3/BRD4 epigenetic axis on enhancer activity,
chromatin structure, and gene expression. As a major H2AK119 deubiquitinase, the BAP1 complex functions as
a general transcriptional activator, antagonizing PRC1’s function and is involved in PRC1-dependent
transcriptional regulation. Therefore, our second project is to elucidate the relationship between BAP1 and a
distinct PRC1 sub-complex in regulating H2AK119ub levels by utilizing our newly developed BAP1-specific
small-molecule inhibitor. Mutations within ASXL3 have been demonstrated to be driver mutations in multiple
neuronal diseases. Therefore, we will define the role of ASXL3 in mediating ESC differentiation into neuronal
progenitor cells (NPC), and then investigate how ASXL3 and its associated epigenetic factors determine the
transcriptome landscape during developmental processes."
10870193,"Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury remains a major clinical problem with no effective therapy established to
date. Although potential therapeutic targets have been identified and tested in clinical trials, none of them has
proven to be effective, underscoring the complexity of sepsis pathophysiology. Work from our laboratory
identified disturbances in cell-cell communication as a major feature underlying the complex pathophysiology
of sepsis-induced kidney damage. For example, pathologic signaling from S1 tubules to downstream S2/S3
tubules was a major pathway of renal injury in sepsis. Indeed, we identified the S1 proximal tubular segment as
a major sensor and sink for filtered endotoxin. This S1 uptake of endotoxin resulted in severe oxidative stress
and damage to downstream S2/S3 segments. Targeted S1 transcriptomics and tissue metabolomics revealed
that purine metabolism is markedly altered in septic S1 proximal tubules. This shift is catalyzed by xanthine
oxidoreductase, a key enzyme in the purine degradation pathway. This enzyme functions as a dehydrogenase
(XDH) in its native form but is readily converted to an oxidase (XO) through sulfhydryl oxidation or proteolytic
modification. Whereas catalysis by XDH does not generate free radicals, XO is a strong pro-oxidant that
generates deleterious reactive species. Furthermore, the pro-oxidant XO is secreted into the urinary lumen and
can therefore cause damage to downstream segments. In contrast, XO expression in macrophages may be
beneficial because it stimulates the bactericidal potential of these cells through generation of reactive species.
It is one goal of this proposal to establish the relative roles of XO versus XDH in S1 and macrophages in septic
kidneys. Moreover, because XO/XDH is involved in the final degradation of purines, the changes in XO/XDH
activity will not only affect the generation of reactive species but will also have an upstream impact on the size
of purine pools. It is the second goal of this proposal to determine the overall flux of purine metabolites and
their contributions to purine homeostasis in sepsis."

Over half of the 6.7 million adults with heart failure in the United States have a normal or near-normal left
ventricular ejection fraction, or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The prevalence of HFpEF
is increasing over time, due to ageing of the population and other factors. Morbidity and mortality for patients
with HFpEF remains high; rates are similar to those observed in HF with reduced ejection fraction. Poor
outcomes in HFpEF are related to a lack of evidence-based therapeutic options. There is an urgent need to
efficiently conduct large, simple, streamlined trials with clinically relevant endpoints comprised of therapeutic
interventions for HFpEF patients. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (including spironolactone) present one
promising treatment for HFpEF. In clinical trials of participants with HF with reduced ejection fraction,
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists have consistently demonstrated their ability to improve symptoms, and
reduce mortality and hospitalizations. However, the TOPCAT trial was the largest study of mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonists in HFpEF. In TOPCAT, spironolactone did not significantly reduce the primary outcome (a
composite of cardiovascular death, aborted cardiac arrest, or hospitalization for HF) relative to placebo, but did
reduce a secondary endpoint of HF hospitalization (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69–0.99, p=0.04). A post-hoc regional
analysis of TOPCAT, limited to North and South America, found that spironolactone reduced the primary
endpoint (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69–0.98) compared to placebo. Therefore, TOPCAT demonstrated the potential
promise of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in HFpEF but was not definitive. The SPIRRIT-HFpEF
(Spironolactone Initiation Registry Randomized Interventional Trial in Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection
Fraction) randomized clinical trial was funded in 2018 for 5 years and has now randomized >1900 participants.
The primary aim of SPIRRIT-HFpEF is to test the hypothesis that use of spironolactone will reduce total HF
events (total hospitalizations for HF and death from cardiovascular causes). SPIRRIT-HFpEF will complete
enrollment December 31, 2023. The current application for SPIRRIT-EX is for a free-standing extension of the
SPIRRIT-HFpEF trial to extend follow-up through 2025 and to allow for accrual of additional clinical events.
The application will specifically support extended follow-up, secondary analyses (including a pre-specified
meta-analysis of data from another ongoing HFpEF clinical trial), dissemination of results, and closeout
activities of participants previously randomized in SPIRRIT-HFpEF. Resolving whether spironolactone is
beneficial in patients with HFpEF would have tremendous public health implications."

 The career development activities and studies delineated in this K01 application are designed to equip Dr.
Theocharidis, the Principal Investigator (PI), with expertise in biomaterials and multi-omics in order to become
an independent investigator. Non-healing diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) affect millions of Americans and lead to
devastating consequences. Existing treatments are inefficient in promoting wound closure. The ongoing steep
surge in diabetic population necessitates new strategies to accelerate healing of diabetic wounds. Unlike acute
uncomplicated wounds, the linear progression from one phase of wound healing to the next is impaired in DFU,
which is characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammation. This could be the primary reason that growth factor
treatments that act during the proliferative phase have been unsuccessful. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (sc-
RNAseq) offers extensive insights into cell function and disease pathophysiology by allowing the mapping of the
transcriptomic landscape of individual cells in heterogeneous tissues like DFUs. A recently completed study led
by the PI focused on differences between DFU patients who healed their ulcers and those who failed to heal
them and investigated molecular changes via sc-RNAseq of surgically removed DFUs. Comparative analysis
unveiled genes and pathways significantly associated with successful wound repair.
 Delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) into recipient cells has the potential to enable functional protein
expression with tremendous therapeutic implications. Ongoing work by the PI has revealed that alginate hydrogel
dressings that facilitate lipid nanoparticle (LNPs)-mediated delivery of healing associated modified CHI3L1
mRNA and IL-2 mRNA to the injury site, markedly improve wound healing in diabetic mice. Based on these
findings, I hypothesize that (i) topical wound treatment with advanced biomaterials capable of tailorable delivery
of mRNAs, corresponding to genes shown to promote DFU healing can lead to novel treatments. Further, I
hypothesize that (ii) altering the LNPs’ surface by conjugating antibodies targeting specific cell type receptors
can streamline their application and maximize their pro-reparative impact.
 These hypotheses will be explored across three aims. The first aim will focus on fabricating alginate hydrogels
for effective topical delivery of mRNA loaded LNPs. During the second aim, I will employ multi-omics approaches
to establish LNP cell internalization and intracellular mRNA translation processes, together with particle
biodistribution, as well as to identify mechanisms of action. In the third aim, LNPs will be endowed with cell
specificity by conjugation of antibodies on their surface to maximize the platform’s efficiency and also evaluated
in a mouse model of increased clinical relevance. Successful completion of this multidisciplinary proposal will
result in highly novel data that will substantially expand our knowledge on DFU pathophysiology and advance
the fields of biomaterials, RNA therapeutics and cutaneous wound repair. This can lead to the development of
innovative much-needed interventions for the management of DFU."
10869469,"Project Summary/Abstract
Alcohol use is a risk factor in multiple disease conditions including gastrointestinal related diseases. Recent
findings from our laboratory show that alcohol use in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) leads to increased
intestinal infections and antibiotic usage. Similarly, we observed that binge alcohol administration in mice
treated with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) exacerbates the symptoms associated with UC. However, the
mechanisms by which alcohol exacerbates UC symptoms are not known. In our recent studies, we found that
alcohol administration increased the pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae and decreased beneficial Lactobacillus
bacteria in feces of mice receiving DSS. This was accompanied by increased nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2)
levels in colonic epithelial cells. We also observed a decrease in interleukin (IL)-22 and phosphorylated STAT3
in colons of mice treated with DSS and ethanol. An increase in Nos2 during inflammation can alter the colonic
microenvironment causing tissue damage. Furthermore, nitric oxide produced by Nos2 interacts with reactive
oxygen species to generate nitrates, which the pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae can competitively utilize as an
energy source. Conversely, IL-22, is a cytokine that utilizes STAT3 activation to promote the gut mucosal
barrier and plays a significant role in protection against pathogenic gut bacteria. STAT3 activation is also
shown to inhibit Nos2 transcription. Thus, decreases in IL-22-STAT3 signaling not only could impair the repair
process and defense mechanisms required for maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity, but also results in
increased Nos2 activity, which can cause bacterial dysbiosis and open specific niches for pathogenic
Enterobacteriaceae to infiltrate the mucosal layer of the intestine perpetuating UC flare/pathology. Therefore,
the goal of our proposed studies is to assess the role of Nos2 and IL-22-STAT3 signaling in alcohol-mediated
exacerbation of colitis pathology. Our hypothesis is that alcohol increases Nos2 expression which
combined with a decrease in IL-22-STAT3 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells following DSS-induced
colitis results in bacterial dysbiosis and exacerbation of symptoms associated with colitis. The
hypothesis will be tested in two aims using a model of DSS-induced colitis and binge alcohol exposure. Studies
in Aim 1 are designed to determine whether alcohol-mediated increase in Nos2 expression exacerbates the
pathology associated with UC directly or via bacterial dysbiosis. Aim 2 will focus on whether IL-22 utilizes
STAT3 to mitigate the upregulation of the Nos2 pathway thus preventing alcohol-induced exacerbation of
pathology/flare in mice treated with DSS. These studies will provide valuable insights into the mechanism by
which alcohol exacerbates UC flare periods, and thus will help in developing effective therapy for the treatment
of these patients."
10869530,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hispanic women are up to 70% more likely to experience infertility (i.e., trying to conceive for ≥12 months without
success), compared to non-Hispanic white women in the US (NHWW). Recent studies indicate that women with
a history of infertility may be at greater risk of cancer, cardiometabolic diseases, and mortality later in life and
that risk may vary among specific infertility diagnoses (e.g., endometriosis, tubal factor infertility, and polycystic
ovary syndrome). Prior research has shown that the severity, incidence, and risk factor profiles for cancer,
cardiometabolic diseases, and mortality differs between Hispanic women and NHWW. However, there has been
a paucity of research on infertility and long-term health outcomes among Hispanic women, despite Hispanics
being the largest minority group in the US with two-thirds having Mexican heritage. Our proposal will utilize the
Mexican Teachers´ Cohort (MTC), a prospective cohort study of 115,306 women from 12 geographically diverse
states in Mexico who were a median age of 44 (range 20-84) when the cohort began in 2006-2008. MTC has
collected data for 18 years. The MTC will harnesses detailed data on reproductive health, including information
on specific infertility diagnoses (e.g., PCOS, ovulatory, tubal, endometriosis, male factor), infertility treatments,
and pregnancy history. The cohort has validated information on disease endpoints including breast cancer,
ovarian cancer (recently funded by NCI), diabetes, and mortality through linked electronic health records and a
national mortality registry through 2019. In the planned proposal, we will leverage our successful methodology
to validate incident breast cancer, diabetes, and mortality cases (2019-2024), and identify and confirm
endometrial cancer, ischemic heart disease and stroke cases (2006-2024). Specifically, our proposal will: Aim
1. Determine the risk of cancer for women with a history of infertility compared to parous women without infertility;
Aim 2. Determine the risk of cardiometabolic diseases for women with a history of infertility compared to parous
women without infertility; Aim 3. Determine the risk of premature mortality for women with a history of infertility
compared to parous women without infertility. The chronic disease risk for Hispanic women with infertility is not
known despite their high infertility disease burden and unique chronic disease profile. This gap in knowledge
precludes them from benefitting from early screening and interventions which may ultimately reduce morbidity
and mortality. This proposal, utilizing a large, well-characterized resource of women with Mexican heritage, is
the first step towards filling a substantial gap in understanding risk of long-term health outcomes among Hispanic
women, the largest minority group in the US."
10872161,"Abstract. Breast cancer rates in American women of African ancestry (AA) continue to rise and the gap in
mortality between AAs and women of European ancestry (EA) persists, the reasons for which are largely
unknown. Investigating the hypothesis that evolutionary adaptation to endemic infectious diseases in Africa,
such as malaria, resulted in more robust immune responses, but potentially more aggressive breast cancers
with poorer prognoses, we found striking ancestral differences in distributions of SNPs in immune pathways,
and in circulating cytokines and systemic immune response. Extending our research to local immune response
in the tumor microenvironment (TME), we found a stronger presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in
breast tumors from AAs than in EAs. Because TILs are typically associated with better survival, but AAs have
poorer prognosis, in a pilot study, we investigated if various immune cell subtypes in tumor tissues differed in
EAs and AAs. We found an important shift in gene expression profiles for TIL composition and the balance of
immune responses, including a higher ratio of exhausted CD8 to total CD8 T cells in AAs, which was an
independent prognostic factor in survival analysis. These preliminary findings have led us to hypothesize that
the robust nature of the immune response in AAs is important for reshaping the biology of breast tumors,
ultimately leading to the emergence of a more immune-resistant or refractory malignant phenotype. To address
our hypotheses, we will take a multi-pronged approach built upon the established Women’s Circle of Health
Study (WCHS) to resume enrollment of EA cases and continue recruitment of AAs, so that we will have ample
statistical power to compare and investigate immune profiles in tumors from AA and EA women. We will first
profile and compare breast TMEs using transcriptomic profiling in 250 AA vs. 250 EA patients, followed by
validation of top markers and spatial characterization using Vectra multiplex immunofluorescence assay in
tumors from 1,500 AA vs. 716 EA patients, with consideration of other molecular characteristics that differ
between groups. We will examine relationships between immune phenotypes and breast cancer survival, as
well as inflammation-related epidemiologic and social factors that may vary between EAs and AAs, or are
differentially associated with risk by ER status, to investigate why breast tumor immune response would differ
by race. To complement this research, we will employ comprehensive phenotypic and functional assays to
determine the inherent response of immune cells from AA vs. EA cancer patients relative to healthy controls.
Our study will provide evidence at both immune marker and functional levels that breast tumors from AA
women have a stronger immune cell repertoire, but the balance of their TME is shifted towards an unfavorable
dysfunctional state. Our findings may inform clinical investigations of immunotherapy focusing on breast cancer
in AA women, and may guide the way for immunotherapy to activate exhausted T cells, ensuring that all
groups of patients will receive equal benefits from cancer immunotherapy."

 All neurons are remarkably different and existing approaches do not allow de novo visualization
of specific living cells in intact brains, without laborious tasks of making transgenic animals. The project will
address this grand challenge: our interdisciplinary team will develop and validate novel nanoscopic probes,

applications, in vitro neuronal selection Neuro-SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
enrichment) will be used to generate libraries of nucleic acid-based probes. These aptamer-based tools
will also serve as “pull-out” molecular constructs to identify cell-specific membrane proteins associated with
unique neuronal identity and wiring. As a result, this research will provide a broad spectrum of advanced
nanotools to decipher the organization of neural circuits at the level of single cells and their compartments.
 Our preliminary data indicate that the Neuro-SELEX can produce multipurpose toolkits to uniquely
map specific neurons or axons without a priori knowledge about their molecular diversity in the intact
nervous system. These results, together with our published data, provide the scientific premise for three
proof-of-the-concept aims. Arguably, Aplysia is a very powerful experimental model for such technology
development. First, to selectively label identified neurons and glial cells, hybrid fluorescent aptamers will
be generated using chemical evolution for neuron-specific selection. We will develop a high-throughput
cost-efficient system to manufacture molecular probes at a large scale, targeting each key, functionally
identified, neuron within a simple-memory forming circuit. Second, we will design fluorescent probes (e.g.,
modified nucleic acids with fluorophores) for multiplex labeling of several neuronal cell types in vivo. This
bar-coding would allow simultaneous visualization of pre- and postsynaptic partners within the same circuit
in real time. Furthermore, these probes will be chemically modified to self-deliver molecular constructs into
hundreds of target cells without the needs of direct injection, electroporation or making transgenic animals.
Third, in proteomic experiments, we will utilize these probes as specific binding tags or ligands to capture
and identify membrane proteins specific for each neuronal type of the model circuit including possible
synaptic components and receptors.
 These versatile nanoprobes, with high selectivity and high-throughput fabrication capabilities, will
be resourceful to test causality relationships between cellular genomes and complex neuronal phenotypes.
Technologies and infrastructure should be applicable to virtually all animal cell types and organs. In
perspective, novel fluorescent markers and molecular reporters can be used in early diagnostics and
therapy for a broad spectrum of neurological and cell-specific disorders as well as in personalized medicine."

Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are a leading cause of death worldwide, and no medical treatment is currently
available. It is now accepted that aneurysm growth is related to chronic progressive tissue destruction secondary
to vascular inflammation, resulting in the breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. We have shown that
a tailored Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) protocol in a mouse model can halt aortic aneurysm growth 21 days
after AAA induction. Photodynamic therapy has been shown to enhance cross-linking of collagen, a key
component of aortic ECM. This cross-linking substantially increases the strength of ECM. Further, in oncologic
studies, PDT appears to selective kill rapidly dividing cells with an affinity for proliferating immune cells.
Therefore, we hypothesize that applying PDT to AAA will enhance ECM cross-linking and eradicate proliferating
immune cells within the adventitia layer of the vascular wall. Our specific aims are designed to test these
hypotheses and determine the mechanism of action behind PDT treatment of AAA. In Aim 1 we will compare the
changes to ECM proteins after PDT to what occurs in control mice. We will also evaluate matrix metalloproteases
(MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), key enzymatic regulators of ECM degradation. In Aim 2 we will
investigate the changes in immune cell subpopulations within aortic tissue after PDT. In addition, we will use
unbiased analysis to identify changes to gene expression of inflammatory proteins within aortic tissue after
delivery of PDT. As our preliminary findings show that PDT can have a powerful effect on AAA growth, analysis
of the molecular changes that coincides with this deceleration in growth may lead to a better understanding of
the mechanisms that drive AAA progression. In addition, understanding the therapeutic mechanism of PDT may
allow PDT to adapted for use in human AAA disease."
10873712,"Developmental Research Project Program Summary/Abstract
The ND INBRE has provided over 1,000 students an undergraduate research experience. Over 50% have
been on the campuses of the PUIs and TCUs. The research experiences of the PUI and TCU students
were provided year-round by pilot grants from the developmental grant program. This effort has
resulted in over 400 poster presentations by the students. The students also display high graduation
rates with a large majority of students entering research and the health professions. Noteworthy is the
entry of 25 M.D.’s and 41 Ph.D.’s into the workforce. The ND INBRE will keep the successful PUI and
TCU pilot grant program in place during the upcoming funding cycle. The study section review did
question what the program has provided for UND. In response to this valuable question, the ND INBRE
proposes to support a new developmental grant program to stimulate faculty development at UND
based on the K99/R00 program of the NIH. Previous efforts by the program have centered on
infrastructure development and the K99/R00 provides entry of the program into faculty development."
10874247,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The opioid epidemic is a persistent public health crisis that has been worsened by the COVID19 pandemic.
Efforts to curtail this epidemic have had minimal success in halting its continued progression. There is a critical
need to more fully understand the neurobiology of opioid use disorder so that highly novel therapeutics can be
developed. Recent clinical and preclinical studies have found that opioid use increases the levels of phosphory-
lated tau protein in the brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex plays a significant role in
the control of opioid use. Hyperphosphorylated tau is a hallmark of neurodegenerative tauopathy-related dis-
eases such as Alzheimer’s Disease and frontotemporal dementia. However, opioid use does not appear to be a
major predisposing factor in the development of these diseases. This begs the question of whether opioid-in-
duced increases in phosphorylated tau are a simple byproduct of opioid use with no significant role in brain
health, or if this increase has significant biological relevance for mediating the neurobehavioral consequences
of opioid use. Focusing research efforts on whether opioid use produces neurodegenerative diseases may lead
to a missed opportunity to explore a non-neurodegenerative role for opioid-induced changes in tau biology. It is
known that hyperphosphorylated tau can and tau oligomerization alter neurotransmission long before tau-related
pathology is observable. Therefore, we reason that opioid-induced increases in phosphorylated tau and tau oli-
gomerization may alter prefrontal cortical neurotransmission in the absence of any overt pathology. This project
proposal tests the hypothesis that opioids produce enhanced tau phosphorylation and oligomerization in the
prefrontal cortex leading to synaptic dysfunction and elevated opioid consumption. We will focus on the opioid
oxycodone in this project due its long-term use to treat pain as well as its common misuse in those with opioid
use disorder. We will use a multidisciplinary approach to test for a causative role for prefrontal cortical tau in
producing synaptic dysfunction and enhancing oxycodone consumption. This project is high-risk, high-reward. It
is conceivable that opioid-induced changes in tau have nothing to do with synaptic changes or oxycodone con-
sumption. However, if there is a connection between opioid-induced changes in tau biology and synaptic
changes and opioid use, then this will be a paradigm shift for the opioid research field. In the future, after some
additional exploration, we may be able to leverage therapeutics originally designed to treat neurodegenerative
tauopathies to treat opioid use disorder. This would be an entirely new avenue for combatting the opioid epi-
demic."

It is not clear why some people develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in response to a traumatic event.
DNA methylation, an epigenetic mark that associates with trauma and other environmental exposures,
associates with PTSD in multiple studies, and DNA methylation of some genes may be informative for early
prediction and treatment of PTSD. Over the last 3 years, the Epigenetics Workgroup of the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium for PTSD (PGC-PTSD) has brought together data from 10 studies, with over 90
investigators from 10 countries to facilitate meta-analyses of DNA methylation (DNAm) data from cross-
sectional and longitudinal studies of PTSD in civilian and military cohorts. In this renewal proposal, we will
build on this highly productive collaboration by replicating our findings in an independent meta-analysis and
performing the largest epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to date in >4,700 subjects, characterizing
PTSD-associated CpGs in postmortem brain tissue, identifying methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) in
blood and brain relevant to PTSD, and characterizing DNAm changes over the course of PTSD treatment. We
are poised to rapidly and efficiently identify epigenetic markers informative for early prediction and treatment
and to provide context to genetic variants that predict risk and resilience following traumatic events. This study,
which aligns with ongoing PGC-PTSD efforts, will inform critical questions in the field related to the role of
blood-based methylation patterns as clinically-informative biomarkers and the degree to which they reflect
epigentic patterns in the brain; it will also provide insight into the biologic pathways underlying PTSD,
complement ongoing efforts to identify therapeutic targets, and inform prospective studies of PTSD and trauma
exposure that are underway."
10876254,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive primary brain tumor with a two years survival rate of less than 50%
following surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. Recurrence is nearly universal after the first-line
treatment, and there is currently no therapy proven to prolong survival after tumor recurrence. Thus, there is an
urgent need for more effective GBM therapies. The overarching goal of this project is to further develop and
validate new chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of GBM. GBM's resistance to radiation and
chemotherapy heavily correlates with extensive hypoxia-induced, mitochondria-dependent phenotypic changes
such as glycolytic respiration, decreased the ability to undergo apoptosis and extensive invasiveness.
Mitochondrial LonP1 is an ATP-stimulated protease, directly up-regulated by HIF-1α. LonP1 is overexpressed in
human malignant gliomas and its elevated expression levels are associated with high glioma tumor grade and
poor patient survival. Therefore, regulation of mitochondrial function by inhibiting LonP1 protease could represent
a novel approach for GBM and potentially other fast-growing malignancies which heavily depend on hypoxic
adaptation. The proposed project is based on our published and preliminary results obtained from in vitro (cell-
based) studies with LonP1 inhibition using siRNA and the inhibitor compounds CC4 and BT317 and in vivo
LonP1-overexpression xenograft models studies. BT317 is a small molecule compound, able to cross the blood-
brain barrier and to achieve promising concentrations in the brain. BT317 is highly effective in inducing cell death
in multiple glioma lines and patient-derived glioblastoma stem cell cultures, with an IC50 value of 60-100 µM
(temozolomide – the main FDA approved therapy and has minimal toxicity in normal lines. identifying BT317 as
a potentially new therapy for this universally fatal disease. In this project, we propose to: (1) examine the effect
of mitochondrial LonP1 knockout in distinct patient-derived primary glioma stem-like cells (GSC), glioblastoma
cell lines and xenograft models, (2) identify microenvironment cues and LonP1-induced mitochondrial changes
that drive GSC invasiveness, and (3) examine the drug-target inhibition and molecular mechanisms for anti-
cancer efficacy of the LonP1 inhibitor, BT317. The studies outlined here are the first to explore a very promising
avenue – mitochondrial Lon protease inhibition – as a treatment for GBM."

10874997,"Inteins are intervening proteins that catalyze their excision from flanking proteins, or exteins, via protein
splicing. Many inteins are mobile and can be inserted into intein-less alleles as initiated by an intein-
encoded homing endonuclease. Although the canonical mechanism of protein splicing is understood, the
role that inteins play for the host, if any, and the molecular means by which inteins adapt to extreme
environments are not fully elucidated. Using a combination of in vitro enzymology, structural biology,
screening for small molecule modulators, and genetic manipulation of intein-containing proteins,
undergraduate students will investigate how chemical or physical cues influence the structure and function
of inteins from extremophiles and if this conditional splicing is physiologically relevant. We will learn how
halophile inteins, encoded by mobile genes, have evolved to adapt to a highly saline environment. We will
determine if inteins are more than molecular parasites by discovering if an intein that is fixed in the
population can play a positive role for the host rather than exerting a fitness cost. We will design an assay to
discover a new category of splicing inhibitors to block the folding of intein enzymes, and learn if these
inhibitors affect growth of the host.
The long-term goal of the program is to understand how intein enzymes are able to catalyze chemical
reactions and maintain structural stability under conditions that would irreversibly denature eukaryotic or
prokaryotic proteins, and to determine if inteins can play a role for the host organism rather than being
molecular parasites. We want to discover inhibitors of the splicing process and determine if these inhibitors
can prevent the splicing of key proteins in environmental and human pathogens. Inteins have found wide
use in biotechnology applications, and a better understanding of their mechanism and structure may lead to
the development of better tools for biomedical research."
10875137,"Project Summary
The discovery of the first mutations known to increase longevity a little more than thirty years ago revolutionized
the field of aging research. Despite their fundamental importance, it has been notoriously difficult to screen for
pro-longevity mutations directly because by definition the effects of the mutation cannot be known until late in
life, and very old animals tend to not be able to reproduce. Crosses between individuals have long been
fundamental to genetics, both because that is what is needed to map and identify a given mutation and also
because reproduction is key to propagating the mutation after it is initially found. There are strategies such as
family selection to compensate for this, but they tend to be highly laborious and low throughput. Here, we propose
to build upon a comprehensive genetic library transgenesis approach that we have created called “Transgenic
Arrays Resulting In Diversity of Integrated Sequences” (TARDIS) to create a Cas9 RNA guide system that will
allow comprehensive whole genome targeted mutagenesis in an animal model for the first time. TARDIS
provides the benefits of library-based transgenesis that is frequently used in microbial species, but capitalizes
upon the ability of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to produce and propagate extra chromosomal
arrays. Elements of the array are pulled at random into a single landing pad site in the genome, constructed so
as generate a selectable marker upon guide integration. This system has the advantage of allowing the entire
genome to be targeted using a curated synthetic library in a defined and reproducible manner. But more
importantly for longevity screens, because the guide is found at a well-defined location in the genome, the
resulting mutation can be identified via simple sequencing of a single site in a single individual. Reproduction is
therefore not necessary to map or propagate the mutation. This system therefore provides an approach for the
first fully comprehensive screen of pro-longevity mutations in an animal model. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop
this new library based mutagenesis system within C. elegans, and (2) use this system to screen for novel
mutations that increase individual longevity. Mutations identified in this fashion will be confirmed via
recapitulating the same genetic change in a standardized line via CRISPR genome editing, allowing for a
comprehensive analysis of the mutations effects on longevity. This project will create a wholly new approach for
screening for mutations for any post-reproductive phenotype, as well as any mutation that precludes reproduction
per se. It will also produce a new set of genetic lines containing pro-longevity mutations. Both of these outcomes
should be of broad benefit to the genetics and aging research community."

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) impart a huge financial (in excess of $250 billion) and societal strain. In order to
develop pharmacological and behavioral therapies to treat AUDs, therefore, it is important to understand the
neural circuitry and neuroadaptation that occurs in the transition to excessive consumption of alcohol use. The
focus of this application is on a population of neurotensin (NTS) neurons the central nucleus of the amygdala
(CeA). Utilizing genetic, cre-recombinase strategies in conjunction with selective lesioning (caspase3) and
optogenetic (channel rhodopsin) strategies, we have found that these neurons, via their projections to the
parabrachial nucleus (PBN), regulate both excessive consumption of alcohol, and reward-like behaviors. In this
proposal we hypothesize that GABAergic signaling within the NTSCeA and in the NTSCeAPBN mediates
reward and ethanol consumption behaviors. We will explore this hypothesis over 3 converging aims. Aim 1
will probe the role of signaling molecules within NTSCeA neurons on reward, alcohol consumption and
appetitive behavior. Aim 2 will further probe the role of GABAergic signaling within the NTSCeAPBN projection.
Finally, Aim 3 will explore physiological adaptation within these circuits. Together, these aims provide an
innovative framework to discern how specific projections within the brain are influencing the reward behavior
and consumption of alcohol."

encountered in ambulatory and inpatient settings with cellulitis and abscess being most
common. Effective treatments are needed as SSTIs are a high-volume condition, and the
overall healthcare burden remains high. SSTIs are one of the top causes for hospital
readmissions. Furthermore, the standard of care, incision and drainage (I&D), is one of
the most painful procedures in the emergency department. In addition to pain and the
potential for unsightly scarring, other complications from I&D include damage to
surrounding structures, an extension of the infection into adjacent tissues, bacteremic
complications and reoccurrence. Furthermore, patient populations with psychosocial risk
factors (e.g., homelessness, IV drug use) are prone to secondary infections and wound
care remains problematic in these populations. Although bacteria can develop drug
resistance, they remain susceptible to mechanical damage. In particular, short intense
pulses of Focused Ultrasound (FUS), histotripsy, non-invasively generates localized
cavitation that mechanically disrupts the bacteria and represents a new paradigm for non-
invasive abscess treatment. We propose that histotripsy can non-invasively disinfect and
liquefy many superficial and intramuscular abscesses allowing for complete fine needle
aspiration. Our Aims are to expand our animal model to include MRSA pathogens and
perform animal studies to advance this technology toward first in human studies. If
successful, this approach could decrease patient morbidity, eliminate hospital stays, and
lower healthcare costs."

The mission of the NIH INCLUDE Project is to accelerate research that addresses the critical health and quality
of life needs of individuals with Down syndrome (DS). A key aspect of this mission is to ensure that the many
large and valuable multidimensional datasets that are being generated by INCLUDE-funded projects are
available and amenable to a diverse community of researchers. Therefore, to increase diversity, equity, inclusion,
and accessibility in the INCLUDE Project in particular and in the DS research community more broadly, we
propose to develop an immersive summer course known as the Data Science for Diverse Scholars in Down
Syndrome Research (DS3). This course will provide training in the generation, identification, and collection of
high-content multidimensional datasets; their management, analysis, and visualization, including cloud-based
analytics; and the development of professional skills required for the career advancement of diverse trainees.
Led by a diverse teaching team, the DS3 will be developed along the following Specific Aims:
Aim 1. To teach students how to perform FAIR research in the INCLUDE Data Hub and beyond. We will
teach the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) and demonstrate the FAIR
use of datasets available in the INCLUDE Data Hub and other synergistic public repositories. We will tutor
students about where to find datasets, how to frame answerable questions, considerations in using public data,
and how to analyze these datasets in a cloud-based environment.
Aim 2. To train students in the skills necessary for big data management, analysis, and visualization.
Using short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) data as a foundational data type, students will learn the
basics of high-performance computing skills (e.g., Unix/Linux, cluster computing skills, file management and data
analysis workflows). Students will be trained on the integration of -omics data types with clinical metadata, and
also receive training in data visualization and biostatistical tools using Python and R Studio.
Aim 3. To empower diverse trainees with professional skills necessary for career advancement. We will
provide workshops on how to write a compelling Specific Aims page, how to develop clear presentations, and
how to prepare an impactful curriculum vitae and NIH biosketch. Furthermore, we will hold networking events
with prominent DS researchers and self-advocates who are invited as guest speakers.
Aim 4. To develop a portfolio of DS3 training resources for dissemination at a global scale. We will develop
a DS3 website connecting to public libraries of DS3 video tutorials, example analyses, presentations, slide decks,
datasets, and code for sharing with the global community.
Altogether, this training program will enhance diversity in the pool of young DS researchers, while also elevating
data science literacy to accelerate clinical research that will benefit people with DS."

Determining the mechanisms by which the human brain generates cognition, perception, and emotion hinges
upon quantifying the relationships between coordinated brain activity and behavior. NIH-funded brain mapping
initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Adolescent Cognitive and Behavioral
Development (ABCD) study, have accelerated the production of large brain connectivity (i.e. connectome) and
behavioral datasets. Contemporary connectome research views the brain as a large-scale, complex network
composed of nonadjacent, yet connected brain regions. We propose to leverage the inherent network
architecture of the connectome in order to probe fundamental biological mechanisms underlying the
development of executive function and internalizing symptoms. In pursuit of this research question, this
application proposes to formalize and validate in house analysis pipelines into a Network Level Analysis (NLA)
toolbox as a comprehensive, versatile tool for use in connectome-wide association studies. The proposed NLA
toolbox fulfills BRAIN Initiative goal #5 to “Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis
of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools”. While the research focus
of this career transition award is on the application of NLA to developmental mechanisms of executive function
and emotion regulation, this versatile analytic tool will be transformative to connectome data analysis across
species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease. As part of tool development, the applicant will validate
multiple NLA approaches using in silico connectome-behavior relationships and establish sensitivity and
specificity of network level findings as compared to the connectome-wide control of familywise error rate (K99
Aim 1). The applicant will then establish test-retest reliability of NLA approaches using in vivo human connectome
and behavioral data available from the HCP-Young Adult cohort (N=1105), and establish brain networks
underlying healthy adult executive and emotional function (K99 Aim 2). During the independent R00 phase, she
will then investigate changes in connectome architecture supporting the development of executive and emotional
function using the ABCD longitudinal connectome and behavioral data (N=~11,000 age 9-14) (R00 Aim 3).
During the K99 phase she will extend her training in behavioral neuroscience to include training in machine
learning, longitudinal models, and computer science. Building on her strong foundation in human brain
connectivity analysis, the applicant will gain advanced skills in biostatistics and best practices in software
development to ensure her success as an independent researcher. The advisory committee, including Drs.
Smyser (functional connectivity), Marcus (software engineering), Fair (developmental neuroscience), Todorov
(biostatistics), Zhang (machine learning), Bassett (connectome analysis), Eggebrecht (toolbox development),
and Barch (HCP/ABCD consultant) provide expertise in all core areas spanning experimental disciplines and
possess an excellent record of obtaining independent funding and mentoring young scientists."
10877834,"PROJECT SUMMARY ABSTRACT
While other diabetes complications decreased, amputations (combined major and minor) due to foot ulcers
increased 63%, reaching a 20-year peak. More than two million Americans develop a foot ulcer annually,
placing them at risk of limb loss. Even worse, rural patients face a 37% greater risk of above-ankle, major
amputation compared to urban counterparts, a health disparity identified by our group and others. We urgently
need interventions to address this grave rural disparity and escalating amputation rate.
Our systematic review of 33 studies spanning four continents reported that urban integrated care models
reduce major amputation by approximately 40%. Urban integrated care models work by co-locating multiple
specialists in the same clinic and using algorithms to address four physiologic factors: 1) poor glycemic control,
2) vascular disease, 3) mechanical complications, and 4) secondary infection. However, the urban integrated
care model has never been adapted to rural, primary care settings.
We engineered the first integrated care model for rural patients with diabetic foot ulcers, which is innovative in
supporting both rural primary care and care that bridges rural and urban settings. To do so, we partnered with
a HRSA-awarded Cooperative of 43 rural healthcare systems with a nationally recognized focus on improving
rural diabetes care. Together, we identified the #1 health system barrier to rural, integrated care: poor
collaboration across the rural-urban health system divide. Without co-location, rural providers and urban
specialists struggle to manage the highest risk patients―those with ischemia and infection. Next, we co-
designed an integrated care model to promote cross-setting collaboration without co-location. Our model
includes two tools: 1) a care algorithm and 2) a referral checklist. The care algorithm supports rural primary
care in providing high quality, local care to most patients. It also addresses obstacles to collaborating with
urban specialists by providing a priori agreed upon referral criteria including timeframes, clinical indications,
and pre-consultation diagnostics for severe disease. The referral checklist will support rural clinic schedulers,
who place referrals to urban specialty clinics, by providing schedulers with a list of documents that should be
included, reducing barriers of time-consuming triage and disjointed electronic health records.
This early-stage-investigator proposal answers NIDDK’s call for small R01 pilot/feasibility trials in preparation
for a statewide trial. We aim to: 1) build recruitment and retention strategies that work across diverse, rural
clinics, and 2) evaluate the potential of our integrated care model to reduce major amputations by examining its
impact on guideline-concordant care processes, including urban specialty referral. These aims 1) address the
top reasons clinical trials fail―poor recruitment and retention, and 2) generate preliminary evidence of efficacy
for the statewide trial. Our pilot is the next step towards the first intervention to reduce rural health disparities in
major amputations, addressing amputation as a NIDDK priority outcome in a priority, rural population."
10880279,"Clinician scientists are a vital component of the biomedical research workforce. Unfortunately, early career
clinicians currently make up a smaller share of funded investigators than ever, and the training pipeline for
clinician scientists is shrinking. This T35 training grant proposal seeks continuation of a highly productive training
program with an overall goal of encouraging talented and motivated medical students and pharmacy students to
careers as clinician scientists. Programs to attract interested medical students to careers as physician scientists
complement MD-PhD training programs because MD scientists are more likely to become engaged in patient-
oriented research compared to MD-PhD scientists and MD scientists more often choose research as a career
direction during medical school compared to MD-PhD scientists who generally choose before medical school. In
the next funding period we propose to expand the program to include pharmacy students to train pharmacist
scientists, who play an increasingly important role in research in new therapeutics in infectious diseases and
immunological disorders, including cancer. In addition to expanding the pool of clinician scientists, this approach
provides valuable interprofessional research experiences for medical students and PharmD students to work
together. The program offers a research and career development experience between the first and second year
of professional school, building on a partnership between University at Buffalo and Roswell Park Comprehensive
Cancer Center. The training program has been enormously successful. During the first ten years, every position
has been filled with 100% of 70 students completing the nine-week program. The program has influenced
medical students in how they view research and academic careers. Several students have continued in research,
have presented their work at national conferences, published papers in peer-reviewed journals and are on
academic career paths. An important priority of this program, which we will continue to emphasize, is the
recruitment of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social
sciences. During the previous five-year funding period, 30% of students were underrepresented minorities and
63% were women. In addition to including one to two PharmD students per year, we propose two additional
innovations in the next funding period. Students who complete the program will earn a digital badge and an
opportunity to earn a micro-credential, which are an emerging, innovative educational approach awarded for
completion of a learning experience. They are shareable on ePortfolio, digital resumé or Linked-In profiles and
are increasingly valued in education and industry as a way to document training that learners can bring with
them as their careers progress. A second innovation is that we will build on our pipelines to attract students from
underrepresented groups through partnerships with internal programs and with other institutions. This T35
program, designed to introduce medical and pharmacy students to careers as clinician scientists, is responsive
to a national priority to increase the number of clinician scientists in the U.S. biomedical research workforce."
10880280,"ABSTRACT
Breast cancer mortality is largely attributable to systemic, hematogenously-disseminated metastatic disease.
Given the limitations of current prognostic criteria, new methods to identify tumors likely to metastasize and
respond to therapy are needed. Multiphoton-based intravital imaging has shown that invasive carcinoma cells
in rodent mammary tumors intravasate via peri-vascular structures containing a Mena over-expressing tumor
cell, a macrophage, and an endothelial cell, all contacting each other. This tri-partite arrangement of cells
facilitates entry of carcinoma cells into the blood vessel. We have identified this microenvironment in human
breast cancer samples using a triple immunostain for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue that simultan-
eously labels the 3 cell types. We call the direct apposition of these 3 cell types “TMEM”, for Tumor Micro-
Environment of Metastasis. Recently, in a cohort of patients at Kaiser Permanente (KP), we showed that
TMEM was positively associated with risk of distant metastasis in ER+/HER2- breast cancer independently of
IHC4, a composite immunohistochemical score (based on ER, PR, HER2, Ki67) that provides prognostic
information comparable to the Oncotype Dx® Recurrence Score (RS). Extension of this work to encompass
comparison to other recently developed prognostic markers (e.g., PAM50) is now warranted. For TMEM, the
invasive carcinoma cells are identified using a protein marker for invasive and migratory cancer cells called
“Mena”, which has multiple splice variants: Mena11a is an anti-metastatic isoform expressed in epithelial-like
but not mesenchymal-like tumor cells, while Mena invasive (MenaINV) confers a potent pro-metastatic pheno-
type in mesenchymal-like tumor cells. Recently, we used multiplex quantitative immunofluorescence to
estimate the abundance of Mena lacking its anti-metastatic Mena11a isoform. We showed that this marker,
Menacalc, which reflects the relative amount of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) that a tumor has
undergone so that tumor cells can participate in TMEM assembly and interact with TMEMs, was positively
associated with risk of breast cancer death. We now propose to: examine the association of these markers
(Menacalc/MenaINV/TMEM) with risk of distant metastasis both in a case-control study of 600 case-control pairs
nested in an expanded KP cohort of 8769 breast cancer cases, and in 1000 breast cancer cases sampled from
the B28 trial (which assessed the value of paclitaxel as adjuvant chemotherapy); examine the association with
risk of distant metastasis of the strongest TMEM-related marker or marker combination in comparison to and in

Radiation therapy (RT) is a key component of standard of care treatments for glioblastoma (GBM), the most
common and deadly primary brain malignancy in adults. Beyond the direct cytotoxic effect on tumor itself, RT-
elicited anti-tumor immune responses have recently been appreciated as a key factor to the treatment outcomes.
These responses are dependent on the functionality of myeloid cells, an essential component of the innate
immune system. However, within tumor microenvironment, much of the myeloid compartment is programed to
be immunosuppressive, which impairs the anti-tumor immune responses and thereby therapeutic effects of RT.
The objective of this proposed work is to harness and reprogram immunosuppressive tumor-associated myeloid
cells (TAMCs), the most abundant immune population in GBM, to amplify the RT-elicited anti-tumor immune
responses. To enable a precise and efficient therapeutic targeting of TAMC, we propose the development of a
bridge-lipid nanoparticle (B-LNP) platform with the ability to actively target the GBM-induced TAMC in-vivo. Our
preliminary data suggest that B-LNP tethers TAMC to GBM through a “bridging” effect and concurrently blocks
the anti-phagocytic effectors used by GBM to escape immune surveillance. This platform also enables TAMC-
targeted delivery of an agonist for stimulator of interferon genes (STING), a key factor in bridging innate and
adaptive anti-tumor immunity, resulting in the tumor displaying a pro-inflammatory phenotype that robustly
stimulates effector T cell infiltration of tumor. In preclinical animal models, our TAMC-targeted reprogramming
promotes brain tumor regression, and increases the anti-tumor activity of RT.
The central hypothesis of this proposal is that nanoparticle therapies that simultaneously activate TAMC
phagocytic activity and interferon pathway signaling will amplify the RT-stimulated anti-tumor immunity against
GBM. We will focus on two different anti-GBM mechanisms of TAMC that our nanoparticle could harness:
phagocytosis of GBM (Aim 1) and activation of effector T cell responses (Aim 2). Lastly, we will determine the
effectiveness of TAMC-targeted therapy in the context of standard of care treatments for GBM (Aim 3). The
feasibility for clinical translation will be thoroughly evaluated using preclinical animal models, including a unique
humanized animal model of GBM, and clinical GBM samples, which will test the effectiveness of a humanized
version of the therapeutics. Overall, our study provides a novel approach to reshape the immunosuppressive
tumor microenvironment responsible for therapy resistance, and promote current standard of care therapies for
GBM."

ABSTRACT
 Recent evidence from our lab and others indicates that the insurgence of a primary tumor leads to changes
in the bone microenvironment that affect the residing hematopoietic and mesenchymal populations. These
changes in the bone microenvironment occur during the early stages of tumor development, prior to any evidence
of metastatic dissemination, and become more pronounced while the primary tumor progresses, even in tumors
that do not metastasize to the bone. We find increased numbers of immature myeloid cells that can actively
suppress T cell proliferation in bone marrow of mice bearing primary breast tumors and in newly diagnosed stage
II-III breast cancer patients compared with controls. In addition to changes in immune populations, bone residing
osteoblasts and osteocytes, normally involved in bone formation and regulation of bone homeostasis, respond
to distal tumors by upregulating various inflammatory cytokines as well as inhibitors of the Wnt signaling pathway,
such as Dkk1. Several of these bone-produced factors act locally to change the basal bone homeostasis, but
can also have systemic effects that can impact, either directly or indirectly, primary tumor growth and future
tumor dissemination to various sites.
Wnt signaling plays important roles in bone development, hematopoiesis and cancer. Dkk1 is a Wnt/β-catenin
inhibitor, known to suppress bone formation and promote bone resorption. Increased levels of Dkk1 are often
observed in cancer patients and correlate with poor prognosis. We recently reported that Dkk1 is upregulatated
by osteoblasts and osteocytes in the bone of mice with primary breast tumors and in cancer associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) in the primary site, but at a level much lower than in the bone. Intriguingly, we found that Dkk1
exerts immune suppressive effects and its neutralization decreases primary tumor growth by reducing immature
myeloid populations and enhancing T cell immune surveillance. Based on these exciting findings, our central
hypothesis is that bone residing osteoblasts and osteocytes modulate primary breast cancer growth and
metastatic dissemination to multiple sites by creating a systemic immune suppressive environment via
production of Dkk1. Aim1. Exploring the role of the bone microenvironment during tumor progression.
The goal of this aim is to determine the anti-tumor effects of Dkk1 deletion in bone versus its deletion at tumor
site. Aim2. Determine the mechanism by which Dkk1 modulates immune suppression. The goal of this
aim is to determine the cellular mechanism by which Dkk1 induces immune suppression.

 Acne vulgaris, or acne, is a disease of the pilosebaceous unit (PSU). Acne is ranked third among
chronic skin diseases for causing disability and medical expense and is a major cause of psychological stress
in young people. One factor contributing to acne is Cutibacterium acnes, the major bacterial species in the
PSU. Using C. acnes as a model to study the interaction between the microbiome and the host immune
response, we: 1) previously demonstrated the presence of IL-17 in acne skin lesions and 2) recently
discovered that C. acnes phylotypes associated with acne (CA) or healthy skin (CH) differentially regulate the
fate of TH17 cells to develop into non-antimicrobial (n-AMTH17) and antimicrobial (AMTH17) subsets. AMTH17 cells
release T cell extracellular traps (TETs) and directly kill C. acnes and other bacteria pathogens.
 To date, the mechanisms by which C. acnes phylotypes induce TETs and their biological impact in
acne are unknown. Therefore, our proposed research is innovative because we will define the immune
landscape of the acne lesions, provide mechanistic insights into the biological impact of TH17-TET formation in
acne, and identify novel immune pathways and potential biomarkers that can be targeted for acne therapy.
This is important as future strategies could be developed to modulate TH17 function. Additionally, maintaining
the balance among the different phylotypes of C. acnes may represent a strategy for novel probiotic design.
The identification of C. acnes ligands will further elucidate the specificity of host receptors involved in microbial

investigate the role of AMTH17 cells in acne inflammation (Aim 2), and identify the C. acnes ligands that induce
AMTH17 differentiation (Aim 3). Our preliminary findings support the premise that healthy skin commensals are
critical to the education of our immune system and our overall defense against pathogens. Our strategy will
include: classical immunological techniques involving T cell cloning to dissect the immune effector functions
that underlie TH17-mediated antimicrobial host defense; microbiome sequencing of C. acnes phylotypes that
inhabit donor biopsies to define how interactions within the skin microbiome and the host immune response
influences acne development; high-resolution time-lapse imaging to define mechanisms of TET release and
chromatin dynamics that occur during TET formation; scanning electron microscopy to delimit extracellular trap
formation in human T cells; and state-of-the-art single cell RNA-seq experiments to compute T cell gene
signatures and to define the T cell types and immune circuits present in acne lesions. Additional state-of-the-
art methodologies include the use of high affinity capture of cellular interactomes, coupled with mass
spectrometry-based proteomics, lipidomics and carbohydrate HPAEC-PAD analysis to identify C. acnes
ligands and endogenous complexes. This contribution is significant as, our studies will make significant

10889983,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The development of novel therapies is at the core of improving cancer outcomes worldwide. However, currently
used metrics to capture clinical benefit of these novel therapies may not always capture treatment success or
failure. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to increase precision by leveraging metrics that
integrate imaging with other measures of tumor response such as changes in plasma circulating tumor DNA
(ctDNA) in patients undergoing novel therapies. The proposed research builds on clinical proof-of-principle by
the investigative team using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of ctDNA that decreases in variant allele
frequency (VAF) of selected alterations can be observed prior to conventional radiologic response, and that
increases in VAF often occur several weeks to months before radiologic progression. Building on the foundation
of NGS, MSK-ACCESS, a highly sensitive deep sequencing liquid biopsy assay, was recently developed by the
investigative team based on its FDA-authorized counterpart MSK-IMPACT performed on tumor tissue, which
enables the identification of actionable genetic alterations that can be targeted with drugs. Additionally, the
research builds upon extensive experience of the investigative team with “basket trials” evaluating the activity of
precision genome-driven and immunomodulatory therapies, whereby the enrolling criterion is a putative
biomarker regardless of cancer type, which has put a premium on serially collecting co-clinical trial ctDNA
samples along with MSK-IMPACT testing on the tumor tissue, providing a baseline genomic profile to guide
ctDNA-based disease monitoring. The diverse and extensive collection of prospectively collected ctDNA samples
within these trials provides timepoints that can be compared to regulatory grade pre-treatment, on-treatment,
and post-progression imaging assessments via computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the correlation between early
changes in ctDNA variant allele frequencies (VAF) with best response to therapy via conventional and advanced
imaging assessments in early-phase targeted or immunomodulatory clinical trials. Specific Aim 2: To identify if
plasma ctDNA trends can more precisely predict longitudinal clinical benefit (measured by progression-free
survival) in patients who fall within the broad response category of stable disease via RECIST in early-phase
clinical trials. Specific Aim 3: To identify the median time prior to which rising ctDNA levels presages eventual
radiologic progression in patients who initially benefit from targeted or immunomodulatory therapy (i.e.,
complete/partial response or stable disease as best overall response) in early-phase clinical trials. Impact: The
insights from this study will lay the groundwork for integrating advanced imaging and ctDNA-based biomarkers
in the future that may be used by regulatory agencies around the globe for the purpose of assessing and
approving novel precision therapies and ultimately allow the possibility for personalized precision medicine."
10889985,"11 million lives and 350 million disability-adjusted life-years were lost to tobacco smoke and other noxious pollutants in
2017 (significant increases from 2007). The airway tree is the first line of defense against these ubiquitous noxious agents
and, according to textbooks, has a fairly standard anatomy.
 During the first funding period, we confirmed our primary hypothesis and found that approximately 25% of the general
population have airway branch variants that modify susceptibility to cigarette smoke (published in PNAS). Further
epidemiologic investigation of airway tree structure on computed tomography (CT) in multiple cohorts demonstrated that
variation in native airway tree caliber (“dysanapsis”) is common and predicts incident chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) better than smoking (published in JAMA) and extends to the terminal bronchioles. These new findings suggest that
native airway tree caliber is fundamental to COPD risk and may modify susceptibility to inhale particulates including
cigarette smoke. This renewal therefore proposes to 1) establish the early-life origins of airway tree caliber to identify
possible modifiable factors, 2) investigate the pathophysiology of increased susceptibility to inhaled noxious agents in
adults, and 3) define resilient vs susceptible airway tree structure using clinical outcomes
 We will use new and existing data, and proven expertise in cohort epidemiology, lung imaging, tobacco and air pollution
assessment and gene expression to address the following aims:
Aim 1 Using radiation-free innovative MR lung imaging, we will establish the early-life origin of airway tree caliber
variation that is physiologically relevant among adolescents (n=100) in a well-characterized mulit-ethnic birth cohort.
 1a Explore if smaller airway tree caliber is associated with prospectively ascertained and modifiable early-life factors.
Aim 2 Investigate two candidate pathophysiologic mechanisms linking airway tree caliber to increased susceptibility to
tobacco smoke and other noxious pollutants:
 2a: Mechanism 1 (higher dose delivered): Determine if smaller airway tree caliber is associated with i) higher baseline
 and prospective accumulation of lung macrophage black carbon content (n=554), and ii) higher systemic biomarker levels
 of tobacco smoke exposure and inflammation (n=6,570).
 2b: Mechanism 2 (impaired airway homeostasis): Determine if smaller airway tree caliber is associated with attenuated
 basal progenitor cell expression signature among never smokers (n=40) and an ‘exhausted’ basal cell gene expression
 response to smoking with higher expression of airway inflammation (n=207).
Aim 3 Identify the threshold of airway tree caliber that defines resilient versus susceptible airway tree caliber using existing
cardiac and full-lung CT measures and clinical outcomes with up to 21 years of follow-up (n=9,664).
 3a: Test whether airway tree caliber modifies the risk of death associated with tobacco smoking.
The proposed R01 renewal builds upon high-impact prior work and seeks to understand and ultimately target resilient airway
tree development and maintenance across the lifespan and improve population health in the 21st century."

The inositol trisphosphate receptors (ITPR1, ITPR2, ITPR3) are present in the endoplasmic
reticulum, forming homo- or hetero- tetrameric complexes to control calcium release. Upon
binding to the second messenger, inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate (IP3), the ITPR controlled release
of calcium controls differentiation, proliferation, and death processes for every cell type in the
body. We identified the same single allelic mutation in the Inositol Tris Phosphate Receptor Type
3 (ITPR3) in two unrelated children. The missense mutation creates a p.Arg2524Cys amino acid
substitution within the calcium channel. These children have immunodeficiency, Charcot-Marie
Tooth disease and partial to complete anhidrosis. While autosomal recessive ITPR3 mutations
cause one form of CMT syndrome, immune system problems and sweating defects are not
normally seen. In fact, most single allelic mutations in ITPR3 are benign due to compensatory
functions by ITPR1 and ITPR2. To understand the basis for the more widespread clinical
presentation our two patients with the single allelic p.R2524C variant, as well as an expanding
number being reported elsewhere, we genocopied the mutation in mice. Our preliminary findings
suggest this Itpr3 p.R2524C variant forms a cell-type specific dominant negative. In the current
proposal, we will determine the impact of this Itpr3 mutation on cell signaling in the immune,
neuronal, and eccrine systems. A characterization of the T and B cells of the adaptative immune
system will be done with a combination of functional assays and signaling studies. Additionally, a
characterization of the Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system and eccrine cells will be
undertaken. The studies will be complemented with knockdown approaches using shRNA
technologies to determine if functionality can be restored by selectively targeting Itpr3."

Reducing Inequities by Promoting Participatory Learning Experiences in Science (RIPPLES) is
proposed by the Science Education Partnership (SEP) at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center (Fred Hutch) in
Seattle, Washington. The RIPPLES program meets the goals of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the
Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) to encourage students, particularly those from
underrepresented groups, to pursue further studies in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics,
diversify the scientific workforce, and advance the field of health disparities research. It aims to build
understanding of the mechanisms of health disparities among secondary students, so that they are inspired
and empowered to work towards healthy futures for all.
 1) Curriculum development: RIPPLES engages secondary school students in fundamental biological
concepts including mutation, human variation, and evolution through two units centered on health disparities,
designed for the Next Generation Science Standards at the high school and middle school levels. The units,
comprising 8-10 lessons that span 2-3 weeks, will examine the scientific, environmental, and social contexts
for health disparities, emphasizing the social and structural determinants of health. RIPPLES also develops
lesson modules using real-world data that engage students in building quantitative skills as they analyze the
factors that contribute to health disparities. Once developed, we will evaluate the efficacy of the curricular
materials using a well-matched comparison group study.
 2) Teacher professional learning: RIPPLES enhances the ability and confidence of secondary school
life science teachers to teach fundamental biological principles and practices through the lens of health
disparities by providing 20 teachers annually with a three-week summer professional development program
that includes a mentored research experience, and seven additional day-long sessions throughout the school
year (three orientation and follow-up, and four content workshops).
 3) Student programs: RIPPLES aims to inspire and empower secondary school students, particularly
those from underrepresented groups, to become the next generation of scientists, changemakers, and
community health leaders. A two-week summer program designed for American Indian/Alaska Native youth
introduces students to science research and community health using culturally relevant approaches and
mentoring from scientists and students close in age to participants (near-peers). In addition, an event hosted at
Fred Hutch and open to all students will celebrate student community action-oriented projects and connect
youth with professionals, community members, and other students."

 Breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) is a side-effect of anticancer treatment. Caused by damage
to the lymphatic system secondary to surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy treatments, protein-rich
lymphatic fluid moves from the lymphatic channels into the surrounding interstitial tissues, causing pain,
swelling, decreased physical function, and emotional distress. Every person treated for breast cancer has a
lifetime risk of developing this condition. Currently, there is no cure for this anticancer treatment sequelae.
Early, timely, and consistent surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment is critical to successful management.
Lifetime treatment involves a two-phase program of lymphedema therapist-guided treatment and personal self-
management activities. As survivors age, support and surveillance needs change with additional comorbidities,
psychosocial changes, and health navigation challenges which complicate lymphedema self-management.
Studies have explored incidence, symptom association factors, and self-management issues in small samples
of breast cancer survivors living with BCRL. To date, no BCRL studies have used a large, longitudinal,
prospective database. The Nurses’ Health Study is a large, national, longitudinal database that explores
reproductive and chronic disease health issues in women. Launched in 1976, researchers sought to examine
reproductive health and chronic illness risk over time. Over 280, 000 professional nurses have responded to
survey questions focused on lifestyle and health status. In 2010, questions developed by our team to address
breast cancer treatment and lymphedema symptoms were added to the biennial survey. From 2010-2017, five
waves of survey data were collected. In this study we seek to 1) explore patterns of incidence of self-reported
BCRL symptoms of limb, breast, or chest heaviness and swelling across race, socioeconomic status, and time
since diagnosis; and 2) examine patterns of associations between self-reported lifestyle- and health-related
factors and BCRL symptoms of limb, breast, or chest heaviness and swelling. Five biennial waves of the
survey data will be analyzed. We will model the association between self-reported lifestyle- and health-related
factors and BCRL symptoms of limb, breast, or chest heaviness and swelling using Generalized Linear Mixed
models across the five biennial waves of data. This study will provide the first rigorous evidence about the
incidence and prevalence and patterns of breast cancer diagnosis and self-reported BCRL symptoms in nurses
who are breast cancer survivors. These findings will help generate future questions about additional factors
that may impact survivorship for nurses living with BCRL and lay the foundation for future research in BCRL
self-management intervention development."
10865624,"A critical unmet need in prostate cancer management is to prevent disease advance to a castration-resistant and
chemotherapy-inert lethal stage. We will explore a novel anti-cancer approach against castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) that entails activation of a pro-drug conjugate specifically in tumor tissue leading to
cancer cell ablation without imposing off-targets toxicity. The approach is based on a 2021 report by Tanaka &
colleagues that a drug-conjugated aryl azide reacts with endogenous acrolein molecules that are abundant in
cancer but not normal tissue. This bioorthogonal reaction in cancer cells, based on click chemistry, leads to
rearrangement of the reaction product and drug release. We will utilize this drug release principle in a preclinical
study to target CRPC cells by BO-264 and its more potent derivatives, which are small-molecule anti-cancer
agents & drug candidates, and by docetaxel & cabazitaxel - the chemotherapy drugs for clinical CRPC. Acrolein,
a 3-carbon unsaturated aldehyde, is copiously produced in cancer cells due to abnormal metabolism and
oxidative stress. BO-264, identified from a chemical library screen, inhibits TACC3, a centrosome-associated
protein which regulates chromosome segregation. TACC3 is elevated in prostate cancer and other solid tumors.
This project is a collaboration of PI’s lab with Co-PI’s synthetic chemistry lab. Novel aryl azide conjugates of
biologics and chemotherapeutics, synthesized by the Co-PI’s lab, will be examined for impacts on CRPC in vitro
and in vivo in mouse xenograft & allograft in PI’s lab. Prelim data shows dose-dependent increasing susceptibility
of the PC3 CRPC cells to the azide conjugate of BO-264, synthesized in-house. Non-cancer RWPE-1 prostate
cells were unaffected. PC3 cells showed ~ 7-fold higher acrolein than RWPE-1. Sp. Aim 1: Synthesize at high
yields aryl azide conjugates of the above-noted anti-cancer biologics & taxanes using novel synthesis strategies
and characterize the end products. The products will be characterized by NMR, IR, HRMS, X-ray. Derivatives
of BO-264, not available commercially, will be synthesized. Sp. Aim 2: Investigate activated drugs/biologics,
released from conjugates, for effects on human & mouse CRPC cells, and on CRPC xenograft/allograft tumors
in mice. Conjugate-treated cells in culture and tumors will be assayed for proliferation, apoptosis, migration,
invasion, EMT, AR, and for AKT & ERK activation. For androgen receptor (AR)-positive CRPC, combined effects
of enzalutamide (AR inhibitor) and an azide conjugate will be probed. Tumor volume and metastasis will be
examined and correlated with tumor acrolein levels. Methods: Engineering of cells to stably express
AkaLuciferase reporter; bioluminescence imaging to assess tumor volume, metastasis; NMR, IR, HRMS, X-ray;
Cell invasion, migration; Western; IHC; single-cell RT-qPCR; Acrolein assay; FACS; Statistics. Clinical impact:
1) High clinical translation potential; 2) Novel azide conjugates of anti-cancer biologics & CRPC drugs; 3) Tumor-
selective release & activation of drugs in a bioorthogonal reaction based on click chemistry is applicable to other
cancers; 4) Drug release & activation in an immune-intact allograft tumor microenvironment is clinically relevant."

Radiation therapy is an important component of cancer treatments, yet its usage has been hampered due to side
effects to normal tissue. The current K99/R00 project seeks to investigate the molecular landscape of radiation
induced coronary heart disease (RICHD), a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors.
The complex nature of RICHD necessitates a comprehensive understanding of patient-specific risk factors and
underlying genetic variations. Focusing on the pivotal role of endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and
its correlation with variations in p53 signaling due to TP53 mutations, I will utilize human-induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) from cancer patients with TP53 mutations and transgenic mouse models in the mentored K99
phase. In my first aim, I will utilize 3D vessel-on-a-chip model (VoC) lined with iPSC-derived endothelial cells
and smooth muscle cells from cancer patients with or without TP53 mutations for longitudinal endothelial lineage
tracing analysis with vascular functional assays after exposure to 2 Gy of X-rays radiation. In my second aim, I
will generate a novel endothelial lineage tracing mouse model with TP53 mutations and elucidate the functional
and molecular alterations after exposure to 20 Gy of X-rays radiation on the heart. Both projects employ in-depth
single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis to map the gene regulatory networks perturbations across
different cell-types at varied time points post-irradiation. This project will be guided by an advisory committee
constituted of researchers bringing their distinct expertise: Joseph Wu (Precision Medicine), Laura Attardi (TP53
Biology), Sharon Gerecht (Vascular Engineering), Billy Loo (Radiation Oncology), Kristy Red-Horse (Lineage
Tracing), Michael Snyder (Integrative Omics Analysis). The training received under this mentorship will equip me
with invaluable expertise in tissue engineering, lineage tracing and scRNA-seq analysis. Ultimately, this will foster
my transition to the independent phase (R00), where I aim to establish genotype-phenotype correlations for
RICHD in iPSC-derivatives. Functional radiogenomics on vascular cells will provide novel insights and a
roadmap for stratifying TP53 mutations in RICHD offering a significant advancement for cancer patients
undergoing radiation therapy."

10868469,"The overarching goal of the proposed aims is to leverage novel methods with large and underutilized data sets
to evaluate the potential impact of increasingly specific HIV responses across generalized epidemic settings in
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in reducing overall HIV incidence. This application is highly responsive to multiple
areas of interest in the recent Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Harnessing Big Data to Halt HIV (NOT-AI-21-
054). Moreover, these aims align with current realities of the HIV pandemic. While overall incidence has steadily
declined over the last 15 years, over 1.5 million people newly acquired HIV in 2020 including one million people
across SSA. The risk for HIV is not evenly distributed anywhere in the world. And while specific key populations
are recognized to be at increased risk of HIV in many higher income settings, a general population construct is
often used to represent HIV epidemics across SSA. This construct typically negates proximal determinants of
HIV acquisition and transmission, including heightened transmission risks in the contexts of condomless sex
between men, sex work, and drug use, as well as infections among transgender people and incarcerated
populations.
We propose an ambitious set of aims that will leverage available HIV-related data for key populations as well as
auxiliary data including from social media, search patterns, spatial data, socioeconomic and migration data. We
will assemble multiple data sources and integrate these data to build a comprehensive data warehouse to
estimate key population-specific indicators including HIV incidence and prevalence, population size,
engagement in the HIV treatment cascade, and structural determinants. These estimates, augmented by small
area estimation methods where data are sparse, will inform dynamic transmission models to estimate differential
risks of onward HIV transmission among key populations and to better address the needs of key populations
compared with general-population approaches. Finally, we will leverage very large and underutilized program
data for HIV testing, prevention, and treatment programs in partnership with implementing partners. Cameroon,
Kenya, Senegal, and South Africa will be used as exemplar countries given that there exists sufficient data,
willing governments, and they represent common HIV epidemic typologies in their respective regions of SSA.
Aim 1: Build a flexible, comprehensive, and accessible data warehouse collating available HIV-related and
relevant auxiliary data for key populations from 2000 onward in SSA. Aim 2: Employ small area estimation
methods and spatial statistics using available direct and auxiliary data to infer population size, prevalence, and
engagement in the treatment cascade for key populations. Aim 3: Characterize the transmission population
attributable fraction for HIV among key populations in each setting, incorporating differential risks of onward HIV
transmission over multiple time horizons. Aim 4: Evaluate routinely collected program data to inform tailoring
and adaptation of implementation strategies for delivery of HIV prevention and treatment for key populations."
10868473,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tauopathies are a set of clinically-significant neurodegenerative disorders characterized by accumulation of
fibrillar aggregates composed of tau protein within the brain. Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent tauopathy
as it accounts for the majority cases of dementia worldwide. With the prevalence of dementia expected to at
least double in the next few decades, there is a desperate need to discover novel fundamental information about
the aberrant tau aggregation at the root of these diseases. The recent advent of cryoelectron microscopy allowed
for an unprecedented level of structural insight into the tauopathies, revealing extensive structural polymorphism
among the filaments at the root of these tauopathies. This discovery has many vital implications. First, it directly
suggests that distinct pathologic cellular conditions shape the tau aggregates in disease. Second, all distinct
polymorphs discovered thus far retain at least one of the two key hexapeptide nucleation motifs previously shown
to be vital for aggregation, implying some degree of commonality in the aggregation process that could be
exploited therapeutically. Third, the presence of unique structures in each disease directly suggests the
possibility of developing structure-specific chemical probes. My preliminary data demonstrates the power of
structural biology in elucidating key insights into all three of these areas, and the project proposed in this
fellowship application aims to expand on these results to deliver fundamental insights into tau aggregation,
polymorphism, and ligand binding. Aim 1 will characterize the structural impact of multiple pathological cellular
condition mimics on the structure of tau filaments. This structural analysis specifically aims to uncover novel
information about the potential etiology at the root of tauopathies. Aim 2 will derive detailed mechanisms for how
two in vitro inducers initiate and shape the aggregation process. This approach will uncover novel insight into
how tau aggregation is triggered and identify potential therapeutic targets for disruption of aggregation. Aim 3
will characterize the driving forces behind ligand binding to specific sites on tau filaments. Such fundamental
mechanistic information will unveil specifics for high-affinity ligand design and aid in the targeted development
of disease-specific imaging agents. Overall, this proposal is innovative because it will deliver novel insight into
multiple key aspects of tauopathies utilizing a structure-driven approach. This research is significant as it will
specifically uncover information on the etiology and pathogenesis of aberrant tau aggregation and polymorphism,
thus providing novel avenues for much-needed therapeutic intervention. Additionally, this research is significant
because the mechanistic information derived herein will aid in the future development of disease-specific positron
emission tomography tracers, in turn assisting with many clinical studies and in tracking of disease progression."
10890244,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The chemokine system consists of structurally related protein chemoattractants, their cognate G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs), and a family of atypical receptors (ACKRs), which are structurally related but do not couple
to G-proteins. It is an unusually diverse network involved in almost every physiological process of jawed
vertebrates. The complexity of the chemokine-GPCR-ACKR network requires unique tools, approaches and
techniques. A prominent feature of the chemokine system is to guide cell migration, primarily of immune cells,
and position these cells in specific niches both in homeostatic conditions as well as in pathologies such as
infection, inflammation, and cancer. The 2024 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Chemotactic Cytokines:
“Navigating Cells into Tissue Niches and Controlling their Fate and Functions in Health and Pathologies” is an
internationally renowned meeting dedicated to the mechanisms and functions of the chemokine system. This will
be the 15th edition of the Chemokine GRC. As in previous meetings, the Chemotactic Cytokine GRC 2024 will
attract scientists from diverse cell biology, biochemistry and biomedical disciplines to discuss their latest
published and unpublished results. The proposed program calls on outstanding specialists that will present new
findings and concepts with potential translational perspectives. New focus will be given to chemokine-GPCR
interactions mediating tumor specific immunity and immunotherapy, neuroinflammation, as well as neuronal
development. New developments of chemokine-GPCR related drugs and treatment strategies will also be
discussed. The GRC will, as in the recent five editions, be accompanied by a satellite Gordon Research Seminar
(GRS) on Chemotactic Cytokines. The GRS ""Emerging perspectives in chemokine network interactions and
functions"" is particularly designed for young scientists, graduate students and early postdocs. These next
generation scientists will present their work and receive feedback on their research projects from their peers and
from a select panel of senior internationally renowned field experts who will attend both the GRS and the GRC
meetings. The GRS will cover both the major themes of the GRC as well as several molecular aspects of
structural biology of chemokines and their receptors not discussed in the main GRC and will therefore attract
additional participants. Importantly, this GRS forum will also promote networking within the field of chemokine
research of the next generation of chemokine and GPCR experts. NIH funding is requested to provide partial
support for registration of the participants to both meetings. We anticipate that the main speaker presentations
including the keynote lectures, the scientific discussions during the plenary sessions and the parallel, poster
sessions, and the informal interactions between the participants during meals and leisure activities will jointly
contribute to advancing our understanding of chemokine involvement in health and disease. The conference will
also foster the development of new collaborative projects and approaches to treat human pathologies, including
inflammatory, autoimmune, and infectious diseases, and improve immune based therapies for malignancies."
10890418,"Project Summary/Abstract: Age-associated changes in different elements of the immune system, including
cells, organs and circulating factors, are reported. A meta-analysis on genome-wide transcriptional analyses of
peripheral blood (PB) from ~15,000 people identified 1,497 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated
with chronological age. However, contributions of individual immune cells in PB to these changes are not yet
well defined. In human immunity, one of the most prominent changes with age is peripheral memory CD8+ T
cell expansion. We found two distinct cell populations which expressed high and low levels of the T cell
homeostasis cytokine IL-7 receptor alpha chain (CD127 or IL-7Rαhigh and low) in effector memory (EM) CD8+ T
cells in human PB. Compared to young adults (YA, age ≤ 40), older adults (OA, age ≥ 65) had an expansion of
IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T cells (up to 70% of total CD8+ T cells) which are highly cytotoxic and inflammatory cells
with unique transcriptome and DNA methylome. About 31% of DEGs (231/744 genes) in IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T
cells, in comparison to IL-7Rαhigh EM CD8+ T cells, corresponds to 15.4% of the age-associated genes
(231/1,497 genes, referred to IL-7Rαlow aging genes) found in the above meta-analysis, suggesting the
implication of IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T cell expansion in changing the genomic profile of PB with age. Indeed, an
independent group reported the significance of the IL7R gene as an aging biomarker. Aging is the strongest
risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that accounts for 60-70% of all dementia. A recent study reported the
expansion of CD45RA+ EM CD8+ T cells in PB and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, correlating with
cognition. Importantly, such cells are mostly IL-7Rαlow cells. Of interest, we found that IL-7Rαlow aging genes
and previously reported genes with altered expression in PB of AD patients overlapped. Also, AD patients with
dementia were be divided into 3 subgroups with distinct expression levels of a set of genes, including IL-7Rαlow
aging genes, in PB which were associated with neuropsychological performance. These findings support the
possible implication of IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T cells and the IL-7Rαlow aging gene signature in AD although the
clinical and biological significance of such findings is yet to be elucidated. Based on these points, we will
investigate the significance and mechanism of the age-associated expansion of IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T cells and
related gene signature in healthy aging and AD with the overarching hypothesis that aging alters transcriptome
and methylome of IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T cells, leading to promoting inflammation. The goal of the proposal is to
test this hypothesis with: Aim 1. Investigate whether aging alters global transcriptomic landscape of IL-7Rαlow
EM CD8+ T cells in association with altered DNA methylation, leading to functional changes; Aim 2. Investigate
the significance of IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T cell signature in defining subgroups of Alzheimer’s disease patients
with distinct clinical severities; and Aim 3. Investigate the impact of IL-7Rαlow EM CD8+ T cells on neuronal
function using human cortical organoids and brain tissue."
10892013,"SUMMARY: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is marked by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) lipid dys-
homeostasis, including pathologic extracellular lipid accumulation, impaired mitochondrial lipid metabolism, and
increased lipid peroxidation, a toxic form of lipid oxidative damage. The RPE normally plays an essential role in
retinal lipid homeostasis, consuming and secreting prodigious amounts of lipid. Lipid consumption comes in the
form of a large daily lipid load, including both lipoprotein uptake from the choroid and phagocytosis of lipid-rich
photoreceptor outer segments (OS). Some of this lipid is oxidatively metabolized in the mitochondria, producing
metabolites that energetically support photoreceptors. Lipid oxidative metabolism also minimizes glucose use
by the RPE, allowing glucose to pass unused from the choroid to highly glycolytic photoreceptors. Lipid secretion
is primarily through lipoprotein, some of which supports regeneration of OS and some of which accumulates as
the extracellular deposits typical of AMD. A characteristic of cells facing large lipid loads is the formation of lipid
droplets (LD), intracellular lipid storage organelles that dynamically regulate lipid trafficking, metabolism, and
lipid peroxidation. Specific LD function varies widely between different cell types. RPE LD have been studied in
the context of visual cycle biology, but their physiology and role in maintaining non-retinoid lipid homeostasis in
the RPE is essentially unexplored. This proposal examines the composition, physiology, and role of LD in human
RPE lipid homeostasis. The over-arching hypothesis is two-fold: a) LD can temporarily store a wide-range of
lipids derived from the RPE’s daily lipid load, preventing their lipid peroxidation; and b) lipid released from LD by
specific enzymes is preferentially metabolized in mitochondria rather than secreted. By facilitating lipid oxidative
metabolism over lipid secretion, RPE LD may enhance metabolic support for photoreceptors and decrease the
accumulation of pathologic extracellular lipid seen in AMD. To test the hypothesis, various lipid loads will be fed
to primary- and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived human RPE cultures, with LD composition assessed
by mass spectrometry. The fate of lipids released from LD will be tracked via microscopy, biochemical methods,
and lipidomics. The principal investigator’s long-term goal is to develop the expertise to define intracellular RPE
lipid trafficking pathways that enhance RPE lipid homeostasis and decrease pathologic extracellular lipid
deposition, opening up new therapeutic avenues for AMD. To achieve this goal, the principal investigator’s
career development plan (CDP) focuses on RPE lipid biology, establishing expertise in iPSC-RPE culture,
radiolabeled lipid tracing, high-resolution microscopy, bio-energetic profiling, and lipidomics. The CDP’s
mentorship team takes advantage of deep expertise in lipid biology and lipidomics at University of Michigan and
has a track-record of successfully mentoring K awardees to research independence. The combination of
didactics and hands-on experience in this proposal ensures the investigator will become a successful AMD-
focused clinician with an independent basic science program harnessing RPE lipid biology to understand AMD."
10892014,"Abstract:
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the most lethal human malignancies and is responsible for
over 48,000 deaths per year in the United States. PDAC tumors have several genetic and physiological
properties that promote the generation of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can interact
destructively with cellular macromolecules. As a result, these tumors rely heavily on ROS detoxification programs
which employ thiol groups to mitigate the electron imbalances that define ROS. Those thiols are ultimately
derived from cysteine, a semi-essential amino acid with a thiol-containing side chain. As cysteine is ultimately
sourced from dietary sources, the import of exogenous cysteine is a critical step in the ROS detoxification
process. In the first term of this grant, we tested the hypothesis that PDAC depends on cysteine import for
survival. We found that depletion of cysteine, either through depletion from the media or by inhibition of cysteine
uptake, resulted in the induction of ferroptosis, a form of regulated necrosis that occurs due to oxidative damage
to cellular membranes. We demonstrated that cysteine depletion could selectively induce ferroptosis in PDAC
tumors in vivo using both genetic and pharmacological approaches and we expanded the mechanistic
understanding of ferroptosis by demonstrating that depletion of coenzyme A (a cysteine derivative) is necessary
for the induction of ferroptosis in pancreatic tumor cells.
 Here we will extend these findings in order to potentiate the effects of cysteine depletion in PDAC. First, we
will study the mechanistic difference between inhibition of system xC– versus degradation of exogenous cystine
with the engineered enzyme cyst(e)inase. We will then directly compare the preclinical efficacy of these
approaches in a genetically engineered models of PDAC, making use of a new, highly potent system xC– inhibitor.
Second, we will pursue our earlier findings on the role of coenzyme A in regulating ferroptosis by studying
whether high levels of coenzyme A in the tumor microenvironment might help suppress ferroptosis in malignant
epithelial cells. This leads to a strategy of targeting ENPP proteins, which are necessary for the (indirect) import
of exogenous coenzyme A. Third, we will determine whether the release of free iron from ferritin through via
autophagy can promote ferroptosis in the context of cysteine depletion. This leads to a strategy of activating
autophagy via MEK inhibition to increase lipid ROS production and sensitize to ferroptosis in combination with
cysteine depletion. For each of these topics, we will pursue both basic science mechanisms and translational
strategies. The studies will make use of genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC as well as novel tumor
explant models developed by our group in which human or murine PDAC samples are cultured intact in an
engineered system for up to a week. Together, these studies will further elucidate the mechanisms of response
to cysteine-depletion strategies in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma."
10892019,"Dissecting and targeting a novel vulnerability in Rb1 and p53 doubly deficient prostate cancer
Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer
death in American men. Rb1 and p53 are two prototypical tumor suppressors. Loss of one or both alleles of
either gene leads to significant deficiency in its functions, which contributes to the oncogenesis and progression
of human cancers, including prostate cancer (PCa). Concurrent Rb1 and P53 Deficiency (RPD) is common in
PCa cases that are aggressive and have poor prognosis. The mechanisms of increased cancer mortality in RPD-
PCa are far from well understood, which has hindered the development of effective treatments. Our goal is to
investigate the mechanisms underlying RPD PCa progression and to target novel vulnerabilities of RPD-
PCa cells. We have found that GPCR-kinase 3 (GRK3) is expressed significantly higher in RPD-PCa than in
non-RPD-PCa. In line with this, GRK3 expression correlates with Rb1-loss or p53-loss gene signatures. Using
the genetic and pharmacological tools that we have acquired to modulate GRK3, we have begun to gain critical
insights into the mechanisms of GRK3 and RPD in PCa. We have identified a key epigenetic regulator that is
activated by GRK3 as its kinase substrate. Our preliminary data show that GRK3 silencing preferentially ablates
RPD-PCa cells, and that its knockout inhibits PCa progression and extend survival of the TRAMP mice, a RPD-
related genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model. Our overarching hypothesis based on these results is
that GRK3 is essential for the molecular mechanisms and the fitness of RPD-PCa cells, and that GRK3
signaling through its substrates is a vital part of the mechanisms of RPD aggressiveness. To target GRK3
and to dissect molecular mechanisms underlying its function in RPD cells, we have carried out compound library
screens and identified two potent and first-in-class GRK3 inhibitors which effectively block GRK3 activity and
preferentially ablate RPD-PCa cells. We also hypothesize that blocking GRK3 with these inhibitors will
thwart RPD tumor growth and metastasis. To test these hypotheses, we propose to pursue three Aims: 1.
validate GRK3 as a novel vulnerability in RPD-PCa by examining the effects of its silencing in xenograft models
and its knockout in a genetically defined RPD GEM model; 2. determine the impact of GRK3 inhibitors on the
properties of RPD-PCa cells, as well as on the cancer progression in RPD-PCa cell-derived and patient-derived
xenograft models; 3. dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying GRK3-mediated aggressiveness in RPD.
Completion of these works is expected to establish a novel kinase-substrate relationship underlying RPD biology
and define GRK3 as an Achilles heel of RPD-PCa. It will also validate targeting GRK3 as a new direction for
developing effective therapeutics for lethal PCa. Our findings will have an impact on our understandings and
targeting of other aggressive cancer types where RPD is common."
10866155,"Project Summary / Abstract
Our strongest memories often stem from our most rewarding experiences, allowing us to learn what features of
experience predict reward and to use these predictions in the future. The ability to remember rewarding spatial
locations, such as food sources, is crucial for survival. In humans, reward memory can become dysfunctional in
memory disorders and mental illnesses like drug addiction, highlighting the need to understand how the brain
amplifies information associated with rewards. The hippocampus and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) comprise
a potential neural circuit for this amplification process. Neurons within these regions construct and update a
neural map of spatial experience, notably ""overrepresenting"" reward locations within the neural activity. However,
it remains unclear exactly what aspects of the rewarding experience the overrepresentation encodes and how
this information is learned. The goal of this proposal is to understand the neural dynamics of how the reward
overrepresentation develops in both the hippocampus and MEC and how this process is synchronized within the
hippocampal-MEC circuit. To achieve this goal, the proposal combines powerful neural recordings technologies
across rodent species, using innovative behavioral tasks that disentangle the reward itself from sensory stimuli,
movement dynamics, and the cognitive demand of remembering a specific location which predicts reward. Aim
1 (K99) will use calcium imaging to determine whether changing cognitive demands shape the hippocampal
reward overrepresentation over learning. Aim 2 (K99/R00) will use high-density electrophysiology to disentangle
reward and cognitive demand in the MEC code, tightly controlling for motor correlates around goals. Aim 3 (R00,
pilot K99) will combine simultaneous recordings in the hippocampus and MEC with inactivation of each region
to dissect their reciprocal contributions to spatial reward memory and decision-making. This work will build on
the candidate’s extensive expertise in electrophysiology and behavior by providing training in three key scientific
domains, under lead mentor Lisa Giocomo: (1) computational modeling and statistical analysis with the guidance
of co-mentor Scott Linderman, to illuminate how neural coding properties change in different task states; (2)
calcium imaging with advisor Jun Ding, to solidify a toolkit to monitor the circuit dynamics underlying flexible
coding; and (3) hippocampal and cortical population dynamics with advisors William Newsome and André
Fenton, to understand how population activity is structured and coordinated across regions at moments of
decision-making. The training plan will build professional skills in inclusive mentorship, lab management, and
scientific communication to propel a transition to independence. Stanford University offers a collaborative,
interdisciplinary, and supportive environment to pursue cutting-edge science and launch an independent career.
The proposed work will provide key insights into how and when spatial reward information is amplified in the
brain, building a foundation for the candidate’s career goal: to investigate how neural circuits flexibly shape the
information stored in memory according to behavioral demands."
10866214,"PROJECT SUMMARY (CURRENT RESEARCH AND GOALS)
My research goals are to improve the mobility of Veterans with lower limb amputation, reduce their risk of
injury, and enhance their comfort while wearing a prosthesis. I use randomized clinical trials to determine the
efficacy of commercially available devices to guide clinical decision-making with evidence. If commercial devices
fall short of expectations, I explore innovative approaches that could dramatically advance the state-of-the-art.
Individuals with lower limb amputations sometimes see their mobility curtailed due to residual limb skin
injuries. Infrequent, but high stresses from impact loads (e.g., jumping or fast walking) or torsion (e.g., rapid
changes in direction) can certainly cause skin injuries, but so can repetitive insults from the thousands of steps
taken each day. While clinicians have many commercially available prosthetic ankle-feet to choose from, none
mimic the motion of the natural limb in all regards. To discover if a prosthesis with more natural motion would
have better patient outcomes, I developed a torsionally adaptive prosthesis (TAP) that couples sagittal plane
motion of the ankle (plantar- and dorsi-flexion) with transverse plane motion (external and internal rotation).
Funded by a VA Merit Review, our recently concluded clinical trial found a 6:1 sagittal:transverse coupling ratio
created a more natural motion and minimized residual limb torsion. Providing this coupling might improve
mobility by allowing longer walking bouts without injury, but a mechatronic limb like the TAP would be unlikely
to leave the lab. Striving for a commercially viable alternative, my team and I invented and patented the Pivot-
Flex Foot, a passive prosthesis capable of 6:1 coupled motion. Using a validated finite element model, we are
fabricating Pivot-Flex feet in different sizes and stiffness categories needed for an upcoming clinical trial.
A more proximal challenge to mobility is the clinical need for a well-fitting socket. Veterans who live near a clinic
can be repeat customers until a satisfactory fit is obtained, but about a quarter of all Veterans live in rural
communities far from VA Medical Centers. I am testing inexpensive digital scanning technology to remotely
capture a Veteran’s residual limb shape with the assistance of a caregiver or helper. My VA funded research will
determine if prosthetic sockets, made in part with remote study helper assistance, fit at least as well as prosthetic
sockets made entirely with in-person prosthetic services. Affordable advances in technology that improve access
to care and service delivery are clinically welcome.
Of course, a well-fitting socket is essential for mobility, but perspiration can quickly bring mobility to a halt due
to adherence problems. New to market are perforated liners that allow perspiration to seep away from the skin.
I am conducting a nationwide, decentralized clinical trial (n=180) to compare three clinically available products
intended to address problems of perspiration. The results are expected to identify the product that maximizes
stability, suspension, and comfort when activities and/or environmental conditions induce perspiration.
Lastly, a fan of science fiction movies might think biomechatronic limbs are soon to be within our reach. My team
and I have developed several microcomputer operated limbs with machine and deep learning algorithms to
predict movement intentions. One particularly intriguing problem we are exploring is how to respond to rapid
changes in loads such as when a person picks up or sets down a heavy item. However, in the short-term, clinicians
need more pragmatic studies. My team has recently completed a load carriage study intended to provide
recommendations on how an individual should carry a load (anteriorly, posteriorly, on the prosthetic limb side,
or on the intact limb side) and which of several different study feet are best for such activities.
The knowledge disseminated from my research will provide evidence to assist clinicians with their prescription
practice and guide the commercial development of new products. I expect both to lead to substantial quality of
life improvements for Veterans with lower limb amputation."
10868562,"Project Summary/Abstract
Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are small DNA tumor viruses that cause debilitating disease in humans, including the
often-fatal Merkel cell carcinoma by Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). To cause infection, these non-enveloped
viruses must transport through the crowded host cellular environment to reach the nucleus where transcription
and replication of the viral genome leads to lytic infection or cellular transformation. During entry, PyV, is
endocytosed and trafficked to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it penetrates the ER membrane to reach
the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, the virus is disassembled and transported to the nucleus where it is thought to
enter the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). How PyV reaches the nuclear membrane and is
subsequently imported into the nucleus have yet to be determined. Intracellular transport is mediated largely
through the actions of the kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein host motor proteins that transport cellular cargo
towards the periphery and center of the cell, respectively. Studies of the archetype PyV, simian virus 40 (SV40),
revealed that the virus exploits these motors in escaping the ER to reach the cytosol and for virus disassembly
in this compartment. This K99/R00 proposal seeks to understand the role of cellular motors in the subsequent
transport and nuclear entry of PyVs. During the mentored phase of this award, Dr. Spriggs will determine how
kinesin-1 and dynein coordinate the transport of disassembled SV40 to the host nucleus and the mechanism by
which it enters the nucleus through the NPC. At this time, she will receive training in high-resolution microscopy
techniques, including correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), that when used in combination with both
traditional and state-the-art biochemical approaches, will lead to impactful discoveries in viral and cellular nuclear
import mechanisms. While much of our knowledge of human PyV infection has come from the study of SV40,
key differences have been observed between it and MCPyV, the only PyV definitely associated with human
cancer. One prominent distinction lies in its proposed mechanism of nuclear entry, which may instead require
mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown. Despite its impact on public health, little is known of the basic biology of
MCPyV infection. During the independent phase, and with her K99 training, Dr. Spriggs will delineate the entry
pathway of this distinct human pathogen, culminating in a mechanistic understanding of its nuclear entry. When
combined with her strong background in virology and cell biology, learning high-resolution microscopy should
fully equip Dr. Spriggs to run a successful independent research program studying virus-host interactions.
Further, along with her highly motivated Advisory Committee, the University of Michigan provides an ideal
environment for her training, given its exceptional research facilities and professional development resources."
10868564,"SUMMARY
Tight regulation of gene expression in space and time is necessary for development and homeostasis in
multicellular organisms. Regions of the genome outside gene coding sequences (cis-regulatory modules, or
CRMs/enhancers) serve as assembly platforms for transcription factors that facilitate gene expression in
response to cellular or environmental cues. Although many genes are regulated by multiple CRMs,
mechanisms that coordinate the action of these CRMs and that regulate their local chromatin dynamics are
poorly understood. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, expression of the transcription factor Brinker (Brk)
is activated in the early embryo by two distal CRMs, one 5’ and one 3’ to the brk gene. Initially thought to be
redundant, these CRMs were found to drive sequential, partially overlapping patterns of expression along the
embryonic dorso-ventral axis. Further, these CRMs depend on a promoter-proximal element (PPE) that
appears to facilitate the sequential, long-range interaction of each CRM with the promoter. We have additional
evidence that the brk PPE is required for brk expression in several other tissues. We hypothesize that this
PPE located upstream of the brk gene in Drosophila represents a general mechanism for coordinating
multiple cis-regulatory modules’ (CRMs’) interaction with the promoter, and that this coordination of local
chromatin dynamics is important for proper gene expression, development and maintenance of homeostasis.
To test this hypothesis, we propose the following experimental directions: Aim 1 will test the idea that the brk
PPE manages chromatin conformation at the brk gene locus; Aim 2 will identify molecular effectors
supporting brk PPE action; and Aim 3 will investigate a role for one PPE-binding protein Odd paired (Opa) in
supporting global CRM-promoter interactions at other loci in addition to brk. Many genes across diverse taxa
are regulated by multiple CRMs – including so-called super, stretch or shadow enhancers – yet we know very
little about how these various regulatory contributions are coordinated during normal development. Insights
will come from the study of already well-characterized genes such as brk, whose expression depends on
CRM coordination by a promoter proximal element; as well as through whole genome assays of chromatin
conformation to uncover the mechanisms regulating CRM/enhancer-promoter interactions, in general. New
experimental approaches, which permit targeted manipulation and direct observation of chromatin in live,
differentiated cells of an intact organism, combined with tried-and-true techniques for the analysis of genetic
and developmental phenomena in Drosophila can provide a link between CRM-promoter interaction and the
contributions of transcription factor binding to the regulation of gene expression. Because many genes,
pathways and regulatory mechanisms are shared between Drosophila and higher organisms, improved
understanding of how gene regulation is coordinated at complex loci in flies is likely to inform new approaches
to understand these phenomena in wild-type as well as disease-relevant human contexts."
10868565,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Goal-directed navigation often occurs in complex, large environments where the same goal can be reached
from different starting point and through different routes which are often self-selected. The hippocampus is
believed to play a central role in navigation yet it remains poorly understood how it supports the planning and
execution of naturally emerging navigation patterns during goal-directed behaviors. The Egyptian fruit bat is a
powerful model for bridging this gap due to specialization for spatial navigation and in particular, its natural
desire to converge onto self-selected, stereotyped and highly structured navigation patterns. Here, we leverage
the bat natural behavior and significantly extend the arsenal of tools and approaches to study how the
hippocampus contributes to the planning, emergence and sustainment the goal-directed, structured navigation
behavior. To do so, we develop novel fully automated environments aimed at engaging the bats in self-paced
and self-selected, natural navigation under closely monitored laboratory conditions. In doing so, we find that
the bats readily engage in goal directed foraging behavior which resembles that observed in the natural setting.
To study the neural dynamics, computations and involvement of the hippocampus in this behavior we integrate
a wide range of wireless neuro-technologies, many of which are entirely novel for the bat model system. These
include, wireless electrophysiology, wireless cellular resolution calcium imaging and wireless optogenetics in
freely flying bats. Our preliminary results provide a detailed account of the bat's navigational strategies during
goal-directed behavior and are beginning to reveal the neural computations in the hippocampal formation that
could facilitate this function. These includes functionally discrete set of neurons that are participating during
discrete stages of the foraging behavior including, planning, execution and evaluation of goal-directed
navigation as well as neuronal sequences that are specific to distinct navigational routes. Combined, we marry
the development of the controlled, yet ethologically-relevant, behavioral setup with a wide range of cutting-
edge neurophysiological methods to thoroughly examine the role and computations in the bat hippocampus
that can subserve that bat's natural ability for structured goal-directed navigation behavior. In doing so, this
research aims to provide a new model the hippocampal neural computations that can support self-selected and
complex goal-directed navigation."

Individuals receiving care in nursing homes disproportionally experience adverse outcomes due to
multidrug-resistant organisms. This investigation will focus on an endemic and virulent pathogen common to
nursing homes – methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and a highly emerging antibiotic
resistant fungus – Candida auris, both of which have been linked to substantial morbidity and mortality in U.S.
nursing homes. While MRSA has been a major prevention target in hospitals, little has been done to address
this pathogen in nursing homes despite the fact that nursing homes have a 3-fold higher MRSA prevalence
than hospitals and MRSA carriers in nursing homes have a 40% risk of infection per year.
Risk in nursing homes due to MRSA is now compounded by C. auris, which has been termed the
“fungal MRSA” due to similar transmission characteristics, including a remarkable propensity to colonize the
body and persist on surfaces for prolonged periods. C. auris has been associated with intractable outbreaks in
nursing homes with high attributable mortality; 5-10% of known carriers develop invasive infections and 30-
60% of those with invasive infection die as a result. Thus, determining which nursing home residents are at
greatest risk for MRSA and C. auris carriage is crucial for effective response and control.
The overall goal of this proposal is to generate novel data on MRSA and C. auris carriage and
contamination in nursing homes to inform interventions to control these important pathogens. The first
objective is to identify nursing home facility characteristics and resident risk factors associated with MRSA and
C. auris carriage. Results from this objective could target high-risk residents for screening and prevention
activities. The second objective is to determine if high-contact care activities (e.g., dressing, bathing) for MRSA
and C. auris carriers cause contamination of high-touch objects in their immediate environment. If so, focused
post-activity cleaning could be important to reduce MRSA and C. auris contamination and mitigate spread.
 I (Gabrielle Gussin, MS) am pursuing a Ph.D. in Public Health at the University of California, Irvine. This
F31 fellowship will enable me to bridge my previous Master’s training in Systems Biology with skills in
epidemiology, clinical research, and population health. I will be mentored by a multidisciplinary team with
expertise in clinical infectious diseases, epidemiology, multidrug-resistant organisms, public health, nursing
home operations, and biostatistics to support my proposed aims and career goals."
10868664,"Late preterm (34-36 weeks gestational age) infants account for 7% of the 3.76 million live births in the United
States annually, or over 263,000 infants each year. Compared to term infants, late preterm infants are at
increased risk of morbidity from outcomes such as hypoglycemia, temperature instability and
hyperbilirubinemia, and often require medical intervention in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Thus, while
the vast majority of infants born at term stay with their mothers in a well infant (level I) nursery during the birth
hospitalization, many late preterm infants are instead hospitalized in the NICU where they may be separated
from their mothers. However, significant variation exists amongst hospitals for NICU admission rates and
clinical thresholds for admission in late preterm infants that is not explained by clinical illness. Preliminary data
obtained by the PI suggests that institutional criteria for requiring automatic NICU admission in late preterm
infants can vary from 34-37 weeks gestational age and 1500-2500 grams birth weight. This represents late
preterm infants of varying maturity and size, and likely does not precisely capture infants who are at highest
risk of needing NICU level interventions. The goal of this proposal is to identify optimal NICU admission criteria
for late preterm infants. A large retrospective cohort of late preterm infants born at a single institution will be
assembled, collecting data on admission locations, and occurrence and management of late preterm
morbidities. With this, Aim 1 will be addressed: identify the frequency of neonatal morbidities amongst infants
born at 34-36 weeks’ gestation, and the frequency of these morbidities requiring medical intervention.
Literature on the frequency of morbidities in late preterm infants is limited, and none currently exists delineating
the proportion of these morbidities that require clinical intervention. Subsequently, in Aim 2: a prediction model
will be developed for which late preterm infants are most likely to benefit from automatic admission to a NICU
at the time of birth. The cohort generated in Aim 1 will be utilized to compare clinical parameters of infants who
required at least one NICU level intervention to those that did not require any. Training and test data sets will
be established. Using cross-validation techniques within the training set, an optimal cut-point for a score
derived from the predictive model will be chosen to drive clinical decision-making based on the sensitivity and
specificity of the decision rule. The strategy will be evaluated on a test set. The obtained prediction model will
be a resource towards informing optimal NICU admission criteria for late preterm infants. The PI will train in
study design methodology, data analysis, modeling, and grant writing during this fellowship that will advance
her career path towards an independent physician scientist focused on identifying high value care practices
that safely promote an intact mother-infant dyad in newborn care. She will benefit from the world-class
research and clinical environment, and renowned expertise at Stanford University."
10877307,"Nearly two-thirds of the young adults diagnosed with or treated for structural hip pathology are females, yet
females are vastly underrepresented in the research investigating how hip structure develops. This high female
prevalence is not only true for acetabular dysplasia, but also for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI)
syndrome, a condition characterized by hip pain, clinical signs, and excess bone on either the proximal femur
(cam morphology) or the acetabulum (pincer morphology) that contributes to impingement and hip pain. While
cam was initially recognized primarily in males, current evidence confirms that over 80% of females with FAI
syndrome have cam morphology. As bone responds to load in predictable ways (Wolff’s law), it is likely that
regular participation in sports prior to skeletal maturity would influence the resulting hip structure. Compelling
evidence of this adaptation exists for males, but female athletes have been vastly understudied. This work,
therefore, will address this research disparity and investigate how female participation in specific sports
influences hip structure at different levels of skeletal maturity. In this cross-sectional, observational study, we
will evaluate hip structure and function in 150 girls ages 8 to 17 years old. We will recruit girls who play
competitive “hip-risk” sports (sports known to have an increased prevalence of cam morphology in female
adults) and girls who do not play organized sports (controls). We will obtain MRIs of bilateral hips to
characterize the structure of the femur and acetabulum. We will capture multiple measures of function (i.e.,
range of motion, movement control, performance) and obtain clinical measures of ligamentous laxity and
symptoms. We will also collect pubertal and maturation status, and quantify activity level using surveys and
accelerometry measures. We will determine whether female athletes who participate in hip-risk sports differ
from controls in hip structure or function, and if so, at what maturity level differences emerge. At the completion
of this study, we will have compiled the necessary data to facilitate the design and future implementation of
high-quality clinical and longitudinal studies by determining critical time periods for observation and
intervention. While the development of cam morphology is insidious and the sequelae are delayed, risk
reduction efforts similar to programs for acute sports-related injury (e.g., FIFA-11+, neuromuscular training)
have a high potential to improve hip health across the lifespan."

Kidney Disease Aging Research Collaborative (KDARC) will address a fundamental challenge in nephrology
by establishing infrastructure to support sustainable interdisciplinary research on the science of aging.
Although kidney disease occurs in ~40% of older (aged≥65 years) adults, among whom up to 70% are frail and
87% have cognitive impairment, adult nephrology care ascribes to a “one size fits all” approach ignoring
geriatric syndromes. As noted by the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine there is a
significant age disparity in accessing the preferred forms of kidney disease treatment. These age disparities
are driven by the dearth of research on kidney disease patients with geriatric syndromes. In contrast to the
18,200 general nephrology publications, only 183 geriatric nephrology manuscripts have been published since
2000. Consequently, there is wide variation in choice of geriatric tools in clinical practice and research.
Geriatric nephrology research is limited by 3 major barriers: 1) organizational barriers that dissuade
interinstitutional collaborations, 2) data barriers that leave pressing research questions unanswered, and 3)
workforce development barriers that limit entry into the field, especially for underrepresented in medicine
(URIM) faculty. To advance and sustain the science of aging in nephrology, novel research infrastructure that
address these barriers and supports faculty who are URIM, early career, and/or new to aging research are
critically needed. Therefore, we have taken the first steps to establish a new geriatric nephrology research
collaborative, KDARC and identified 3 geriatric nephrology research priorities. We will establish a robust and
sustainable infrastructure in KDARC through a Development Phase (R61) and Application Phase (R33);
progress will be guided by an experienced Oversight Board and monitored by yearly milestones. R61 Specific
Aims, Development Phase: 1. Formalize KDARC organizational structure and procedures (Year 1-2); 2.
Convene a consensus conference on geriatric nephrology research priorities (Year 2); and 3. Establish
KDARC Data Cooperative with existing data (Years 1-2). R33 Specific Aims, Application Phase: 1. Enable
KDARC investigators to launch new geriatric nephrology studies (Year 3); 2. Support geriatric nephrology pilot
studies (Year 3-4); and 3. Advance geriatric nephrology research skills (Year 3-5). KDARC will establish the
necessary research infrastructure to stimulate new interdisciplinary research in aging and kidney disease by
leveraging existing datasets, formalizing new data collection for preliminary data, and investing in the career
development of its members. KDARC resources will be widely available to the broader research community.
Ultimately, KDARC will produce critically needed high-impact and high-priority geriatric nephrology research
that will reduce well-recognized age disparities in nephrology and positively impact the lives of the 22.4 million
older adults living with kidney disease in the US."
10877404,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hearing loss and vertigo are symptoms of Meniere's disease (MD). While the etiology of MD is unknown,
endolymphatic hydrops observed in the temporal bone specimens of MD patients point to disruption of
endolymph homeostasis in the disease. The endolymph is an extracellular physiological fluid in the inner ear that
is essential for hearing and balance. Consequently, any factor that perturbs the endolymph homeostasis is likely
to affect inner ear function. However, our understanding of the factors that affect endolymph homeostasis is a
work in progress. For example, we know stress is an important factor that exacerbates MD symptoms, but the
relationship (molecular connection) between stress and endolymph homeostasis is unknown. Hence, a deeper
understanding of the factors that affect endolymph homeostasis will be essential to develop effective treatments.
This proposal will test the hypothesis that stress hormones affect endolymph production and inner ear
physiology. Specific Aim 1 will focus on the role of adrenergic (stress) hormone receptors in endolymph
homeostasis. To elucidate the action of adrenergic hormones on endolymph production, Aim 1a will focus on in
vivo regulation of the endolymph and perilymph by adrenergic hormone receptors in mice. We will use various
electrophysiological measures and histological analysis to assess the impact of these receptors on endolymph
homeostasis and inner ear function. In Aim 1b, we will use explants from the mouse cochlea to analyze the
physiologic response (to melatonin and β-adrenergic hormones) elicited by the stria vascularis in the cochlea
and dark cells of the vestibular system, the epithelia responsible for the endolymph production. The physiological
response will be evaluated by live imaging of ion levels in the cells of the explants. Specific Aim 2 will determine
the action of glucocorticoids on endolymph homeostasis. This aim is important for two reasons. Glucocorticoid
secretion is a classic endocrine response to stress, and injection of glucocorticoids is a common treatment for
MD. In Aim 2, conditional knockout mice will be used to study the effect of (disabling) glucocorticoid receptors in
intermediate cells of the stria vascularis. The outcomes will be assessed by methods used in Aim 1a.
The proposed work will reveal the mechanistic relationship between stress hormones, endolymph homeostasis,
and inner ear dysfunction. The results will be relevant to understanding the contributions of stress hormones to
MD symptoms and developing treatments to mitigate those symptoms. Further, this award will launch the
candidate to pursue an independent career in inner ear homeostasis. Case Western Reserve University will
bring together expert physiological recording (Dr. Moss, consultant) and ion level imaging (Dr. Stepanyan,
consultant) to enhance the candidate's career."
10866962,"Project Summary. Intravenous ketamine, which displays rapid antidepressant properties, is posited to reverse symptoms
by rapidly enhancing neuroplasticity. Although community-based ketamine clinics have proliferated in the US and
worldwide in recent years, a significant barrier to clinical adoption is the lack of evidence-based strategies to enhance the
durability of ketamine’s effects, creating substantial barriers to access and longer-term maintenance of gains. In a previous
efficacy study among depressed outpatients, we posited that ketamine would rapidly increase plasticity within the
information processing domain, allowing for rigid, negative biases in cognition (specifically, negative self-
representations) to be rapidly made malleable. We further expected these neurocognitive changes would provide a clinical
window of opportunity in which to introduce digital cognitive training techniques, which would consolidate adaptive
forms of cognitive processing (specifically, positive implicit representations of self) while neuroplasticity remains high.
By instantiating adaptive forms of processing after first 'priming' the brain with ketamine, we developed a novel
synergistic treatment approach (ketamine + Automated Self Association Training; ‘ASAT’) that extended the acute effects
of a single ketamine infusion far beyond its typical 7-14 day window, showing statistically significant effects on
depression [relative to saline paired with ASAT (no-drug control arm)] that persisted for 3 months after a single infusion
of ketamine—an approximately 9-fold increase in durability of effect relative to ketamine paired with sham digital
training (no-training control arm). In the current multi-site ‘Hybrid Type 1’ effectiveness-implementation randomized
controlled trial, 600 ketamine-seeking depressed outpatients receiving intravenous ketamine ‘induction’ (6-12 serial
infusions over 3-8 weeks) at one of 8 well-established real-world clinics throughout the US will be randomized to receive
either adjunctive active ASAT or sham ASAT. After an initial in-clinic ‘onboarding’ session, patients will self-administer
ASAT (or sham) at home, in three ‘bursts’ (each ‘burst’ = eight ~15min sessions delivered 2x/day over 4 consecutive
days), sequenced to begin just after (1) the first ketamine induction dose (Aim 1), (2) the last ketamine induction dose
(Aim 2), and (3) 3 months after the first dose (Exploratory Aim). Patients will complete depression severity measures
and performance-based measures of cognitive target engagement (implicit self-associations), acutely and across a 12-
month naturalistic follow-up, enabling comprehensive assessment of ASAT’s potential enhancing (Aim 1) and extending
(Aim 2) effects on depression relief. Validated data-driven ‘combined moderator’ methods will be used to identify
baseline patient profiles (Aim 3) that predict favorable response to ketamine (all patients) and specific response to
ketamine+ASAT (relative to ketamine+sham). Comprehensive, mixed methods feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness,
and cost data will be captured from both patients and providers (Aim 4). This study will provide novel effectiveness,
feasibility/acceptability, and long-term (12-month), systematic follow-up data among heterogeneous real-world patients
seeking ketamine treatment under real-world conditions in the community, and will synergistically combine ketamine
with a portable digital intervention in an effort to exploit and extend ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects."

Gammaherpesviruses establish life-long infections in >95% of adults worldwide and are
associated with B cell lymphomas. Gammaherpesvirus-driven cancers develop in both
immunocompromised and immunocompetent individuals; prevention of such cancers is
currently impossible due to absence of vaccines, curative antivirals, and defined risk factors for
lymphomagenesis. Manipulation of B cell differentiation lies at the heart of chronic
gammaherpesvirus infection and pathogenesis. Specifically, gammaherpesviruses use natural
proliferative capacity of germinal center B cells to amplify latent viral reservoir. Further,
germinal center B cells are believed to be the target of viral transformation, as a majority of
gammaherpesvirus-driven B cell lymphomas are germinal center-derived. Despite the
importance of germinal center response for chronic infection and lymphomagenesis, very few
factors that control infection of germinal center B cells have been defined. Interferon Regulatory
Factor 3 (IRF-3) is a transcription factor that targets many cellular genes, including interferon
(IFN) β. We discovered that, contrary to the predicted role of IRF-3 as an antiviral factor, IRF-3
supports latent gammaherpesvirus infection of germinal center B cells. The proposed studies
test the hypothesis that IRF-3 is usurped by gammaherpesvirus to facilitate latent infection of
germinal center B cells, with subsequent generation of memory B cells that host life-long latent
viral reservoir. This is achieved through IRF-3-dependent regulation of cellular and viral target
genes. Successful completion of the proposed studies will offer an insight into the mechanism
by which the virus usurps a classical innate antiviral factor for the viral benefit."

The Albany Medical College (AMC) Imaging Core Facility, representing the imaging needs from
multiple NIH-funded investigators, proposes to acquire an Olympus FVMPE-RS multiphoton
microscope suited for intravital microscopy. This instrument will bridge a key gap in our current
offerings and will allow for AMC and other Capital District researchers to perform detailed
mechanistic studies in mouse models of disease, on topics as varied as systemic inflammation
and resolution (Adam, Fredman, MacNamara), lung disease (Tang, Mishra), development
(Larsen), cancer (Barroso, Intes, Lamar, Logue), vascular disease (Pumiglia, Singer), and
neuropathology (Zuloaga, Temple). All users listed in this application study highly dynamic
mechanisms of disease and have well-established animal and in vitro models for their studies.
However, their research is currently being limited by the lack of a microscope that allows for high
depth and cellular/subcellular resolution imaging to complement the imaging already performed
at high resolution in ex vivo tissue samples and in vitro 3D models and non-invasively with low
resolution and penetrance. This microscope with the proposed configuration will allow for real-
time two-color deep imaging using an Insight X3 Dual laser (680-1300/1045nm tunable/fixed), two
GaAsP detectors and a fast hybrid scanner. Two-color imaging is needed for the study of complex
biological processes such as vascular/immune cell interactions, drug delivery and cancer cell
migration and perfusion of the neurovascular unit. This configuration is designed to cover the
main requirements of all major and minor users, while allowing for future upgrades and additions
through institutional or individual investments. Through the acquisition of the Olympus FVMPE-
RS multiphoton microscope, we will leverage the state-of-the-art animal facility at AMC to provide
the needed access to multiphoton microscopy to NIH-supported investigators within AMC and at
other research institutions in the Albany Capital District, fostering cross-institutional collaborations
among NIH-supported investigators at these institutions."
10867004,"Project Summary
Normal sleep and circadian rhythms play a critical role in the developing brain. Disruptions in sleep and rhythms
during human development are a common co-morbidity in neurodevelopmental disorders including ADHD and
autism. Although the molecular mechanisms encoding cellular rhythms are well understood, little is known about
how rhythmic behaviors first emerge. I hypothesize that the developmental emergence of rhythmic behaviors is
intimately tied to metabolic state. Specifically, juvenile animals have high metabolic demands necessitating
frequent feeding; as an animal matures, consolidated periods of sleep become sustainable, leading to enhanced
memory capacity. However, it is unclear how changes in metabolic state influence the emergence of behavioral
rhythms or if the neural circuitry that regulates rhythmic behavior has conserved functions across the lifespan.
This proposal exploits the Drosophila melanogaster model to investigate the mechanism through which
sleep and feeding rhythms are initiated and influenced by metabolic state. This proposal will also offer
insight into how long-term memories (LTM) are coupled to rhythmic sleep. Finally, this proposal will use a
developmental approach to examine how sleep-wake and feeding rhythms are regulated across the lifespan. I
have determined that while 2nd instar (L2) Drosophila larvae do not show differences in sleep across the day,
early 3rd instar (L3) larvae show clear diurnal differences, sleeping more at night. My preliminary data have
characterized the development of a circuit bridge between larval DN1a clock neurons and Dh44(+) output
neurons that drives the emergence of sleep rhythms. I have also determined that Drosophila larvae experience
changes in LTM capacity over development: L3 but not L2 larvae exhibit LTM of an aversive cue. In the mentored
phase of this proposal, I will determine if the DN1a-Dh44 circuit acts as a conserved regulator of sleep timing
across the lifespan (Aim 1) and I will uncover how circadian sleep-wake circuitry communicates with
learning/memory circuits to promote the development of LTM capacity (Aim 2). In the independent phase of this
proposal, I will determine how metabolic state influences circadian-sleep circuit development (Aim 3) and how
other rhythmic behaviors such as feeding develop (Aim 4). Completion of the proposed experiments will provide
insight into how developing circuits integrate metabolic cues to drive the emergence of rhythmic behavior.
Broadly, this proposal will provide rigorous training 1) in a wide range of behavioral analyses possible
in Drosophila including adult sleep, 2) feeding rhythms and circadian neurobiology, 3) larval
learning/memory principles and circuitry, and 4) cutting-edge techniques such as machine
learning/vision approaches, each of which will complement my existing knowledge/skills. Completion of
the proposed training plan will open the door for new areas of investigation in Drosophila in my own independent
position. Furthermore, the proposed career development activities and coursework will enable me to obtain a
tenure-track faculty position."
10868084,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Eukaryotic parasites are a diverse group of organisms that can cause a wide range of infectious diseases in
humans. These diseases have a significant impact on global health, with millions of people affected
annually. The advent of affordable genome sequencing has revolutionized the study of pathogens for
therapeutic development. However, the functional annotation of the proteins encoded by these genomes has
struggled to keep pace with the rapid advancements in sequencing technology. Traditional methods based on
sequence orthology have failed to fully annotate a third of all proteins in VEupathDB, a sequence database
dedicated to eukaryotic parasites and a Bioinformatics Resource Centers (BRCs) project funded by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).
To overcome this challenge, we propose to apply a novel structure-based orthology approach to predict protein
function. This approach relies on AlphaFoldDB, a vast repository of precomputed models, and Foldseek, a
revolutionary algorithm that aligns structures with high accuracy and speed, combined with OrthoMCL
sequence orthology. The successful completion of this project has the potential to be a game-changer in
infectious disease research. The ability to functionally annotate thousands of uncharacterized proteins in
VEupathDB will provide a valuable tool for identifying potential targets for further functional studies and
therapeutic development. Furthermore, the ability to automate this process represents a significant
advancement over the current manual process, which requires extensive structural biology knowledge.
Specific Aims: 1) Define Domain-based Structure Orthology Groups (DSOGs) at scale by leveraging
AlphaFoldDB and Foldseek to identify structural orthologs and rank them based on conservation of positions in
structure-based sequence alignments. 2) Predict the function of DSOGs at scale with natural language
processing techniques, such as ProtNLM, to generate unified names and functional annotations for proteins
with similar functions within DSOGs. We will collaborate with VEupathDB to update existing official product
names and annotations.
By successfully completing these specific aims, our project will deliver annotations for thousands of
uncharacterized proteins in VEupathDB as well as an automated pipeline that streamlines the laborious
process of protein functional annotation. The annotations will provide valuable insights into the biology of
parasitic organisms, help identify potential targets for further functional studies, and facilitate the development
of novel therapeutic interventions for infectious diseases."

Population subgroups experiencing health disparities are often also underrepresented in clinical trials. These
groups include individuals from minoritized racial and ethnic groups, people from lower socioeconomic
backgrounds, and men or women, depending on the study area. Identifying approaches to reduce health
disparities will remain stalled until clinical trials can recruit and retain diverse clinical trial participants. To
improve recruitment across studies, there is a need to understand how diverse populations view specific
clinical trial attributes that could be manipulated to increase interest in trials. Prior studies have identified
personal benefits (including access to medical care; incentives) and societal benefits (advancing science) as
motivations for joining clinical trials. Participants are also more likely to enter trials with high trust and
transparency and where participant burden is minimized. Beyond this basic understanding, it is unclear how
trial attributes preferentially impact trial participation rates in various underrepresented groups, particularly for
trials focused on disease prevention. To address this need, this project will use a discrete choice experiment to
identify and prioritize specific trial attributes under investigators’ control that could be leveraged to enhance
clinical trial participation rates in underrepresented groups. Discrete choice experiments are a low-burden,
efficient methodology widely used in health economics and pharmacology to quantify target groups’
preferences for variants of a given program or product. The application of the discrete choice experiment
methodology to identifying participant preferences for clinical trial components, especially for trials focused on
prevention, is entirely novel. This project will evaluate participants’ preferences of 1) inclusion of a community
advisory board, 2) return of full versus limited results to participants, 3) balancing a study’s participant burden
with its ability to address multiple research aims, 4) incentivizing clinical assessments vs. conducting home-
based assessments, and 5) results generalizable to specific social groups versus the broader population. This
experiment will be conducted with a sample of potential clinical trial participants (N = 600) that is diverse in
terms of self-reported gender, racial and ethnic identity, education, and chronic disease status. The results of
this study will be used to design a randomized comparison of enhanced clinical trial attributes across multiple
health conditions to evaluate whether using the enhanced trial features can more efficiently recruit
underrepresented participants into clinical trials."

Family psychoeducation for adults living with psychotic disorders in Tanzania (KUPAA Trial)
Psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia contribute to the global burden of disease in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs) yet mental health services have been severely neglected. Family Psychoeducation
is an evidence-based practice from high-income countries that could have a significant impact in settings such
as Africa and other regions worldwide where resources are limited and family involvement in treatment is
fundamental. In response to PAR-21-130, this R01 will evaluate the impact of a culturally tailored version of
family psychoeducation called KUPAA (meaning “to soar” in Swahili) that is group-based and family-involved in
a low-income country context. The KUPAA intervention was recently pilot tested with adults living
schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and their families in Tanzania. The proposed hybrid effectiveness-
implementation clinical trial would individually randomize patient-caregiver pairs to either the group-based
intervention or the standard of care across 14 health facilities in four regions of Tanzania. The overall objective
is to improve recovery outcomes for individuals with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Aim #1: Determine the
effectiveness of KUPAA vs. standard of care for an outpatient population (n=432) by reducing disability and
improving quality of life (primary outcomes); and reducing hospitalizations and reducing perceived family
burden for caregivers (secondary outcomes) among matched patient-caregiver dyads. Aim #2: Examine the
mechanisms of change underlying KUPAA as a group-based, family-involved intervention. Aim #3: Evaluate
implementation outcomes guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) via
mixed methods (n=122 semi-structured interviews, observational data, cost data). This project is a
collaboration between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Duke University and four Tanzanian
institutions: Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences in Dar es Salaam, Mbeya Zonal Referral
Hospital in Mbeya, Mirembe National Mental Health Hospital in Dodoma, and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical
University College in Moshi. This proposal aligns with the NIMH cross-cutting global mental health theme and
will contribute to NIMH’s goal of advancing mental health services to strengthen public health by providing
insights on an adapted evidence-based practice designed for lower-resource settings that could also inform
domestic implementation strategies for scaling family psychoeducation in the U.S."
10866994,"Matching patients to the treatment most effective for them can accelerate recovery and meaningfully
reduce the growing burden of mental health conditions. Key barriers to tailoring care are the lack of objective
data that can predict treatment response and effective approaches to translate data to improved clinical
outcomes. As a result, many patients experience multiple treatment trials before recovery and a substantial
proportion do not recover. The combination of mobile behavioral tracking and machine learning holds promise
to overcome this barrier. Smartphones and wearable sensors can collect passive, continuous and objective
measures and can be used to administer scalable, active behavioral tasks that capture constructs central to
mental health. These highly dense data can be combined with genomics and clinical records, and machine
learning holds promise to extract meaningful signals from these rich, multidimensional streams of information
and facilitate the development of accurate predictive models.
 Our long-term goal is to increase the effectiveness of mental health treatments and the capacity of our
mental health care system. Our objective in this application is to identify factors that can be used to effectively
match patients to treatments. We will recruit 4,400 patients initiating outpatient mental health care in a network
of primary and specialty clinics into the COMPASS Study (Comprehensive Mobile Precision Approach for
Scalable Solutions in Mental Health Treatment) as part of the IMPACT-MH program. Subjects will be tracked
through a wearable device and smartphone and complete active behavioral tasks. Because evidence-based
digital interventions are increasingly widespread, patients will first be followed as they are randomized to
receive one of two evidence-based digital interventions: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); or 2) mindfulness
training. Subsequently, patients will be followed as they receive the array of treatments selected by their
clinical teams. Our overarching hypothesis is that, through the use of mobile technology and machine learning
in a large cohort before and during mental health care, we can develop individualized prediction models that
will optimize mental health treatments. Our study is designed to test this hypothesis with the following specific
aims: (1) Develop predictive models for personalized digital intervention treatment; (2) Develop predictive
models for personalized, clinic-based mental health treatment; (3) Assess patient and clinician preferences for
and perceptions of, the use of predictive modeling and behavioral tracking in mental health care; and (4)
Actively participate in cross-IMPACT-MH project activities. Our approach is innovative because it applies
scalable technology and analytic tools to a large and diverse sample of subjects receiving treatment under
real-world conditions. Further, the project is designed to lead directly to an organization-level intervention that
matches patients to treatments. Finally, this project is significant because it has the potential to greatly
accelerate recovery by identifying the treatments from which each person is likely to derive the most benefit."

Improved approaches are needed to advance the field of toxicology by discovering specific
targets and mechanisms through which legacy and emerging environmental contaminants act.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are critical mediators of physiological processes and
have been identified as targets that mediate the harmful effects of a small number of
contaminants. However, the current research on contaminant activity toward the human
GPCRome is scarce and only investigates specific contaminants and receptors in detail. Our
proposed project focuses on the gap in the research concerning environmental contaminant
activity on GPCRs. We will leverage contemporary high throughput screening (HTS) and
receptor pharmacology techniques to identify novel contaminant-GPCR pairs, giving insight into
molecular mechanisms and biological consequences. To test our approach, we trialed a small,
preliminary study, which yielded promising results by revealing novel and unpredictable
contaminant interactions with specific GPCRs, thus supporting this research's direction. From
both literature precedent and our findings, we propose to expand the effort more
comprehensively and rigorously with the following research objectives: (1) Interrogate per- and
polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) against a focused set of GPCRs to identify PFAS-GPCR
relationships that mediate effects of PFAS exposure, (2) Conduct a comprehensive screen of
various contaminants against the 'druggable' GPCRome, to discover unpredictable
contaminant-GPCR pairs, and finally (3) characterize the newly identified contaminant-GPCR
pairs in detail regarding their impact on receptor pharmacology, and cellular consequences. To
achieve success in our research objectives, the methods of our approach will draw upon the
recently developed PRESTO-TANGO and TRUPATH technologies, in addition to traditional
receptor pharmacology techniques. Findings generated from this proposal will include (1) the
identification of GPCR-mediated effects of contaminants, (2) the discovery of specific targets
acted on by environmental contaminants, and (3) characterizing molecular mechanisms of
contaminant exposure in the relevant context of cellular consequences. Furthermore, the
significance of this work will extend beyond the insight gathered from the tested compounds. As
a 'first-in-class' study, this project would support a new framework for investigating the biological
activity of xenobiotic compounds - proving valuable for current research initiatives such as the
exposome and future work investigating emerging contaminants."

strand break repair (DSBR) and cell cycle checkpoint control after DNA damage. These functions are critical
for the maintenance of genome stability and suppressing tumorigenesis. In recent years, much has been
learned about the mechanisms of PALB2 in HR-DSBR, but the mechanisms by which PALB2 functions with
BRCA2 and BRCA1 to promote cell cycle checkpoint response remain elusive, and how normal PALB2 mutant
cells survive and proliferate in vivo and evolve into cancer cells is poorly understood. In this proposal, we will
deploy a combination of state-of-the-art in vitro and in vivo approaches to answer the above open questions. In
Aim 1, we will use phosphoproteomics, targeted proteomics and functional studies to identify key factors and
mechanisms of PALB2-mediated G2/M checkpoint control. In Aim 2, we will build upon our recent discovery of
NFκB activation in Palb2 mutant mice and use a combination of systemic knockin, conditional knockout,
lineage tracing and organoid models to define the mechanisms of PALB2-associated mammary tumorigenesis
and the role of NFκB in the process. In Aim 3, we will determine the genetic mechanisms of our newly
discovered complementary relationship of PALB2 and BRCA1 in mammary tumor development by testing the
roles of RAD52 and RNF168 in the respective models."
10866878,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Many of the major biological discoveries of the 20th century were made using very few model species.
They were chosen for historical experimental tractability, rather than biological attributes relevant to critical
biological questions or relevance to pressing global health issues. Yet the advent of efficient sequencing
technologies has made the study of new organisms feasible. For example, the study of cultured fibroblasts
from incredibly large, long-lived and cancer free Bowhead whales has revealed extraordinary adaptations for
efficient DNA repair mechanisms in these animals (1). Yet Bowhead whales are not at all experimentally
tractable other than through cell culture. Acomys are an emerging model non-fibrotic regeneration and are the
only known mammalian species with any significant and systemic adult regenerative capacity. As a rodent,
albeit with some unusual reproductive physiology, they are readily maintained in the laboratory, yet we lack
tools to genetically exploit and manipulate their naturally selected, advantageous traits. History has
demonstrated that the success of model organisms is self-perpetuating: as the community of researchers
grows, new methodologies and resources are developed and shared, and the body of specific knowledge and
access to powerful tools to manipulate, observe and experiment upon these model organisms further lowers
the bar to entry so that the cycle can repeat. Here we propose to develop multiple genetic tools including
inbred lines, ES cells for chimeric and organoid analyses, and whole animal transgenesis to establish Acomys
as experimentally and genetically tractable model for mammalian non-fibrotic regenerative healing and healthy
aging. These technologies are fundamental to define the mechanisms driving the naturally selected
regenerative capacity in this species, which in turn are certain to drive the creation of new pro-regenerative
therapeutics for human regenerative medicine."
10870194,"Project Summary 
Hypoglycemia is a serious complication of diabetes resulting from insulin treatment which can lead to cognitive deficits, brain damage, loss of consciousness, and death. A primary response to hypoglycemia is an increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF). We will test the novel hypothesis that astrocytes contribute to hypoglycemia-induced CBF increases by simultaneously monitoring astrocyte Ca2+ signaling and blood vessel diameter in the mouse cortex as blood glucose is lowered by insulin administration. We will also test whether activity-dependent increases in CBF (neurovascular coupling) is reduced during hypoglycemia and during the course of diabetes. 
Aim 1. Test the hypothesis that astrocytes mediate hypoglycemia-induced vessel dilation. The relation between blood glucose, astrocyte Ca2+ signaling, and vessel diameter will be determined as blood glucose is lowered by insulin administration in wildtype mice and in IP3R2 KO mice, where astrocyte Ca2+ signaling is reduced. 
Aim 2. Test the hypothesis that adenosine evokes Ca2+ increases in astrocytes and the release of vasodilating prostaglandins (PGs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) during hypoglycemia. We will test the hypothesis that adenosine dilation of vessels acts in part by stimulating astrocytes and evoking astrocyte Ca2+ increases. PGs and EETs are released from astrocytes and dilate cerebral vessels. We will test whether one or both of these astrocyte vasodilators contribute to hypoglycemia-induced vessel dilation.  
Aim 3. Determine whether neurovascular coupling is altered during hypoglycemia. Increases in neuronal activity evoke local increases in CBF. This response, termed neurovascular coupling, supplies active neurons with needed glucose and oxygen. We will test whether vessel dilation evoked by whisker stimulation is altered during hypoglycemia in healthy mice.  
Aim 4. Test the hypothesis that neurovascular coupling is altered during hypoglycemia in a mouse model of diabetes. Aim 3 experiments will be repeated in diabetic Akita mice. These mice have been subjected to chronic hyperglycemia and represent a more accurate model of insulin-induced hypoglycemia in diabetic patients. 
Aim 5. Test the hypothesis that neurovascular coupling is altered during the course of long-term hyperglycemia as experienced in the Akita mouse model of diabetes. Cognitive decline is a serious and widespread complication of diabetes and may be caused, in part, by altered CBF regulation. We will determine whether neurovascular coupling is compromised during the course of diabetes in a longitudinal study in the Akita mouse."
10869470,"PROJECT SUMMARY – ROLE OF JMJD4 IN BREAST CANCER
 In 2023, nearly 43,000 women will die from breast cancer in the US, indicating the urgent need for
better therapies. A more comprehensive understanding of driving forces in breast cancer may furnish novel
ideas how to curtail this disease.
 JMJD4 is an enzyme that has been implicated in protein lysine hydroxylation and demethylation.
However, the precise physiological functions of JMJD4 and its mechanisms of action have remained
unresolved. Our preliminary data demonstrate that JMJD4 is upregulated in breast tumors and JMJD4
ablation can reduce growth and invasion of human breast cancer cells. Further, we provide evidence that
JMJD4 interacts with two transcription factors involved in the development of breast cancer and
chemoresistance: the stress response mediator NRF2 and HIF-2a, a major component of the hypoxia
response pathway. This suggests various potential mechanisms by which JMJD4 may affect breast cancer
cells.
 Based on these and other preliminary data, we posit that JMJD4 promotes breast tumorigenesis.
Moreover, we hypothesize that JMJD4 functions, at least in part, through modulating NRF2 and HIF-2a.
To test these hypotheses, we propose two specific aims: (i) To determine the role of JMJD4 in breast
cancer cells. (ii) To reveal how JMJD4 acts through NRF2 and HIF-2a.
 Completion of these studies will greatly advance our mechanistic understanding of JMJD4 and its role
in breast tumors. Furthermore, our research may nominate JMJD4 as a novel target for the treatment of
breast cancer. Because JMJD4 is not essential for normal cells, small molecule inhibitors of JMJD4
enzymatic activity are predicted to have minimal side effects, a highly desirable feature. Lastly, insights
gained here likely have implications for the treatment of other diseases, including colon and lung cancer,
where JMJD4 is also overexpressed."
10869580,"Three G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for lysophosphatidylserine (LysoPS), i.e., P2Y10, GPR174, and GPR34,
were recently identified. Studies in mice have uncovered immunomodulatory functions of LysoPS, and associations with
autoimmune conditions have been established, including Graves’ disease, Addison’s disease, and autoimmune thyroid
diseases. The P2Y10 receptor (P2Y10R) was initially identified as a member of the P2Y family of nucleotide receptors
based on structural similarities. However, the ability of nucleotide ligands to activate P2Y10R remains uncertain. This
project aims to address previous study limitations to determine P2Y10R ligand specificity. The pathophysiological and
immunomodulatory functions of LysoPS receptors vary with disease model and cell type, which may be attributed to the
LysoPS species present. Species of LysoPS have various fatty acid chains located at either the sn-1 or sn-2 position, and
chain length can dictate the immunological response based on preferential receptor binding. Sjögren’s disease (SjD) is a
chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the lacrimal and salivary glands,
resulting in dry eye and dry mouth, respectively. Beyond glandular involvement, SjD is a systemic disease that impacts
many exocrine and non-exocrine tissues, with pulmonary manifestations observed in more than 20% of all SjD patients. In
addition to genetic factors, SjD is triggered by environmental exposures, including various viral infections. Our
preliminary data in humans and mice suggest an association between P2Y10R and the SjD phenotype. We found that
GPR174, P2RY10, and the LysoPS-producing enzyme, phospholipase A1A (PLA1A), but not GPR34, are upregulated in
parotid and minor salivary glands of SjD patients compared to non-SjD controls. P2Y10R and GPR174 receptors are
expressed predominantly in immune cells and lymphoid organs such as the spleen and bone marrow. P2Y10R expression
depends on the Ets transcription factors Pu.1 and Spi-B, known B cell receptor signaling mediators that promote B cell
maturation. B cells play an essential role in the pathogenesis of SjD. Indicators of B cell hyperactivity in SjD include the
production of autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, and the development of B cell lymphomas. Single-cell RNA-
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the minor salivary gland (MSG) biopsies of SjD and non-SjD subjects revealed that
P2RY10 is most abundant in B cells, T cells, and NK cells, with lower expression in plasma cells and macrophages.
Among these, P2RY10 was most upregulated in T cells in SjD glands compared to controls. Though B cells have received
much attention in the study of SjD, T cells have garnered recent interest and are important to disease processes. Our
preliminary data in mice indicate that P2Y10Rs are present in the submandibular glands of IL-14αTG SjD-like mice at
higher levels than age-matched wild-type C57BL/6 mice and can be activated by LysoPS. Spatial transcriptomic analysis
revealed that P2ry10 expression is localized to ectopic germinal centers in the IL-14αTG submandibular gland. These data
suggest an association of P2Y10R with the SjD phenotype in humans and mice and warrant further investigation. We
propose to use bioinformatic and in vivo techniques to elucidate the role of P2Y10R in SjD pathophysiology.
Understanding the role of P2Y10R in SjD pathophysiology could establish a druggable target for SjD pharmacotherapy."
10868846,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A key priority for the NIH is to limit disability caused by osteoarthritis (OA) and other chronic diseases
that emerge with age. Our long-term goal is to catalyze effective strategies for early intervention by establishing
the mechanisms that lead to OA. Through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), it is clear that the genetic
risk for OA is driven primarily by a large number of non-coding single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that alter the
regulation of gene expression in chondrocytes and other cell types of the joint. Our overall hypothesis is that
testing the effect of OA GWAS SNVs on enhancer strength will identify the most likely causal variants, and that
analyzing transcription factor binding at these variants will provide insight into the mechanisms of genetic risk in
OA.
 We work with cadaveric chondrocytes from donors with no history of joint disease to provide a regulatory
environment that represents cartilage homeostasis. In addition to this baseline state, we also stimulate cells with
bioactive matrix fragments to initiate gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes that mimic the cellular
state during OA. The first aim is to identify expression modulating variants (emVars) in primary human
chondrocytes at baseline and in response to an OA-relevant stimulus. We will use massively parallel reporter
assays (MPRAs) to assess allele-specific activity of the 1259 variants that reside within 104 known OA GWAS
loci. The results from MPRAs and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies in other cell types and diseases
give us the expectation that we will identify 1-3 emVars for each of 10-30 loci and that some of these will be
specific to either baseline or stimulus conditions. The second aim is to computationally determine the
transcription factors that differentially bind to emVars. We expect to find that emVars preferentially reside in
regions that have accessible chromatin (as determined by ATAC-seq) and contain histone marks present in
enhancers (as determined by Cut & Run for H3K27ac). Further, we expect that emVars will alter transcription
factor binding strength and that stimulus-specific emVars will disrupt the binding sites of transcription factors that
we have shown coordinate gene expression changes in response to this stimulus.
 This proposal is innovative, as it represents the first MPRA in primary human chondrocytes and one of
the first “response MPRAs” to test the effect of cell state on allele-specific enhancer function for any disease.
These results will have a substantial effect on the field by providing some of the first examples of how specific
non-coding variants alter transcription factor binding to mediate the genetic risk of OA."
10869332,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Highly recurrent and metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is predominant among young African
American (AA) compared to European American (EA) women. Although mitochondrial DNA alterations play an
essential role in tumor recurrence and metastasis, the mitochondrial genetic basis of TNBC racial disparity
remains largely unknown. Mitochondria are unique organelles within the cells (having their own DNA) and are
an integral part of the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) for generating cellular ATP. They are
composed of five complexes (I-V), which are assembled from multiple polypeptides- some encoded by mtDNA
and others by nuclear DNA (nDNA). The human mtDNA is a 16.5-kb double-stranded closed circular molecule,
which codes for the 12S and 16S rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 proteins essential for the mt respiratory complex
(RC). Most human cells contain hundreds of copies of mtDNA and nearly all these mtDNA copies are identical,
i.e., homoplasmic at birth as the mtDNA follows a strict maternal mode of inheritance. The mutation rate in
mtDNA is approximately 10 times higher than that of the nuclear DNA and much easier to detect in cancer cells
because of the high copy number. Studies from our lab and others have identified somatic mtDNA mutations in
various cancers and demonstrated their role in cancer progression, implicating a role of mtDNA mutation in
human tumorigenesis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) harboring nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids are important
determinants of tumorigenesis and promising for biomarker development. However, a comprehensive analysis
of mtDNA alterations in triple-negative breast cancer racial disparity and their potential in noninvasive biomarker
development remains largely unknown. In Aim 1, we will examine the pattern of the pre-optimized panel of 11-
mtDNA mutations in EA and AA-TNBCs. This approach will enable us to validate the aggressive tumor-
signature mtDNA mutational events and to better predict metastatic recurrence early and guide treatment
planning. In Aim 2, we will measure the above panel of mtDNA mutations in the circulating EVs of all the EA
and AA patients of Aim 1. Highly sensitive and accurate detection of the tumor-signature mtDNA mutations
in the circulation as a function of progression will allow us to detect invasive lesions early and better predict
metastatic recurrence and monitor therapeutic response. In the longer run, this research will lead to the
development of routine clinical assays to detect disparate tumor-signature hotspot mtDNA mutations and
measure mtDNA contents in extracellular vesicles for early diagnosis, recurrence prediction and treatment
planning of the racially disparate population."
10869186,"Until recently, the concept of the “oncology nurse” was limited to those having extra competency in administering
chemotherapy, coordinating care delivery, or working with investigators to screen, enroll, and manage patients
in clinical trials. With increasing recognition of the ability of PhD oncology nurse researchers to walk seamlessly
between the “bedside and the bench” and acquire high value data, there is an urgent need for providing new
state-of-the- art postdoctoral-level training in oncology for nurse-scientists. Nurses have an unduplicated role in
patient care, monitoring overall well-being, managing symptoms, and developing a personal relationship over
time with the patients and families. Research results obtained by nurse-scientists who can leverage these skills
and interactions to conduct meaningful research on both the biological aspects of treatment response and the
totality of the patient experience can provide important insights that cannot be obtained by other health care
workers. And, as in the case with the success of the field of “symptom science”, they can change the way patient
care is delivered as well as improving patient outcomes. However, despite increasing recognition of the unique
and valuable role of the PhD nurse-scientist, there is an acknowledged shortage of these pivotal researchers in
oncology.
The Paul Calabresi Clinical Oncology Scholar Training Program provides a unique opportunity to address this
gap by providing training opportunities for nurse-scientists with PhDs (or equivalent) in advanced cancer
research skills and career-building opportunities needed to develop successful research careers in oncology.
Indeed, with over 54-NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the US, there is a significant need for
a diverse new generation of nurse scientists with the cutting-edge postdoctoral research training to lead essential
patient-oriented research in oncology. While there are now 130+ programs leading to the PhD degree in Nursing,
including one here at the University at Buffalo's School of Nursing, training in oncology is significantly lacking
and although the NIH Reporter lists 19 T32 training grants for nurse-scientists, at this point in time, few are
funded through the NCI with a focus on cancer-related training. Moreover, for nurse-scientists to move up in their
career, postdoctoral research training and career development and mentorship, such as afforded by the K12
mechanisms, has become the requirement for careers in either academia or clinical practice. Yet, there are no
K12 programs for nurse scientists in oncology at this time in the US. Our new K12 program, led by a team of
outstanding advisors and faculty, is designed to prepare a new generation of diverse, PhD educated nurse
scientists in oncology, giving them front-line opportunities to conduct innovative, independent clinical and
translational research and providing them with outstanding career development opportunities."
10870413,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Our research program seeks to develop innovative technologies to investigate the role of ADP-ribosylation, an
under-studied DNA modification implicated in critical biological processes, including DNA repair, genome
replication, and pathogen defense. Though prevalent across all kingdoms of life, from bacteria to humans, the
precise function and extent of DNA ADP-ribosylation remain elusive. Current knowledge largely stems from
studies on the bacterial DarT-DarG toxin-antitoxin system, and more recently, the discoveries of DNA
modification by the anticancer drug target PARP1 in human cells. One significant challenge in the field is the
absence of technology capable of identifying DNA ADP-ribosylation sites across the whole genome. Past
efforts have involved meticulous mutagenesis using radioactive labeling on predefined oligo sequences or
breaking down the genome to individual bases for modification assessment. However, these methods are
limited in their ability to provide the broader genomic context of DNA ADP-ribosylation.
Our goal is to bridge this gap through the development of two complementary techniques, using the well-
characterized DarT-mediated ADP-ribosylation as our model. The first repurposes tools we have developed to
study protein ADP-ribosylation and applies them to DNA, using high-throughput Illumina-based sequencing to
pinpoint the modification site. The second approach involves nanopore sequencing, using a modified
transmembrane protein as both a channel for DNA passage and a biosensor for base identification. By
monitoring changes in electric current, we can distinguish specific bases and detect DNA modifications. To
optimize this method, we will collaborate with leading nanopore epigenetics expert Dr. Winston Timp at
Hopkins and adapt established machine learning approaches for electric current data analyses. We will test
and refine our methods using DarT-modified oligos with defined sequences and genomic DNA standards.
In summary, this program aims to unravel the complexities of DNA ADP-ribosylation using cutting-edge
sequencing methods. These strategies will enable the investigation of the sequence context of ADP-
ribosylation sites and, in due course (beyond the current scope), the study of motifs from diverse pathogen
toxins and other modifying enzymes such as human PARPs. By developing tools to reveal the mechanisms of
DNA repair, gene regulation, and pathogen defense, we anticipate that our work may catalyze significant
advancements in healthcare, potentially leading to the development of new treatment and detection tools for a
range of diseases, from infections to cancers."
10870706,"SUMMARY
 Single particle cryoEM is now a ubiquitously employed methodology for high-resolution structure
determination of biomedically important macromolecular complexes. CryoEM structures have revealed the
detailed mechanisms underlying a wide range of cellular functions and helped understand how environmental or
genetic factors perturb biological function to give rise to disease. However, all biological specimens prepared for
single particle cryoEM imaging are exposed to the hydrophobic air-water interface during the sample preparation
process. This interaction with the air-water interface has a destructive effect on the structural integrity of the
targeted specimen, resulting in partial or complete unfolding of proteins, compositional dissociation of
complexes, and widespread aggregation of the sample. This interaction with the hydrophobic air-water interface
poses the single largest challenge facing the field of single particle cryoEM, and severely limits the utility of
cryoEM structure determination for a wide range of samples. Particularly stable samples that maintain structural
integrity after repeated interactions with the air-water interface often adopt preferred orientations relative to the
hydrophobic surface, which either diminishes or completely eliminates one’s ability to determine a high-resolution
structure of the targeted specimen. While there are additives and newer sample preparation devices that aim to
mitigate these issues arising from the air-water interface, none of these are broadly applicable for all samples,
nor do they fully overcome the air-water interface issues. Thus, cryoEM researchers often spend as much time
(or more) optimizing cryoEM sample preparation methods as in establishing expression and purification
conditions for a given macromolecule. Given that all commonly used cryoEM sample preparation technologies
expose particles to the air-water interface, most of the acquired particle data are damaged and must be
computationally discarded during image analysis. This makes cryoEM structure determination incredibly
inefficient. We propose to overhaul the grid preparation process to abolish air-water interface interactions during
cryoEM grid prep to accommodate preservation of fragile, hard-to-purify samples while substantially improving
the efficiency of cryoEM data collection. This new technology will minimize damage to protein samples by
blocking interaction with the air-water interface, which will increase applicability and efficacy of cryo-EM data
collection, while also enabling robust quantification of macromolecular abundance or conformational dynamics
present in a sample. Using a combination of graphene and nanocage technologies we will develop a cheap and
robust methodology for cryoEM sample preparation that abolishes air-water interface interactions. Successful
execution of the proposed sample preparation platform will advance our understanding of macromolecular
mechanisms by enabling the preservation of challenging samples that thus far been recalcitrant to single particle
cryoEM studies. This innovative cryoEM grid system will enable researchers to probe unexplored aspects of cell
biology, and have a transformative impact that will reverberate throughout the structural biology community."
10873340,"K24: Immunopathology of Indirect Airway Hyperresponsiveness in Asthma
Project Summary
Indirect or ""endogenous"" airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a fundamental feature of asthma that is not
fully understood. In contrast to other features of asthma such as airflow obstruction or the response to an
exogenous bronchoconstrictor such as methacholine, endogenous AHR is specific for asthma and replicates
many of the common triggers for asthma including the response to cold/dry air, hypertonic aerosols and
allergens in individuals who are appropriately sensitized. We have focused on exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction (EIB) as a prototypical feature of endogenous AHR because it is a common trigger for
symptoms, has been associated with risk of asthma progression, does not require allergic sensitization and
can be precisely measured in the laboratory. Recent studies from our lab have revealed a shift in the precise
location of mast cells (MCs) in the airways from the submucosa to the epithelium and that MCs and eosinophils
(Eos) interact with the airway epithelium in a manner that serves to propagate airway inflammation. We have
also identified alterations in phospholipid metabolism and a specific enzyme called secreted phospholipase A2
group 10 (sPLA2-X) that is strongly associated with AHR and contributes to the dysregulated lipid mediator
metabolism present in asthmatic airways. The overall goal of my research program is to understand the
underlying alterations in the airways that lead to endogenous AHR in humans. We hypothesize that MCs
and Eos act in concert with the epithelium to promote airway inflammation and that alterations in phospholipid
metabolism play a key role through generation of mediators that serve to activate the sensory nerves. In the
first aim, we determine differences in the number and proliferation potential of MC progenitors in the airways
and utilize ex vivo models to examine how interactions among MCs, Eos and airway epithelial cells (AECs)
serve to propagate airway inflammation. In the second aim, we examine the function of sPLA2-X in innate
immune cells and explore the therapeutic potential of an extracellular inhibitor of this enzyme in a model of
EIB. In the final aim, we use design-based stereology to examine the precise location of cells and structures in
the airway wall and integrate this information with transcriptomic analyses of airway epithelial brushings to
identify the underpinnings of AHR in asthma. These projects move the field forward through a better
understanding of the basis for AHR in asthma and will support the career development of the next generation
of patient-oriented researchers interested in the immunopathology of asthma."
10873343,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a DNA virus belonging to the hepadnavirus family and is responsible for chronically
infecting over 250 million individuals worldwide, resulting in nearly a million annual deaths due to severe liver
diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Unfortunately, anti-viral treatments fail to cure HBV
infection due to the tenacity of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is the template for viral
transcription and subsequent translation of all viral products necessary to establish and sustain HBV replication.
Much is learnt about HBV replication events post cccDNA production, however little is known about the
intracellular trafficking steps that are required for the initial cccDNA production to establish productive infection.
My PhD dissertation research aims to define the role of the viral capsid in endocytic trafficking during HBV
infection (Aim 1). We have identified a series of HBV capsid mutants which have a unique phenotype in that
during infection, they do not lead to productive infection (i.e., no cccDNA formation), however cccDNA can form
during transfection via intracellular amplification, which bypasses the viral entry steps during infection, indicating
that there is a block in the viral entry steps during infection with the mutant viruses that are not required during
transfection. We plan to monitor post-entry trafficking events of WT and mutant HBV (Aim 1.1) and will further
define the role of the viral capsid in directing endosomal trafficking through use of capsid inhibitors that induce a
similar effect to our capsid mutants (Aim 1.2). These capsid inhibitors are in active clinical development;
therefore, it is crucial that we understand what entry steps are modulated by them. Addressing questions related
to HBV entry has been made possible by the identification of the viral entry receptor, hNTCP, however its
expression cannot confer susceptibility to HBV infection in HEK293 cells, which can support cccDNA formation
during transfection but cannot support cccDNA formation during infection, phenocopying the effects of the HBV
capsid mutations and inhibitors. The second portion of this project will focus on defining the role of host cells in
HBV trafficking during infection (Aim 2). We will address the endocytic trafficking of HBV in HEK293-hNTCP cells
to identify where the block(s) in infection occurs, rendering these cells non-susceptible (Aim 2.1). To help identify
the host determinants, beyond the entry receptor hNTCP, that may play a role in HBV entry, we have designed
a split GFP-based HBV reporter system that will be used to isolate a subpopulation of HepG2-hNTCP cells that
are highly susceptible to HBV infection (Aim 2.2) and perform RNA sequencing analysis to identify differentially
expressed genes between susceptible vs. non-susceptible cells. These proposed studies will increase our
understanding of HBV entry and identify the essential endocytic trafficking steps that lead to productive infection.
Altogether, the successful accomplishment of my dissertation will have profound impacts on (1) understanding
the essential events of HBV endosomal trafficking and entry and (2) identifying the HBV capsid and novel host
determinants that are critical for HBV entry and productive infection."
10876355,"ABSTRACT
Globally, there are over 16 million orphans and vulnerable children (OVC), with estimates of between 1.9-3.7
million for South Africa (SA). Despite high mental health needs of OVC, there is a crisis in scarcity of mental
health workers in SA. Community-based organizations (CBOs) offer a strategic point of intervention. In a prior
NIH-funded quasi-experimental feasibility trial we showed that the Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing
Caregivers (MISC) for CBO careworkers, thereafter named MISC-CBO, significantly reduced mental health
problems in Sesotho-speaking OVC. MISC-CBO is a year-long semi-structured, manualized video-feedback
intervention designed to enhance the caregiving capacity of CBO careworkers to improve child outcomes, by
targeting the RDoC systems for social processes (affiliation and attachment). Building on this work, we now
propose a repeated measures cluster randomized trial to fully establish the effectiveness and trans-diagnostic
mechanisms of action of MISC-CBO in 7-11 year olds – a developmental stage critical for building mental health
resilience against the adolescent onset of psychiatric problems. In addition, we will use Consolidated Framework
for Implementation Research (CFIR) constructs and input from a Community Advisory Board (CAB) to leverage
the RCT to evaluate implementation costs, climate and readiness that would better position the RCT results for
future uptake, scale up, and sustainability. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the direct effects of MISC-CBO on video-
coded CBO careworker caregiving quality (affiliation and attachment) and children’s mental health outcomes
over a 24 month period. 24 CBOs (360 children and 72 careworkers) will be recruited using our existing NGO
partner (Childline) in the Mangaung and Xhariep districts in the Free State, SA. CBOs will be randomly assigned
to receive either one year of bi-weekly MISC-CBO or TAU. We hypothesize that MISC-CBO will be associated
with comparative increases in careworker caregiving quality and reductions in mental health problems in OVC.
In Aim 2a, we will test the hypothesis that caregiving quality at end-of-intervention (12 months) accounts for
intervention effects on child mental health at 18 and 24 months. Aim 2b will evaluate the moderating effects of
orphan status and the quality of the home environment, expecting that OVC who are maternal and double
orphans, and from impoverished home environments will show reduced response to intervention compared to
children without these risk factors. Aim 3a will use World Health Organization metrics to test the hypothesis that
MISC-CBO is cost-effective in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Aim 3b will use qualitative
methodology to test the hypothesis that community stakeholders deem the climate favorable and ready for the
implementation of MISC-CBO, and that additional barriers and facilitators for scale-up and implementation will
be identified. Our proposed work extends our formative work to now fully test the real-world effectiveness,
mechanisms of action, cost-effectiveness and implementation readiness of MISC-CBO during the critical
developmental window of at-risk children aging into adolescence, consistent with NIMH’s strategic objectives."
10876356,"Project Summary
 Limited English Proficiency (LEP) Latinxs experience longer duration of untreated mental health
disorders. In the case of depression and anxiety, Latinxs are half as likely as whites to receive quality,
evidence-based care despite primary care providers recommending treatment at equivalent rates. There are
known barriers for LEP Latinx patients with depression and anxiety, especially at the healthcare setting level.
Because these patients are more likely to receive care in public healthcare settings which disproportionately
care for patients on Medicaid or who are uninsured, there are often language and culturally concordant care
models in these systems yet an overall deficiency of Spanish-speaking behavioral/mental health clinicians. In
addition, these under-resourced healthcare systems also are less likely to be the site for implementation of
innovations that might increase access to mental health care for their population.
 Digital interventions, i.e., those that leverage Internet and mobile technologies, can provide an effective
option for overcoming these barriers. In many countries, digital treatments are frontline treatments for mental
health issues such as depression and anxiety, creating a standard of care that can overcome disparities and
promote health equity. In the United States, few patients have access to evidence-based digital treatments,
and even when available, uptake and engagement is often low.
 This proposal aims to implement and evaluate an evidence-based digital cognitive-behavioral therapy
intervention in safety-net primary care clinics for LEP Latinx patients with depression and/or anxiety. Primary
care is the de facto treatment setting for the treatment of common mental health problems such as depression
and anxiety and Latinx patients tend to prefer to remain treated in primary care rather than being referred to
other specialty mental health services. We will conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial (Type 2)
design with both provider- and patient-level randomization. This will generate data on effectiveness of digital
peer support for mental health outcomes for LEP Latinx patients while simultaneously generating rigorous data
on the implementation strategies with the highest chance of dissemination in future work. At the provider-level
we will compare outreach (using our clinic patient registry) with inreach (traditional provider referral), at the
patient-level we will compare two modes of delivery of the dCBT platform (peer-supported vs. unsupported).
 The long-term goal of this research is to aid in the implementation of digital mental health interventions
that can be sustainable implemented in low-resourced settings, while reducing the reliance on professionals,
overcoming workforce deficits, and increasing relevance for diverse populations. Such interventions could be
provided at scale and address the substantial burden of disease resulting from common mental disorders while
making resources more available to those traditionally underserved by our health system."
10876497,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Wheezing is a highly prevalent symptom among preschool children that is notoriously difficult to treat. While
the factors associated with wheezing are complex, it is also recognized that preschool children are a
heterogeneous group, with differing symptom profiles that may contribute to differing clinical outcomes and
disease trajectories. However, symptom science is quite limited in preschool children and has focused
primarily on respiratory symptoms in isolation, ignoring other physical symptoms and symptoms of mental and
social health in caregivers that are important to overall functional status and quality of life. To date, there has
been no attempt to identify or study symptom clusters (defined as two or more concurrent symptoms
independent of other clusters) in preschool children with recurrent wheezing. This K24 application entitled
“Mentored Patient-Oriented Research in Preschool Wheezing Disorders” seeks five years of support for
protected time to expand the Principal Investigator’s mentoring activities, promote her career development and
provide momentum to advance her research on symptom clustering in preschool children with recurrent
wheezing. The Principal Investigator has built an extensive research program on preschool wheezing in an
environment with unparalleled infrastructure, resources and collaborators. Career Development goals are to
ensure that the Principal Investigator will be provided sufficient time for mentoring and patient-oriented clinical
research activities. The award will also allow the Principal Investigator to further her education in statistical
methods and study design, molecular biology, and precision medicine to help her expand her patient-oriented
research program. This training will also facilitate the design of interventions to reduce the severity and
incidence of wheezing in young children. The overarching research hypothesis is that symptom clusters and
their associated inflammatory pathways predict clinical outcomes in preschool children age 12-59 months with
recurrent wheezing. Specific aims are to determine whether symptom cluster predicts exacerbation (primary
outcome) and quality of life (secondary outcome) and to utilize next-generation sequencing to identify
pathways underlying symptom clusters and their trajectories. This project addresses innovative questions in
symptom science and may result in identification of novel biomarkers for personalized intervention. Greater
understanding of symptoms underlying morbidity will also help tackle a critical public health problem
(wheezing) that affects a growing proportion of children in the United States."
10876931,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common multisystem inflammatory condition. Delay in effective treatment results
in increased morbidity and mortality, and a heavy economic burden. Current treatment strategies are empiric
because we have no markers to suggest which therapy is best for an individual. Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
(TNFi) are the most common initial biologic treatment in RA. Responses are variable, with approximately 30%
not responding and another 30% having only partial response. We have shown in test and validation cohorts that
pre-treatment circulating type I IFN (T1IFN) predicts non-response to TNFi. Pre-treatment IFN-β to IFN-α activity
ratio >1.3 was strongly predictive of non-response to TNFi (specificity=77% in the validation cohort). No patient
with a ratio >1.3 achieved remission or low disease activity. We used single cell analysis to study blood monocyte
(Mo) gene expression in RA patients with high vs. low IFN-β-to-α activity ratio and found major differences
between the groups, supporting downstream effects upon a critical effector cell population. Presence or absence
of JAK1 expression strongly aligned with IFN-β-to-α ratio. In RA, blood Mo invade synovium, and local stimuli
drive expansion of inflammatory macrophage (Mφ) populations. It is not known whether the circulating IFN ratio
in RA reflects T1IFN levels and pathway activation in the synovium, and this will be examined in Aim 1. The
relative contributions of blood vs. synovial signals in the diapedesis and differentiation of Mo to inflammatory
Mo/Mφs is not known. This will be explored in Aim 2 using a novel perfusable organ-on-a-chip system.
HYPOTHESIS: RA TNFi non-responders have increased blood and synovial IFN-β/α ratio that results in altered
expression of JAK1 and IFN-stimulated genes, increased diapedesis and differentiation of Mo into inflammatory
Mφs. I will explore this overarching hypothesis in 2 Specific Aims: (1) Detect differences in T1IFN, pathway
activation, and histopathology in synovium of RA patients who have a EULAR good response or no response to
TNFi. (2) Determine the impact of IFN-α and IFN-β on RA Mo, Mo-derived Mφ, and fibroblast-like synoviocytes.
I will gain new skills biased and unbiased analyses, data architecture/artificial intelligence, and in use of a
bioengineered microphysiological system to interrogate human RA biology, which I need to successfully launch
and establish myself as an independent investigator advancing precision medicine in RA. Results will provide
fertile ground for future directions. Select coursework will complement my research and fortify my skills.
Presenting, publishing, and submitting grants will sharpen my abilities. I aim to use cell biology, immunology,
and contemporary approaches to understand differences among RA patients and allow for prognostication and
a treatment approach tailored to an individual’s disease and personal immunology. NYU is heavily invested with
the resources and infrastructure to promote basic, clinical and translational research. The density of high caliber
scientists and collegial environment is ideal for an ESI transitioning to independence. Support from a K08 is vital
in my efforts to expand my research skills and empower my independent career."

The Infection and Immunity NRSA post-doctoral training program based at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM)
has an outstanding record of training investigators at the cutting edge of research in infectious diseases and
immunity for the past 16 years. Trainees in the program will be at the postdoctoral level and a mixture of MDs
and PhDs each supported for 2 years for a total request of 3 stipends per year. This program is the sole NRSA
at BCM or the Texas Medical Center that supports the breadth of research training in infections and global
health, and one of very few programs in this region of the US. Superb training opportunities exist at BCM in a
number of areas. Participating faculty mentors have strong records of federal funding and training experience.
Areas of focus include: 1) enteric pathogens; 2) vaccine development and testing; 3) HIV; 4) tropical medicine
and public health; 5) bacterial pathobiology and treatment; 6) microbiome and functional genomics; and 7)
immunology. Total current grant support in for the projects participating in this NRSA Program is approximately
$52.9M. The Program offers three training tracks: 1) laboratory-based research, 2) patient-based research,
and 3) global and public health research. The Program Co-Directors are Thomas Giordano, MD, MPH, and
Mary Estes, PhD, who oversee and administer the program. Associate Program Director Robert Atmar, MD
and Peter Hotez, MD, PhD, round out the Executive Committee. Selection of trainees is performed by the
Selection Committee, which includes the Executive Committee and three other program faculty. Excellent
training in translational team science is supported by the structure of the program. Both MD and PhD trainees
have a primary and co-mentor (one an MD and one a PhD), have an individual research advisory committee,
must prepare a written research proposal to be defended to the research committee, and have yearly reviews
that include academic and career assessment. Core training activities for all MD and PhD trainees include
developing an IDP, taking courses on clinical investigation, grants and contracts, and human subjects
research; participating in team science and career development seminars; and attending a monthly research-
in-progress seminar series, a weekly journal club, and a yearly scientific retreat. All trainees must present at
these meetings. The Adult and Pediatric Infectious Diseases Training Programs at BCM and other
Departments participating in this NRSA have shown they can attract highly qualified, training-grant eligible
postdoctoral trainee candidates including underrepresented minority candidates. Twenty-two trainees have
completed training supported by this award to date; all but one remain in a research or research-related career.
These graduates have been awarded a total of $7.9M in external federal funding. Forty four percent of the
trainees appointed in the last funding period are members of underrepresented minority populations. The
program is a critical pipeline for researchers and academicians in the US South and continuation of the
program at three slots per year is warranted."
10876935,"The prognosis for patients with HNSCC is grim with only 40%-50% of patients surviving 5 years. Surgery,
radiation and chemotherapy are debilitating with high morbidity. Immunotherapy has shown some dramatic
results. However, complete responses are rare and only a minority of HNSCC patients benefit. Therefore,
there is an unmet need to understand factors controlling HNSCC-specific immunity and to plot out novel
strategies for improved targeting. This project addresses these two goals. Accumulating evidence indicates
that the AhR, an environmental chemical receptor, is highly expressed and chronically active in many cancers
including HNSCC even in the absence of xenobiotics and regardless of tumor etiology. Chronic AhR activity
can be initiated by environmental chemicals but maintained through an AhRIDO kynurenine pathway
(endogenous AhR agonist) amplification loop. In a mouse oral cancer (MOC1) model, short-circuiting this loop
by deleting the AhR from malignant cells decreases immunosuppressive IDO1 and PD-L1 and, following
orthotopic transplant, renders mice completely immune to challenge with wildtype tumor. MOC1AhR-KO cell-
induced immunity is accompanied by a spike in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a diminution of: 1) PD1+, Lag3+,
CTLA4+, and CD39+ T cells, 2) PD-L1+ and CD39+ granulocytes (G-MDSCs), 3) PD-L1+ dendritic cells (DC),
and 4) CD39+ and CCR2+ macrophages (MΦs), all of which contribute to poor HNSCC outcomes. We
postulate that the AhR circuit in MOC cells upregulates PD-L1 and, via endogenous ligand production, skews
AhR+ MΦs, G-MDSCs, and/or DCs in the TME towards immunosuppression. Thus, our central hypothesis is
that the AhR mediates multiple immune checkpoints in HNSCC and thereby represents an attractive
immunotherapy target. Three specific aims are proposed: Map the effects of AhR, IDO and PD-L1 knockout
in malignant cells on the spatial location and interactions of immune cells in tdLNs and the TME.
CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing will determine the relative contributions of AhR-regulated PD-L1 and IDO in
immunosuppression (1.1) and Imaging Mass Cytometry will define the spatial relationship of AhR+ immune
subsets and AhR+ MOC1 cells in the TME (1.2). Aim 2: Define the immunosuppressive role of the AhR in
host immune cell subsets. Conditional AhR knockout mice will be used to determine the requirement for AhR
expression in G-MDSCs, MΦs, and DCs in HNSCC-induced immunosuppression (2.1) and scRNA-seq data
will define immune subset representation (2.2). Aim 3: Determine mechanisms of action of AhR inhibitors
in HNSCC preclinical models. The cellular targets of an AhR inhibitor will be determined and compared with
immune profiles seen after MOC1AhR-KO cell transplant (3.1); the effects of AhR inhibitor specifically on host
cells will be defined (3.2), and the effects of AhR knockout in MOC1 cells and AhR inhibitor on tumor antigen-
specific T cells compared (3.3). This collaborative project, with its use of innovative approaches, has the
potential to make a significant impact in both the environmental science and cancer immunology fields."

10876712,"SUMMARY - Engineered exosomes carrying synthetic gRNA/Cas9 targeting HBV-infected cells
Despite universal vaccinations against hepatitis B virus (HBV), chronic HBV infection remains a public health threat
in the United States and worldwide. The current antiviral treatments, using various nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs), can
block the HBV life cycle but cannot eliminate integrated HBV DNA and have little effect on HBV covalently closed
circular DNA (cccDNA), which sustains viral replication. Thus, novel curative strategies are urgently needed to
eliminate HBV cccDNA from infected hepatocytes. CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)-mediated gene-editing is an appealing approach to tackle this
problem. However, the major hurdle in the application of this technology is how to deliver gene-editing drugs to target
cells and elicit specific antiviral activities without causing off-target effects. Notably, the current CRISPR/Cas9
delivery technologies often require viral vectors, which pose safety concerns for therapeutic application in humans.
Synthetic guide RNA (gRNA)/Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) represent a novel non-viral formula with excellent
features, including rapid DNA cleavage activity, low off-target effects, no risk of insertional mutagenesis, easy
production, and readiness for clinical use. We have designed and tested a series of gRNA/Cas9 gene-editing RNPs
targeting HBV and selected the most specific and potent gRNA/Cas9 RNP candidates to abolish HBV replication in
HBV cellular models. However, the existing viral and non-viral delivery systems for gRNA/Cas9 RNPs in vivo use
face several challenges, such as non-specific (off-site) delivery, limited drug-loading capacity, low biocompatibility,
poor stability, cytotoxicity, and potential of immunogenicity. These challenges are major bottlenecks, limiting the use
of synthetic gRNA/Cas9 RNPs for in vivo applications. To address these limitations, we developed a novel exosome-
based delivery platform engineered to deliver the HBV gene-editing RNPs specifically to human hepatocytes. These
engineered exosomes are designed in such a way that they carry an HBV pre-S1-derived peptide (binding to HBV
receptor) on the surface of exosomes so that they can more specifically deliver and intracellularly release our
synthetic gRNA/Cas9 RNPs to HBV target cells. In this proposal, we aim to evaluate the capability of these exosome-
based HBV gene-editing gRNA/Cas9 RNPs (herein called Exo-HBV-Eliminator) in targeting HBV-infected
hepatocytes and investigate their antiviral efficacy and potential cytotoxicity using both cellular and animal models.
We hypothesize that our Exo-HBV-Eliminator will specifically target HBV DNA and thus efficiently abolish HBV
replication and elicit minimal cytotoxic effects both in vitro and in vivo. We propose two specific aims to test our
hypothesis. Aim 1 will determine the biophysical and biological properties of our Exo-HBV-Eliminator in vitro. Aim 2
will evaluate the antiviral and off-target effects of our Exo-HBV-Eliminator in HBV-infected, liver-humanized mice in
vivo. The objective of this study is to develop and test a novel gene therapy (engineered exosomes carrying synthetic
gRNA/Cas9 RNPs) targeting HBV cccDNA in HBV-infected hepatocytes that are incurable by the current antiviral
regimens, to lay the foundation for achieving our long-term goal of curing chronic HBV infection."
10889988,"Project Summary
 Small molecules are critical for proper regulation of stem cell behavior in multicellular organisms.
Consequently, defects in the biosynthesis, perception, or metabolism of these compounds can cause
developmental abnormalities and disease. Despite the critical importance of small molecules, the vast majority of
our understanding of their functions is derived from indirect measurements. Typically, studies of small molecule
biology are limited to genetic or biochemical approaches that ascribe functional roles to compounds based on the
properties of the genes or proteins that interact with these molecules. Alternatively, small molecules are studied
using chemical analysis approaches that homogenize bulk tissue and destroy the native context of the signals.
High-resolution spatial information is critical in development, where stem cells comprise only a small fraction of
the tissue. To enable deeper investigations of chemical regulation of stem cell behavior, my lab will apply
technologies capable of directly measuring the localization and activity of small molecules in their native
developmental contexts. This work will be done using plant roots, which are a powerful developmental system.
Roots store all of their stem cells at the root tip, which generates a developmental gradient that can be examined
in a single slice of tissue. My lab will leverage this gradient to investigate the role of small molecules in stem cell
decisions. We will map the developmental chemistry of plant roots using mass spectrometry imaging and visualize
small molecule interactions with proteins using a synthetic fluorogenic reporter. Metabolite-driven developmental
mechanisms will be explored in depth by investigating citrate and retinaldehyde (retinal), two highly conserved
metabolites with novel roles in root stem cell divisions and identity. This research will generate: 1) high-spatial
resolution atlases detailing the chemical profiles of stem cell decisions, from regeneration to differentiation 2)
novel insight into pathways that promote proliferation in stress-resilient stem cell subpopulations and 3)
elucidation of dynamic metabolite-driven signaling pathways that regulate stem cell patterning. Our results
suggest that there are many small molecules with important developmental roles that await discovery. Conducting
research at the intersection of chemistry and developmental biology will provide mechanistic insight into stem
cell decisions that would not be possible using a single-disciplinary approach. Accordingly, this work will enrich
our understanding of the conserved and divergent principles that govern stem cell patterning, maintenance,
divisions, and fate acquisition."
10889991,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The overwhelming majority of conventional and targeted chemotherapeutics in clinical use or under
development rely on engaging apoptotic pathways to elicit tumor cell death. However, resistance to apoptosis-
inducing agents is a particularly thorny clinical problem. A novel approach to targeting therapy-resistant cells is
to engage cell death mechanisms other than apoptosis to eradicate these malignant subpopulations. The
overall goal of the proposed studies is to define the lysosomal-mitochondrial inter-organelle signaling
mechanisms underlying tumor cell-specific and programmed necrotic lysosomal cell death (LCD) process
induced by a number of drugs. Our lead compound hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), a derivative of a drug that
has been employed clinically in the management of blood pressure for over forty-five years, kills differentiated
and stem cancer cells independent of tumor type, subtype, or species, but does not efficiently kill normal
differentiated cells or stem cells. Moreover, HMA kills cancer cells independent of cell cycle, autophagy
engagement, and caspase-dependent apoptosis; indeed, cell death appears to result from drug-induced
permeabilization of the lysosomal limiting membrane and subsequent cathepsin-mediated plasma membrane
rupture. Our observations indicate that efficient HMA-induced cell death requires the production and action of
mitochondrially-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our observations also indicate that HMA induces
hallmarks of some of the sphingolipidosis lysosomal storage diseases, including the accumulation of a variety
of lipid species that are normally broken down by the lysosome. Notably, lipids such as lactosylceramide and
lysophosphatidylcholine that have been demonstrated to act as signaling second messengers in the production
of mitochondrial ROS accumulate specifically in tumor cells but not normal cells upon HMA treatment. Our
observations point to a model where drug-induced aberrant lipid accumulation and ROS-mediated lysosomal
membrane lipid oxidation disrupt lysosomal membrane integrity, allowing cathepsin release and induction of
necrotic cell death. To test this model, we will use biochemical, cell biological and metabolomics approaches.
In Aim 1 we will assess the contribution of bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (BMP), a lysosome resident lipid
that is suppressed in tumor relative normal cells and is further suppressed with HMA treatment, in regulating
lysosomal membrane stability and cell viability via its ability to activate lysosomal enzymes of the
sphingomyelin breakdown pathway. Complementing these studies will be an in-depth analysis of lipidomic and
metabolomic changes associated with cellular transformation and LCD-inducing agents. In Aim 2, we will
examine lysosomal-mitochondrial signaling events that couple mitochondrial ROS production to dysregulated
lysosomal lipid metabolism. These studies will uncover lysosomal targets that will allow future development of
novel therapeutic agents that more effectively elicit cancer cell-specific programmed necrotic cell death."

10889993,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Laryngeal dystonia (LD), or spasmodic dysphonia, is isolated focal dystonia characterized by selective
impairment of speech production due to involuntary spasms in the laryngeal muscles. Despite well-
characterized clinical features of LD, its clinical management remains challenging due, in part, to the absence
of objective measures (biomarkers) for early detection and differential diagnosis. This results in diagnostic
inaccuracies, which have a negative impact on the patient’s quality of life and healthcare costs. Importantly,
delayed diagnosis leads to deferred treatment. The objective of this application is to conduct a series of studies
that combine advanced machine-learning with neuroimaging and genetics to (1) identify the neural markers
that accurately differentiate LD between its clinical phenotypes (adductor vs. abductor), genotypes (sporadic
vs. familial), and comorbid disorders (voice tremor and muscle tension dysphonia); (2) determine the early
predictive neural markers of LD development in at-risk individuals, and (3) validate associated LD gene
mutations. Supported by our preliminary data, our central hypothesis is that brain abnormalities are shaped, in
part, by underlying genetic factors and exhibit LD form-characteristic features, which can be used as
differential diagnostic and early predictive biomarkers of this disorder. This research is innovative both
conceptually and methodologically because it uses a cross-disciplinary approach to focus on the neural
pathophysiology and genetic susceptibility factors for LD diagnostic and predictive biomarker discovery. The
proposed research is significant because it will directly contribute to closing the critically existing gap in the
clinical management of LD. Identification of LD neural and genetic markers is expected to have a positive
translational impact by establishing enhanced criteria for accurate differential diagnosis and screening of
persons at risk. In short, the successful completion of these studies will open new horizons for the clinical
management of LD patients."

 The goal of the Research Education Component (REC) of the Pittsburgh Older Americans
Independence Center (OAIC) is to create a new generation of investigators with expertise in age-related
mobility and balance research. These investigators will have expertise in basic, clinical, and translational
approaches and will lead and participate in collaborative multidisciplinary projects. To accomplish this goal, the
REC uses a wide range of learning strategies for trainees. The program integrates training in basic and clinical
research, creates a structured but flexible and rich learning environment, and provides core competencies,
self-assessment tools, research project support, and access to a talented source of senior investigators from
multiple disciplines who are dedicated to mobility and balance research and mentoring.
 Our specific aims are to: 1) Promote careers in mobility, balance, and aging research among junior
investigators at 3 levels: Novice investigators (mentees in the initial level of training), Pepper Scholars (junior
faculty with some expertise who receive OAIC salary support), and Transition to Independence investigators
(mentees with independent career development awards). 2) Provide structured career development through
mentored multidisciplinary research experiences, retreats, and career development seminars, as well as formal
didactic programs on basic and clinical research skills through the Clinical and Translational Science Institute
(CTSI) training programs. 3) Promote translational research and cross-training between clinical and basic
science investigators. 4) Coordinate access to a large group of experienced mentors. 5) Offer Scholars a two-
semester grant writing course that enables them to emerge with a polished career development award
proposal or “R” application that is suitable for submission. 6) Provide financial support for trainees through
stipends, pilot funds, and additional resources. 7) Provide individualized advice, feedback, career guidance,
and support to trainees and mentors. 8) Oversee the promotion, recruitment, selection, monitoring, and
evaluation of trainees and the program. 9) Collaborate with other cores and units within and outside the
institution for OAIC related themes. 10) Enrich Scholar training through participation in the OAIC Coordinating
Center's Visiting Scholar Program.
 Innovations for this cycle include: (1) a mentoring team for each Scholar that now includes both basic
and clinical researchers, designed to promote team science; (2) a “cross-training” curriculum for all Scholars in
clinical, translational, and basic science; (3) expansion of our Leadership Skills Training curriculum which
focuses on skills critical for emerging leaders; (4) improvement of OAIC mentoring skills through participation in
the NIH/CTSI-funded mentor skills program; and (5) participation in the new OAIC Coordinating Center's

6. Establish new independent REC and PESC oversight committees as requested by NIA.
7. Provide research oversight and safety monitoring for all OAIC human studies and help establish a Data
 and Safety Monitoring Board as necessary.
8. Sponsor a Research Seminar series, an Annual Retreat, Workgroups, a publication/communication
 committee, formal grant reviews, and new partnership initiatives.
9. Increase basic and translational research partnerships.
10. Provide administrative support and manage financial records for the OAIC as a whole.
11. Collaborate outside the Institution on OAIC related themes.
For this renewal, we implement several innovative programmatic changes. First, we add a new discrete
Resource Core, the Biology of Mobility and Aging Core (BMAC), derived from new and existing Basic Science
laboratories. Second, we add TEAM Science sessions to incorporate complementary basic and clinical
presentations and foster cross talk and collaboration. Third, a new telemedicine workgroup will pursue novel
opportunities for distance technology clinical research. Fourth, we extend our Visiting Professorships to
National thought leaders to increase attention to basic and translational Biology of Mobility and Aging. Fifth, we
will expand our dissemination efforts by 1) supporting a Dissemination Champion(community leader) and 2)
implement innovative “Story Booth” podcasts of OAIC participants sharing their clinical research experience."
10890731,"CPOC Summary/Abstract
The Clinical and Population Outcomes Core (CPOC) promotes a multidisciplinary approach to the assessment
of mobility and balance in OAIC clinical research through three key functions: (i) engaging older adults from
the community and long-term care settings as participants (in a series of large-scale registries) and partners
(through our Community Advisory Board) in research; (ii) providing training to investigators on appropriate
contact, screening, and consent strategies for research with older populations; and (iii) sharing expertise in
clinical assessment methodology (though a standardized library of assessment tools and study datasets) for
mobility, balance, and falls. The Core has been highly productive. Over the past 5 years CPOC has provided
support for 13 pilot or developmental projects, including consultation for 5 REC trainee pilots. Our support has
contributed to 8 newly funded grants (4 R01, 2 K01, 1 VA, 1 foundation) and has supported over 40
independently funded external projects. CPOC support has resulted in over 200 publications. CPOC
successfully launched the Platinum Long-Term Care Registry (seniors residing in assisted living and skilled
nursing facilities who have consented to research contact), with over 40 facility recruitment sites and over 400
residents enrolled. The CPOC Community Registry includes over 2500 older participants and has served as a
key recruitment source for 60 research studies. The CPOC SMART Center provides clinical research space
and serves as a testbed for a number of innovative devices and experimental paradigms designed by the
Integrative Systems Core, and our novel mobile laboratory utilizes noninvasive, portable technology to
examine mobility, balance, and physical activity in the field. In the renewal we will 1) increase recruitment and
researcher use of the Pepper Long-Term Care-Platinum and Community Registries, with streamlined web
access and oversight; 2) expand dissemination-implementation efforts through a partnership with our PCORI-
funded patient-oriented “Story Booth” program; 3) expand our mobile laboratory by adding additional
investigative tools, including actigraphy and ultrasound assessment of muscle and fat; and 4) implement a
developmental pilot, “Automated Neighborhood Walkability Audits by Machine Learning,” with colleagues in
our School of Engineering to develop computer-based, automated methods for auditing Google Street View
images for environmental features most relevant to mobility and falls in older adults. The proposed
developmental pilot will provide important information on external physical environments, a neglected domain
for falls risk. Leadership of the Core continues with Dr. Steven M. Albert and now includes Dr. Andrea Rosso,
who will co-direct and also lead our developmental project."
10890734,"ISC Summary/Abstract: The fundamental concepts underlying the Integrative Systems Core (ISC) are that
age-related alterations in mobility and balance develop subtly, prior to overt clinical problems, and are due to
multi-system interacting changes. The ISC provides state-of-the-art multidisciplinary expertise on age-related
change in mobility via collaborating laboratories encompassing 1) whole-body movement and balance, 2)
nervous system structure, function and energetics, and 3) cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal structure,
function and energetics. These laboratories collaborate with each other, as well as with other Pepper Cores
and Centers to bring simultaneous multisystem evaluation to research studies. During the current cycle, the
ISC supported 11 pilot exploratory studies (PES), 2 developmental projects (DPs), 23 REC trainees (7
scholars), and over 50 externally funded projects (EP), virtually all of which involved collaboration with other
Pepper Cores, other Pitt Centers, other Pepper Centers, and other institutions.
 In this renewal, the ISC will support 3 PES and 2 DPs in collaboration with other Pepper Cores. The ISC
will add extensive and innovative new resources for: 1) non-invasive in-vivo assessment of mitochondrial
function in heart, brain and muscle; 2) cardio-pulmonary physiological changes during exercise; 3) muscle
structure, innervation and energetics including spinal cord physiology; 4) a validated set of tasks for detailed
assessment of dual tasks and the cognitive-motor interface; and 5) wearable devices to measure cerebral and
muscle activity while walking (NIRS and high-density EMG), as well as in-place spatial navigation via combined
accelerometry-GPS systems outside the laboratory. Our specific aims are:
 1. Provide cutting-edge resources and expertise to concurrently study both whole-body as well as multiple
 systems and physiologic mechanisms affecting mobility and balance during aging, both during study
 planning as well as during implementation and analysis.
 2. Develop and test novel techniques and approaches to address gaps and needs for multi-system
 evaluation of mobility and balance.
 3. Support the training mission of the OAIC by educating and supporting the work of Pepper trainees
 through workgroups, seminars, “field trips” and active involvement in trainee research projects.
 4. Collaborate with other Cores and Centers in and outside Pitt on OAIC-related activities.
 5. Continuously monitor, evaluate and communicate about Core activities both within and among Core
 laboratory leaders, as well as with other Pepper Cores, Pepper leadership and NIA.
In summary, the ISC has formed the heart of the Pittsburgh Pepper since its inception and has been
instrumental in creating and disseminating new knowledge and new approaches to prevent and treat age-
related problems with mobility and balance."
10890736,"DMAIC Project Summary/Abstract: The overarching goal of the Data Management, Analysis and Informatics
Core (DMAIC) is to ensure data and analytic integrity, transparency and reproducibility by continuing to serve
as a central source of methodological expertise and a service provider to the researchers of the Pittsburgh
Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC). Methodological expertise is most beneficial when provided by
a team such as DMAIC familiar with the balance and mobility in aging theme, specialized measures and
methods of the OAIC. Our specific aims are to:
1. Meet data management requirements of Pittsburgh OAIC PESC, REC, developmental and external projects.
2. Support quantitative and facilitate qualitative analysis needs of Pittsburgh OAIC projects.
3. Provide informatics expertise to Pittsburgh OAIC projects.
4. Support the training mission of the Pittsburgh OAIC with Pepper Scholars and other trainees.
5. Develop new techniques, as wells as novel application of existing methods to address OAIC-related unmet
 needs and methodological challenges.
6. Collaborate with other Cores and units within and outside the institution on OAIC theme-related activities.
For OAIC pilot and developmental projects, we will fully support the data management and quantitative
analysis needs in addition to facilitating access to qualitative and other specialized analytic resources and
informatics expertise. We will provide workshops and individualized training for OAIC trainees as well as
innovatively involving graduate student researchers in core activities to expand our education mission. We
innovate by developing new techniques and novel applications of existing methods to address OAIC theme-
related methodological challenges. Our proposed Developmental Project on dynamic prediction modeling is a
novel approach to updating prognoses with new information. We will collaborate with others within and outside
the institution on OAIC theme-related activities to share and learn from a broader community of colleagues.
 During the past cycle 2015-2020, the DMAIC provided data management/statistical support to 16 OAIC pilot
and developmental projects in addition to external proposals. This extensive support generated findings which
were disseminated in over 109 peer reviewed publications and used to obtain an additional $11 million of
funding to continue research focused on improving the mobility of older adults.
 We build on a strong track record of 15 years with stable leadership providing data management and
analytical infrastructure, methodological innovation, and supporting the training mission; and will continue to
provide these services to the OAIC. We innovatively expanded our services to include machine learning and
computational biology to new OAIC priorities and the changing landscape of informatics and big data; access
to real-world clinical data; participation in a new telemedicine workgroup; and training on data sharing."
10890738,"BMAC Summary/Abstract:
The impact of basic science is increasingly influencing medical practice. This trend will likely only accelerate in
the near future, as techniques including gene therapy and CRISPR-based gene editing begin to impact clinical
care. The continued progress of this approach, and its application to geriatrics, requires a seamless integration
of basic, translational and clinical researchers. In order to facilitate this integration, we are proposing creation
of a new Core for this application. Entitled, the Biology of Mobility and Aging Core (BMAC), this Core will foster
the work of clinicians and basic scientists by linking the tenets of `geroscience' to advance new treatments to
improve balance and mobility. These include the identification of new biomarkers, elucidating new molecular
targets for drug therapy, using in-depth animal phenotyping to assess new biologic agents, and generally
promoting back and forth translation between human and basic studies. This work will ultimately help catalyze
the ability of our Pepper Center to conduct first-in-human clinical trials of novel agents to preserve mobility and
balance in late life. Excitingly, some of these efforts have already been initiated. By supporting pilot,
developmental, and external projects, the BMAC also enhances the rigor, strength and quality of our OAIC.
Moreover, BMAC resources that include state-of-the-art instrumentation and methodologies, a range of
seminars and didactics, as well as laboratory visits, unique genetic reagents and in-depth consultations, will
become widely and easily accessible to Pepper investigators. The BMAC includes internationally renowned
faculty members who constitute a group of senior investigators with knowledge spanning neuroscience, muscle
physiology, pre-clinical animal phenotyping, metabolomics, translational pharmacology, the microbiome and
high throughput genetic and chemical screening platforms. All BMAC faculty operate state-of-the-art and well-
funded laboratories in areas relevant to the biology of mobility and aging."
10888537,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Rare diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adults that frequently have a
genetic etiology, but specific treatments are only beginning to emerge. Among more than 10,000 individual rare
diseases, less than 5% have a specific treatment, in part because the affected protein is understudied. FOXP1
is an understudied forkhead box transcription factor that urgently needs investigation to reveal its impact to
human health as a therapeutic target. We have identified prominent cerebellar hypoplasia in patients with
heterozygous variants in the FOXP1 gene, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms driving this abnormality
have not been studied. In Aim 1, we will characterize FOXP1 cell type and spatiotemporal expression and
visualize microvascular architecture in human cerebellar development using high resolution optical imaging. In
Aim 2, we will construct FOXP1 cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks using single cell genomic assays.
The results from these experiments will provide foundational data for investigating pathological development of
FOXP1 syndrome."

10865612,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This K23 career development award proposal addresses the underutilization of pain psychology, an effective
frontline treatment, among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals suffering from chronic low back pain
(cLBP). The primary investigator (PI) seeks to bridge this healthcare disparity through a three-fold research
strategy. Aim 1 proposes to investigate the impact of socioeconomic status on pain psychology utilization via a
retrospective cohort analysis. The PI will leverage data from a large, PCORI-funded trial across healthcare
systems in Baltimore, MD, and Salt Lake City, UT. Aim 2 aims to identify the barriers and facilitators to pain
psychology utilization through qualitative interviews with psychologists and patients from a low socioeconomic
stratum. This step will guide the development of the Empowering Pain Psychology Access and Collaboration
(EPPAC) intervention, a patient-centered approach using shared decision-making and motivational
interviewing. Aim 3 pilots the EPPAC intervention among socioeconomically disadvantaged patients with cLBP,
evaluating its acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy compared to a usual care control group.
This K23 career development award proposal is spearheaded by Dr. Fenan Rassu, an Assistant Professor in
the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and a clinical researcher at The Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine who is determined to address underutilization of evidence-based pain
psychology treatments among socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals with cLBP.
The proposed career development plan includes didactic and research training activities that will substantially
build his skills and expertise. These will include training in health services research, stakeholder engaged
research and qualitative research methods, and implementation science . This training will occur in the rich
training environment of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, including the Bloomberg School of Public
Health. He will receive guidance from his outstanding team of mentors and advisors with expertise in the
methodologies needed for conducting the planned research, and a track record of mentoring and funding. The
award and protected time will allow Dr. Rassu to build an independent NIH-funded research career and
become a leader in improving access and engagement in evidence-based treatments for vulnerable
populations living with pain."
10866292,"Project Summary
Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) are common conditions that affect ~25% of U.S. women. PFDs are morbid, with
more than 50% of afflicted patients rating them as “worse than death”. As vaginal delivery is the greatest
epidemiologic risk factor for PFDs—likely due to the pelvic floor muscle (PFM) dysfunction it often incites—
greater understanding of vaginal delivery biomechanics and birth injury is needed. But in order to accurately
study the mechanical behavior of the PFMs during childbirth, their structure, function, and integrity just before
childbirth must be known. Acquiring this knowledge is not trivial given the degree of pregnancy-induced
remodeling that soft tissues undergo during gestation. Thus, this study aims to implement multiscale
experimental and computational methods to characterize and simulate pregnancy-induced remodeling of PFMs.
Phase 1 (K99) is the experimental arm of this proposal. In Aim 1 cell culture of primary 1) skeletal muscle stem
cells and 2) fibro-adipogenic progenitors isolated from female rat PFMs will be used to determine the impact of
sex hormones (e.g., estrogen) and mechanical stretch on resulting 1) myotube growth and 2) collagen secretion
by fibroblasts, respectively. After the cultured cells have differentiated, myotube size, fusion index, and the
amount of collagen secreted (quantified as a percentage of the sampled area) will be quantified via bright field
(myotubes) and fluorescence (fibroblasts) microscopy. These will serve as proxies for muscle fiber growth and
collagen deposition in vivo, allowing for the determination of the effect of sex hormones and mechanical stretch
on the contractile and extracellular matrix (ECM) components of the PFMs. Meanwhile, Aim 2 will define changes
in whole PFM active and passive mechanics across the nonpregnant—postpartum continuum. Whole PFMs will
be harvested from rats at various stages throughout the pregnancy and postpartum, and then ex vivo active and
passive mechanical testing will be performed. This will establish changes in force generating capacity (active
properties) and load bearing capacity (passive properties) across the continuum, revealing how the function of
both the contractile (active) and ECM (passive) components of PFMs are altered by pregnancy and childbirth.
Phase 2 (R00) is the computational arm of this proposal. Aim 3 will generate intracellular signaling network (cell
level) and finite element (whole muscle level) models, calibrate and validate those models using literature and
Phase 1 data, and then couple those models; resulting in a multiscale computational model of pregnancy-
induced PFM remodeling. This coupled model will consider sex hormone levels, the degree of mechanical stretch
acting on myofibers and the ECM, myofiber growth, and collagen deposition collectively while simulating their
impact on whole PFM active and passive function. Together, these aims will characterize the multiscale
(intracellular and whole muscle) mechanisms of pregnancy-induced PFM remodeling and identify the most
influential sex hormones and mechanical properties driving these adaptations; thus, promoting translational
studies evaluating the PFMs' ability to withstand vaginal birth and avoid injury."
10868465,"Project Summary
Glaucoma is a clinically and genetically complex disease that is the leading cause of irreversible blindness
worldwide. The disease exhibits both complex and Mendelian inheritance with complex disease more common
in adult populations and Mendelian forms more common in children and young adults. While recent genome-
wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >100 risk loci for adult-onset disease, only 10 genes are
known to cause early-onset glaucoma (EOG, glaucoma developing before age 40), and few studies have
targeted this severely affected population. The current set of EOG genes can explain only 20% of cases,
leaving most affected individuals without a molecular diagnosis. Treatment options for EOG cases are limited
and these patients are most likely to become blind during their lifetimes. The overall goal of this proposal is to
discover novel EOG causal genes that will provide opportunities for gene-based screening and diagnostic
tests, allowing for improved risk prediction and genetic counseling, as well as new, and potentially curative,
therapeutic targets. The current lack of EOG genes creates a pressing need to study genetic variation across
the full length of the genome in these severely affected glaucoma cases. Using whole genome sequencing
(WGS) we will create a comprehensive set of variants for genomic analyses for two large collections of
clinically well-characterized early-onset glaucoma probands and families through a collaboration between the
USA and Australia. We will accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Comprehensively identify all genetic
variants in at least 1000 EOG probands and selected family members using high quality WGS data and robust
variant calling and annotation pipelines; 2) Discover novel highly penetrant genetic variants in novel causative
genes in EOG patients and families; and 3) Examine oliogogenic inheritance and assess relationships of EOG
genes with adult-onset disease (primary open angle glaucoma)."
10864626,"Patients with fatty liver disease have a high risk of progressing to liver cancer, including
hepatocellular carcinoma. At the molecular level, two major changes occur in hepatocytes caused
by the accumulation of fat in the liver: a switch in energy metabolism, based on mitochondria
disfunction and altered TCA cycle flux, and abnormal epigenetic activities, including higher
expression of chromatin modifying enzymes. However, the connection between aberrant
hepatocyte metabolism and aberrant epigenetic activities in the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression
has not been defined, nor therapeutically exploited to combat the onset of HCC. We propose to
do so in this application. We will focus on establishing metabolic biomarkers and targeting
metabolic/epigenetic co-vulnerabilities during HCC development. The rationale for this approach
is that oncogenic epigenetic Jumonji histone demethylase enzymes, chromatin modifiers
upregulated in HCC which delete histone methylation marks, use TCA metabolite alpha-
ketoglutarate (2-OG) as a co-substrate for catalysis. Indeed, not only is 2-OG a co-substrate for
these enzymes but succinate and fumarate can compete with 2-OG for binding, and thus act as
inhibitors of Jumonji activity. Current Jumonji inhibitors we and other have developed work by
competing with 2-OG. This presents an enormous opportunity in the context of fatty liver disease
progressing to HCC, since this progression thus establishes new metabolic vulnerabilities with
targetable epigenetic consequences. We hypothesize that altered cellular TCA metabolism in fatty
livers triggers aberrant Jumonji KDM histone demethylase levels/activity before HCC onset and
that this pro-oncogenic event is targetable through small molecule inhibitors of Jumonji enzymes
that compete with 2-OG, to prevent HCC development. We will test this hypothesis by measuring
2-OG related metabolites in the liver and the blood during the NAFLD to HCC progression to
identify metabolits that correlate with response to Jumonji inhibition (aim 1, biomarker focus)
and by evaluating the efficacy of three available Jumonji inhibitors to prevent or slow down the
progression of NAFLD to NASH and to HCC in vivo (aim 2, therapeutic focus). We will use
DIAMOND mice as our in vivo model since they recapitulate the human NAFLD, NASH to HCC
continuum faithfully, are well characterized, and spontaneously develop HCC within a year. Our
studies will inform future personalized medicine applications in the prevention and treatment of
hepatocellular carcinoma, making this proposal highly clinically relevant, timely, and potentially
transformational."
10867872,"ABSTRACT: OUTREACH, RECRUITMENT, AND ENGAGEMENT CORE
 The Outreach, Recruitment, and Engagement (ORE) Core will coordinate with each of the UAB ADRC
Cores to address Deep South disparities in dementia by fostering community education and research on
Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD). In our exploratory phase, we have utilized a community-
based participatory research model and multiple modalities to initiate community partnerships, build trust,
disseminate information, and facilitate recruitment and retention of cognitively normal and cognitively impaired
individuals representing the Deep South, with an emphasis on engagement with Black/African American
(B/AA) community residents. This has enabled us to recruit a cohort of individuals that is 47% B/AA. Alabama
citizens in the Deep South have a history of social and economic inequities, adverse social determinants of
health, as well as high rates of co-occurring medical problems, which contribute to the region's heightened
incidence of dementia. We will continue and expand our targeted recruitment of individuals affected by these
factors, particularly B/AA residents, for participation in ADRC activities and research. We will grow our Registry
of individuals potentially interested in research. We will train and deploy teams of Community Health Advisors
(CHA) to amplify our reach, with measures built in to evaluate the effectiveness of our programs. We will work
with our Community Advisory Board (CAB) and Participant Advisory Board (PAB) to guide the design and
refinement of our study approaches. We have developed multifaceted strategies to promote participant
retention and ongoing engagement with the ADRC, which includes a robust and culturally appropriate return of
results program. We will publish on recruitment science and share strategies that have been beneficial for our
Center. The ORE Core’s operations are integrally linked to interactions with the Center’s other Cores."
10867485,"The overarching goal of the study is to obtain the necessary training to better understand the neural
mechanisms underlying the rewarding, reinforcing properties of cannabis. The proposed study aims to
characterize individual differences in subjective reward response and neural reward processing to delta-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis, among healthy young adults who
may be at-risk for problematic cannabis use. Individuals differ in their subjective response to THC on self-
report measures of drug reward. Few studies have examined how THC impacts brain reward circuitry in
humans. As cannabis becomes increasingly available in the U.S. there is serious concern about negative
outcomes related to problematic use. To minimize the adverse impact of increased use, it is critical to identify
risk factors that make certain individuals more vulnerable to problematic cannabis use. One factor implicated in
risk for drug use and abuse is the sensitivity and function of brain reward circuitry, especially in response to
early drug use. Preliminary evidence indicates that THC activates brain reward circuitry, especially the ventral
striatum (VS) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which might be linked to individual differences in rewarding
effects of cannabis. To date, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying the rewarding, reinforcing
properties of cannabis and how these may contribute to individual differences in subjective reward response to
THC, a marker of drug abuse liability. In the current K23 application, I propose to examine the affective reward
mechanisms that identify individuals who may be at risk for cannabis use and abuse. In the proposed study, 80
healthy young adults (aged 18-25), who report occasional cannabis use (≥10x in life, but use ≤1x a week), will
undergo two double-blind, within-subject, drug-challenge visits (placebo, 7.5mg THC). During these visits,
participants will complete neural measures of reward during electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as well as subjective measures of drug reward. By combining neural and
behavioral measures with an acute drug administration design, I will (a) determine if THC enhances brain
reward reactivity; (b) examine if THC-induced alterations in neural reward reactivity are related to subjective
reward response; and (c) determine if “baseline” neural reward reactivity (i.e., during the placebo session)
predicts subjective reward response to THC. This study concurrently provides an excellent opportunity to
receive mentor-directed, hands-on training in several key areas necessary to refine my knowledge and skill-
sets. Specifically, the proposed training plan will focus on four new domains: 1) EEG, 2) Addiction and drug
administration studies, 3) Biostatistics, and 4) Professional development. This study, coupled with completion
of the training goals will launch my independent career in the translational affective neuroscience of drug
abuse and will lay the foundation for future, high impact R01 studies focused on behavioral-brain risk
phenotypes and intervention targets for Substance Use Disorders, including Cannabis Use Disorder."
10868673,"Extracellular oligomeric tau (o-tau) and vascular deposition of o-tau has been observed in brains of Alzheimer's
disease (AD) patients. In this project, we propose to examine how the direct interactions of o-tau with the
basolateral side of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs) impact their function, including
oxidative stress, inflammation, adhesion molecule expression, membrane tether adhesion, and transendothelial
migration of monocytes through activations of NADPH oxidase, cytosolic phospholipase A2
and NFκB. As retina is a part of the brain, we also employ the non-invasive optical coherence tomography
(OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) (i.e. OCT/OCTA) to study microvascular characteristics and
neurodegeneration, as quantified by the ganglion layer thickness (GLT), and their relations to oligomeric
amyloid-β (oAβ), and o-tau contents in retinas of Tg AD mouse models for studying the influences of human tau
and amyloid pathology including APPswe/PSEN1dE9 and 3xTg AD mice. This project will fill the research gap
between extracellular o-tau and neurovascular abnormalities in AD by providing information regarding adhesion
mechanical responses to o-tau in HBMECs, and changes in retinal vessel network characteristics and GLT in
relations to Aβ and o-tau, and ultimately provide insights into therapeutic strategies for AD treatment by
regulating tau's effects."
10865439,"Background: Nearly one-third of all colonoscopies are performed for surveillance (i.e., follow-up) of previously
identified colorectal neoplasia. Despite existing evidence-based guidelines for colorectal neoplasia
surveillance, data show overuse of surveillance colonoscopy for low-risk and underuse for high-risk colorectal
neoplasia, even in integrated health systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Overuse of
surveillance for low-risk neoplasia leads to exposure to unnecessary harms, wastes limited resources, and
creates barriers to access. Underuse of surveillance for high-risk neoplasia leads to increased risk for future
colorectal cancer (CRC). There is a critical need to address the imbalance of surveillance to optimize allocation
of limited colonoscopy resources in the VHA. Little is known about factors related to under- and overuse of
surveillance in this setting. Efforts to develop targeted interventions that address both underuse for high-risk
Veterans (who benefit most from surveillance) and overuse for low-risk Veterans (who benefit little or not at all)
are needed as the demand for colonoscopy far exceeds the capacity in the VHA.
Significance/Impact: Current efforts to improve access to colonoscopy resources are primarily focused on
shifting screening to non-invasive, stool-based tests. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop and
pilot test an intervention to optimize surveillance by improving access to, and efficiency of, this costly and
limited resource at the VHA. Through this work, we seek to ensure delivery of high-quality, equitable, and
timely patient-centered care.
Innovation: Existing guidelines for surveillance intervals by themselves are not effective in the real-world. The
proposed work will shift the current paradigm for optimizing colorectal neoplasia surveillance by studying and
addressing factors at the patient-, provider-, and system-levels to identify targets for intervention. Cross-cutting
methods, using a theory-based, structured approach, will be used by an interdisciplinary team of experts to
improve colonoscopy resource use and access in the VHA.
Specific Aims: We will first characterize patient-, provider-, and facility-level factors associated with colorectal
neoplasia surveillance adherence and non-adherence (Aim 1). We will then conduct a formative evaluation of
barriers and facilitators from the perspectives of patients, providers, and staff to design an intervention that
optimizes surveillance use (Aim 2). And finally, we will pilot test the intervention to determine feasibility and
acceptability (Aim 3).
Methodology: In Aim 1, we will use national VHA data to identify Veterans who are between the ages of 50
and 75 years and have had either low- or high-risk colorectal neoplasia on their colonoscopies. We will then
characterize patient-, provider-, and system level factors associated with surveillance adherence and non-
adherence using a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model. In Aim 2, we will use qualitative methods
to conduct a formative evaluation of barriers and facilitators for patients, providers, and staff while using
Intervention Mapping as the framework to design our intervention. In Aim 3, we will pilot test our intervention to
determine feasibility and acceptability using a pre-post mixed methods approach.
Next Steps/Implementation: Findings from this project will directly inform an IIR proposal comprising a multi-
site Hybrid Type 1 randomized effectiveness-implementation trial of the intervention that we developed and
pilot tested. Effectiveness will be measured as adherence to surveillance for colorectal neoplasia. While this
proposal will focus on development of an intervention to improve underuse of surveillance for high-risk

10868463,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Experiments in this proposal address how sensory signals trigger effective action. We focus on light-driven
modulation of the mammalian pupil, which merits study for its own sake and offers a tractable system for
understanding the steps that lead from photon capture to motor output. The pupillary light response appears
simple but is critical for vision; a large pupil increases photon collection to support sight in dim light, while a
small pupil reduces optical aberration to sharpen visual acuity in bright light. The pupil mediates this trade-off
across variations in environmental light intensity that span orders of magnitude, and does so in a manner that
appears optimal. We propose to investigate how features of molecules, cells, and circuits in the retina meet the
requirements of pupil control. Our overarching hypothesis is that these mechanisms are well-tuned, to the
extent that their features propagate through brain circuits to manifest overtly in the pupil. To test this
hypothesis, we will apply in vivo approaches to mice, analyzing retinal signals within the brain’s first relay for
pupillary control while simultaneously monitoring the pupil. We will draw on our knowledge of retinal
mechanisms to examine their actions in these areas, using quantitative and systematic experiments. We will
examine mice that have normal visual pathways or are engineered to lack candidate mechanisms. Moreover,
we will employ ex vivo methods to clarify select mechanisms, such that we can analyze their in vivo influences
with greater precision. Taken together, these experiments will uncover origins of the pupillary light response,
inform the question of how sensory information affects motor action, and provide insight into the steps by which
mechanisms at lower levels of biological organization influence the whole animal."

The human genome encodes more than 1,600 transcription factors (TFs), along with additional
cofactors, chromatin regulators, and structural proteins that collectively execute the regulatory
instructions encoded within the nuclear DNA. Dysfunctions of these proteins, collectively known
as Gene Regulatory Proteins (GRPs), are known to drive multiple diseases such as cancer,
inflammation-related, and neurological conditions. In cancer, these proteins are frequently
rearranged and fused to create new proteins which cause the initiation and progression of
various types of leukemia, sarcoma and other tumors. Despite the importance of these proteins,
GRPs have been considered undruggable due to challenges in modeling their activity in vitro.
We have solved these shortcomings by implementing an in-cell functional proteomics drug
discovery platform that quantifies the effects of small-molecules on the abundance of GRPs
bound to the genome in a diversity of cell and tissue types. The platform is based on Chromatin
Extraction by Salt Separation, coupled to Data Independent Analysis mass spectrometry
(ChESS-DIA), which was recently reported. In this proposal, we will apply this technology for
drug development of oncogenic fusion proteins. First, we will use Mixed Lineage Leukemia
(MLL) rearranged leukemia to perform technology development of the oncogenic fusion protein
proteomics strategy. MLL rearrangements are found in a subset of AML and ALL patients,
commonly in children, and remain challenging to treat with existing therapeutic options. Several
drug candidates for MLL-rearranged leukemia are currently in clinical trials, and these will be
used to validate the accuracy of the ChESS-DIA assay for reporting the ability of MLL-targeting
compounds to disrupt the MLL complex in live cells. With a validated MLL ChESS-DIA assay,
we will then conduct a pilot screen to prove the assay’s utility in a screening setting, using the
National Cancer Institute’s Mechanistic Diversity compound set supplemented with known
inhibitors of the MLL complex. These compounds contain a diverse array of bioactivities, many
of which act through unknown mechanisms. This provides an opportunity to find new
compounds capable of disrupting the MLL complex. Lastly, we will use the roadmap developed
for MLL to develop ChESS-DIA assays for many of the common oncogenic fusions, then
develop a method to unify these assays together in a single, unified, in-cell assay for oncogenic
fusion proteins."

 Regeneration of osteoarthritic cartilage has been a largely unmet biomedical challenge for the past fifty years.
Numerous strategies are being employed to harness the synthetic power of cells to generate new extracellular
matrix in the hope of reversing the pain and dysfunction associated with osteoarthritis (OA), in keeping with the
mission of the NIH to seek fundamental knowledge about of living systems and the application of that knowledge
to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Of particular interest is the emerging role of
the pericellular matrix (PCM), the region immediately surrounding the chondrocyte, due to its demonstrated
importance in mediating chondrocyte mechanotransduction in both healthy and OA cartilage. In OA,
degeneration of the PCM is one leading event of disease initiation, contributing to disrupted chondrocyte
mechanotransduction and irreversible cartilage degradation. Thus, if we can engineer the properties of the PCM,
there is a potential for us to modulate chondrocyte mechanosensitive activities, and in turn, to promote cartilage
regeneration and/or to attenuate osteoarthritic cartilage degeneration. Our biomimetic proteoglycans (BPGs)
have the niche effect of engineering cartilage PCM. We chemically end-attached 7-8 chondroitin sulfate
glycosaminoglycans (CS-GAGs) to a poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) core (Mw ~10 kDa), resulting in a biomimetic
proteoglycan, BPG10, with a bottle-brush nanostructure mimicking the native aggrecan. When infiltrated into
bovine cartilage explants in vitro or intra-articularly injected into rabbit knees in vivo, BPG10 was preferentially
localized in the PCM. This localization led to a significant increase in the micromodulus of the PCM in vitro, and
in turn, significantly enhanced chondrocyte intracellular calcium signaling activities. The role of BPG10 is also
relevant to OA. When infiltrated into human OA cartilage, BPG10 was also localized in the PCM, and enhanced
the local PCM modulus, indicating a potential for restoring degenerative PCM and rescuing disrupted
chondrocyte mechanosensitive activities. Given that the synthetic PAA core is not susceptible to physiologic
enzymes, as are natural proteoglycans, BPG10 could also be resistant to chondrocyte catabolism in vivo. Our
central hypothesis is that biomimetic proteoglycans will molecularly engineer the PCM, increasing the
micromodulus of the PCM through interactions with native PCM molecules, thus promoting chondrocyte
mechanotransduction and attenuating OA-induced cartilage degeneration. To test this hypothesis, we will: (1)
study the physical interactions between BPG10 and cartilage matrix biomolecules; (2) determine if BPG10
augments the neo-PCM of chondrocytes in 3D culture and the PCM of degrading cartilage explants, and thus,
modulates chondrocyte mechanotransduction and metabolic activities and (3) test if intra-articular administration
of BPG10 attenuates the progression of OA in rabbits in vivo. In these studies, individual CS-GAGs will be tested
as a control to examine the role of BPG10's unique structure."
10869997,"Epidemiological evidence shows that paternal preconception exposures to environmental perturbations, such as
stress and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), are associated with changes in reproductive outcomes,
offspring gestational development, and ultimately, offspring health and disease. Studies in animal models have
implicated the germ cell transfer of small non-coding RNA (sncRNA), including miRNA and tRNA fragments, in
programming these effects. We recently published our foundational work which allowed us to construct a scaffold
to initially assess the composition of, and dynamic changes in, sncRNA (including miRNA, piRNA, and tRNA) in
sperm samples from a young, healthy and relatively homogenous student cohort. This repeated-measures
design allowed us to define in humans the between- and within-participant variation in the most abundant sperm
sncRNA content over time. In addition, by utilizing complex modeling of the relationships between individual
sncRNA and perceived stress states preceding each sperm donation, we were able to identify specific sncRNA
responsive to the dynamics of prior stress. Ultimately, our model identified highly expressed miRNA common to
all subjects, including miR-34c-5p and miR-16-5p, and three miRNA, including miR-181a-5p and let-7f-5p, that
fit strict criterion for dynamic expression within- and between-subjects, and were associated with prior perceived
stress. To test our hypothesis, the following Aims are provided: 1) in Aim 1 to test our current sperm sncRNA
framework within a larger and more representative cohort of students, we will examine the outcomes identified
in our first study, including perceived stress across 6 months of sperm collection and test the sncRNA populations
for expression, variance, and responses to prior perceived stress; 2) in Aim 2 to test the additional influence of
subject ACEs in our model, as one of the major influences on adult current stress perception, for effects on
sperm sncRNA in low vs high ACE-exposed males; and 3) in Aim 3 to substantiate a causal importance of the
sperm-associated miRNA previously identified in our model that were consistently expressed at high levels
across subjects, or dynamically expressed in association with prior perceived stress within- and between-
subjects. We will utilize mouse zygotic microinjection of miRNA inhibitors to specifically reduce levels of normally
highly expressed sperm-associated miRNA, miR-22-3p, miR-16-5p, and miR-34c-5p, and miRNA mimics to
specifically elevate individual miRNA normally lowly expressed, but dynamically environmentally responsive,
miR-181a-5p, miR-4454, or let-7f-5p. Outcomes will examine the impact of these microinjections on in vitro
preimplantation embryonic development, in vivo embryonic and fetal development, and transcriptomic changes
by RNA sequencing of E7.5 embryos."

Potassium channel proteins are involved in many aspects of human physiology. Small
conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (SK channels) are voltage-independent and
widely expressed in excitable cells. Our laboratory determined that expression of kcnn1, which
encodes the SK1 channel, is upregulated after spinal cord injury in zebrafish. Our preliminary data
using a potassium channel inhibitor, 4-aminopyridine, demonstrates that inhibition enhances
swim recovery in zebrafish suggesting modulation of SK channels may be potentially useful as a
therapeutic approach for SCI. The broad, long-term objective of the project is to determine the
role of SK1 in recovery from spinal cord injury (SCI). To achieve this goal, we will first construct
knockout and transgenic zebrafish for both paralogs of the SK1 channel. We will determine
whether these lines properly develop a spinal cord and use optogenetic techniques to
spatiotemporally control kcnn1 expression after SCI. Second, we will use pharmacological
approaches to determine how modulation of SK channels mediates functional recovery after SCI.
These studies will clarify the role of SK channels and specifically SK1 in recovery from SCI. We
expect that the developed lines will be useful to study additional neurological pathologies and
facilitate drug screening to identify new therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases."
10867164,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are monoclonal antibodies used as novel cancer therapeutics to
release intrinsic brakes on T-cell cytotoxicity against tumor cells. While effective to treat many advanced cancers,
ICIs have been reported to cause fulminant myocarditis, pathologic inflammation of the heart—a life-threatening
side effect which can lead to severe arrhythmias, heart failure and death. Although our group and others have
previously found effector CD8+ T-cell clonal expansion and activation in the heart in ICI myocarditis, the
contribution of macrophages with respect to their effect on T-cells has yet to be fully characterized. Using single-
cell RNA-seq data collected as part of my funded K08, I have found an enrichment of CXCL9/10+ macrophages
and CXCR3+ effector CD8+ T-cells in the hearts of MRL/Pdcd-1/- mice with myocarditis. Furthermore, depletion
of macrophages in MRL-Pdcd1-/- mice reduces cardiac CD8+ T-cell infiltration and improves mice survival. Thus,
I hypothesize that recruitment of CXCR3+ T-cells to the heart by CXCL9/CXCL10 expressing macrophages plays
a pathogenic role in ICI myocarditis. To test this, I will utilize a novel pharmacologically treated mouse model of
ICI myocarditis developed in my laboratory, along with high throughput immunophenotyping techniques and in
vitro phenotyping. Aim 1 will investigate the effects of CXCR3+ blockade in our mouse model of ICI myocarditis,
while Aim 2 will investigate the mechanistic effects of blocking CXCR3 and its ligands, CXCL9/10, on
macrophage-mediated T-cell migration and function in an in vitro transwell system. This proposal has been
carefully designed to be fully achievable within the timespan of two years of this proposal, while also having
critical and high impact in the fields of ICI myocarditis and cardiac inflammation. By completing this project, I will
define key pathogenic interactions between adaptive and innate immunity which drive ICI myocarditis, bridging
a major knowledge gap in the role of macrophage effects on T-cell trafficking to the heart in myocarditis. In doing
so, I hope to pave the way for the development of adjuvant therapies for treatment and prevention of ICI
myocarditis. This grant will be instrumental in launching the next phase of my career and prepare me to
successfully compete for R01 funding in the field of cardio-immunology and cardiac inflammation."
10867107,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Despite considerable investments in treatment development for psychological conditions, response rates for
most interventions are quite modest (30-40%)2,3 and the prevalence of mental disorders remains persistently
high.4 A new approach to psychological treatment is clearly needed to move the needle on the disease burden
of mental illness. In the last decade, researchers have identified a manageable number of personality dimensions
(i.e., neuroticism, [low] agreeableness, [low] conscientiousness) that can account for a broad range of
psychopathology and be directly targeted in treatment. The overarching goal of the proposed study is to provide
initial evidence that targeting this limited number of higher-order, personality-based dimensions represents a
more potent, parsimonious, and personalized approach to mental healthcare. The goal of the R61 phase is to
demonstrate target engagement by determining whether discrete therapy modules each designed to directly
address one higher-order personality dimension engage their intended personality targets using multi-modal
assessments of clinician-rated, self-report, and behavioral indicators. A single-case experiment to test
engagement of each higher-order target (n = 10 in each sub-study) will be conducted. Participants will complete
(1) an assessment-only baseline period to establish stability in the targeted personality dimension without
treatment, (2) a 6-session intervention phase targeting the personality mechanism in which they demonstrated
an elevation, and (3) a 4-week assessment-only follow-up. The proposed R33 project will be conducted if at least
one personality-focused therapy module leads to improvement in its corresponding higher-order personality
dimension (i.e., go/no go criteria). The goal of the R33 phase is to demonstrate target validation by determining
whether improvement in higher-order personality targets leads to improvement in downstream clinical endpoints
(i.e., DSM-5 disorder symptoms). Participants (N = 204) will be randomized to receive the personality-based
treatment modules (6-18 sessions) corresponding to their clinically significant elevations, or to a waitlist
condition. We will recruit participants with borderline personality disorder in both study phases as this disorder
is characterized by combinations of high neuroticism, low agreeableness, and low conscientiousness,6,28,58 and
frequently co-occurs with a variety of DSM-5 disorders that are accounted for by different personality domains."
10871697,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality resulting in over
74,000 intensive care unit deaths per year in the United States. Patients often present with rapidly progressive
respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation which is costly and associated with long term
disability. A more refined understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of ARDS may guide more
personalized approaches for prognostication and therapy. The immune “checkpoint” pathway includes the
receptor Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and its ligand Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). The
binding of PD-L1 to PD-1 leads to negative regulation of T cell receptor signaling. PD-1 and PD-L1 have been
associated with defects in immune function in patients with sepsis which is a major risk factor for ARDS. For
example, high PD-1 expression on circulating T cells in patients with sepsis is associated with decreased T cell
interferon-gamma production. However, other studies suggest a role for this pathway in limiting tissue
inflammation. Preliminary data in this proposal shows that patients with ARDS who have prolonged mechanical
ventilation have lower expression of PD-L1 on alveolar macrophages. Further, a serious side effect of
pharmaceutical inhibitors of this pathway termed “checkpoint inhibitors” is immune mediated tissue injury such
as an ARDS-like pneumonitis. Thus the role of this pathway in modulating immune responses may be critical to
our understanding of ARDS. The hypothesis of this study is that immune checkpoint proteins are protective
against poor outcomes in ARDS by limiting tissue injury. This study will also investigate potential mechanisms
of this association through promotion of regulatory T cell responses or limiting inflammatory T cell responses.
Study subjects will be enrolled into a discovery cohort where measurements will be performed using novel high
dimensional mass cytometry to identify expression of these proteins on a single cell basis. A validation cohort
will be recruited externally to confirm these findings. Aim 1 will identify whether cell surface immune checkpoint
protein expression is associated with severity of ARDS, Aim 2 will focus on mechanisms behind the
association in modulating T cell responses, and Aim 3 will identify potential soluble measures of this pathway.
This study aims to identify a biologically relevant immune signature of patients at risk for prolonged mechanical
ventilation and death from ARDS."

Peri-adolescence (ages 10-13) heralds an alarming escalation in pediatric mental health (MH) risk, making this
transitionary time between childhood and adolescence a crucial window for early detection and intervention.
Predictive models built on electronic health record (EHR) data are emerging as practical tools to automate MH
risk stratification in pediatric primary care (PPC); however, to date these models have only modest predictive
value. Common, causal, and modifiable transdiagnostic MH risk factors are needed to improve on EHR models
and pave the way for deployment of preventive care during peri-adolescence. Sleep is one such risk factor: more
than 50% of peri-adolescents experience unhealthy sleep patterns, and sleep problems during peri-adolescence
prospectively predict negative MH outcomes more strongly than at other times in development. Moreover, youth
from minoritized racial and ethnic backgrounds are even more severely impacted by poor sleep health than non-
minoritized youth. However, several barriers have impeded the incorporation of sleep into PPC screening and
risk stratification tools: (1) the heterogeneity of sleep characteristics hinders the differentiation of normative
versus at-risk sleep patterns; (2) the multidimensionality and multimodality of sleep data have led to
inconsistencies regarding which particular features and modalities are needed for screening; and (3) until very
recently, it has been impossible to capture crucial behavioral and physiological measures of habitual sleep in
sufficiently large samples. To address these challenges, we propose the Pediatric Precision Sleep Network:
a multi-site observational study of unprecedented scope and scale, focused on establishing sleep signatures
that predict transdiagnostic MH problems among youth in PPC. Across three sites, we will recruit a diverse
sample of 1,200 youth (10-13yr) with a range of sleep disturbances from PPC settings. We will develop and
validate multidimensional and multimodal sleep signatures (Aim 1) and practical and scalable transdiagnostic
MH risk stratification algorithms (Aim 2). Aims 1-2 will employ a sequential, multimodal machine learning
workflow to establish the extent to which each data modality can incrementally inform signatures and identify
youth at greatest transdiagnostic MH risk. These findings will inform screening, risk stratification, and future
developmentally-appropriate effectiveness and/or experimental therapeutics trials. In Aim 3, we will coordinate
with the IMPACT-MH Data Coordinating Center to efficiently recruit participants, collect data, hone and share
innovative data processing pipelines, and securely transfer data. We are committed to bringing sleep and MH
data to our broader scientific community, along with the accompanying tools and resources needed to process
sleep data efficiently. Our long-term goal is to inform clinical decision-making algorithms for PPC that leverage
sleep to improve MH outcomes and reduce MH disparities at a pivotal developmental window."
10866801,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 A plethora of environmental factors contribute to inter-individual differences in lifespan, yet a significant
genetic component to lifespan variation has been demonstrated in a number of species, including humans.
Characterizing the complex genetic basis of lifespan can provide insights into the mechanisms of aging, the
molecular processes underlying age-related disease risk, and will inform treatments directed at maintaining
health during aging. Direct genetic analysis of lifespan variation in humans is difficult due to the array of
uncontrollable environmental, sociological, and economic factors at play. As a consequence, the genetic
dissection of lifespan in humans has met with mixed success, and only a handful of robust lifespan-associated
variants are known. Given these challenges, non-human model systems – that can be subject to exquisite
environmental control, and allow great flexibility in the design of genetic experiments – remain critical tools for
understanding the biology of aging, and evaluating interventions that can extend life- and healthspan.
 Numerous studies have sought to employ the fruit fly model system, Drosophila melanogaster, to
identify QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) contributing to lifespan and age-related phenotypes. But these studies
have variously suffered from very low power to identify causative variants, poor resolution to localize QTL, are
open to the confounding effects of inbreeding depression, or are experimentally inefficient. We have pioneered
a novel approach that mitigates all these concerns, extending the “extreme QTL” or X-QTL methodology
originally developed by plant breeders and yeast geneticists. We establish a highly-recombinant population
from a set of sequenced strains, rear thousands of outbred diploid individuals in a “common garden”
environment, select and sequence pools of both phenotypically-extreme and control individuals, and identify
QTL via changes in allele frequency between groups. This strategy affords high power to map even very
modest effect QTL, and localizes them to sufficiently small intervals that follow-up, gene-level functional testing
is possible. We have successfully employed this approach to efficiently and powerfully dissect several traits.
 In the present proof-of-concept project we plan to extend our X-QTL method to dissect genetic variation
for lifespan, as well as variation in the response to dietary restriction, a well-described life-extending treatment.
Extensive simulations, along with our empirical work on other traits, suggest this is by far the highest-powered
study to date aimed at identifying longevity genes in Drosophila. Results will impact the aging/lifespan field in
two major ways. First, we can discover novel loci impacting lifespan traits, future characterization of which will
implicate new pathways in the control of variation. Second, we can rigorously characterize differences in the
genetic architecture of lifespan between sexes, and under normal and dietary restricted regimes. If successful,
future elaborations of our fundamental approach could compare the genetic basis lifespan across multiple,
diverse populations, and contrast genetic architecture across a range of lifespan-enhancing treatments."
10866803,"There is a clear need for a vaccine to protect against Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct), a sexually transmitted bacterium causing
an ongoing epidemic associated with reproductive complications. IFNγ-producing CD4 T cells (Th1 & Th1/17 cells) are
required for protection from Ct, which grows and replicates intracellularly, whereas antibodies provide complementary
protection in the presence of IFNγ. Our studies of Chlamydia-infected women and mice have identified Chlamydial Protease
Activity Factor (CPAF) as an immunoprevalent and immunodominant antigen for CD4 T cells and B cells, making it a
strong vaccine candidate. Due to the tolerogenic nature of the female genital tract (FGT) and its lack of secondary lymphoid
tissue, effective induction of protective cell-mediated immunity requires potent adjuvants and mucosal vaccination to
imprint FGT homing or generate resident memory T cells. Our preliminary data indicate that intranasal immunization of
female mice with CPAF conjugated to the TLR9 agonist, CpG, combined with the STING agonist, cyclic-di-AMP (CDA)
in the squalene oil-in-water nanoemulsion AddaS03 (AS03), induces high levels of CPAF-specific CD4 T cells and
protection from infection and pathology. Our novel covalent CPAF-adjuvant conjugation approach enhances antigen-
presenting cell activation through coincident stimulation leading to the potential for dose sparing, reduced toxicity, enhanced
immunogenicity, superior efficacy, and reduced cost of goods. This proposal incorporates a tiered approach to determine if
refinements using innovative new generation TLR7/9 and STING agonists delivered via mucosal routes will enhance
protection via the following specific aims: Aim 1. Complete product development activities of 2nd generation dual
agonist CPAF vaccines. (i) Refine the multi-adjuvant CPAF-CpG+CDA+AS03 vaccine. (ii) Covalently conjugate TLR7,
-9 and STING agonists to CPAF. (iii) Perform in-vivo formulation, toxicology, and preliminary immunogenicity analysis
of candidate vaccines. Aim 2. Evaluate efficacy of the 2nd generation candidates in the female murine challenge model
and immunogenicity in male mice. (i) Determine most efficacious vaccine regimen (candidate and route). (ii) Determine
protection against female infertility and vaccine immunogenicity in males. (iii) Determine duration of humoral and cell-
mediated responses by top candidate, and the contribution of additional boosting. Aim 3. Vaccine process development.
(i) Optimize upstream production, downstream purification, and conjugation of CPAF. (ii) Develop analytical assays and
qualify as suitable for intended use. (iii). Develop formulation and evaluate vaccine stability. (iv) Conduct a non-GLP
toxicology assessment of the final vaccine candidate. Accomplishing these three Specific Aims will result in a Chlamydia
vaccine candidate ready for tech transfer to a qualified CMO, GMP production, and early-phase human clinical trials."
10867947,"Summary
Aging reduces our bodies’ ability to respond to pathogens and vaccines. This is thought to at least in part be due
to impaired functions of adaptive immune cells, which are educated and activated in the lymph nodes. The lymph
nodes are highly organized tissues that coordinate T and B cell (the primary adaptive immune cell) functions
through a complex system of interactions and migration within the tissue. Recent work has shown that T cell
migration and motility is impaired in aging, and that this is correlated to the age of the lymph node tissue
specifically, not the age of the T cells. Interestingly, researchers have demonstrated that during aging
extracellular matrix materials and adipose tissue is accumulated in the lymph nodes. Changes in the composition
of lymph node tissue may result in changes in its biophysical properties like elastic and viscous moduli, as well
as stiffness. An increase in stiff adipose tissue and more fibrous material is likely to increase the tissue’s elastic
modulus and stiffness. Adaptive immune cells have been shown to respond poorly to increases in stiffness and
elastic modulus, as indicated by a reduced ability to migrate in proximity to extracellular matrix materials and
impaired activation in stiff environments. Thus far, no studies have been able to correlate these structure-function
relationships in the lymph node. This is likely due to the difficult nature of extracting biophysical properties like
elastic and loss moduli and stiffness from small tissues, while maintaining tissue integrity, and correlating these
properties to different regions of a tissue. We have pioneered the use of multiple particle tracking (MPT) and
Brillouin microscopy to study lymph node biophysical properties ex vivo via tissue slice cultures. MPT
uses nanoparticle Brownian motion within a tissue to extrapolate its elastic and viscous moduli, pore size, and
viscosity and we have used this method to assess biophysical properties of T and B cell regions of skin and
mesentery lymph nodes. Brillouin microscopy uses interactions between inherent and incident phonons to
calculate a shift that can estimate the uniaxial stress-strain ratio at high frequency, resulting in a heat map of
moduli that are correlated with the tissue’s elastic modulus. Here, we will correlate the biophysical properties
obtained through both of these methods with extracellular matrix and lymph node compartments using
immunofluorescence to provide a complete picture of how the lymph node structure impacts local properties in
the context of aging. We will also assess how specific extracellular matrix components, such as different
collagens, contribute to lymph node biophysical properties. Altogether, our proposed studies will build key
knowledge in our understanding of how lymph node structure affect their biophysical properties and will lay the
foundation for future investigations of structure-function relationships between lymph node biophysical properties
and T and B cell behavior and function in the context of aging."

Cancer cachexia is a complex metabolic syndrome characterized by muscle wasting, weight loss, and decreased
quality of life. Patients with cancer cachexia experience impaired muscle function, reduced treatment tolerance,
and lower survival rates. Despite progress in understanding the condition, its underlying mechanism and high
mortality rate remain unclear. The proposed research aims to investigate the role of platelets in cancer cachexia
development, as they are involved in inflammation and tissue wasting. Preliminary data suggest an association
between elevated platelet counts and the pre-cachexia stage and platelet activation and severe/refractory
cachexia. The proposed study hypothesizes that platelets play a crucial role in the recruitment of immune cells
and the release of pro-cachectic factors, ultimately leading to muscle loss. The research will test the hypothesis
through two aims: depleting platelets at pre-cachectic stages to assess the impact on inflammation and muscle
wasting and examining the effects of activated platelets on muscle wasting in cancer and chemotherapy-induced
cachexia. The project aims to provide novel insights and potential approaches by targeting platelets in cancer
cachexia."

Our prior work showed that Medicaid expansion under the ACA is associated with early detection and improved
survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. However, Medicaid
enrollees with lung cancer still have much worse survival compared with their privately insured counterparts,
which is driven predominantly by their higher risks of being diagnosed at more advanced stages and under-
utilizing stage-appropriate cancer treatment. This suggests that equal healthcare coverage is essential, but
insufficient, to ensure equal access to lung cancer care and outcomes. Healthcare access has been
conceptualized as a result of the interactions between factors across the individual, provider and healthcare
system, neighborhood, and policy levels. However, prior studies addressing lung cancer disparities in low-
income patients focused on individual-level factors. We and other groups demonstrated that neighborhood
accessibility to cancer care is associated with treatment in patients with breast or colorectal cancer. Medicaid
enrollment pre- vs. peri-cancer diagnosis is associated with early-stage cancer diagnoses. Much less is known
about the influences of neighborhood contexts, Medicaid enrollment continuation, and Medicaid coverage of lung
cancer screening on lung cancer care in Medicaid patients. Tobacco cessation treatment is an integral and
essential part of lung cancer treatment. No study has examined the utilization of tobacco treatment and its
determinants in low-income lung cancer patients, a medically underserved population with high prevalence of
nicotine dependence. We hypothesize that neighborhood contexts, Medicaid policies, and hospitals play critical
roles in lung cancer care and survival in Medicaid patients. Employing a robust multilevel modelling approach to
account for clustering within providers and neighborhoods, we will assess the impacts of neighborhoods, policies,
and hospitals on early detection and oncologic treatment for lung cancer, utilization of tobacco treatment, and
lung cancer survival in Medicaid patients, as well as their contributions to racial disparities in lung cancer
treatment and survival. To this end, we will develop integrated datasets for Medicaid enrollees diagnosed with
lung cancer, which includes nationally representative cancer data, Missouri Medicaid claims and enrollment (also
Medicare claims for dual eligible enrollees), Missouri Cancer Registry data, Annual Hospital Surveys,
neighborhood contextual measures that we will develop. To our knowledge, this will be the first population-based
study to comprehensively assess the contributions of factors at the neighborhood, health policy, and hospital
levels to the lung cancer care continuum in low-income patients. The results will help inform interventions by
suggesting potentially modifiable factors that could be targeted to improve cancer care in this vulnerable
population and thereby reduce lung cancer disparities. Addressing non-financial barriers to cancer care in
Medicaid enrollees could maximize the likelihood that substantial investments in Medicaid expansion will

This is an application for a K08 award for Dr. Elizabeth Middleton, a pulmonary and critical care physician at
the University of Utah. Dr. Middleton is establishing herself as a young investigator in translational research of
biological mechanisms driving the pathophysiology of sepsis. Her long-term goal is identification of new
therapeutic targets to advance the care of patients suffering with sepsis so they have longer and have
improved quality of life. The role of platelets in inflammation and infection is poorly understood. She is
proposing to investigate the contribution of the megakaryocytes (the platelet parent cell) and platelets, and how
they impact a patient’s response to sepsis. This K08 will provide Dr. Middleton with the support necessary to
accomplish the following goals: 1) gain expertise in megakaryocyte (MK) biology, gene expression, and
functional assessments, 2) to increase knowledge of platelet FcγRIIA biology and function through use of
humanized transgenic mouse model, 3) to develop the skills and toolsets to dissect intracellular platelet
signaling events, 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a translational research program. To
achieve these goals, Dr. Middleton has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr.
Matthew Rondina, an established physician-investigator and leader in the field of platelet biology in immune
responses and inflammation, and 4 advisors who are leaders in the fields of megakaryocyte gene expression,
biology and function, translational research in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and genetically
altered murine research.
The primary treatment for sepsis is early recognition and hemodynamic resuscitation, antibiotics and
supportive care. Despite hospital-based systems to detect the onset of sepsis, it continues to carry significant
mortality, short- and long-term morbidity. Dr. Middleton’s research focuses on the study of a platelet immune
receptor, Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIA (FcγRIIA), which is positioned at the cross-roads hemostatic,
immune, and inflammatory continuum. Dr. Middleton will (Aim 1) determine how platelet FcγRIIA expression is
increased in sepsis; (Aim 2) determine if increased platelet FcγRIIA during sepsis causes hyperactivation,
thrombosis, and mortality. In Aim 1, Dr. Middleton will investigate the inflammatory agonists that drive
increases in platelet FcγRIIA and track the expression of this receptor from the megakaryocyte to circulating
platelets. In Aim 2, Dr. Middleton will interrogate whether the increased platelet FcγRIIA contributes to risk of
thrombosis and short-term mortality associated with sepsis. This research will prepare Dr. Middleton to design
and implement a research program with clinical applicability to inform future therapies for sepsis."
10866374,"Project Summary/Abstract
Dysregulated renal repair/regeneration leads to the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) after acute
kidney injury (AKI). However, there are no effective treatments to improve the renal repair/regeneration process,
and the dearth of therapeutic options leaves affected patients at high risk of CKD progression and CKD-
associated cardiovascular events and mortality. This unmet medical need underscores the importance of
identifying new therapeutic strategies by elucidating the molecular underpinnings of impaired renal repair. Highly
regenerative SRY-box 9 (SOX9)-expressing tubular epithelial cells (hereafter, Sox9-progenitors) were recently
identified as a critical cell population for healthy renal repair. We found that Sox9-progenitors become
dysfunctional, losing their regenerative function after severe but not mild AKI. Our extensive preliminary data
further indicate that excess oxidative stress contributes to the dysfunction of Sox9-progenitors through
ferroptosis, a newly identified form of oxidative-stress-induced, non-apoptotic regulated cell death that is
observed in human AKI. Our preliminary data also underscore the therapeutic potential of harnessing anti-
ferroptotic defense pathways to enhance renal epithelial repair and avert progression to CKD. However,
molecular mechanisms underlying oxidative stress-induced Sox9-progenitor dysfunction remain unknown, and
the contribution of ferroptosis to the AKI-to-CKD transition requires elucidation. To advance this promising and
clinically relevant line of investigation, we will test our central hypotheses that: (1) In the setting of severe tubular
oxidative stress in AKI, Sox9-progenitors become dysfunctional, impeding renal repair/regeneration, and (2)
excess lipid-peroxidation in Sox9-progenitors induces ferroptosis, precluding healthy healing of damaged renal
tubules, thus driving progression to CKD. To test these hypotheses, we will integrate unbiased single-cell
transcriptomics and mouse genetics in two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the mechanisms of Sox9-
progenitor dysfunction at single-cell resolution by comparative analyses of kidneys that underwent severe versus
mild ischemic renal injuries. In Aim 2, we will investigate ferroptosis in Sox9-progenitors as a key driving
mechanism of the AKI-to-CKD transition by genetically deleting the anti-ferroptotic defense enzyme, glutathione
peroxidase 4, from the Sox9-progenitors. We will subject our gene-modified mouse lines to ischemic, toxic, and
obstructive renal injuries to define the contribution of ferroptosis of Sox9-progenitors across the spectrum of
different AKI etiologies. Completion of these aims will allow us to identify molecular mechanisms of maladaptive
renal repair and elucidate the fundamental pathogenic roles of ferroptosis in renal tubular epithelial progenitors.
Our results will lay the scientific foundation for activating anti-oxidative and anti-ferroptotic pathways to enhance
renal repair/regeneration as a novel therapy to disrupt the AKI-to-CKD transition."
10866436,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been enthusiastically proposed as an essential mechanism for
tumor metastasis, since the EMT-associated features such as migration, invasion, resistance to apoptosis and
stemness properties, adequately meet the requirements for metastasis. Taken the challenges of tracing the EMT
process in vivo, we developed a strategy of using a mesenchymal-specific Cre-mediated switch of fluorescent
markers in a multiple-transgenic mouse (MMTV-PyMT:Fsp1-Cre:Rosa26mT/mG, Tri-PyMT). Surprisingly, we
found that lung metastases were predominantly composed of pre-EMT RFP+ tumor cells exhibiting epithelial
phenotypes under normal conditions. Importantly, the post-EMT tumor cells did exhibit resistance to
chemotherapy, significantly contributed to recurrent lung metastases after chemotherapy. These findings pointed
to the complexity of EMT contributions in tumor progression and revived vigorous discussions in the community.
Given the transient, reversible and dynamic natures of the EMT process, and concerns about the Tri-PyMT
model, we proposed new lineage tracing models to study the roles of EMT in metastasis and chemoresistance.
Aim 1. To explore the contributions of EMT mechanism in tumor metastasis and chemoresistance by
using Snail-CreERT2 mediated EMT lineage tracing model. The Fsp1-Cre mediated Tri-PyMT model may not
be sufficient to report all EMT events. Metastatic cells could undergo EMT by activating distinct EMT transcription
factors (TFs) such as Snail. Therefore, we have established a Snail-CreERT2–mediated EMT lineage tracing
model. In-depth analyses will be performed to clarify the roles of EMT in metastasis and chemoresistance with
this model.
Aim 2. To explore the dynamic changes of EMT statuses in human breast cancer metastasis and
chemoresistance. EMT reporter cell lines (MDA-MB-231:Vim/RFP and BT-474:ECAD/GFP cells) carry knockin
fluorescent tags within EMT marker genes (Vimentin and E-cadherin, respectively). Unlike the Cre-mediated
models, the fluorescence expression in these cells is quantitative and reversible, which allows us to analyze the
dynamic changes of EMT status with and without chemotherapy in human breast cancer models.
Aim 3. To assess the evolutionary lineages of metastasis-initiating cells and the involvement of EMT
mechanism via genetic barcoding models. In addition to using EMT markers, we will genetically barcode the
Tri-PyMT cells using the homing-CRISPR technique. This model will allow us to depict the evolutionary
trajectories from primary tumor cells to individual metastases, and determine the origins of the metastasis (pre-
EMT vs. post-EMT cells). Further, we will develop genetic barcoding mice (MARC:CRISPR:PyMT) for lineage
tracing of spontaneous metastatic cells and assessing the contributions of the EMT program to metastasis.
Impact: Resolving the controversies in the field will not only improve our mechanistic understanding of tumor
metastasis but also provide novel targets/opportunities in combatting the deadly disease."
10867383,"Project Summary/Abstract: In post-industrial cities, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are increasingly
recognized as especially persistent and problematic contaminants. VOCs have been highlighted because of their
impact on public health through intrusion into basements via soil vapors. However, our ability to address this
public health issue is limited by our ability to identify belowground VOC contamination in a spatially
comprehensive and cost-efficient way. Project E1’s objective is to use an innovative aboveground approach to
pinpoint possible hot spots of belowground VOCs in post-industrial urban environments that contribute to human
health issues associated with degraded indoor air quality as a result of vapor intrusion. Our central hypothesis
is that because VOCs can accumulate in plant tissue, mainly via root-water uptake, plant-water interactions can
be used in a cost-effective way to inform VOC data and isolate belowground VOC hotspots in post-industrial
urban environments with highly altered hydrology. We propose to address this hypothesis through three specific
aims: (1) identify hot spots of VOC contamination using data from aboveground plant tissue in a geospatial GIS
framework; (2) identify belowground source waters for urban plants to isolate possible sources of VOC
contamination (especially in urban environments where access to groundwater through wells is limited); (3) verify
belowground presence of VOCs and link to VOCs in indoor air. The proposed approach is the first effort to link
phytoscreening and stable isotope techniques in understanding belowground VOCs. Compounds of interests
include trichloroethylene; tetrachloroethylene; benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes – priority Superfund
contaminants that have been detected in soil vapors of our study area (Detroit, MI). Our findings will contribute
to the problem-solving goals of CLEAR by: (1) providing the proof-of-concept for using aboveground plant tissue
in both point and non-point belowground source remediation efforts of Superfund-relevant VOC contaminants in
complex urban environments and (2) providing the geospatial framework for sharing data between environmental
and biomedical research efforts aimed at improving conditions that impact public health in complex post-
industrial urban environments. Metrics from our geospatial framework and metrics of public health concern can
be spatially correlated to focus remediation and/or mitigation efforts. Therefore, Project E1 directly responds to:
SRP broad mandate 3, i.e., development of “methods and technologies to detect hazardous substances in the
environment” – and directly relates to the goals of Project E2; SRP broad mandate 2, i.e., development of
“methods to assess the risks to public health presented by hazardous substances” because the incorporation of
our environmental data into a geospatial framework allows for direct integration with public health data – and
directly relates to the goals of Project B3 and the Community Engagement Core; SRP broad mandate 4, i.e.
evaluating “basic biological, chemical, and physical methods to reduce the amount and toxicity of hazardous
substances” by monitoring existing phytoremediation efforts within the urban community for their effectiveness."

Integrated IoT Sensing and Edge Computing Coupled with a Bayesian Network Model
 for Exposure Assessment and Targeted Remediation of Vapor Intrusion
Leads: Zhang, Dittrich
Project Summary/Abstract: Project E2 supports the Center for Leadership in Environmental Awareness and
Research (CLEAR) with a focus on the Superfund-relevant VOC contaminants in complex urban environments.
The goal of Project E2 is to develop a robust integrative platform that combines the power of an Internet of Things
(IoT) sensor network with edge computing (IoTEC) for exposure assessment and targeted remediation of VOC
vapor intrusion (VI) using a Bayesian network (BN) model. We hypothesize that (1) integrated IoT sensor network
and edge computing (IoTEC), compared to conventional off-line sampling, can provide a rapid-response, cost-
efficient, and accurate approach to monitor and screen for VI in complex urban matrices, (2) IoTEC sensing data
supplemented with house survey, regional groundwater modeling, soil survey, and geospatial tools can be used
to develop integrated mechanistic-BN models for exposure assessment of VI, and (3) a novel VOC adsorption
approach for timely and targeted remediation of VI coupled with the products of (1) and (2) will complement
conventional engineering remediation to reduce exposure risk of VI. This hypothesis will be tested by three
specific research aims: Aim 1 - establish the IoTEC tool by integrating the IoT sensor network with edge
computing for rapid-response, cost-efficient, and accurate monitoring of VI and VOC exposure; Aim 2 - develop
and deploy a dynamic, machine-learned BN model integrated with a mechanistic model for exposure assessment
and prioritized remediation of VI; and Aim 3 - develop functionalized sorbents and remediation systems for
integration with IoTEC monitoring for targeted remediation of VI risk pathways. This innovative work will transform
the paradigm of VI assessment and remediation from conventional off-line methods to a new data-science driven
approach, providing a first-of-its-kind platform with functionality ranging from VOC monitoring and data
collection/analysis to data-based decision making and improved remediation outcomes. In addition, labscale
micropilot treatment systems will be developed by integrating the IoTEC sensor network with the novel
adsorption approach for rapid-response remediation of VOC to minimize exposure risks in both air and soil-water
systems. Modifications to sorption materials including activated carbon, zeolite clay, and organosilica particles
will be investigated to address current air purifier performance concerns. This project addresses three important
SRP mandates: SRP Mandate 2, methods to assess the risks to human health presented by hazardous
substances (Aim 2); SRP Mandate 3, methods and technologies to detect hazardous substances in the
environment (Aim 1); and SRP Mandate 4, basic biological, chemical, and physical methods to reduce the
amount and toxicity of hazardous substances in the environment (Aim 3). In combination with other CLEAR
projects / cores to reduce environmental risk to VOC exposure as well as improve public health outcomes, this
work will provide improved methods and tools for risk characterization and optimization of remediation efforts.
This research will leverage the investigators’ funded research projects in IoT, edge computing, smart
environmental monitoring, groundwater modeling, machine-learned BN modeling, and sorbent media synthesis,
and will benefit from well-established collaborations with partners such as the MI EGLE VI team and Superfund
office."
10867386,"Summary/Abstract:
Anthropogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) have emerged as high priority environmental
contaminants due to ubiquitous urban exposure via industrial exhaust, fuel refineries, and vehicle exhaust, as
well as VOC contamination at an estimated 78% of Superfund sites. Residents in urban areas are
disproportionately exposed to VOCs as a result of indoor vapor intrusion, tap water, ingestion of contaminated
fish, and ambient outdoor exposure. Inhalation, ingestion, and dermal adsorption from indoor and outdoor
sources are routes for human exposure, and at-risk communities are often chronically exposed to complex
mixtures of VOCs. Varied adverse health impacts associated with VOC exposure involve the respiratory,
cardiovascular, renal, hepatic, endocrine, immune, and nervous systems. Studies also suggest
that chronic, maternal VOC exposure is linked to birth defects and preterm birth. Nonetheless, these health risks
remain ill-defined. The Center for Leadership in Environmental Awareness and Research (CLEAR) seeks to
reduce the impacts of environmental contaminants on both public and environmental health, focusing on the
alarming rate of preterm births in Detroit. Our hypothesis is that exposure to VOCs at environmentally-relevant
concentrations and mixtures will impair development, immune function, and reproductive health in zebrafish, an
NIH-accepted model organism. The development of innovative, high-throughput techniques will enable the
CLEAR B1 team to perform novel developmental, reproductive, neurobehavioral, immune, and multigenerational
bioassays to evaluate adverse phenotypic effects of exposure to six VOCs at various concentrations (Aim 1),
similarly, identify effects of exposure to VOC mixtures (Aim 2), and employ molecular techniques to identify
transcriptomic and epigenetic pathways, as well as rank potential biomarkers (by sensitivity), relevant to VOC
exposure and specific biological effects (Aim 3). Using data from Projects E1, E2, B3, and the CEC, we will focus
our experiments on environmentally-relevant VOC concentrations and mixtures found in Detroit and at known
Superfund sites. The proposed research is significant because the results are expected to fill knowledge gaps
in the field at basic and applied levels and have a positive translational impact by expanding the depth of our
understanding regarding health impacts of individual VOCs and VOC mixtures, critical developmental windows
for these adverse health impacts and biomarkers of effect, and mechanisms for environmentally-influenced,
adult-onset and multigenerational disease. These results will be shared with the research training, data
analysis, and chemical analysis cores to advance the development of evidence-based strategies to prevent and
treat environmentally-induced disease. Ultimately, these strategies will be used by the community engagement
core to enact VOC prevention and intervention measures to improve the health of mothers and children in
Detroit (Figure 1)."
10869464,"In a healthy cornea, optimal corneal hydration and transparency is maintained by the corneal
endothelial cells that pump fluid out of the stroma. The pump requires the action of three stromal-
facing transport proteins: the Na+/CO3= cotransporter NBCe1 and the H+/Lactate- transporter
MCT1. However, it is unclear why mutations in another protein, the pH-dependent H+ conductor
SLC4A11, cause loss of pump function and thence corneal dystrophy. We hypothesize that
SLC4A11 supports the activity of the pump by counteracting pH changes that result from
imbalances in NBCe1 and MCT1 action. Understanding the complex functional interactions
among these three acid-base transporters with co-expression studies only is virtually impossible
because intuition alone is not sufficient for data interpretation. Mathematical models, developed
in conjunction with experimental approaches, provide a powerful tool to overcome this difficulty.
Thus, here we propose to use experimental data gathered from Xenopus oocytes expressing
these transporters singly, in pairs, or as a trio, in combination with kinetic parameters that have
been determined for each transporter, to generate a computational model that mimics our in vitro
experiments. This multidisciplinary approach will allow us quantify the power of SLC4A11 to
prevent pH change during imbalanced NBCe1/MCT1 action, disclose synergistic and antagonistic
interactions among the three, and predict the effects of disease-causing mutations that shift the
abundance and/or pH dependence of SLC4A11 on intracellular pH balance and on the ion fluxes
that support pump function."
10869304,"The overall objective of this study is to optimize, validate, and evaluate the effectiveness of strategies for
reporting back environmental sampling results, with a focus on rural Native American populations and the
balance between real-time and delayed feedback for both acute and chronic exposure concerns. The bioethical
question of interest is: How does the information source (i.e., the messenger, format, and timing of education)
impact the effectiveness of report-back strategies in rural tribal populations? This project is innovative because
it addresses unanswered questions regarding the role that real-time exposure information plays in report-back
strategies, with application to rural Native American populations. Aim 1: Optimization of Real-Time Report-Back
Strategies for Rural Native American Research Participants. Previous work has involved environmental sampling
data (indoor/outdoor PM2.5 and indoor radon) at households of N. Arapaho tribal members. Half of the
participants received immediate exposure information from real-time, direct-reading displays while the other half
only received final, delayed feedback with average data. The question remains as to whether the report-back
strategies were as effective as desired. The hypothesis is that real-time exposure feedback will be more
acceptable for short-term health outcomes whereas delayed feedback will be more acceptable for long-term
health outcomes. Listening sessions and questionnaires will be used to evaluate prior approaches for both acute
and chronic exposures, with a specific focus on our bioethical question. Aim 2: Validation of Optimized Report-
Back Strategies for Rural Native American Research Participants. Based on the results of Aim 1, a series of
vignettes will be developed that target the report-back strategies of interest (e.g., real-time exposure data for
acute concerns, etc). These will be presented in 4-8 focus groups, with targeted discussions regarding the
messenger type, format, and timing of education. The hypothesis is that the report back strategy that will be
perceived as the most acceptable for all of the exposure scenarios will be in-person report-back by a tribal
member, with education both before and after sampling. Aim 3: Evaluation of the Implementation of Exposure-
Reduction Strategies from Report-Back of Environmental Exposures in Tribal Populations. Evaluation of the
developed report-back approaches for long term (radon) and short-term (PM2.5) exposure risks will occur in two
tribal populations: N. Arapaho and Utah Navajo. Reliability and generalizability will be tested to understand the
extent to which individual tribes have unique needs and where techniques are more universal. Effectiveness of
the strategies will be evaluated for the level of engagement with exposure-reduction activities, with a goal of
building local capacity for management of evaluation activities into the future. The hypothesis is that real-time
exposure feedback will result in more engagement with exposure-reduction strategies. The ultimate outputs of
this project will be validated guidance on the most effective strategies for reporting back environmental sampling
results, with a focus on increasing engagement with exposure-reduction activities in rural tribal populations."
10873208,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 1: Mounting preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrates that external
beam radiation therapy (EBRT) can enhance the systemic anti-tumor response to immunotherapies (ImmRx) by
modifying the tumor microenvironment (TME) in ways that enhance tumor immune susceptibility. Others and we
have observed that in the setting of multifocal or metastatic disease this capacity of focal EBRT to elicit in situ
vaccination (optimal at doses of 8-12 Gy) may be further enhanced by delivering low dose radiation (RT; 2-4 Gy)
to all tumor sites. In this capacity, low dose RT may play a critical role in overcoming tumor-specific immune
suppression from RT-sensitive immune lineages [e.g. regulatory T cells (Tregs)] and may also enhance the
immune susceptibility of tumor cells at these disseminated sites by cGAS/STING activation of a type I interferon
(IFN) response. The limited ability of EBRT to target all tumor sites without considerable risk of toxicity is a major
hurdle that limits the capacity of EBRT to modulate the collective TME in this manner. In the setting of
microscopic or metastatic disease, it is not possible to treat all TMEs with EBRT at the doses required for
immunomodulation without also incurring lymphopenia. Consequently, a radiotherapy modality is needed that
can deliver immunomodulatory RT doses to all tumor sites without triggering systemic immunosuppression. To
meet this need, we hypothesize that molecularly targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT), a systemic form of
radiotherapy combining a tumor-selective vector with a therapeutic radioisotope, will deliver immunomodulatory
RT to all metastatic tumor sites resulting in significant tumor responses without systemic immune suppression.
 To effectively study these broad mechanisms requires a TRT agent with 1) selective uptake across a breadth
of malignancy, 2) a theranostic capacity for delivery of paired isotopes that can be used for therapy and
diagnostic imaging (e.g. 90Y and 86Y, respectively) to facilitate personalized dosimetry, and 3) the ability to bind
and deliver diverse radionuclides to study the differential capacity of these to immunomodulate the TME of micro-
and macro-metastases. Current FDA-approved TRTs are limited in their capacity to achieve this vision. We have
developed a novel TRT vector, NM600, which is optimally suited for this broad application in dose-dependent
immunomodulation and which has produced many complete responses including tumor specific immune memory
induction in syngeneic murine tumor models when used in combination with checkpoint inhibition (Project 2),
immunocytokine (Project 3), and DNA vaccine (Project 4) immunotherapies. Project 1 will investigate how the
properties of different TRT vectors and radionuclides (e.g. linear energy transfer (LET), dose rate, and dose
distribution) influence the TME and the host immune system in syngeneic mouse models relevant to each Project
and also in companion canine cancer patients to assess whether parallel effects can be translated to a larger
species. In Projects 2-4, this knowledge will be utilized to optimize the combination of TRT with each type of
ImmRx and to elucidate biological mechanisms of observed synergies."
10873211,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 2
In a project that builds upon the ongoing collaborative progress of our multidisciplinary team, we will
systematically evaluate mechanisms of cooperative interaction and optimize the potency of treatment regimens
that combine targeted radionuclide therapies (TRT) with immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI; e.g. anti-PD-
1, anti-CTLA-4) to enhance the anti-tumor immune response against metastatic cancers. Moderate dose
(8-12 Gy) external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is capable of eliciting an in situ vaccine effect, converting the
targeted tumor into a nidus for enhanced tumor antigen recognition. In preclinical and clinical studies, this results
in diversification of the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Consequently, in preclinical studies, EBRT improves the
response to ICIs. This is at least in part dependent upon the capacity of EBRT to activate a type I interferon (IFN)
response in radiated tumor cells. However, clinical studies have not yet conclusively demonstrated a benefit from
combining EBRT with ICIs, and even in studies that suggest a benefit it is clear that more is needed if we aim to
develop an effective approach to eradicating metastatic disease for all cancer patients. In pursuit of such a goal,
we now propose to evaluate a next generation strategy to leveraging the capacity of radiation to enhance
response to ICIs by using TRTs to deliver radiation to all tumor sites in settings of metastatic disease. To begin
testing this approach, we will compare the relative capacities of different TRT agents to 1) activate a type I IFN
response in tumor cells, 2) augment response to ICIs, and 3) increase the diversity and clonality of the TCR
repertoire among tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. We hypothesize that TRT will enhance the rate and depth of
response to ICIs and that this will correlated with effects on the TCR repertoire that are dependent on the ability
of TRT to modulate tumor cell immune susceptibility by activating a type I IFN response. We expect that TRTs
will also elicit immunogenic cell death, local inflammation, and temporary depletion of suppressive regulatory T
cells (Tregs) from the tumor microenvironment (TME), and other Projects in this P01 will investigate those
mechanisms further. Here, we will compare the relative effects of TRT radionuclides and vectors in order to
develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions between these agents and anti-tumor immunity. In
particular, we will evaluate the potential impacts of tumor size, type, and number as well as the type of radioactive
decay products (e.g. α particle vs β particle vs γ-ray vs Auger electron), linear energy transfer (LET), dose, dose-
rate and half-life, and dose range. We will also examine the potential impact of the TRT vector, specifically testing
how changes in TRT distribution at the organism, tumor, and subcellular level affect anti-tumor immunity. The
insights and treatment regimens developed in these studies should enable rapid translation to clinical
testing in patients with any type of metastatic cancer while also launching a generation of follow-up
basic and translational preclinical studies."
10870644,"Project Summary
The importance of achieving stone-free status during endoscopic kidney stone surgery is emphasized by the
high rate of repeat stone procedures due to residual fragments after index surgery. Speciﬁcally, residual stone
fragments can lead to obstruction, pain, kidney injury, and recurrent infections. Currently, of the 100,000 patients
who undergo an endoscopic kidney stone treatment each year, around 25,000 will require a repeat stone surgery
within 20 months. Successful endoscopic stone surgery requires the surgeon to visualize the entire renal col-
lecting system and locate all kidney stones during treatment. Challenges that lead to incomplete stone treatment
involve inadequate stone visibility and difﬁculty navigating through the kidney. Complete kidney navigation relies
on clinical experience and surgeons who have performed fewer cases have greater chances of recurrence.
 Our overall goal is to create an eye gaze based guidance system to complement the current standard of care
where trainees only get verbal feedback. Gaze guidance has been shown to improve skill acquisition and retention
in robot-assisted and laparoscopic surgery settings but has not been explored in the unconstrained environment
of ureteroscopy. Our previous work in measuring eye gaze patterns shows similar differences in trainee vs.
expert gaze behavior during kidney stone phantom procedures compared to those found in laparoscopic and
robotic surgery. This suggested that using gaze training may similarly improve ureteroscopy skill acquisition.
Successful eye tracking and eye gaze sharing in ureteroscopy require a tracking and registration system that
does not constrain surgeons’ movements or head orientations. We propose head-mounted eye trackers that map
gaze to the surgical monitor to ﬂexibly track gaze as surgeons move around the operating room. We will evaluate
whether the gaze sharing platform improves complete kidney visualization, which is required to identify stones
that may not show up in pre-operative imaging, in phantoms and patients.
 The endpoint of this R21 will be a fully validated gaze-based training system for endoscopic stone surgery and
the necessary experimental data to power a large-scale, multi-center clinical trial. As our training system is solely
composed of software running on augmented reality devices, all existing endoscopic and laparoscopic surgical
procedures could in principle immediately beneﬁt from the results of this project. In this way, we believe the suc-
cess of our project will facilitate improved training procedures and mitigate repeat interventions or complications,
beneﬁting patients, surgeons, and society."

Plant (poly)phenolic compounds are widely acknowledged to have health benefits in humans, and diets high in
plant-based foods are associated with good health. Phenolic compounds can act as antioxidants, by scavenging
free radicals and preventing free radical formation, and can regulate metabolic reactions by binding to various
enzymes. Despite epidemiological evidence that these phytochemicals have health-promoting effects, the
mechanisms of action behind their bioactivity remain incompletely understood. The overarching goal of this
proposal is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying various biological activities of (poly)phenolic compounds
including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and other medicinal properties. The specific aims are 1) Systems-level
analysis of metabolism upon (poly)phenolic compound addition, 2) Exploring the effect of (poly)phenolic
compounds in cell lines and animals, and 3) Searching for synergy by paring (poly)phenols, small-molecule
drugs, and nutrient conditions.
The complexity and diversity of (poly)phenolic compounds and their biological
activities necessitate innovative analytical techniques for systems-level quantitation of metabolic effects.
The
proposed research will innovate i) a widely applicable method for mapping the mechanism of action of natural
products and ii) targeted uses of (poly)phenols as a sole preventive and therapeutic strategy and as a
complement to other drugs. To this end, a novel method, termed ‘shotgun metabolomics,’ will be developed.
Furthermore, a combination of state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, cleverly designed isotope tracing strategies,
and a fundamental thermodynamic principle will be used to obtain and integrate metabolomic, fluxomic, and
thermodynamic measurements across cellular metabolism. This integrative approach will expand the coverage
of quantitative metabolic analysis. Using this approach, this project will generate and test new hypotheses
regarding systemic metabolic rewiring, elicited by (poly)phenols, that contributes to preserving energetic
homeostasis in terms of ATP and redox molecules. The proposed systems-level analysis will reveal multi-faceted
effects of (poly)phenols on various parts of metabolism, which collectively contribute to cells’ ability to fight
stressors and maintain homeostasis. Exploring and elucidating the mechanisms underlying (poly)phenols’
biological activities will promote preventive and integrative health care."
10876495,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The gut microbiome has a profound effect on human health by influencing the development of the immune
system, producing bioactive metabolites and directly aiding in the processing of food. Changes in the
composition and metabolism of the gut microbial community has been associated with a wide array of human
diseases, including malnutrition, auto-immunity, and even neurological function. A central aspiration of gut
microbiome research is to identify individuals with abnormalities in gut microbial composition in order to intervene
therapeutically. However, a major limitation is that it is logistically challenging to evaluate gut microbial
composition in a patient-care setting. The studies in this proposal will advance a novel strategy to overcome this
roadblock. Based on powerful preliminary studies in germ-free mice and in humans, our central hypothesis is
that the volatile composition of breath offers a dynamic representation of the composition and function of the gut
microbiota. We will test this hypothesis by evaluating the association between breath, gut bacterial species, and
microbial metabolic functions (Aim 1). In addition, we will use two unique clinical cohorts of infants to determine
how the breath volatile profile changes dynamically with changes in gut microbial community composition (Aim
2). Together, our studies will not only advance our fundamental understanding of the spectrum of breath volatiles
that arise from microbial metabolism, but will also be a critical first step in determining how “breathalyzer”
diagnostics of gut health can be applied clinically."
10876938,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer death in
the United States by 2030. One of the differentiating hallmarks of PDAC is an exceptionally high frequency of
perineural invasion (PNI), a histopathologic manifestation of tumor-nerve crosstalk whereby cancer cells recruit,
migrate towards and invade peripheral nerves. These tumor-nerve interactions may be biochemical, electrical,
and metabolic in nature and involve both neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells. While it has become apparent that
intra-tumoral nerves play an important role in cancer initiation, progression, recurrence, treatment resistance,
metastasis, and survival, the diverse molecular mechanisms underlying tumor-nerve crosstalk remain largely
unknown. To address this gap in knowledge, this proposal aims to perform a comprehensive spatially-resolved
whole transcriptome screen in human PDAC to identify cell-type specific genes linked to PNI and dissect their
functional roles by applying CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) in a novel orthotopic organoid transplant model. It is
anticipated that this work will uncover a set of previously unknown mediators of PNI and provide a high-resolution
molecular interconnectivity map of the tumor-nerve interactome, which will guide therapeutic development.
Prior work studying molecular mediators of PNI using bulk or single-cell/nucleus RNA-sequencing lacked spatial
context. The first aim applies a transcriptomic and proteomic digital spatial profiling (DSP; Nanostring) approach
optimized for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of human PDAC to preserve the spatial relationships
among different cell types/states. By performing DSP on tissue microarrays created from a custom cohort of
PDAC patients with tumors spatially annotated for regions with and without PNI, the ability to extract gene
expression differences that associate with PNI isolated from inter-patient genetic heterogeneity is greatly
enhanced. The second aim will investigate the potential causal relationships between a shortlist of ~20
candidate genes and the development of PNI by performing an arrayed in vivo CRISPRa screen involving
orthotopically transplanting pancreatic cancer organoids expressing single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting one
or more candidate genes (KrasLSL-G12D/+;Trp53FL/FL;Rosa26LSL-dCas9-VPR-mNeonGreen;sgRNA) into syngeneic
recipients. The density and properties of intra-tumoral nerves/PNI will be assessed using multiplexed imaging
and machine learning approaches. The long-term goal of this research is the successful development of
therapeutics that disrupt adaptive tumor-nerve crosstalk in the tumor microenvironment.
The research proposal is part of an extensive career development plan that includes formal educational
opportunities and seminar/conference presentations to enable the principal investigator to become an
independent physician-scientist in translational cancer biology. A diverse and experienced team of mentors,
scientific advisory committee members, and collaborators at MIT, MGH, DFCI, HMS, and Columbia University
School of Medicine is committed to supporting and guiding the principal investigator toward achieving this goal."

 There is strong demand for third-generation DNA sequencing systems to be single-molecule, massively-
parallel, and real-time, while also reducing operating costs and supporting long read lengths. No technologies
have yet met this challenge, but the most successful attempts to date have been based on methods which
track the real-time operation of single enzyme molecules operating on a strand of DNA. Optical approaches to
single-polymerase imaging suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios deriving from the weak photon emission from
single fluorophores (< 2500 photons/sec), and thus demand both complex optics and purposely-reduced base
incorporation rates (~1 Hz). Nanopore-based detection approaches offer faster detection and have been
demonstrated to track polymerase activity at higher incorporation rates (~10-100 Hz), but have struggled with
reliability issues and high error rates associated with the still-weak signal levels produced by popular protein
nanopores.
 These struggles suggest that nanopore-based single-molecule sequencing techniques which do not de-
pend on real-time imaging of active enzymes would have several important advantages. First and foremost,
they could offer sequencing speeds even faster than a free-running polymerase molecule. Second, removing
active enzymes from the detection platform offers more freedom to optimize key parameters such as buffer
conditions and temperatures outside the operating range of natural enzymes. Third, sequencing platforms
without active enzymes may prove simpler and cheaper to operate, ship, and store. Lastly, nanopores, particu-
larly biological ones, face reliability challenges as electronic devices, experiencing degradation during use.
 In this four-year effort, we focus on the development of a multiplexed solid-state nanopore platform ena-
bling a per-pore sequencing rate of at least 105 bases/sec, leveraging integrated electronics and state-of-the-
art solid-state nanopores based on ultra-thin membranes of layered two-dimensional materials and delivering
useful signal bandwidths in excess of 10 MHz when required. We expect to be able to detect signal levels as
low as 50 pA at signal-to-noise ratios greater than 8 and bandwidth better than 2 MHz, making possible high-
speed free-running single-molecule electrophoretic sequencing if the translocation rate and diffusive motion of
the translocating DNA can be controlled. This is accomplished through electrostatic control through gate elec-
trodes in the pore itself and closed-loop feedback. This goal is pursued through three Specific Aims: the de-

and closed-loop electronic control of the gates within the pore (Specific Aim 2); and application of this system

Radiation therapy (RT) is a very effective treatment modality for improving local control
and overall survival for many cancer types. However, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
displays remarkable radioresistance. Although, post-surgical RT (total dose of 60Gy in
2Gy fractions) is the only treatment modality that increases overall survival for GBM
patients, GBM universally recurs and is fatal. Resistance to RT is therefore a major
contributor to treatment failure. Overcoming radiation resistance of these tumors is one
of the major remaining frontiers in Radiation Oncology that, if resolved, could
dramatically improve outcomes in this disease. Amongst the many contributing factors
that have been proposed, GBM metabolism and its role in generating resistance to
oxidative stress, such as during RT is a promising therapeutic angle that we will exploit
in this proposal. Specifically, we have evidence that irradiated GBM cells reprogram their
metabolism towards antioxidant pathways, by funneling glucose through the NADPH-
generating pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Such metabolic reprogramming during
RT is mediated in part by the glycolytic enzyme PKM2 and in part by the transcription
factor NRF2. Oxidative stress-dependent inactivation of PKM2 or activation of NRF2,
both result in rerouting of glycolytic intermediates into the PPP. In addition, we have
evidence that PKM2 is a NRF2 target. Therefore, we hypothesize that PKM2 and NRF2
cooperate in driving an antioxidant metabolic response in irradiated GBM cells that
promotes resistance to RT. Of importance is the fact that PKM2 is overexpressed in
GBM tumors, while normal brain tissue only expresses PKM1. Also, small molecule
activators of PKM2 are available that exacerbate oxidative stress and have anti-tumor
activity, although they have not been tested in GBM or with RT. These activators cross
the blood brain barrier making them suitable for combining with RT to sensitize GBM
tumors. Therefore, it is also proposed that interfering with the NRF2-PKM2-metabolism
axis would limit the antioxidant, pro-survival metabolic reprogramming induced by
radiation and improve the effect of RT in human and mouse models of GBM."

10877836,"SUMMARY
Substance use disorder afflicts nearly one in seven people in the US, placing a heavy burden on healthcare
resources, the economy, and individual quality of life. Currently, there is no effective medication available for
cocaine use disorder (CUD), most likely because the neurobiology underlying the disease is complex and not
completely understood. Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic circuit has been shown to play a
critical role in CUD. Cocaine inhibits the activity of the dopamine transporter (DAT) to produce its behavioral
effects. Regulation of the DAT, a principal regulator of dopamine signaling, occurs primarily through post-
translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, which are triggered by presynaptic auto and hetero-
receptor-linked signaling cascades. These modifications alter the interaction of cocaine with the DAT, leading
to changes in the stimulating and rewarding effects of cocaine. However, to date, post-translational
modifications have not been a focus of investigation in the CUD field. Our studies show that phosphorylation of
the Threonine-53 residue of DAT, or phospho-T53-DAT (PT53-DAT), plays a pivotal role in regulating cocaine-
directed behaviors. In this proposal, we explore this novel finding using cutting-edge techniques, including a
knock-in mouse model with a phosphorylation-defective DAT-Thr53Ala mutant (DAT-A53), a viral-mediated
brain region-specific blockade of DAT-T53 phosphorylation, and fiber photometry-based measurements of
dopamine in freely moving mice using the fluorescent sensor, dLight. With these new models and tailored
biochemical, neurochemical, and behavioral studies, the current proposal aims to fill a critical gap in our
understanding of the central role of DAT phosphorylation in normal dopamine neurotransmission and in the
presence of cocaine, including in live animals for the first time. As a key mechanism, we have discovered that
the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) regulates DAT via PT53-DAT. Our studies also show that KOR activation
increases DAT activity through PT53-DAT, and when T53 is substituted with A53, the aversive effects of a KOR
agonist are attenuated. Here, we will expand and test our overarching hypothesis “Cocaine induces addiction-
like behaviors when the KOR phosphorylates DAT at T53 and alters DA dynamics”. Aim 1 will investigate the
effect of T53 phosphorylation on KOR-mediated DAT upregulation, trafficking and protein-protein interactions.
Aim 1 will also examine if these PT53-DAT-dependent effects are sex-, and brain-region specific. Aim 2 will
examine the impact of PT53-DAT on extracellular DA dynamics and DA release and clearance modulation by
KOR and cocaine in vivo and in brain slices. Aim 3 will determine whether PT53-DAT plays a role in KOR- and
cocaine- associated behaviors. Outcomes from the proposed studies will provide novel insights into the
mechanisms of CUD, open new horizons for examining phosphorylation of DAT-T53 as an underlying
mechanism of dynorphin actions in DA-signaling and cocaine addiction and expose new molecular therapeutic
intervention points."
10878999,"PROJECT SUMMARY ADMINISTRATIVE CORE
The Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction (CSNA) merges advanced experimental and computational
approaches in sophisticated mouse model systems with experts in behavioral neuroscience, computational
biology and genetics, to interrogate the overlapping biological factors underlying risk for psychostimulant
addiction. The CSNA draws on the experience and expertise of three highly accomplished researchers based
at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX); SUNY–Binghamton University; and the University of North Carolina Chapel
Hill. By integrating these programs through resource sharing, experimental and analytical standardization,
and collaboration, the CSNA will enable a synergistic, multi-dimensional analysis of risk for psychostimulant
abuse, while sharing data, resources and expertise with the research community. To fully capitalize on the
extensive knowledge base afforded by this geographically dispersed team, and to efficiently synthesize and
disseminate novel methods, findings and educational opportunities, the CSNA will be guided by a strong,
centralized and well-organized Administrative Core (Admin Core). The overall objectives of the Admin Core
are: 1) Communication. The Admin Core will organize and oversee regular scientific meetings to foster
communication and synergy within and across the projects and cores of the CSNA, and to nurture a strong,
collaborative environment across all sites, including those external to JAX. Regular communication between
Admin Core leadership, the Internal Executive Committee (IEC) composed of the PI and all Core and Project
Leads, and an External Advisory Board (EAB) composed of experts in the field, will optimize both progress of
the CSNA towards its goals and stewardship of the Center as a resource of national impact. 2)
Oversight/Management. The Admin Core will provide scientific and administrative oversight of CSNA
research projects, cores and pilot programs. This oversight will include assessment and decision-making,
project management,
timely preparation of reports, regular fiscal review, intellectual property management,
regulatory compliance, involvement of institutional and programmatic resources, pilot project review, and
regular review of research and publication progress. As part of its oversight and program review, the EAB will
provide critical perspectives on CSNA progress, make recommendations on overall scientific direction, and
provide guidance on logistic, scientific and fiscal challenges faced by the Center. The Admin Core, together
with the IEC, are responsible for implementation of EAB recommendations. 3) Education, Outreach and Career
Development. The Admin Core will provide outreach to further public awareness of addiction research and of
the CSNA and enhance professional training, education and career development in the genetics of addiction for
a diversified addiction research workforce. This will be accomplished through a suite of offerings that leverage
the well-established resources available at JAX for education and outreach."
10879001,"PROJECT SUMMARY INTEGRATIVE GENETICS & GENOMICS CORE (IGGC)
The Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction (CSNA)’s Integrative Genetics and Genomics Core (IGGC)
integrates and disseminates data from a coordinated, synergistic set of biobehavioral studies of psychostimulant
addiction susceptibility. Central to this integration is the expansion of systems genetics tools and approaches to
examine genetic correlations among addiction-related behaviors, identify underlying genes and variants,
pathways and neurobiological mechanisms and extrapolate them to human conditions. The IGGC provides
innovative systems genetics approaches, serving all projects with advanced analyses developed by the core
leads and others. The objectives of the IGGC are: 1) To deliver rigorous, reproducible experimental design and
molecular phenotyping through an Experimental Design, Colony Management and Sample Tracking service and
a Molecular Analysis service. Our experimental design will be executed with the assistance of a robust LIMS
system that facilitates rapid data dissemination. Genotyping, gene expression and other molecular analysis will
be conducted using validated protocols and data will be integrated with phenotypic data. 2) To develop and
implement traceable statistical, statistical genetics and bioinformatics pipelines for the expanded molecular and
behavioral phenotyping studies through a Statistical Genetic Analysis service. Rigorous integrative statistical
analysis of data generated by the CSNA will be performed using a suite of specialized tools devised largely by
the IGGC team, including reference trait analysis and genetic correlations. 3) To manage, integrate and
disseminate data through widely accessible cross-species genetic and genomic resources through Cross
Species Integration and Data Dissemination services. We will achieve cross species integration at the variant
and molecular level using the GeneWeaver platform, which enables multi-species data integration through
advanced combinatorial algorithms. Data will be shared through a suite of complementary and widely accessed
resources for integrative analysis and interpretation. Each service includes processes for quality control, quality
assurance and effective resource utilization by all members of the CSNA. The Core structure—based on our
experience that one cannot separate data analysis from careful experimental design and project management—
will ensure faithful execution of an integrated experimental protocol across the CSNA’s projects. The IGGC will
interact closely with the Behavioral Phenotyping Core to conduct complex behavioral analysis directed at
predisposing and drug self-administration traits, and the Mouse Resources and Validation Core to receive
validation cohorts for behavioral testing. By meeting standards for research reproducibility, data quality and data
integrity, the IGGC will enable discovery of novel biomolecular mechanisms of addiction susceptibility and ensure
lasting utility of CSNA data and research outcomes. The IGGC will play an integral role in skills development,
deliver its innovative approaches to other researchers using systems genetics populations and resources in
addiction genetics and genomics, and continue to prepare training materials for the global research community."
10879002,"PROJECT SUMMARY BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPING CORE (BPC)
The Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction (CSNA) brings together experts in model organism genetic
studies of addiction, who are focused on the discovery of biological mechanisms through which predisposing
behavioral trait variation (e.g., impulsivity, novelty seeking, drug sensitivity, compulsive drug seeking) influences
the self-administration of drugs. Achieving this goal requires rigorous and reproducible investigation of large,
genetically diverse mouse populations and complex behavioral phenotyping analysis. Over the past five years,
the Behavioral Phenotyping Core (BPC) has established and streamlined multiple pipelines for complex
behavioral analysis of predisposing and drug self-administration traits. Working closely with Project Leads, the
BPC has been integral in providing the behavioral phenotyping for the CSNA’s goal of defining extreme
responder strains within the Collaborative Cross inbred population and discovering novel genes and mechanisms
that modulate addiction-related behaviors in Diversity Outbred mice. With sophisticated facilities to perform
broad, in-depth behavioral phenotyping batteries, and personnel with demonstrated expertise in using such
facilities and methods, the BPC will continue to carry out multiple and diverse behavioral phenotyping assays
efficiently and accurately for the CSNA. The overall objective of the BPC is to support the CSNA and external
investigators with cost-effective, large-scale centralization and execution of behavioral phenotyping in mice. The
Specific Aims of the BPC are: 1) To provide high-throughput behavioral phenotyping capabilities for addiction-
related traits in genetically diverse mouse populations using our highly advanced, multidimensional, and
streamlined phenotyping platform; 2) To adapt and deploy new phenotyping assays to extend the
characterization of addiction-related traits; and 3) To support the dissemination of Core datasets, protocols,
resources, phenotyping capabilities and expertise. The BPC will interact closely with the other two CSNA cores,
including the Integrative Genetics and Genomics Core to perform multivariate data analysis and integrate
behavioral data with genetic information, and the Mouse Resources and Validation Core to receive validation
cohorts for behavioral testing. In addition, through the CSNA, external investigators will be provided access to
the BPC facilities, and expertise and training in behavioral experimentation. The BPC will make testing protocols
and data available to the research community through the Mouse Phenome Database, a publicly accessible
repository curated at JAX."

The Mouse Resources and Validation Core (MRVC) at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) provides
centralized mouse production and model development for the Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction
(CSNA). Mouse resources include the Collaborative Cross (CC) and Diversity Outbred (DO) populations, in
addition to the large JAX mouse repository of over 7,000 unique mouse strains. The MRVC will provide the
expertise and resources for validation of candidate genes through the creation of genetically engineered mouse
models and cell lines. Taking advantage of existing infrastructure in the JAX Repository, the MRVC will serve as
a centralized repository for novel mouse models of addiction generated by the CSNA to support the research
and mission of the CSNA. The Specific Aims of the MRVC are: 1) To support the Behavioral Phenotyping Core
and the Research Projects by providing cohorts of Collaborative Cross strains, Diversity Outbred mice, and
genetically engineered strains from resident JAX colonies for expanded phenotyping assays. 2) To provide
capacity for in vivo validation through the production of genetically engineered strains using CRISPR/Cas9
methods for in vivo validation of putative functional variants, and for the creation of new tool strains. 3) To serve
as a centralized repository for genetically engineered models created by the Center. The repository will archive

10879007,"PROJECT SUMMARY IMPULSIVITY (PROJECT 1)
Impulsivity describes a heightened propensity to engage in excessive reward pursuit or consumption, perhaps
resulting from unusually strong motivational urges to obtain the reward and/or difficulty with reasoning about the
consequences of, or suppressing, reward-related behaviors. High levels of impulsivity segregate with
recreational and clinically impairing drug use in humans, including the initiation of misuse, escalation into
repetitive and habitual use and attempts to achieve and maintain abstinence. Impulsive behaviors can both
predict susceptibility for relatively greater drug self-administration in both humans and animal models and result
from experience with stimulant drugs of abuse. The overall objective of Project 1 is to identify genetic, genomic
and neurobiological mechanisms contributing to individual differences in impulsive behaviors that may be
relevant to addiction. The scientific synergy made possible through collaboration with investigators, projects and
cores within the CSNA is designed to generate insights into the genetic correlations between impulsivity and
other biobehavioral risk factors for addiction, novel genetic variations and gene expression mechanisms
associated with reinforcement learning and impulsivity, and neural mechanisms by which the identified variants
act to influence behavior. Using the high diversity Collaborative Cross (CC) and Diversity Outbred (DO) lines
that represent powerful polygenic models of trait variation, we will: 1) assess shared mechanisms among
measures of impulsivity and novelty-related behaviors, psychomotor and incentive sensitization to cocaine and
cocaine IVSA and 2) identify molecular mechanisms underlying variation in impulsive behavior using gene
expression correlations and genetic mapping. We will also design, create and phenotype engineered CC strains
reliably exhibiting variable behavioral phenotypes to test the role for candidate genes in regulating impulsive
behaviors and underlying neurobiology. These analyses represent one of the deepest phenotypic and genomic
analysis of impulsivity yet conducted and will expose new biological influences on inter-individual differences in
addiction liability."
10879009,"PROJECT SUMMARY SENSITIZATION (PROJECT 2)
Most people who use cocaine do not go on to develop a cocaine use disorder (CUD) suggesting that individual
differences drive susceptibility to addiction. The progression from initial drug use to drug dependence is driven,
in part, by genetic differences but there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of the genetic and biological
etiologies underlying CUD. Individual differences in behavioral and neurobiological changes that occur in
response to repeated drug exposure have been associated with CUD risk. In rodents, repeated psychostimulant
exposure progressively augments locomotor activation – a phenomenon referred to as behavioral or
psychomotor sensitization. Repeated exposure to drugs of abuse that yields psychomotor sensitization also
alters the reward circuitry and results in hypersensitivity to the incentive motivational effects of drugs and drug-
associated stimuli (incentive sensitization). Although psychomotor sensitization is often used as an indirect
measure of underlying neuroadaptations, direct comparisons between individual variation in psychomotor
sensitization and incentive sensitization have not been reported. The overall objective of Project 2 is to identify
neurogenetic mechanisms contributing to individual differences in cocaine sensitization that may be relevant to
patterns of drug use. Using our high-throughput screening regimen for behavioral sensitization developed over
the current funding period, and implemented in the Behavioral Phenotyping Core, we found significant
phenotypic variation in behavioral sensitization across 50 Collaborative Cross (CC) strains. We also identified
CC strains with extreme phenotypes in cocaine-induced locomotor sensitivity and demonstrated that these
strains exhibit divergent phenotypes in cocaine self-administration (Project 3). In this renewal, our research goals
will be achieved with the following three aims: 1) To establish the relationship between behavioral and incentive
sensitization in CC strains. In collaboration with the Behavioral Phenotyping Core, we will measure incentive
sensitization in the same 50 CC strains. These studies will enable us to understand how strain variation in
behavioral sensitization relates to differences in the motivational salience of cocaine. 2) To evaluate potential
mechanisms for behavioral phenotypes observed in the CC. In collaboration with the Integrated Genetics and
Genomics Core, we will characterize CC strains with extreme phenotypes to identify biological mechanisms that
contribute to behavioral differences. 3) To validate candidate genes by studying behavioral sensitization and
other CSNA behaviors in genetically engineered mouse models. In collaboration with the Mouse Resources and
Validation Core, we will engineer overexpression and knockout models of Eed to test the role of this candidate
gene in behavioral sensitization. We will also continue mapping efforts using our Diversity Outbred (DO)
phenotype data to identify additional candidate genes for evaluation."
10916559,"Project Summary/Abstract
Bereavement support is a core tenet of comprehensive palliative care. Yet, accessible, evidence-based
interventions are limited, particularly for bereaved parents. Losing a child to cancer is one of the most
devastating experiences a parent can endure. Bereaved parents are at higher risk for numerous poor mental
and physical health outcomes, including prolonged grief (PG), depression, reduced quality of life, existential
distress, decreased work productivity, adverse health behaviors, and even death. Despite their suffering,
bereaved parents report emotional and logistical barriers to returning to the institution where their child was
treated and do not know where to turn for support in their communities, resulting in underutilization of services.
The need for empirically-supported, conceptually sound, acceptable, and accessible interventions for bereaved
parents is clear. Grief researchers have long emphasized the therapeutic value of facilitating meaning-making
to improve bereavement outcomes. However, meaning-based interventions have not been empirically
evaluated for grieving parents. To address this, we developed a manualized intervention, Meaning-Centered
Grief Therapy (MCGT), for this critically at-risk and underserved population. Our pilot randomized controlled
trial (RCT) comparing MCGT to supportive psychotherapy (SP), the most commonly received grief therapy,
showed that MCGT outperformed SP for parents with higher baseline PG levels, improving PG, depression,
anxiety, hopelessness, and quality of life domains. It also showed that telehealth delivery in parents’ homes
was feasible and could reduce access-to-care barriers. In the wake of COVID-19, telehealth grief interventions
are needed now more than ever, and yet evidence is scant. To improve the quality of home-based palliative
care through enhanced bereavement services, the objective of the proposed mixed methods, multisite 3-arm
RCT is to build on our prior work and examine which grief interventions delivered in the home via telehealth
work best for whom and why. We will compare the efficacy of MCGT to SP and enhanced usual care (EUC) for
bereaved parents with elevated PG symptoms. Primary outcomes will be reduced PG and depression
symptoms. We will randomize 265 bereaved parents recruited from four institutions and the community to
MCGT, SP, or EUC. We will embed qualitative interviews concurrently with quantitative measures, which is an
innovation in grief intervention research. Self-report measures, as well as blinded diagnostic interviews to
increase rigor, will be given at multiple time points through 6 months post-intervention. We will conduct
qualitative interviews about the interventions’ impact in a purposively sampled subset (n=48). The specific aims
of this trial are: 1) to compare the efficacy of MCGT, SP, and EUC in reducing PG and depression symptoms in
bereaved parents, 2) to contextualize quantitative findings with qualitative data, and 3) to explore mediators
and moderators of outcomes. The long-term goal of our research is to identify an effective, accessible
telehealth grief intervention that improves suffering in the bereaved as part of comprehensive palliative care."

10890787,"Project Summary
HIF2α is arguably the most important driver of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common kidney
cancer type. Discovered at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) and regarded as undruggable, structural
studies revealed a vulnerability that was exploited leading to the identification of small molecule inhibitors and
the founding of a biotech company, Peloton Therapeutics, Inc., which developed several analogues (PT2385,
PT2399 and PT2977). PT drugs bind to HIF2α leading to its dissociation from its obligatory partner HIF1β,
thereby inhibiting HIF2-mediated transcription. Preclinical and clinical work during the previous funding period
advanced the field significantly. Using tumorgraft (TG) models of patient ccRCCs transplanted in mice, we
showed that: HIF2 is a valid target; approximately 50% of ccRCC are dependent on HIF2; HIF2-sensitive tumors
are characterized by high HIF2α, which may serve as a biomarker; and resistance develops as a result of
acquired HIF2α mutations. In addition, we led accrual to the phase 1 trial, which showed that PT2385 was well
tolerated and active. Furthermore, we showed that: (i) PT2385 specifically targeted HIF2 in patient tumors (but
not HIF1); (ii) HIF2 targeting resulted in inhibition of HIF2 target genes; and (iii) prolonged therapy led to the
acquisition of resistance mutations we predicted in TGs. These data identified HIF2α as the first core dependency
in ccRCC. The success of the program culminated with the approval by the FDA of PT2977 (belzutifan). For the
next funding period, we seek to co-develop: (i) an siRNA-based HIF2α drug (siHIF2α) that targets both wild-type
and resistant-mutant HIF2α; and (ii) a molecular imaging tool that can enable non-invasive HIF2α monitoring in
patients. Developed by Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Inc., siHIF2α is a synthetic, stabilized, chemically modified,
double-stranded RNAi trigger specifically targeting HIF2α mRNA conjugated to a high-affinity ligand for integrins
αvβ3 and αvβ5, which are broadly expressed in ccRCC. siHIF2α will be co-developed with a novel imaging tool
we generated to enable HIF2α quantification, and which will be deployed to measure siRNA-mediated target
depletion. We leveraged the high specificity of PT2385 and by substituting a native fluorine atom converted it
into a PET radiotracer ([18F]PT2385). Since the original submission a year ago, we received an IND for
([18F]PT2385), obtained IRB approval, and began dosimetry studies in humans. We also advanced the siHIF2α
phase 1 trial to the last planned cohort revealing good tolerability, showing that siHIF2α downregulates HIF2α in
patient tumor biopsies, and providing preliminary evidence of activity. Having successfully launched a HIF2α
inhibitor, now FDA approved, we propose to develop a second-generation inhibitor targeting wild-type and drug-
resistant HIF2α. If successful, this may lead to a new drug for ccRCC and possibly the first siRNA-based
therapeutic in oncology."

For reasons unknown, Texas has one of the highest incidence rates of kidney cancer in the US. UT Southwestern
Medical Center (UTSW), together with its affiliates, the county hospital, Parkland Memorial Hospital (staffed by
UTSW faculty), and Texas Health Resources, cares for 57% of all new kidney cancer patients in the Dallas-Fort
Worth metroplex. At UTSW Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center (SCCC), kidney cancer is the 5th most
common tumor type. In 2013, the Kidney Cancer Program (KCP) was inaugurated. Recognized with a Leaders
in Clinical Excellence Program Award and a finalist for the metroplex Innovation in Healthcare Award, the KCP
has been a trailblazer. Directed by Dr. Brugarolas, and with the goal to promote collaborative, interdisciplinary
research to translate discovery and technical innovation at UTSW, the KCP provides a foundation for the
UTSW Kidney SPORE and serves as a vehicle for its integration within UTSW/SCCC. As the coordinating hub
of the SPORE, the Administrative Core provides essential administrative services and organizational support to
the SPORE as a whole. The Director of the Core, Dr. Brugarolas, will continue to provide overall direction and
scientific leadership, promote multidisciplinary interactions, and oversee fiscal management and reporting. His
scientific background, experience across the research continuum and administrative roles enable him to serve
as an effective overall SPORE PI and Director of the Administrative Core. Dr. Kapur, Co-Leader of the KCP and
previously SPORE PI successor, has been promoted to SPORE PI and Core A Co-Director. Dr. Conacci-Sorrell,
an underrepresented minority and Co-Leader of the CEP, will also be joining the Administrative Core as Co-
Director. An Executive Committee comprised of representatives from all Projects and Cores provides advice on
SPORE strategic directions, departmental and administrative interactions, faculty recruitment, and resource
allocation. A Patient Advocacy team representing the spectrum of the cancer experience (from current patients
to cancer survivors and caregivers) is actively engaged in leading community and educational events,
fundraising, and perhaps most inspiringly, volunteering at SCCC clinics to assist other patients. An Internal
Advisory Board made up of institutional leaders serves as a sounding board, and an External Advisory Board
of leaders in their fields with complementary expertise assists by evaluating progress and providing input on
future directions. The KCP/SPORE benefits from a strong commitment from both UTSW and the SCCC with
each committing $200,000 yearly to promote kidney cancer research, thereby extending the reach of the CEP
and DRP programs, as well as $1,100,000 in recruitment funds. Core A will continue to fulfill its objectives through
the following Aims. Aim 1: Partnering with the SCCC and UTSW to advance a program of excellence in kidney
cancer. Aim 2: Serving and engaging the kidney cancer patient population. Aim 3: Furthering a state-of-the-art
translational kidney cancer research program. Aim 4: Recruiting investigators through successful Developmental
Research and Career Enhancement Programs. Aim 5: Supporting and leading national initiatives."

Metabolic reprogramming in cancer is an attractive source of therapeutic targets because it fuels tumor growth
and metastasis through enzymes that are in principle amenable to inhibition with small molecules. Metabolic
reprogramming is intrinsic to renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In fact, few tumors are as profoundly linked to metabolic
derangement as RCC and in particular, clear cell RCC (ccRCC). This is shown by: the clear cell phenotype,
which arises from lipid/glycogen accumulation; direct metabolic reprogramming by the ccRCC signature event,
VHL inactivation; and the observation that germline mutations in metabolic enzymes cause RCC, but few other
tumor types. The two main barriers to targeting metabolic reprograming are the lack of knowledge about RCC
metabolism in patients and the absence of validated translational platforms. To address these challenges, we
executed 5 major activities in Years 1 – 5. First, we pioneered intraoperative infusions of 13C-labeled nutrients in
patients to directly report on RCC metabolism in humans, which revealed, among others, suppressed glucose
oxidation. Second, we showed, mechanistically, that suppressed glucose oxidation is due to deficient oxidative
phosphorylation. Third, we determined that additive-free, orthotopically implanted, patient tumors (tumorgrafts,
TG) are valid models to study human RCC metabolism. Fourth, we established the In Vivo Metabolism Lab,
an innovative translational platform to detect metabolic reprogramming in human tumors, nominate therapeutic
strategies, test them in TG models and primary human tumor tissue, and advance the most promising leads.
Fifth, we demonstrated that both primary ccRCC tumors and metastases use glutamine to maintain redox
balance and produce essential biosynthetic intermediates. Building upon discoveries by us and others implicating
glutamine in cancer, the CB-839 glutaminase inhibitor was developed. However, results in ccRCC trials have
been disappointing. One possible explanation is that glutaminase is only one of several enzymes that catabolize
glutamine. Our new data not only explain CB-839 lack of efficacy, but also identify new opportunities for
intervention. Indeed, while CB-839 inhibits carbon metabolism by targeting glutaminase, glutamine is also a
source of nitrogen in RCC, which is processed via amidotransferases, which are not inhibited by CB-839. In
preliminary data, we show that pan-glutamine inhibition with JHU-083 not only effectively inhibits
amidotransferase reactions, but also significantly blocks ccRCC TG growth. To advance effective glutamine
targeting to the clinic, in Years 6 – 10, we will pursue the following Aims. Aim 1. Probing the role of
amidotransferases in mediating resistance to CB-839 glutaminase inhibitor. Aim 2. Targeting IDH enzymes to
maximize glutamine blockade. Aim 3. To maximize the impact of glutamine targeting by leveraging the tumor
microenvironment using next-generation models."

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have the potential to cure patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
For those experiencing a complete response (CR), induction Ipilimumab (Ipi)/ Nivolumab (Nivo) followed by
maintenance Nivo results in overall survival (OS) rates of 97% at 4 years. However, CR rates occur in ~10% of
patients. Survival rates plummet in patients with progressive disease (PD) and even stable disease (SD). Despite
Nivo maintenance, patients with SD after induction (36%) show significantly reduced 4-year OS rates (55% vs
97%). While by comparison to PD patients (OS rates ~20%), patients with SD derive some benefit from ICI, the
full potential of immunotherapy is not realized. We hypothesize that the addition of complementary immune
strategies will increase responses and eventually cure rates for patients with SD after induction. This represents
an unmet medical need. Most immunotherapy approaches to date have focused on amplifying an adaptive
immune response (i.e., ICI), but more effective strategies may result from simultaneously activating the innate
and adaptive immune arms as it normally occurs physiologically. To unleash the full potential of the immune
system, we propose to induce innate immunity by stimulating antigen presentation (through immunogenic cell
death triggered by stereotactic radiation) and promoting inflammation (with a novel STING agonist we
discovered). Pioneering research at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW) identified a novel innate immune-
sensing pathway, the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway, leading to the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences in 2019
and the development of IMSA101, a novel STING agonist. A phase 1 trial of IMSA101 (NCT04020185) at UTSW
and elsewhere showed that IMSA101 is safe and active. Herein, we propose a novel adaptive clinical trial to
evaluate the impact of stereotactic ablative radiation (SAbR)/ IMSA101 added to standard-of-care (SOC) Nivo
maintenance in patients with SD following induction Ipi/Nivo to harness the full potential of the immune system.
To accomplish this goal, we will conduct a randomized phase 2 trial comparing this regimen to SOC maintenance
Nivo. The study is powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference in response rates from 5% to 35%, which
can be accomplished with 50 patients. We will explore the impact of the intervention through pharmacodynamic
studies involving not only sophisticated tissue analyses, but also an innovative PD-L1 PET. We are uniquely
positioned to carry out these studies given: (i) the discovery of the cGAS-cGAMP-STING pathway and
development of IMSA101; (ii) our pioneering development of SAbR applications for RCC with possibly the largest
SAbR RCC program globally; (iii) our prior success executing clinical trials combining SAbR with ICI in RCC
patients; and (iv) our pioneering work leveraging PD-L1 PET in renal cancer. If successful, this study will harness
the full potential of the immune system through simultaneous activation of the innate and adaptive arms of the
immune system in a patient population with modest benefit from ICI and which represents an unmet medical
need."

The aims of the Biospecimen and Pathology Resources (BPR) Core (Core B) are to facilitate the storage and
distribution of comprehensively annotated, high-quality biospecimens and their derivatives, and to provide
professional and technical pathology services to the principal investigators and collaborators of our SPORE and
Kidney Cancer Program. All three SPORE projects utilize Core B, which is critical to achieving their aims. It is
an indispensable component of our SPORE and leverages and expands (without duplicating) existing pathology
resources in our National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. We
deliver basic histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), tissue microarrays, whole slide
imaging, image analysis, and laser-capture microdissection services, and make available unique cancer tissue
derivatives such as primary cancer cell cultures and cell lines, cryopreserved tissues, DNA, RNA, and patient-
derived xenografts (PDX or tumorgrafts, TG). These efforts are complemented by several national initiatives led
by the Core. This Core provides expertise in histomorphologic evaluation of human kidney tumors, human
tumorgrafts in mice, kidney tumors in transgenic and knockout animal models, and in the interpretation of IHC
and ISH and multiplex immunoassays. The BPR Core develops IHC and molecular assays and has experience
in the deployment of CLIA-certified laboratory tests, such as our PD-L1 IHC. The BPR Core currently has fresh-
frozen renal tumor and paired-normal kidney (or blood) tissues for >1,700 racially and ethnically diverse patients;
a unique live-tissue repository of >1,900 kidney tumor tissues preserved viable in DMSO for mechanistic studies
to address questions arising from genomic and other studies of inert tissues; >200 independent TG lines; 47
primary tumor cell lines representing a wide variety of tumors; and integrated genomic analyses (exome
sequencing, RNA-Seq and SNP arrays) of >500 RCC patients. Specimen data is linked to the institutional tissue
bank, and to comprehensive patient clinical data through Kidney Cancer Explorer (Core C). The BPR Core
provides routine quality control for SPORE investigators to ensure that the tissues are optimal, and several of
our protocols have been published in Nature Protocols and serve as benchmarks in the fields of tissue processing
for integrated genomic analyses and TG utilization for preclinical drug testing. Our repository has had significant
utilization, with >1,000 samples having been shipped to collaborators both internally, as well as externally. TGs
have been extensively utilized to evaluate RCC drug sensitivity, study radiation responsiveness, explore tumor
biomarkers, understand cancer biology (including rare syndromes), and dissect metabolic derangements in
RCC. Studies with these tissues have been published in high-impact journals such as Nature Genetics, Nature
Communications, and Lancet Oncology. Our Core promotes flourishing collaborations among our SPORE
investigators, investigators from other SPOREs, and other investigators in academia and industry."

 Most effective tumor treatments target multiple cellular mechanisms. This proposal will explore a
previously under-appreciated cellular mechanism in cancer biology using a newly developed high throughput
sequencing technology. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are adaptor molecules that read the genetic code for protein
biosynthesis. tRNAs are essential for gene expression, an emerging source of cancer-related biomarkers, and
a treasure trove of epitranscriptomic marks from both human and disease-associated microbes. tRNAs are
dysregulated in many cancers. Due to technical difficulties, tRNA biology and its implications in clinical cancer
care have lagged far behind other DNA and RNA-based approaches. We recently developed a new technology
called Multiplex Small RNA-seq (MSR-seq) which makes feasible for the first time clinical-scale tRNA studies.
Specific Aim 1 will further expand the capability and scope of MSR-seq for clinical samples. Colorectal cancer
(CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the US. Chemotherapy regimens have not
substantively changed in a decade, are unnecessary for 50% of patients, and ineffective in another 30%.
Currently there is no way to categorize patients ahead of time. Recent studies provide evidence that gut bacteria
can influence growth and metastasis of colorectal tumors. Interactions between tumors and commensal gut
microbes provide a new lens to understand the biology of CRC and a new opportunity to identify patients at risk
for cancer recurrence and patients who have no need to endure chemotherapy. Specific Aim 2 will apply MSR-
seq to screen a biobank of blood, biopsy, and stool samples from CRC patients, and to study a murine model of
CRC recurrence. This combination of a unique biobank with a new technology has potential to transform how
CRC is treated and explores the complex host-microbe interactions in a human disease."

The National Cancer Institute prioritized the need to improve IP team-based cancer care. Aligned with these

Our research centers on one modifiable dimension of team communication, information sharing through EHRs, with these aims: Aim 1: Develop new measures of within- and between-group EHR communication in cancer care MTSs. Aim 2: Determine the associations of targeted EHR communication structures with cancer care quality outcomes, specifically potentially preventable ED visits and unplanned hospitalizations. Aim 3: Develop ML-assisted visual analytics and prototype tools to (a) characterize MTSs, and (b) predict patients with EHR communication structures associated with poor quality outcomes. We will extract EHR data of patients with stage II or III breast, colorectal, and non-small cell lung cancer at three study sites (N=2,746). For each patient, using time-stamped EHR access-log data, we will construct a weighted communication network of her/his cancer care MTS to measure within- and between-group communication scores. We will apply zero-inflated Poisson models to analyze the associations of targetd EHR network structures with quality outcomes, controlling for medical complexity and social determinants of health. Leveraging Aim 2 results, and to lay the critical groundwork for Aim 3, we will conduct interviews and focus groups with HCPs, patients, and caregivers (N=90), to gain a more in-depth understanding of EHR communication structures. We will apply and extend graph neural networks (GNN) to predict patients who have EHR communication structures associated with poor outcomes as well as provide the reasoning behind the prediction. Furthermore, we will develop an algorithm to recommend potential communication structure changes that significantly reduce risk. This study addresses the National Research Council report underscoring the central role of visual analytics to support cognition, decision-making, and workflow optimization in healthcare. In a subsequent study, we will evaluate the effectiveness of ML-assisted visual analytics tools at improving patient outcomes and reducing costs."

The human brain exhibits profound diversity in biological function and vulnerability to disease. Despite the

cellular and molecular substrates. In this work we will leverage new technologies in single-cell and spatial
genomics to construct an Atlas of Human Brain Cell Variation. We will analyze tens of millions of cells from more
than 200 people by single-nucleus RNA-seq and single-nucleus ATAC-seq, and a subset of these by spatial
transcriptomics. Analysis of these data will seek to understand: the static versus dynamic molecular and spatial
features of each cell type; the ways in which human genetic variation shapes the molecular repertoire of each
cell type; and the constellations of cellular and molecular features that co-vary, appearing together in the same
brains. We seek especially with this work to understand the functional connections between these phenotypes
and: (i) the gene regulatory processes that drive and shape it; (ii) genetic variation associated with brain
diseases; and (iii) structural brain variation measured in hundreds of neuroimaging studies. The project will
deliver an essential data resource for cellular, molecular, genetic and translational neuroscience – while
expanding our understanding of the ways the human brain varies across different people."

The GI tract recruits lymphocytes from the blood to establish an immune barrier to pathogens, while enforcing
tolerance to self and, after birth, to food antigens and enteric bacteria. ""Natural"" (unconventional) thymus-
derived T cells of the intraepithelial compartment (IEL) comprise the most abundant T cell pool in the adult and
neonatal intestines, and yet how they are recruited to the colon and small intestines, why they populate the GI
tract before birth, and their roles in epithelial homeostasis and pathogen resistance in the perinatal period
remain incompletely understood. The objective of the current proposal is to define mechanisms of innate-like T
cell trafficking to the GI tract in fetal and perinatal life, and to establish the role(s) of these receptors, and of the
specialized IEL T cell subsets they control, in intestinal development and immunity.
 In Aim1 we will identify the major innate T cell subsets in the mouse fetal intestines, determine the
chemoattractant receptors that recruit them into the SI and colon from the thymus, and define their function in
the prenatal gut environment. We will manipulate fetal T cell recruitment in vivo and perform organoid co-
culture ex vivo to test the hypothesis that specialized fetal T cells drive maturation of the intestinal epithelium
and program epithelial defenses in preparation for birth. In Aim 2 we will establish the importance of these
mechanisms and T cells in pathogen responses in models of neonatal viral and bacterial infection. In Aim 3 we
will identify human innate T cell counterparts of the major mouse fetal colon T cell, as defined by common
developmental trajectories; shared gene programs, homing receptor profiles and cytokine responses; and
common functions in intestinal epithelial differentiation. We will employ innovative approaches and develop
new protocols and tools to address these aims. Results from these studies will significantly advance our
understanding of the cells, pathways and mechanisms that prepare the fetal GI tract for microbial assault at
birth. These insights could lead to novel diagnostic, therapeutic or preventative strategies targeting neonatal
immunity."

Loss of sensory hair cells and/or innervating neurons in the cochlea causes irreversible hearing loss in
humans. However, progress on research for realizing biological restoration of hearing has been hampered due
to the paucity of human cochlear tissues. My laboratory recently developed a novel organoid system to
generate inner ear sensory epithelia containing functional sensory hair cells from aggregates of human
pluripotent stem cells in 3D culture. While these first-generation organoids are a valuable tool for studying
human inner ear development, they only generate hair cells with structural and functional properties of native
vestibular hair cells and fail to produce any cochlear cell types. Another limitation with our original system is the
lack of central nervous system components. To overcome these limitations, we aim at developing a next-
generation human microphysiological system that more faithfully recapitulates development of the auditory
periphery and brainstem. In Aim 1, we will carry out genetic programming and a small-scale CRISPR screen to
increase the number of outer hair cells arising in cochlear organoids. The identity of derived hair cells will be
validated by single-cell electrophysiology, electron microscopy and single-cell RNA-sequencing. Additionally,
maturation of derived hair cells will be promoted by thyroid hormone treatments. In Aim 2, we will establish
novel human cochlear-hindbrain assembloids and assess afferent neural circuit development in these
assembloids. In Aim 3, we will develop dynamic/tunable hydrogels and test if introducing a spatial gradient of
stiffness in the microenvironment during organoid formation can affect tissue patterning or cellular
differentiation. Spatial gradients of signaling molecules will be also introduced in hydrogels to test if the dorso-
ventral axis formation can be recapitulated during organoid differentiation. The outcome of this study will
provide a paradigm-changing approach for studying normal and pathological development of cochlear hair
cells and their ascending neural circuits."

Heart failure (HF) remains a major health problem and significant mortality in the United States. While defects in
mitochondrial function are strongly implicated in the pathophysiology of HF, no mitochondrial-targeted therapy
has been successful in the clinic to date, indicating that we still do not possess sufficient understanding of the
mechanisms connecting mitochondrial dysfunction and HF development. Normal mitochondrial functions rely on
maintaining the inner membrane potential (m). In the cardiomyocyte (CM), m perturbations not only directly
affect ATP production, but also influence a variety of signaling pathways that modulate redox balance, Ca2+
homeostasis, and mitochondrial quality control. However, to what extent and how the loss of CM m alone
impairs cardiac energetics, contractility, and electrical activity (i.e., hallmarks of HF) remains poorly defined. This
is due, in part, to a lack of methods for effectively and selectively manipulating CM mitochondria in the in vivo
setting. Existing pharmacological approaches to depolarize m lack both cell (CM versus non-CM) and organ
(cardiac versus non-cardiac) specificity. To overcome this technical barrier, we developed an innovative
mitochondrial-targeted luminoptogenetic (termed mLumOpto) technology and demonstrated that it can induce
dynamic, selective CM m depolarization both in vitro and in vivo, with luciferase-luciferin pair-emitted
intracellular bioluminescent illumination. The primary goal of this proposal is to utilize the mLumOpto technology
to directly induce CM-specific m depolarization in intact hearts, and delineate the acute (i.e. <24 hours) and
chronic (i.e. 2 weeks) impacts on cardiac functions. Our hypothesis is that CM-specific m depolarization alone
is sufficient to induce adverse cardiac remodeling and HF development, which will be tested with the following
Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1 will fully characterize mLumOpto-mediated m depolarization in isolated adult
CMs (ACMs) in vitro, and establish luciferin dose dependency. How the mLumOpto-mediated m depolarization
acutely and chronically impacts ACM function and health, respectively, will be dissected. Specific Aim 2 will
determine the acute effect of CM-specific m depolarization in intact hearts. First, mLumOpto-mediated in vivo
CM-specific m depolarization will be determined. Then, the acute effects of CM m depolarization on cardiac
metabolism, pump function, and electrophysiology in intact hearts will be examined both ex vivo and in vivo.
Specific Aim 3 will delineate the chronic effects of moderate CM m depolarization on cardiac remodeling (at
gravimetric, histologic, biochemical, electrophysiological, and molecular levels) that lead to contractile
dysfunction and HF development. The reversibility of CM m depolarization-induced HF will also be examined.
Successful completion of this research will lead to not only an innovative technology for dynamic control of CM
mitochondria in freely-moving animals, but also new findings that will lead us to novel avenues for the
development and translation of future mitochondrial-targeted HF therapies."

 Extracellular pH is a highly dynamic and ubiquitous signal and many cell types exhibit robust
electrophysiological responses upon extracellular acidification, particularly in the nervous system. Acid-sensing
ion channels (ASICs) are thought to mediate the majority of these responses since various ASIC subunits are
expressed at high levels in many neuronal types and genetic ablation of ASIC subunits dramatically reduces
acid-evoked responses. Consequently, ASICs are vital players in cell death following ischemic stroke. However,
ASICs are more than simply an `extracellular acid alarm'. Genetic deletion, or pharmacological manipulation, of
specific ASIC subunits can produce a wide array of phenotypes ranging from attenuated fear learning, deficits
in pain and mechanosensation, problems in cardiac autonomic regulation and the baroreflex and impairment of
the epithelial to mesenchymal transition in various cancer cells. These myriad roles of ASICs have motivated
structural and biophysical investigation, leading to crystal or cryo-EM structures of chicken ASIC1 in the resting,
toxin-stabilized open and desensitized states. This structural data, combined with functional experiments, have
led to a general outline of how ASICs function. Briefly, protonation of key acidic residues in the extracellular
domain, in regions known as the palm domain and the acidic pocket, leads to global rearrangements of the
extracellular domain as well as channel gating. Yet we lack a clear picture of the molecular events linking
protonation with these observed conformational changes and activation or desensitization. To address this gap
in our knowledge, we will combine electrophysiology with the power of photo-responsive non-canonical amino
acids to test specific molecular hypotheses of protonation-gating coupling. In addition, there has been no
structural data for the ASIC intracellular domains. To address this gap, we will employ a combination of
fluorescence lifetime imaging, as well as patch clamp FRET to map the overall topology and motions of the
intracellular domain using innovative methods of site specific labelling. Finally, despite some reports of ASIC
protein-protein interactions and signal transduction capacity, we lack a clear picture of how ASICs scaffold with
other proteins. We will address this final knowledge gap using targeted protein labeling and downstream analysis
of interactions. Taken together, these proposed experiments will provide new insights into the operation of these
important signaling entities, and may help guide drug development."

 Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and, at present, an irreversible neurode-
generative disease with an ever-increasing disease burden in the United States. Clinical management and de-
velopment of novel therapeutics for AD will beneﬁt from reproducible, robust and non-invasive markers of early in
vivo AD pathology, but no such tools are well-established in routine clinical practice. Quantitative magnetization
transfer (qMT) is an MRI based technique for detecting microstructural tissue changes such as demyelination and
the presence of macromolecules, including amyloid beta protein. This sensitivity to multiple aspects of the amy-
loid/tau/neurodegeneration framework offers a promising diagnostic alternative to amyloid PET in a single, rapid
and high-resolution imaging exam. My preliminary ﬁndings suggest that, using the theory of hybrid state free
precession developed in my research group, qMT images can be acquired in vivo in 12 minutes at 1mm isotropic
resolution with good SNR. Additionally, by direct comparison to PET in a cognitively normal but amyloid positive
subject, qMT appears to be sensitive to the early accumulation of amyloid beta and conﬁrms previous literature
reports of increased qMT exchange rates in AD. My proposal aims to solve the remaining technical challenges
surrounding qMT by optimizing the acquisition for improved sensitivity to amyloid beta (Aim 1) and developing
a neural network based reconstruction pipeline to substantially reduce the post-processing time and improve its
robustness to magnetic ﬁeld inhomogeneities (Aim 2), which create biases in the quantitative parameters. These
biases are particularly important to curtail in the deep brain, where the accumulation of amyloid beta is purported
to begin in AD. In Aim 3, I will perform a pilot study to compare the proposed qMT method's sensitivity for in
vivo amyloid beta in a cognitively normal population directly to amyloid PET. Together, this will establish qMT as a
surrogate marker for in vivo amyloid and motivate further clinical studies on its utility in monitoring AD progression
and response to therapy."

 Sleep disorders, including insomnia, are likely present in up to a third of older patients before surgery,
but most remain untreated. Increasing evidence suggests insomnia-related sleep disturbances greatly impede
recovery, including vulnerability to neurocognitive disorders (NCD), the most common surgical complication in
older adults. Once diagnosed, up to half can progress to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias
(ADRD) within five years. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) has been the first-line therapy to
improve sleep for over a decade. It can reduce anxiety, improve pain tolerance and enhance physical and
cognitive function. Yet, no form of it is currently an option before surgery. This proposal involves the Sleep
Optimization for Brain Health Outcomes in Older Surgical Patients (SLEEP-BOOST) trial to establish the
feasibility and explore the efficacy of an abbreviated, digital CBT-I intervention (dCBT-I) in older surgery patients
with insomnia symptoms. Our central hypothesis is that decreasing insomnia-related sleep disruption is feasible
before surgery, improves sleep, and promotes cognitive resilience.
 To test this, we have developed a pragmatic dCBT-I protocol found to be effective for sleep, anxiety, and
depression at 2 weeks as part of an app-based program synchronized to an actigraphy watch and self-
administered with scheduled guidance by trained non-specialists supervised by a sleep physician. We prioritize
key components that can be implemented quickly: sleep hygiene education (SHE), stimulus control, sleep
consolidation, cognitive restructuring, and relaxation techniques. We will randomize 50 older adults (>65y)
undergoing elective orthopedic joint surgery who have at least moderate insomnia by the Insomnia Severity
Index 1:1 to dCBT-I (4 hybrid sessions 30-60 mins) or control (SHE only plus usual care). This surgical population
is ideal for many reasons: 1) insomnia symptoms are highly prevalent, 2) pain, depression, and anxiety are
comorbid with insomnia, 3) sufficient time before surgery (~3 weeks), and 4) low surgical/patient variability has
led to an established pipeline of NIH-funded NCD studies from the PI’s department.
 Guided by strong preliminary data, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1) Establish the feasibility of
the dCBT-I protocol in older surgical patients with insomnia symptoms, and 2) Examine the effects of dCBT-I on
sleep and cognitive trajectory after surgery. Significance: This proposal addresses a key gap in improving sleep
in older persons undergoing major surgery. It is a meaningful way to develop a pilot sleep intervention that is the
gold standard for insomnia outside the perioperative period. Innovation: Few studies have leveraged this unique,
multidisciplinary approach to test an existing intervention now tailored to surgical patients. Impact: Successful
completion will accrue early-stage clinical pilot data for the feasibility of sleep improvement in a highly burdened
surgical cohort."
10890905,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Mutations in the calcium channel Cav1.2 and downstream calcium signaling proteins in the calcineurin (CaN)/
NFAT pathway, in particular the kinase Dyrk1a, have been reproducibly associated with neuropsychiatric
disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). These genetic findings implicate calcium signaling
dysfunction in psychiatric disease and underscore a critical gap in our knowledge of how calcium signals are
initiated and transduced in the developing brain. Our long-term goal is to understand how intracellular calcium
elevations in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) direct their differentiation into neurons and glia, with an eye
towards uncovering how mutations in calcium signaling proteins alter their developmental functions to promote
disease. In this proposal, we focus on two distinct aspects of calcium signaling: detectors and sensors that
initiate calcium responses to extrinsic cues or depletion of intracellular calcium stores, and molecular pathways
that act as downstream transducers of calcium signals.
 We have found that utilization of two disease-relevant Cav1.2 exons is dynamically regulated in the
embryonic cortex, and that an ASD-associated mutation in Cav1.2 prevents this developmental splicing switch
in channel transcripts, which in turn alters the differentiation of specific cortical neuron subtypes. Similarly, we
have also found that splicing of STIM2, a calcium sensor involved in store operated calcium entry (SOCE) in
response to ER calcium depletion, is developmentally regulated to generate two isoforms with opposing effects
on SOCE. Altering the relative levels of these isoforms in NPCs using in utero electroporation bidirectionally
modulates cell cycle exit in vivo. Finally, in mice bearing a forebrain-specific deletion of Dyrk1a, a kinase that
antagonizes CaN/NFAT signaling, we have observed broad misregulation of NPC function and differentiation.
Building on these published and preliminary studies, the central objective of this proposal is to interrogate
specific mechanisms by which intracellular calcium signals link extracellular cues with intrinsic differentiation
programs and to elucidate how alternative splicing refines these signals. The proposed studies will test the
hypotheses that calcium entry, regulated by precisely-timed exon utilization, orchestrates differentiation
programs in the developing cortex (Aim1), and that downstream cell type-specific calcium signaling via the
CaN/NFAT pathway is a key mechanism involved in the regulation of NPC function and differentiation (Aim2).
This research will broadly impact the field of developmental neuroscience by elucidating the developmental
regulation of calcium signaling in differentiating cells, building a foundation for future studies aimed at
understanding how extracellular cues and intracellular calcium dynamics converge to regulate brain
development. Our results will also have significant translational potential by providing new insights into
mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders."

The Steelworkers Charitable and Educational Organization (SCEO), the non-profit (501c3) arm of the
United Steelworkers (USW), is applying for funds to conduct HAZWOPER Training with workers and with
Tribal and community partners at 12 sites within the DOE Nuclear Weapons Complex. The training division
of the SCEO, the Tony Mazzocchi Center (TMC), is a partnership of USW, Communications Workers of
America, the Labor Institute and two worker centers: The National Day Labor Organizing Network and
Make the Road New York. Over the next five years we will conduct 1,430 workshops reaching 28,900 DOE
site workers, Tribal members and community residents with 355,200 hours of training. By developing and
deploying a cadre of 47 worker trainers, TMC will conduct a full range of H&S courses required by DOE or
otherwise needed by USW and CWA DOE site workers and by Tribal Partners and community collaborators.
TMC is reapplying for support because: 1) We have access to 3,742 USW and CWA DOE site workers
exposed to radiation, toxics and other serious hazards; 2) We have conducted analyses, in cooperation with
DOE and contractors, to identify training needs as well as hazardous conditions facing DOE site workers; 3)
We have an experienced program with the largest industrial training capacity in the U.S.; 4) We have an
expert evaluation team, in partnership with the Barry Commoner Center for Health and the Environment,
Queens College, to develop rigorous and continuous program assessment; and 5) We have the ability to
reach underserved community members near DOE sites, including through educational partnerships with
the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Yakama and Nez Perce Tribal Councils.
Training Track 1, for USW and CWA DOE site workers, will provide an array of HAZWOPER training,
including refresher courses, as well as additional classes including: 1) Incident Investigation; 2) 10 CFR 851,
covering required DOE Worker Safety and Health Programs; 3) OSHA 511, 501 train-the-trainer; 4) Hazard
Mapping; 5) Radiation Worker I & II for workers potentially exposed to radiation; 6) Basic Mine Safety for
workers at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant site; 7) OSHA 521 Guide to Industrial Hygiene; 8) Effective H&S
Committees; 9) Safety Rep, for full-time safety representatives; 10) Disaster Response and Resiliency, to
prepare for climate change and other disasters; and 11) Opioids in the Workplace.
Training Track 2, for Tribal and community collaborators (e.g. public schools, vocational education
centers, fire departments) near DOE sites includes OSHA 10, HAZWOPER classes, and joint Disaster
Response and Resiliency training. TMC training is needed because these partners: a) seek credentials for
possible employment at DOE sites; b) need more information about how to protect themselves in
emergencies; and c) need to learn more about environmental impacts of toxic releases from DOE sites."

On the low vision continuum, the term ultra-low vision (ULV) defines vision good enough to be functional, but too
limited to see detailed shapes, even the largest letters on the eye chart at 50 cm (VA<20/1600 or 1.9 log MAR).
Approximately 1 million Americans currently suffer from severe visual impairment, and the number of individuals
with ULV is expected to grow, both due to an aging population and due to vision restoration treatments (e.g.,
retinal and cortical prosthesis, stem cell therapy, gene therapy) that restore vision from total blindness to the
ULV level. Indeed, the number of patients with ULV is expected to double by 2050. The current practice of visual
rehabilitation in ULV is based on sensory substitution training. However, can visual input enhance functional
performance using inputs from auditory and tactile senses? In this study we will evaluate the range of activities
that can be performed with different levels of ULV; for which of these activities multisensory integration can
enhance functional performance; test a pilot multisensory rehabilitation program; and develop and validate a
rehabilitation program for ULV based on multisensory integration. During the mentored phase, we will assess
visual performance using virtual reality (ULV lab at Johns Hopkins); use cue combination paradigms to assess
if there is enhancement of performance using multisensory integration (VisCog lab at University of Washington,
Seattle); and design and conduct a pilot multisensory rehabilitation program (CRIR at Université de Montreal,
Canada). During the independent phase, I will expand my training to develop an evidence-based multisensory
rehabilitation program for ULV that will be validated for use in ULV population. The outcomes of this research
will have important implications on improving visual ability and integration of visual, auditory and haptic senses.
A program better suited to ULV needs will have a significant impact on ULV individuals' quality of life. Currently,
individuals with ULV are not served well by the vision rehabilitation programs that are available, in part because
of the lack of tools to assess visual ability in any given ULV individual. People with ULV are generally encouraged
to ignore their remaining vision in order to strengthen their non-visual skills. Many of them find this frustrating
and unnecessary, become disillusioned, and avoid further rehabilitation training. Using the methods developed
in this study, we will be able to measure functional vision and validate a vision rehabilitation program for people
with ULV built on a multisensory approach. This study will bridge a critical knowledge gap in the field of
rehabilitation for people with ULV."

Cell silicification creates cellular entities that retain the cell’s innate structure and protein features; have increased
resistance to heat, pressure and dehydration; and imparts novel surface properties. The process of cryo-
silicification eliminates toxic agents and creates non-viable cells that have adsorbent properties and are
biodegradable, enabling in vivo antigen processing. Adsorption of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such
as monophosphoryl lipid A and CpG oligonucleotide, transforms the silicified cells into pathogen mimetics. These
immunogenic cancer cells function as therapeutic vaccines that activate suppressed antigen presenting dendritic
cells. Unlike previous vaccine technology using irradiated cancer cells, silicified cells do not present immune
suppressive phospholipid on the cell surface and the cells are stable to dehydration, creating shelf-storable
vaccines. Past clinical studies evaluating autologous and allogeneic irradiated tumor cell vaccines demonstrated
safety, but failed to improve clinical outcomes. To overcome low therapeutic efficacy, we propose replacement
of irradiated cancer cells with silicified cancer cells, surface masked with microbial molecules. Preclinical studies
using syngeneic silicified tumor cells achieved high therapeutic efficacy in mouse models of ovarian cancer. Here
we propose to evaluate the efficacy of allogeneic cancer vaccines, which are desirable based on mass production,
low cost, lack of invasive procedures, and shelf-readiness. To further move towards clinical translation of the
vaccine, we will evaluate human immune responses to silicified cancer vaccines using patient samples, human
TLR agonists, and humanized mice. The main objectives are: 1) Determine if silicified non-syngeneic cancer
vaccines are effective in mouse models of ovarian cancer and breast cancer; and 2) Validate in vivo vaccine
efficacy using human cancer and immune cells."
10867322,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of this proposal is to develop an objective, standardized, and efficient alternative to current methods of functional assessment for older adults across the spectrum of cognitive aging, from healthy cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and preclinical and clinical Alzheimer’s disease and Alzheimer’s Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). Mild functional difficulties are a strong predictor of future cognitive decline in healthy older adults and individuals with preclinical AD/ADRD or MCI and may precede impairment on traditional cognitive tests. Functional ability level is a criterion that distinguishes preclinical AD/ADRD and MCI from clinical AD/ADRD, and unlike tests of cognitive abilities, functional status generally is not as strongly influenced by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Consequently, information on functional status is useful for determining the validity of low cognitive test scores in non-majority older adults or older adults with low educational attainment/SES. The current benchmark standard method of functional assessment is informant report, which is subjective in nature, may be biased by cultural beliefs about aging and AD/ADRD, and requires an available and knowledgeable partner. Performance-based assessments offer advantages over informant reports but are time consuming to administer and score. Aim 1 of this proposal will evaluate the validity and reliability of a novel, portable, non-immersive, virtual-reality paradigm, the Virtual Kitchen Challenge (VKC). The VKC requires participants to complete two everyday tasks in a virtual kitchen using a touch-screen interface to select objects and sequence steps. A detailed automated score report reflecting time to completion, task accomplishment and performance efficiency is generated immediately after task completion. 180 individuals aged 65 and older with a range of cognitive abilities (healthy n = 60, MCI n = 60, mild, clinical AD/ADRD n = 60) will be administered the VKC as well as traditional cognitive tests (yielding demographically adjusted scores) and validated performance-based tasks with real objects. Informants also will be asked to complete questionnaires of functional status. We predict that the automated VKC score output will yield valid, reliable, and detailed characterizations of everyday function for participants at all levels of cognitive ability.
Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that because of its practical, ecologically valid nature and objectivity, performance-based assessment of functioning (i.e., VKC) will be less influenced by race/ethnicity, education, and SES than standard measures of cognition and informant report of function. However, if our hypothesis is not supported, demographic adjustments for interpreting VKC scores will be identified and applied. This proposal will yield an efficient and sensitive measure of everyday function for diverse older adults that may be used clinically when informants are unavailable or potentially unreliable, and may be scalable for large longitudinal studies of cognitive aging, MCI, and preclinical and clinical AD/ADRD."

Rapid introduction of basic science discoveries into clinical fields requires close collaboration of basic and
clinician scientists. Accomplishing this in otolaryngology requires a multidisciplinary approach to better define
and treat the many disorders of the head and neck. Residency programs today offer limited research training
for otolaryngologists, but few become independent investigators. In contrast, the basic sciences postdoctoral
training offers little exposure to the clinical setting, making translational research difficult. The goal of this
application is to provide research training in otolaryngology and its related sciences. Support is requested for
in-depth training for 1) residents, 2) postdoctoral fellows, 3) predoctoral students and 4) short-term medical
students. All trainees will receive an interactive basic research experience with ongoing exposure to and
interaction of trainees in the clinical setting through conferences and courses. The pre- and postdoctoral
trainees will have a 24-month block of training. Research training for MDs will begin in medical school with
students doing short-term (3-month) projects and continue through the residency program with a 2-year block
midway through the clinical training. One resident will be admitted each year into this research track. Early
introduction and continued research involvement throughout the residency will increase our ability to attract
academically oriented faculty members into the field, with backgrounds to become independent investigators.
This cross-field exposure will enhance the experience for trainees and promote clinical and basic science
interactions as a faculty. A major strength of the program is drawing members of the faculty from a wide variety
of departments of the School of Medicine and across the UC campuses involved in otolaryngology related
research. This will enhance collaborative efforts in related fields of hearing, balance, smell, taste, speech,
language and head and neck cancer. All faculty members have primary or secondary appointments within the
Department of Otolaryngology, creating an ideal environment for translational research between basic and
clinician scientists. Through this multidisciplinary approach to research training for different levels of trainees
from a variety of fields, recruitment and retention of a research-oriented academic faculty involved in research
into disorders of the ears, nose and throat will be increased."
10867328,"Project Summary
We propose to evaluate the effects of pandemic eviction prevention policies on individual- and area-level death
rates, leveraging variation in policies over time and between locations to gain new insight into the relationship
between eviction and mortality. Stagnant wages and rising rents over the last several decades have resulted in
unprecedented levels of housing cost burden in the U.S. and, in turn, forced millions of renters to face the
threat of eviction each year. The pandemic worsened this crisis, resulting in catastrophic job and wage loss,
especially for Black, Hispanic, and female renters who already experienced the highest rates of housing
insecurity. To prevent a surge in evictions, federal, state, and local policymakers established a range of
eviction prevention policies, most notably eviction moratoria and emergency rental assistance (ERA). These
policies varied across the country in how and when they were implemented, creating large exogenous variation
in eviction risk. We exploit that variation to evaluate the effects of eviction on mortality and inequalities in
mortality. In so doing, we provide insight into the potential for eviction prevention policies to advance health
equity. Our project has three aims: 1) We examine the effect of eviction filings on all-cause adult mortality by
age, race/ethnicity, and gender using a unique linkage of individual eviction filing records and Census Bureau
microdata. We also estimate the number of lives saved by eviction prevention policies and project mortality
gains had more protective measures been comprehensively implemented. 2) We analyze the effects of eviction
prevention policies on county-level mortality using a difference-and-differences framework. We analyze how
the staggered lifting of eviction moratoria (2020) and disbursal of ERA (2021-22) affected all-cause, cause-
specific, and age-specific adult mortality, with a focus on racial/ethnic and gender variations in these
associations. 3) We explore the lived experience of eviction prevention policies using in-depth interview data
collected with a diverse sample of renters across two distinct policy landscapes. Our project combines the
strengths of multiple approaches. Our unique linkage of individual-level eviction-filing and mortality records
allows us to produce precise estimates of deaths averted due to eviction prevention policies. We also leverage
natural experiments to examine the causal impact of these policies on county-level measures of mortality,
capturing potential spillover effects. And our qualitative data help to clarify mechanisms underlying these
impacts. Housing policy has played a significant role in producing racial inequalities. Our project identifies the
potential for housing policies to redress these harms and advance health equity."
10867445,"Nutrient digestion and absorption are essential functions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. By the time the intestinal contents reach the colon, the organ is mostly responsible for water and electrolyte reabsorption. Nonetheless, through the metabolic activities of the colonic microbiota, non-digestible luminal contents are fermented resulting in the flux of many small metabolites that are utilized by both microbial organisms as well as by the host. In fact, it is now estimated that bacterial metabolism contributes ~6-10% of the calories that reach the host. Hence, mechanisms to sense and respond to the metabolic flux originating in the colon would seem essential to metabolic homeostasis. In this regard, the GI epithelium contains enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which produce a variety of hormones that help coordinate GI physiology, as well as metabolic responses in a variety of distant organs. Considering that the location of most digestive and absorptive processes is the small intestine, it is intriguing that the colon produces several hormones that control host metabolism and appetite (e.g., Glp-1, Glp-2, Insl5). Using a mouse model of colonic EEC deficiency (EECCol) we have uncovered that these cells are critical to host metabolic homeostasis. We find that these mice develop obesity, which is mostly due to hyperphagia. Moreover, it is associated with changes in intestinal microbiota (dysbiosis). We hypothesize that the spatial distribution of colonic EECs reflects the significant caloric flux derived from microbial metabolism of non-digestible nutrients. The purpose of this project is to evaluate how colonic EECs modulate host metabolism, with the underlying hypothesis that they act as proximal sensors of metabolic flux originating in the colon. To address this goal, we propose the following aims: 
Aim 1: How does dysbiosis contribute to the metabolic phenotype resulting from colonic EEC deficiency? Hyperphagia and obesity in EECCol mice can be prevented by treating their dysbiosis. Here we will test the hypothesis that bacterially derived metabolites are responsible for modulating appetite and body weight. 
Aim 2: How is colonic EEC deficiency able to affect microbiota composition? In this aim will test the hypothesis that host digestion and absorption of nutrients from the intestinal lumen is impacted by colonic EECs and that this in turn influences carbon sources and microbiota composition. 
Overall, the pursuit of this project will provide novel insights into the role of colonic EECs in the regulation of host metabolism and will fill key gaps in our understanding of how the intestinal microbiome regulates metabolic homeostasis more broadly."
10868582,"Abstract
Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of
neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to
measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be
a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments.
Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images
without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as
Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting
(MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple
hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of
the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic
improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will
have many other applications in research and in the clinic.
We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between
vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose
pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use
the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration,
determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies."

successful GloCal Health Fellowship (GloCal). Our LMIC sites are well-established, work in regions with some
of the highest burden of disease, and stand to benefit from our program’s capacity building, mentorship training
and alumni support. GloCal is the only UC-wide global health training program, and our track record shows that
we: 1) Recruit pre- and postdoctoral trainees diverse in discipline and race [39% of U.S. trainees over the past
5 years identify as an underrepresented minority (URM)] who aspire to build interdisciplinary academic
research careers in global health; 2) Provide outstanding, interdisciplinary education and training in global
health in collaboration with faculty mentors from participating UC campuses and collaborating LMIC
institutions; and 3) Provide each trainee with a rich and enduring mentored research experience that fosters
scientific and career development in global health. The program also advances long-term objectives to 1)
Develop models of interdisciplinary, innovative global health research and training designed to ensure healthy
lives and promote well-being for all; 2) Enhance global health networks between the UC and our LMIC partners
and recruit faculty leading innovative global health research; and 3) Strengthen a sustainable and equitable
model of collaboration between the UC and our LMIC partners that develops research capacity that advances
locally-led and locally-relevant research. GloCal will recruit candidates from a pipeline of 65 T32 and 13 D43
programs. GloCal trainees are at different career stages, but all receive: 1) A 9 or 12-month, hands-on
research experience onsite with one of our LMIC partners—LMIC fellows will spend their first 2 to 3 months of
the program at UC and earn a certificate in ‘conducting global health research’; 2) A strong, interdisciplinary
mentored research experience; 3) Instruction in global health through onsite and online courses; and 4) Career
development to ensure that they attain their short-term goals and succeed in transitioning to the next career
stage. GloCal leadership and standing committees ensure that these program components form a seamless,
integrated experience supported by evaluation and continuous improvement. Strengths and innovations of the
program include: 1) A unified consortium under UCGHI that includes four UCs at the leading edge of global
health 2) Recruitment of diverse U.S. trainees across UC and the UCLA-Charles Drew University partnership;
3) Mentors offering training across diverse disciplines (e.g., medicine, nursing, dentistry, public health,
veterinary science, environmental and social sciences) and in research methods; and 4) Leveraging common
resources across the four participating UC campuses (UCGHI, CTSAs and CFARs). UCGHI is committed to
supporting the success of GloCal, as evidenced by their pledge of $600,000 in co-funding."
10868735,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive subtype of lung cancer with a five-year survival rate of less
than 5%. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy such as anti-PD1/PD-L1 antibodies has demonstrated
unprecedented clinical activity in several difficult-to-treat cancers, with durable responses in a subset of patients.
Anti-PD-L1 antibodies such as atezolizumab, for example, have been recently received FDA approval as first
line treatment in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for SCLC; however, the efficacy seems modest.
The mechanistic basis for the modest efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor in SCLC remains unknown but
mounting evidence suggests that the immunosuppressive nature of tumor microenvironment dictates the poor
efficacy of immunotherapy in SCLC. In addition, the potential impact of platinum-based chemotherapy on anti-
tumor immune response may also play an important role in determining the efficacy of immunotherapy.
 Dendritic cells (DCs) orchestrate the initiation, programming, and regulation of anti-tumor immune responses.
Emerging evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironment induces immune dysfunctional tumor-infiltrating
DC (TIDC), characterized with both increased intracellular lipid content and mitochondrial respiration. The
underlying mechanism, however, remains largely unclear. Here, we found that fatty acids-carrying tumor derived
exosomes (TDEs) induce immune dysfunctional DC to promote immune evasion. We also discover that platinum,
the front-line treatment for SCLC, further exacerbates TDE-induced DC dysfunction through reprograming of
glutamine-lipid metabolism in SCLC. Mechanistically, platinum rewires glutamine metabolism to promote fatty
acid synthesis, leading to enrichment of long chain fatty acids in TDEs. As a result, TIDCs uptake TDEs with
large amount of fatty acids that activates peroxisome proliferator activated receptor  (PPAR) signaling, leading
to aberrant lipid accumulation and elevated FAO activity, which culminates in the induction of
immunosuppressive enzyme arginase 1 (Arg1) and consequently dysfunction in TIDCs. Genetic depletion or
pharmacologic inhibition of PPAR effectively attenuates TDE-induced DC-based immune dysfunction and
enhances the efficacy of immunotherapy. This work uncovers a role for TDE-mediated immune modulation in
DCs and reveals that PPARlies at the center of metabolic-immune regulation of DCs, suggesting a potential
immunotherapeutic target. As such, targeting PPAR can be exploited to improve anti-cancer immunotherapy.
We will test our hypothesis through the following aims: Aim 1: To explore how TDEs activate PPAR and induce
Arg1 to drive DC dysfunction. Aim 2: To investigate how platinum rewires glutamine metabolism in SCLC to
induce dendritic cell dysfunction and immune evasion. Aim 3: To evaluate the efficacy of Chemo/anti-PD-
L1/PPAR inhibitor combination in SCLC."
10868738,"In recent years there has been increased awareness and concern about the “epidemic of loneliness” among
older adults and other general population, but the prevalence is even higher among people with schizophrenia.
Loneliness is a significant risk factor for medical comorbidity, cognitive dysfunction, reduced functional
capacity, lower well-being, and earlier mortality. The mortality risk associated with loneliness is double that for
obesity, and equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes per day. Notably, many of the deleterious effects associated
with loneliness parallel those associated with schizophrenia and aging. This convergence raises a question of
whether loneliness significantly contributes to the deficits in health, cognition and functional capacity,
physiologic function, and well-being among middle-aged and older adults with schizophrenia. The proposed
project is the first comprehensive study of the nature, longitudinal stability, and deleterious impact of loneliness
in schizophrenia. Given recent conceptualizations of schizophrenia as a systemic disorder resulting in
accelerated aging, and the manner in which loneliness may evolve over the life-course, the focus for this study
will be on the effects of loneliness with age among middle-aged and older adults with schizophrenia (n=120) as
well as age-comparable non-psychiatric comparison (NC) subjects (n=90). The study employs a longitudinal
burst design, with in-person visits and assessments of key variables at baseline, 6-, and 12-months. For seven
days following each of the three primary study visits, smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Assessment
(EMA) will be used to measure loneliness, social activity, and mood in real-time. Our primary aims include
determining the associations of schizophrenia and aging with persistent loneliness, and the degree to which
the associations are independent of social isolation and depressive symptoms. The other primary aim is to
determine the association of persistent loneliness over 6- and 12-months with levels and patterns of biological
markers of health, medical comorbidity, cognitive dysfunction, functional capacity, and health-related quality of
life. Hypotheses predict schizophrenia being associated with worse and more persistent loneliness, and that
persistent loneliness will be associated with worse biological markers of health and other outcomes. We also
expect these associations to increase with advancing age. Stability and temporal relationships between acute
loneliness, social activity, and mood measured in real-time using EMA, and associations of these patterns with
those from the standard in-person measures will also be assessed. The data from this project will fill a critical
unmet need for empirical data to guide the content and focus of efforts to prevent and reduce deleterious
biological and longer-term health outcomes and diminished well-being in older adults with schizophrenia.
Together, this study represents a significant and innovative step in furthering efforts toward more effective,
comprehensive, individualized prevention and treatment of loneliness and its adverse effects in middle-aged
and older adults with schizophrenia."
10870108,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
The overarching objectives of this proposal are to investigate whether novel quantitative MRI and ultrasound
imaging parameters can reliably detect kidney transplant injury that indicates risk of allograft failure in children.
Children with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) have a mortality rate 30 times higher than children without it. As
kidney transplantation provides a significant survival advantage over dialysis, children with ESKD often require
multiple kidney allografts over their lifespan. Each transplant increases surgical, immunological, and oncogenic
risk. Kidney allograft injury results from inflammatory, infectious, vascular, and fibrotic changes that can
ultimately result in allograft failure. A major limitation to promoting long-term allograft survival is the lack of non-
invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers to reliably detect early injury in the allograft. This proposal seeks
to develop magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) biomarkers to
measure inflammation of kidney transplant in children. Currently, kidney allograft biopsy is the gold standard to
diagnose such changes, but is invasive and not free of complications, which limits its use. Identifying such
markers will allow us to implement individualized interventions to improve allograft survival and decrease
unnecessary biopsies. Aim 1 will determine advanced MRI and CEUS parameters that associate with
histopathological total inflammation Banff score and Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI) score. Aim 2 will
identify novel MRI and CEUS parameters that predict change of eGFR in pediatric kidney transplant recipients
at 6-24 months post-transplantation. The results will inform the field of novel non-invasive imaging biomarkers
in pediatric kidney transplantation. Complementary to this investigation I plan to acquire further training in 1)
conventional and CEUS research imaging acquisition and analysis, 2) MRI research data acquisition and
analysis, 3) design and implementation of biomedical imaging based patient-oriented research studies, and 4)
acquire leadership skills through a professional development plan in the rigorous research environment of
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania. To accomplish these goals, I have assembled
a multi-disciplinary mentoring/advisory team of experts in clinical nephrology patient-oriented research (Primary
mentor, Susan Furth, MD, PhD), MRI clinical and translational research studies (Timothy Roberts, MD, PhD;
Suraj Serai, PhD), CEUS (Chandra Seghal, PhD; Susan Back, MD; Anush Sridharan, PhD), pediatric kidney
transplantation biomarkers (Sandra Amaral, MD, MHS), multinational collaborative networks (Gregory Tasian,
MD, MSCE), kidney disease statistical methods (Jarcy Zee, PhD), and patient-oriented imaging research (Kassa
Darge, MD, PhD; Erum Hartung, MD, MSTR; Hansel Otero, MD). The proposed research, along with the
structured mentoring, coursework, and training that comprise my career development plan, will provide me with
the skills and experience necessary to ensure my success as an independent investigator with a unique skill set
in developing imaging biomarkers for kidney transplantation."
10870113,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Tuberculosis preventive therapy (TBPT) is among the most efficacious and cost-effective interventions to
reduce tuberculosis (TB) incidence and mortality among people living with HIV (PLHIV) but is grossly
underutilized due to our reliance on a symptom-based screening test to rule-out active TB. Studies from
Africa have shown that symptom screening has low specificity (10-30%) for active TB and does not meet the
minimum specificity (≥70%) requirement established by the World Health Organization (WHO) for TB
screening. The low specificity is a major barrier to TBPT scale-up because if current TB screening guidelines
were followed, 70-90% of PLHIV without active TB would not only be denied immediate initiation of TBPT but
would also require unnecessary and costly confirmatory TB testing. The overall objective of this application is
to evaluate the impact of a potentially more effective and cost-effective TB screening strategy, which is the
next step required for successful uptake of TBPT. Our central hypothesis is that compared to symptom
screening, a TB screening strategy based on C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, measured using a point-of-care
(POC) assay, will improve TBPT uptake, thereby reducing TB incidence and its associated mortality among
PLHIV. The scientific premise for this hypothesis is based on our own work that identified POC CRP as the first
tool to meet the minimum sensitivity (≥90%) and specificity (≥70%) targets established by the WHO for TB
screening. To accelerate scale-up of this promising TB screening strategy, and thus scale-up of TBPT, we
propose a single-center individual randomized trial to evaluate the impact of POC CRP-based TB screening in
1720 PLHIV initiating antiretroviral therapy from 3 prototypical HIV clinics in Uganda. Participants will be
randomized to either POC CRP- or symptom-based TB screening and followed for 2-years. Aim 1 will
determine whether POC CRP-based TB screening improves 2-year clinical outcomes. The primary outcome
for Aim 1 will be a composite of TB incidence and all-cause mortality. Key secondary outcomes include TB-
specific mortality and incidence of drug-resistant TB. Aim 2 will determine the impact of POC CRP-based TB
screening on intermediate outcomes related to the primary trial outcome. Primary outcomes for Aim 2 include
the proportion of PLHIV (a) initiating TBPT and (b) diagnosed with prevalent TB. Secondary outcomes include
the proportion of PLHIV (a) completing TBPT and (b) completing treatment for prevalent TB. Aim 3 will
compare the cost-effectiveness and projected epidemiologic impact of TB screening with and without POC
CRP. CRP testing will be performed using a low-cost ($2 per test), rapid (3 minutes) and simple (measured
from capillary blood) POC assay, increasing the likelihood that POC CRP-based TB screening will be
implemented in even the most peripheral settings. This research is significant because in addition to
quantifying the expected clinic, economic, and epidemiologic benefits of TB screening, this work may enable
the field to move beyond ineffective TB screening as a barrier to TBPT and improved outcomes of PLHIV."

Rehabilitation crucially requires interaction with the nervous system. Thus, neuromodulation (NM) is a tool
uniquely able to address a large number of conditions and populations through a set of common principles that
underlie an emerging neural circuit-based approach to rehabilitation and medicine. Our foundational belief is that
applying NM to specific networks offers outstanding promise for advancing and improving nearly all fields of
rehabilitation. While having grown over the past five years, the field of NM for rehabilitation (NM4R – the
combination of NM and rehabilitation) is still nascent and is just beginning to clinically impact the practice of
rehabilitation. The renewal of the National Center of Neuromodulation for Rehabilitation (NC NM4R) at the
Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) builds upon our early successes to facilitate the key steps in the
discovery process that are required to develop the next generation of NM4R interventions and to use these tools
to understand and study neuroplastic nervous system changes associated with rehabilitation. The center
harnesses outstanding expertise in non-invasive NM, rehabilitation, operant conditioning of brain and spinal
networks and animal models of NM4R. teams have formed a cohesive NM4R Community, returning to our center
for multiple workshops and hands-on training experiential sessions, receiving follow-on consultations leading to
pilot awards and extramural funding, and have publishing in peer-reviewed journals. The overarching goal over
the new grant period is to impact multiple priorities of the NIH Research Plan for Rehabilitation (RPR) – most
notably to translational science, pediatric rehabilitation and research design and methodology – by increasing
rehabilitation research workforce access to NM4R approaches and supporting rigorous clinical research to
translate them into effective, evidence-based rehabilitation interventions. Our Specific Aims are to: AIM 1.
Increase the size and diversity of the rehabilitation research workforce with access to NM4R approaches;
and AIM 2. Increase the impact of NM4R approaches. In the proposed renewal, our center will design yearly
strategic activities to focus on impacting RPR priorities. Adjacent fields such as psychiatry are more advanced
in applying NM tools in an emerging circuit-based medical model. NC NM4R will serve a vital purpose by infusing
NM skills throughout the rehabilitation workforce and ensuring early exposure to the cutting edge of NM research
for rehabilitation researchers in all domains."

The detection and characterization of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is increasingly being used to detect cancer – this
modality is frequently referred to as a liquid biopsy. Epigenetic characterization of cfDNA is an emerging
approach for sensitive detection and quantification of cancer burden. Trends in cancer growth are evident from
cfDNA among patients with advandced and metastatic cancer; however, there is a significant translational need
for the development of early-stage cancer or even pre-cancer detection assays via liquid biopsy.
Malignant tumor cells shed DNA into the bloodstream of cancer patients as cfDNA, commonly in the form of
nucleosome-sized fragments. There is broad interest in cfDNA methylation as a cancer biomarker modality,
ranging from targeted biomarker panels to whole-genome characterization of cfDNA methylomes. For detecting
5mC methylation, cfDNA is currently processed with bisulfite or enzymatic conversion of unmodified cytosines
into uracils, which is detected by short-read sequencers. This approach introduces biases such as GC skews,
oxidative DNA damage, PCR amplification bias, and alignment artifacts. Characterizing cfDNA methylomes from
patients remains challenging, particularly with conventional sequencing approaches.
We recently demonstrated a novel approach for single-molecule methylation analysis of cfDNA that overcomes
these issues. We developed a nanopore-based sequencing approach for efficiently characterizing methylation
profiles from the cfDNA of cancer patients. The passage of methylated DNA through the nanopore generates a
unique electrical signal compared to unmodified DNA without cytosine conversion, which can then be classified
with machine learning algorithms. We generated up to hundreds of millions of reads per cfDNA sample from
colorectal cancer patients, with single nanograms or less of analyte per patient.
In this project, we seek to extend our work to (1) characterize the early-stage colorectal cancer cfDNA methylome
landscape, and (2) to develop a classification model for early detection of colorectal cancer. Using cfDNA
samples from patients at the Stanford Cancer Institute (SCI) and the PLCO clinical trial, we will generate cfDNA
methylomes that will be the basis of biomarker signatures for colorectal cancer detection. In Aim 1, we will derive
cfDNA methylome profiles from confirmed and pre-diagnostic CRC, and characterize how cfDNA methylomes
are affected by tumor subtype and stage. We will also deconvolute cfDNA using matched primary tumor and
immune cell references. In Aim 2, using sequenced cfDNA we will build a machine learning model that will
determine statistically significant changes in cfDNA methylation between cancer patients and healthy controls.
The machine learning model will also quantify tumor burden and whether it is likely that a sample is indicative of
cancer. We will use the SCI and PLCO patients as independent cohorts to perform training and validation."
10869873,"Project Summary. Childhood adversity is a potent risk factor for depression, increasing lifetime risk of
this common and burdensome disorder by at least two-fold. While the association between adversity and
depression is well documented, the mechanisms explaining this relationship are poorly understood. In a
BRAINS R01 award, we made several new discoveries about how childhood adversity could become
biologically embedded to shape depression risk through DNA methylation (DNAm), a major type of
epigenetic modification. We showed that DNAm associations with adversity may not merely be molecular
records of adversity exposure, but rather, possibly function as a biological mediator linking childhood
adversity to depression risk. We also identified potential sensitive periods after birth and in the first five
years of postnatal life when adversity exposure imparted more enduring effects on the epigenome and in
shaping depression risk. However, these analyses were limited to mostly European-ancestry samples of
children with low/moderate adversity exposure and only 2 time points of blood DNAm. In this renewal, we
build on our prior work by exploring these relationships in a population-based longitudinal sample of
children in South Africa, who are part of the Drakenstein Child Health Study (DCHS). Relative to our prior
work and the field of epigenetics at large, the DCHS birth cohort provides an unprecedented opportunity
to study these associations within an established group of more racially/ethnically diverse children, many
of whom have experienced considerable early adversity directly or indirectly through their families own
exposure. We will capitalize on existing, repeated adversity markers collected by the DCHS during early
childhood and derive epigenetic data from stored blood samples collected at ages 1, 3, and 5. With these
rich longitudinal data, we will identify the genetic and social drivers and outcomes of chrono-epigenetics,
a newly coined term to describe the temporal dynamics of epigenetic processes, across the early life
course. In Aim 1, we will characterize the effects of genotype on DNAm levels at specific ages and
DNAm trajectories across time. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of repeated adversity exposure
measures before age 5 on DNAm patterns using a two-stage structured life-course modeling approach
that our interdisciplinary team developed for high-dimensional epigenetic analyses. In Aim 3, we will use
statistical mediation and causal inference approaches (e.g., Mendelian Randomization) to evaluate the
extent to which these DNAm patterns explain the relationship between adversity timing and children’s
internalizing symptoms at age 8, one of the earliest signs of depression risk. In sum, this renewal project
will identify specific genetic and social factors shaping DNAm patterns, determine the ages when
adversity is most likely to affect this biomarker, and generate biological insights that may lead to new
intervention strategies to prevent depression, ensuring these findings apply to diverse samples of youth."
10870003,"Project Summary/Abstract
Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) mediate synaptic transmission and are the targets of many
neuroactive drugs, which are allosteric modulators of pLGIC activity. Endogenous lipids including phospholipids,
fatty acids and steroids are also allosteric modulators of pLGICs, and the effects of these lipids are fundamental
to our understanding of pLGIC biology and regulation. The long-term goal of this project is to understand the
molecular mechanisms by which lipids modulate pLGICs. We have developed innovative biophysical and
biochemical techniques to examine lipid binding and modulation in the model pLGIC, Erwinia chrysanthemi
ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC), including native ion mobility mass spectrometry (MS), functional analysis in
model membranes, and covalent modification/photolabeling. Using these techniques, we discovered that the
anionic phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), directly binds to ELIC and modulates
channel gating by stabilizing the open relative to the desensitized state. We now propose to investigate the
mechanisms of phospholipid, fatty acid and steroid modulation of two model pLGICs, ELIC and GLIC
(Gloeobacter ligand-gated ion channel), with a focus on elucidating the specificity and sites of interaction, and
the effects of lipid binding. The overall vision of this research program is to develop a detailed structural model
of lipid modulation of pLGICs that encompasses the potential diversity of mechanisms present in different
pLGICs."

Genetic mouse models have been a powerful system to delineate key mechanisms of cancer
development. However, there are likely to be gene expression and regulation differences
between mouse and man that affect the applicability of some findings in these models.
Furthermore, the inbred strains that are used may come with additional genetic caveats due to
loss of heterozygosity. For these and other reasons, many cancer studies that identify targets or
mechanisms in mouse systems benefit from replicating key findings in a relevant human cell
model. Indeed, this has become a common expectation for high impact studies. Human
pediatric leukemia is genetically diverse with many potential combinations of driver and
accessory mutations, each potentially affecting phenotype. Therefore, a large bank of xenograft
models is required to replicate the heterogenous nature of the disease as found in patients.
Xenograft technology continues to advance rapidly. There has been a steady proliferation of
immunodeficient mouse strains, each with specific strengths relative to each other. More
sophisticated in vivo studies are now possible because of these new strains and many other
technical advances in sample processing, detection, analysis, and modeling of therapeutic
interventions. However, these mice are difficult to breed and manipulate due to their
immunodeficient status. Human cells also require a different set of considerations. Human
hematopoiesis in this environment is very different from what is found in mouse transplant
systems. There are additional host versus graft and graft versus host issues to consider. Human
cells require different culture conditions and transduction protocols. Human cells are
morphologically distinct. The markers used for detection are very different, making flow
cytometry experiments much more involved. I have spent the last 19 years working with these
models and have made continuous improvements along the way. I have a well-documented
history of developing new innovative methods and models for the leukemia research
community. My ability to apply my unique experiences to the projects of many NCI funded
investigators through the set of xenograft resources that I have built adds significant efficiency
and value to the science that can be done at our institution. This proposal is aligned with NCI
initiatives to use mouse models and genomics to identify new molecular mechanisms of
carcinogenesis, delineate mechanisms of resistance, and identify new targets for drug discovery
and development."
10867985,"PROJECT SUMMARY:
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. There are significant disparities in
glaucoma prevalence, presentation, and treatment in the United States (US) by race and ethnicity, English
proficiency, and health insurance status. However, many published glaucoma clinical trials have not reflected
the level of diversity in the US population by race/ethnicity or socioeconomic disadvantage. Broad patient
representation in clinical trials is necessary to ensure that research conclusions are more generalizable to
actual patient populations in the US. Pragmatic registry-based randomized controlled trials (RRCT) are a low-
cost strategy to evaluate glaucoma intervention efficacy in routine settings and to more efficiently recruit
diverse patient populations that have not been well-represented in prior traditional randomized controlled trials
(RCTs). This study proposes a future pragmatic RRCT to obtain high-quality evidence comparing selective
laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) and medications in heterogenous, real-world populations, and with less cost and
complexity than conducting a traditional RCT. More evidence is needed to determine how first-line SLT
compares to medications in US patients with more advanced open-angle glaucoma, and in a more diverse
patient population with respect to race/ethnicity, English proficiency, and ocular comorbidities. The proposed
RRCT will include patients with newly diagnosed open-angle glaucoma, who are treatment-naïve, with any
level of English proficiency, and with active ocular comorbidities. This future trial will leverage the Intelligent
Research in Sight (IRIS) Registry® to identify patients for enrollment. Using a pragmatic approach, follow-up
care will closely mirror usual care. This R34 planning grant will lay the necessary foundation for this future
RRCT and determine its acceptability, methodology, and feasibility. The specific aims are: (1) to determine the
beliefs and attitudes of US glaucoma specialists and patients toward SLT versus medications using a mixed-
methods approach; (2) to refine the enrollment criteria, sample size and trial endpoint for the future RRCT
using retrospective data from the IRIS Registry; and (3) to develop and refine the study protocol, and to
evaluate the operational feasibility of the future RRCT by conducting a non-randomized feasibility study. This
planning grant will help prepare for a future pragmatic RRCT through the IRIS Registry and a UG1 submission.
In addition to answering questions crucial to the care of diverse patient populations, this future trial will
establish infrastructure vital to support additional pragmatic RRCTs in ophthalmology."

 Current paradigms of drug development have made remarkable progress in treating and
preventing disease by effecting the function of a single target enzyme, or receptor with
specificity. However, many chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and
cardiovascular disease are multifaceted and may require alterations in multiple pathways, or
delivery to intracellular targets, to effectively treat the condition. For this reason, extracellular
vesicles (EVs) have gained attention as potential therapeutic carriers and endogenous
modulators of disease. EVs are nano-sized vesicles produced in all cells and carry
macromolecules that are capable of modulating multiple pathways simultaneously in the
receiving cell. Their cargo includes miRNAs, mRNA, DNA, signaling proteins, enzymes
metabolites and receptors. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been extensively used as the
parent cells for therapeutic EVs as the cargo of these cells is broadly protective. Many groups
have engineered MSC EVs to carry therapeutic compounds through permeabilization techniques
which rely on passive diffusion of compounds into isolated EVs. However, the current
engineering techniques are exceptionally inefficient, which is a major factor in preventing the
translation of engineered EVs into the clinic.
 In this proposal we utilize vascular endothelial cells (ECs) to actively package desired
cargo into EVs. This is possible through a novel transcytosis-like process we recently published.
We found that ECs take up exogenous albumin-bound material from the cell culture media, load
the endocytosed material into newly formed EVs, and export those EVs at the basolateral side
of the cell. Interestingly, the released EVs seem to target specific cells in the tissue. Therefore,
we have designed experiments to test and optimize the capacity of ECs to load EVs with
exogenous albumin-bound miRNA, peptides, and drugs. We will test the therapeutic efficacy of
customized EVs in an in vitro and in vivo myocardial infarction mouse model system. We expect
that utilizing ECs will allow for extremely efficient, active loading of EVs, unmatched targeting to
the desired cell type and improved cargo offloading efficiency in receiving cells. This work has
the potential to transform the EV engineering field and bring us closer to clinically applicable EV-
based therapeutics."
10866935,"New classes of antibacterials are required to combat the spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). AMR is an
underlying factor in ~5 million deaths worldwide each year and deaths due to resistant microbes are predicted
to overtake cancer by 2050. Despite this grave forecast, the pipeline of new antimicrobials with new targets is
surprisingly limited, with most compounds in clinical trials being modified versions of existing antimicrobials (e.g.,
fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, etc.). Novel classes of antibacterials have the potential to
combat AMR because existing resistance to these new agents is not predicted to be widespread.
In this proposal, we will explore the use of ozonide synthetic peroxides to kill diverse species of bacterial
pathogens. Ozonides are currently being developed as antimalarials and have pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety
properties that make them attractive as potential antibacterials, including oral bioavailability, excellent tissue
distribution, long half-life enabling daily dosing, and proven safety in humans. We have screened ozonide
analogs for activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and discovered that some have antimycobacterial
activity. For example, against whole cell Mtb, the ozonides OZ539 and OZ707 have growth inhibition half-
maximal effective concentrations (EC50) of 5 µM and 2 µM, respectively. Given the antibacterial properties of
ozonides against Mtb, we tested OZ539 against a panel of bacterial pathogens including M. abscessus (Mab)
and M. smegmatis, and selected Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and Gram-
negative (E. coli and Proteus vulgaris) pathogens. We observed that OZ539 inhibited growth of mycobacteria
and the Gram-positive pathogens, with EC50 from 2-8 µM, but had no activity against the Gram-negative strains.
Transcriptional profiling studies of Mtb treated with OZ539 identified significant differential regulation of iron-
acquisition and storage genes, suggesting that ozonides may function by targeting iron-dependent pathways.
The goal of this R03 is to determine the potential utility of ozonides as antibacterials. Towards this goal, we will
test ozonides against a diverse panel of bacterial pathogens to determine their spectrum of activity (Aim 1.1).
Next, we will screen a structurally diverse collection of ozonides for activity against a panel of prioritized
pathogens (Aim 1.2). Based on this initial screen, we will conduct a more focused screen driven by the identified
structure–activity relationships (SAR). We will then prioritize analogs for studies examining their ability to inhibit
growth in different in vitro conditions associated with pathogenesis (Aim 1.3). We will conclude the study by
exploring the potential mechanism of action of the ozonides, testing the hypothesis that ozonides target iron-
dependent pathways (Aim 1.4). Overall, this proposal will provide the key data needed to determine if ozonides
hold promise for future development as antibacterials."
10867664,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is common with over 7% of U.S. women reporting physical or sexual violence,
and/or staking in the past year. Moreover, nearly 10% of pregnant people report experiencing either physical or
sexual violence during their pregnancy and the prevalence increases to 20% when psychological violence is
included. IPV has widespread consequences, including physical injury, increased rates of chronic conditions,
poorer mental health, and death. Pregnancy is a particularly risky time for individuals in violent relationships:
Homicide is a leading cause of death for pregnant women in the U.S. and over half of pregnancy-associated
suicides involve intimate partner conflict. When a gun is available, the risk of a fatal (versus non-fatal) IPV
event increases 4-fold. Over half of women experiencing IPV are victimized multiple times over multiple
years, therefore meeting the definition of a chronic condition. Reproductive coercion (RC), a hallmark of
IPV, involves controlling contraception use, contraception sabotage, pressure to become pregnant, and
pregnancy decision-making. Prior work has shown people experiencing IPV often seek reproductive health
services and obtaining reproductive health care can reduce the risk of future violence. Today, over half of
women in the U.S. live in states with laws restricting access to reproductive health care, and many live in
states without IPV-related firearm restrictions. This timely proposal will examine relationships between state
law (reproductive health law; firearm law) and rates of IPV, IPV-related morbidity and mortality among
reproductive age people between 2015-2026. We propose to leverage the natural experiment created through
enactment of state laws restricting access to reproductive health services beginning in 2023. We will use data
from Medicaid, the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS), and the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), along with strong quasi-
experimental methods, such as comparative interrupted time series (ITS) or differences-in-differences (DD), to
characterize the relationships between state law and rates of IPV (Aim 1), IPV-related physical and mental
health outcomes (Aim 2), health service use (Aim 2) and IPV-related mortality (Aim 3). Our comparisons will
include 1) across state comparisons by state law; and 2) within state comparisons before and after law
enactment. We will conduct subgroup analyses to examine for law effect heterogeneity by race/ethnicity,
income, and community disadvantage. We hypothesize that state laws that restrict access to reproductive
health services will be associated with increases in IPV and IPV-related health outcomes and the impact will be
greater in some groups of people. This work will yield the best available evidence on the impact of state law on
IPV and health outcomes. Our proposal aligns well with RFA-OD-23-014 by examining the impact of state
laws on IPV (an understudied chronic condition) and mental and maternal health outcomes."

Managing tumor recurrence and spread is a major challenge in breast cancer. This scenario is further aggravated
for women with diabetes as numerous epidemiological studies show that women with type 2 diabetes are at
significantly greater risk of developing, relapsing with, and dying from breast cancer compared to women who
are not diabetic. Studies show that hyperinsulinemia associated with type 2 diabetes is a significant contributing
factor for the mortality seen in breast cancer patients, suggesting an important need for effective therapies that
inhibit tumor cell proliferation under hyperinsulinemic conditions. Our early studies showed that cdk4 knock-
out mice fail to develop breast cancers driven by the ERBB2 or RAS oncogenes suggesting that CDK4/6
inhibitors may be effective therapeutic agents for certain breast cancers. The approval of CDK4/6 inhibitors as
breast cancer therapeutics validated this theory. Another kinase which plays a critical role in insulin signaling
and cancer progression is NUAK1/ARK5 which belongs to the AMPK gene family which regulate metabolism.
The normal physiological role played by NUAK1/ARK5 in the whole organism was studied using
muscle-specific knock-out mice which showed that NUAK1 controls glucose metabolism through
regulation of the insulin signaling. Thus, when these knock-out mice were fed a high fat diet, they
exhibited a lower fasting blood glucose level, greater glucose tolerance, higher insulin sensitivity, and
higher concentrations of muscle glycogen compared to control mice suggesting that inhibition of
ARK5/NUAK1 can overcome the effects of hyperglycemia. Interestingly, ARK5 was originally identified
as a metastasis gene and its over-expression has been shown to promote metastasis of several tumor
types. To achieve the goal of inhibiting breast tumor cell growth and metabolism, we developed a potent dual
inhibitor of CDK4 and ARK5 (ON123300), which was a very effective inhibitor of breast tumor growth. In
addition, this compound has shown a profound effect on high sugar diet-induced tumor development and
metastasis in a Drosophila model system. In this application, we propose to extend these studies to mouse models
of hyperinsulinemia (MKR mice), developed by Dr. LeRoith and PDX models of Triple Negative Breast cancer
(TNBCs) developed by Dr. Irie. The aims are: (1) To test the effects of ON123300 on the growth and metastasis
of mammary tumors in MKR mice which exhibit hyperinsulinemic, pre-diabetic phenotype; (2) To examine the
effects of hyperinsuminemia on the growth and metastasis of PDX breast tumors and utilize the models with
the highest relative levels of ARK5 to examine the therapeutic value of ON123300; and (3) To use the newly
developed Multiplexed-kinase Inhibitor Beads (MIB) and “Cancer Toolkit gain-of-function” (CTK) technologies
to determine whether breast cancer cells develop resistance to ON123300 upon prolonged exposure and to
determine the nature of signaling pathways that might be the root cause of such resistance."

Among the 100 American cities with the greatest number of births, Detroit has the highest reported preterm birth
(PTB) rate of 15.2%.1 The etiologic factors that play central roles in this public health emergency are currently
unknown. However, evidence suggests that exposure to volatile, very volatile, and semi-volatile organic
compounds (collectively abbreviated VOCs) during vulnerable life windows of susceptibility is an important
determinant of maternal-offspring health, with implications for PTB and associated adverse health outcomes.
The Center for Leadership in Environmental Awareness and Research (CLEAR) is dedicated to understanding
and mitigating this serious environmental health problem. The central theme of Project B2 focuses on
deciphering the signaling pathways by which exposure to VOCs during pregnancy have an impact on early life
growth and development with a focus on the fetal immune system. Our central hypothesis is that inflammation
in the placenta and decidua due to maternal exposure to VOCs, alters the development of the fetal
immune system, which results in an aberrant post-natal immune response to infections. Our preliminary
studies suggest that although the fetus may be protected against microbial infection, the outcome of maternal
exposure, protective or deleterious, depends on the nature of the immune response and the severity of the
inflammatory process at the implantation site (placenta-decidua interface). The mechanisms underlying the
response of the fetal immune system to VOC exposure and how indirect training by VOC-induced maternal
inflammation takes place is unclear and understudied. Our specific aims are:
Aim 1. To determine the effect of BTEX maternal exposure on placental and fetal inflammation.
Aim 2. To determine the impact of VOCs exposure on TLR signaling responsible for the homing and
differentiation of T and B cells.
Aim 3. Characterize the offspring immune responses of pups from mothers with VOCs exposure to
microbial infection.
Upon completion of these aims we will have a better understanding of the outcomes associated with the impact
of VOCs exposure on the placental/decidua unit and its consequent influence on fetal programing and its
potential effects on the development of an appropriate neonatal immune responses. B2 is a mechanistic bridge
between the zebrafish (B1) and epidemiological (B3) projects that utilizes a placental model of inhalational VOC
exposure. The Chemical Analysis Core will quantitate BTEX metabolites and the Data Management and Analysis
Core will disseminate data among the biomedical projects to make comparisons between fish, mouse, and
human exposures paradigms possible. B2 will inform future epidemiological studies that investigate associations
between maternal VOC exposures and inflammatory outcomes in children such as asthma."
10867389,"Detroit has the highest preterm birth (PTB) rate of all major United States cities. Although a multifactorial
disease, efforts to decrease PTB have not fully considered the complex interrelationships of the environment
alongside medical and social determinants of risk. Exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOC) result in
adverse health outcomes, including PTB. Considered “a significant public health threat” by the Michigan
Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, VOC contamination via vapor intrusion has been
confirmed at >4,000 sites statewide. Detroiters are at particularly high risk because of the city’s deteriorating
infrastructure, history of being a manufacturing epicenter, and an abundance of older homes with basements –
all which increase the likelihood of living and working in structures at-risk for VOC exposure. Our data on births
in Detroit show that benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX), common VOCs found in petroleum
products, are associated with higher PTB risk, with altered maternal inflammation measures mid-pregnancy,
and with gene expression changes in the placenta. To examine our hypothesis that exposure to VOCs
increases PTB risk, we will establish a prospective birth cohort leveraging clinical resources at Henry Ford
Health System (HFHS) in metropolitan Detroit, MI, which delivers >9,500 babies annually, to cost-effectively
recruit and follow ~1,100 pregnant women. We will conduct a nested case-control study (1:1 frequency
matched) within this birth cohort. Prior studies of VOCs and PTB have been inconsistent and limited by use of
estimated exposures from single sources and single contaminants. This proposed study will address these
limitations by measuring trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and BTEX metabolites in maternal urine (three
times during pregnancy) and benzene protein adducts in the placenta. Inflammatory biomarkers will be
measured in maternal blood at three time points over pregnancy and DNA methylation and gene expression
will be measured in the placenta. Key specific aims are to: (1) examine if VOC metabolite levels in maternal
urine (prenatal exposure), and/or benzene adduct levels in the placenta (exposure at the maternal-fetal
interface) are associated with PTB; (2) (A) examine if VOC levels are associated with maternal inflammation or
altered DNA methylation/gene expression profiles in the placenta and (B) explore if maternal inflammation or
placental functional measures mediate associations between VOC exposure and PTB; and (3) identify sources
of VOCs associated with VOC levels in maternal urine and the placenta. Project B3, using novel methods to
quantify VOC levels in humans, will provide data directly relevant to the overall goal of CLEAR on health
effects of VOC exposure, namely with PTB. Notably, by identifying potential mechanisms of these associations
and potential sources of VOCs, we will provide data to CLEAR that will help identify both biomedical prevention
and environmental remediation strategies to improve the health of vulnerable individuals, in particular,
pregnant women and fetuses, and reduce life-long health burdens associated with PTB."

activities to reduce the impacts of volatile organic compounds on both public and environmental health. In Aim
1, the Administrative Core, co-led by Melissa Runge-Morris, MD, and Carol Miller, PhD, PE, will coordinate
essential centralized operational activities by providing strong leadership, managing Center business
operations, communicating CLEAR operational activities to project and core leaders through monthly meetings
of the Internal Advisory Committee, coordinating biannual meetings with the External Advisory Committee,
communicating regularly with University leadership to ensure strong institutional support, and communicating
regularly with SRP staff to report progress and ensure that CLEAR remains well-aligned with the SRP mission.
In Aim 2, the Administrative Core will facilitate interdisciplinary interactions among CLEAR projects and cores
through its monthly Internal Advisory Committee meetings, a weekly seminar series, quarterly half-day
“progress-pulse” workshops, and an annual thematic symposium. In Aim 3, the Administrative Core will
accomplish research translation via an accomplished team with a unique blend of expertise in environmental
justice communication, environmental and public health law, user-centered information design and
communications, and economic impact analysis, who will disseminate information about CLEAR research
advances and program events to internal and external stakeholders that include academics, SRP staff,
policymakers and government actors, community partners, and technology development partners, using a
targeted communication strategy that includes publication, media dissemination, digital platforms, policy
papers, annual reports, briefing sessions, community art exhibits, and symposia. Aim 4 is devoted to Center
self-evaluation and will include implementation of “Operational and Strategic Dashboards” to visualize metrics
of performance against the Center’s goals, thereby providing an objective means to align strategy with tactics,
ensure a goal-driven and performance-based data culture, and encourage interactivity and analysis throughout
all components of the Center"

Exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is an important determinant of maternal-offspring
health, with implications for preterm birth and associated adverse health outcomes. VOCs
contaminate shallow soils and groundwater of post-industrial cities at Superfund, residential,
commercial, and industrial properties, leading to exposures via vapor intrusion. The Center for
Leadership in Environmental Awareness and Research (CLEAR) is dedicated to understanding and
mitigating this serious environmental health problem. The Data Management and Analysis Core
(DMAC) will provide unified and integrated data and biostatistics/informatics services, while promoting
scientific synergy across the CLEAR projects and cores; we will achieve these goals by interfacing
with the CLEAR cores to advance the two environmental science and engineering research projects
(E1 and E2) and three biomedical research projects (B1–B3). The proposed DMAC will leverage over
25 years of experience serving as the Data Coordinating Center for multisite projects, including our
flexible, centralized data management infrastructure that builds on standard operating procedures,
our seamless collaboration with research scientists in designing cost- and time-efficient studies and
having data collection based on “FAIR” guiding principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and
Reusable), and our biostatistics and informatics expertise in analyzing complex data using cutting-
edge analytical methods in public health research. DMAC will ensure the success of CLEAR research
projects by: 1) Customizing a web-accessible, centralized, and secured data management system to
capture complex data to ensure data quality and timely data integration to foster data sharing and
interoperability and 2) Catalyzing CLEAR growth by working with project and core leaders to develop
new hypotheses about VOC exposures and adverse health effects based on integrated data analysis
and by collaborating with the Research Experience and Training Coordination Core to train the next
generation of environmental scientists in the principles of data collection and management."
10867395,"Summary/Abstract: Across Michigan, there is growing concern about very volatile, volatile, and semi-volatile
organic compounds (henceforth collectively referred to as VOCs). These hazardous substances are carbon-
based compounds that readily or less readily transition to the vapor or gas phase, including: trichloroethylene,
tetrachloroethylene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene. VOCs contaminate shallow soils and
groundwater of post-industrial cities at Superfund, residential, commercial, and industrial properties, leading to
exposures via vapor intrusion. The Center for Leadership in Environmental Awareness and Research (CLEAR)
is dedicated to understanding and mitigating this serious environmental health problem. The Community
Engagement Core (CEC) is CLEAR’s arm for community engagement and education. The CEC will facilitate a
community-centered process to protect human health and inform public policy. The CEC will direct its efforts
across Detroit—a city with a legacy of toxic waste in its industrial areas and neighborhoods, an older housing
stock, and a poverty rate of 39.4 percent. These factors make Detroit residents vulnerable to VOC exposure
through vapor intrusion into homes. The CEC will engage community members in efforts to identify potential
sources of VOC exposure, and prevent and reduce VOC exposure, with a focus on reducing infant-maternal
health risks. The CEC aims to: (1) Engage community leaders who are a part of the Community Advisory
Board to leverage networks and enhance the effectiveness of the CEC; (2) Use multiple mechanisms
for bidirectional community engagement in CLEAR by including residents in focus groups, community
forums, surveys, and two-way text messaging communications; (3) Include Detroit residents as citizen
scientists in assessing the risks of VOCs in their homes, help them to understand these hazards,
address their concerns and engage them in specific activities to reduce VOCs in their homes; (4)
Include residents in constructing a process for reporting the findings of home assessments and the
development of an agenda for intervention and prevention in Detroit.
The CEC will advance knowledge of VOCs in the local community through research and outreach, including
home assessments to measure VOCs in homes. The CEC will provide information about potential sources of
VOCs and equip community members with knowledge of strategies to reduce the amount of VOC in homes, in
accordance with the SRP’s fourth mandate. The CEC will engage residents and leaders in bidirectional
communication to assess the community’s priorities concerning environmental hazards. Further, the CEC will
mobilize CLEAR researchers, community members and local organizations to address identified hazards."

Despite the overall progress in lowering the prevalence of cigarette smoking and incidence rates of lung cancer
in the U.S., the persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic (SES) inequities in the burden of lung cancer are
major public health problems. Over decades, African Americans and Native Hawaiians have suffered a
disproportionate incidence of lung cancer in comparison to other racial/ethnic groups. The concerning
observation that African Americans and Native Hawaiians experience a higher risk of lung cancer, compared to
European, Japanese, and Latin Americans, for the same lifetime exposure to smoking has fueled molecular
epidemiology studies of smoking and lung cancer to investigate racial/ethnic differences in genetic
susceptibility, biomarkers of smoking, and epigenetics. While these studies have shed light on the contribution
of molecular factors to racial/ethnic differences in lung cancer risk, both molecular, genetic and individual-level
lifestyle factors are unable to account fully for the racial/ethnic differences in lung cancer risk. Thus, there is a
clear need to address how upstream factors of social determinants of health, including structural racism,
influence lung cancer inequities. To address this gap, we will leverage the unique epidemiological resources of
the Multiethnic Cohort Study and Southern Community Cohort Study. These two large cohorts include over
272,000 well-characterized adult participants with up to 27 years of follow-up and high-quality cancer
surveillance data. Specifically, we will assess the impact of structural racism and neighborhood disinvestment
on: change in smoking status and internal smoking dose (Aim 1); racial/ethnic and SES inequities in lung
cancer risk (Aim 2); and DNA methylation in blood leukocytes (Aim 3). In addition, we will evaluate whether air
pollution mediates the relationships between structural racism and lung cancer inequities. We will also assess
whether DNA methylated sites and epigenetic age mediate the association between structural racism and lung
cancer risk (Aim 3). The strengths of this proposal include: 1) the integration of two population-based cohorts,
statistically powered to study five racial/ethnic groups from urban and rural settings, ensuring the
representation of understudied high-risk populations; 2) the public health significance of addressing the
influence of structural racism on smoking and lung cancer inequities; 3) the assessment of the biological
pathways by which structural racism is embodied and leads to lung cancer inequities. Findings from this
proposal will expand our understanding of the contribution of structural racism to lung cancer development and
the underlying biological pathways by which structural racism may operate. This knowledge has translational
relevance in providing empirical evidence for community stakeholders, policy makers, and implementation
scientists to develop interventions for smoking and lung cancer that also may have broad health benefits."
10868914,"PROJECT SUMMARY
As wastewater research and surveillance programs develop and evolve beyond SARS-CoV-2 to a wide range
of possible pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and protozoa), one critical challenge is determining what results
ought to be shared, with whom, and how. A National Academies report and several commentators have drawn
attention to legal and ethical issues related to the expansion of wastewater research and surveillance.
However, no currently available guidelines focus on the ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) around
communication of results in the context of expanded testing. Our overarching goal is to develop ethical
guidelines for the dissemination of results from wastewater research and surveillance programs. The objective
of this proposal is to develop a strategy for responsible reporting of results in the state of Texas that is feasible
and reflects community members’ values and perspectives. In Aim 1, we will conduct embedded ELSI research
using participant observation with the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute (TEPHI) Wastewater Consortium
(TWC) Action Plan Working Group and will carry out key informant interviews with members of the Working
Group and other key stakeholders involved in TWC to identify facilitators and barriers to results dissemination.
Community engagement is critical to building trust and tailoring communication to address ELSI concerns.
Therefore, in Aim 2, we will conduct eight community engagement studios in four diverse locations across the
state of Texas to identify what types of results residents prefer to receive and how they prefer to receive them.
We will use the results of the community engagement studios to inform a statewide survey that we will conduct
to evaluate public perspectives on return of results from wastewater research and surveillance. In Aim 3, we
will draw on the results of Aims 1 and 2 to generate evidence-based recommendations that address key
aspects of results dissemination, including privacy protections, communication strategies, target audiences,
and stakeholder engagement. These recommendations will be used by the TWC Action Plan Working Group to
develop an implementation strategy and communication platform that we will present to a subset of participants
from Aim 2 community engagement studios for review and feedback. This research is significant because it
will help optimize results disclosure and build public trust by engaging communities and developing processes
that address stakeholder values, priorities, and concerns. This proposal is innovative as one of the first to
systematically collect data on public perspectives about return of results from wastewater research and
surveillance as these programs develop and evolve post-COVID-19. Our unique collaboration with the TWC
makes this research both feasible and highly impactful. The outcomes of this research have the potential to
improve the transparency, effectiveness, and acceptance of wastewater surveillance as a critical tool for public
health and an important resource for advancing research on social and environmental determinants of health."
10869565,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Maternal leukocytes can migrate to an infant not only during pregnancy via the placenta, but also after delivery
via breastfeeding. Immune cells in the milk have a significant heterogeneity, and they include innate cells
[macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells] and adaptive [T and B] cells. The immature adaptive immune
system needs education by the mother to facilitate immune tolerance and responsivity.
A specific probiotic (Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938) has been examined in our laboratory and found to
have anti-inflammatory effects in several disease models, including neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),
Treg-deficiency-induced autoimmunity (IPEX syndrome in humans), and in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis.
Recently, we found that orally feeding DSM 17938 could modify the function of circulating Tregs. When probiotic-
educated Tregs were adoptively transferred to newborn pups exposed to experimental NEC, probiotic-educated
Tregs were more potent than naïve Treg cells at reducing inflammatory T cells. A current knowledge gap our
understanding of how probiotics modify microbes, interact with leukocytes, and express metabolites that may be
transferred from mother to infant to benefit early life immunity.
The specific aims are to (1) characterize probiotic-modulated immune transfer from mother to infant. We will use
mice with congenic markers to distinguish immune cells arising from mother and infant. We will gavage feed
DSM 17938 to pregnant and lactating dam to identify the transfer of immunity from mother to infant via (via the
placenta or breast milk) by studies of the cross-fostered newborn pups; and we will (2) assess the potentially
beneficial effect of transferring probiotic-modulated immunity from mother to infant in the setting of Treg-
deficiency-induced autoimmunity. In both aims, dynamic changes of stool microbiome and metagenome and
plasma probiotic-modulated metabolites in the mother and infant will be determined."
10873216,"PROJECT SUMMARY - PROJECT 3: We are developing a combination of immunotherapy (ImmRx) and
radiotherapy (RT) that shows potent synergy in eradicating cancer in mice with multiple sites of immunologically
“cold” tumors, which have few infiltrating T cells and do not respond to immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI).
Virtually all pediatric cancers and most cancers of adults are cold, with few mutations or neoantigens. We are
now taking a systematic approach to enable potent immune-induced eradication of most cold tumors aimed
towards clinical translation. We have eradicated large, cold tumors in mice by combining immunomodulatory (12
Gy) external beam RT (EBRT) with intratumoral (IT) injection of tumor-specific antibody (mAb) + IL2. This
approach induces T-cell infiltration into these tumors, potent T-cell memory, epitope spread, and protection from
tumor re-challenge. However, the presence of an identical but untreated second tumor (2°) on a mouse’s
opposite flank inhibits the effect of this treatment, preventing eradication of the primary (1°) tumor treated with
EBRT + IT mAb-IL2. In this setting, the untreated 2° tumor causes tumor-specific immune unresponsiveness to
EBRT + IT mAb-IL2 at the 1° tumor. We refer to this as concomitant immune tolerance (CIT). We can overcome
CIT and eliminate both tumors by giving IT mAb-IL2 to the 1° tumor and EBRT to both the 1° and 2° tumors.
Delivering as little as 2-5 Gy RT to the 2° tumor can overcome CIT. However, the provision of systemic EBRT to
treat many sites of metastases is problematic, due to systemic immune suppression from EBRT; but this can
effectively be achieved without immune-suppression using molecular targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT).
 131I-MIBG is a common TRT for neuroblastoma (NBL). Our University of Wisconsin P01 team has led
preclinical/clinical testing of a novel TRT using alkyl-phospho-choline (APCh) analogs that selectively deliver
radionuclides to cancers in vivo. These show >10-fold uptake over 131I-MIBG in NBL xenografts, but unlike MIBG,
show similar uptake in NBL and virtually all tumors tested. Our lead-candidate form of TRT, 90Y-NM600 has
many conceptual and clinical advantages over 131I-MIBG, including potential outpatient treatment with no need
for patient isolation. We have demonstrated potent synergy with 90Y-NM600 and ImmRx in our mouse models.
 This project expands the ongoing collaborative progress of the several collaborative projects and cores in
this P01 proposal to systematically develop the potency of combining TRT with our combination ImmRx. We will
pursue this synergy in immunocompetent mouse models of cold NBL and sarcomas. Our in vivo goal is the ability
to use TRT to help eradicate all cancer in mice bearing macroscopic tumors in two separate sites as well as
disseminated micro-metastases. We will carefully analyze tumor and immune parameters at the histological,
cellular, and molecular levels in treated and control mice and in mice that are cured vs. mice that show
progression or relapse. In addition, we will integrate into our testing novel new vectors for delivering TRT.
 The insights/regimens developed here should enable rapid translation to cold clinical cancers."
10873219,"PROJECT SUMMARY – PROJECT 4: Prostate cancer is a significant health problem worldwide for which new
treatments are needed. Radiation therapy is a standard therapy for localized prostate cancer, delivered as either
external beam radiation therapy or brachytherapy. Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) agents have been
approved for advanced, metastatic prostate cancer, and others are in clinical testing. To date, the majority of
studies using these agents have focused on identifying maximum doses that can eliminate tumor cells while
having minimal effects on normal cells. The concept of using these types of agents to prime the tumor
microenvironment for immunotherapy has been relatively unexplored. The overarching goal of this P01 is to
evaluate TRT as a means to modulate the tumor microenvironment to enable immunotherapy treatments. Project
2 will evaluate TRT in combination with T-cell checkpoint inhibitor treatments, treatments which alone have been
less successful in the treatment of prostate cancer. Project 3 will evaluate TRT in combination with intratumoral
delivery of immune therapies for immunologically “cold” tumors, an approach not feasible for most prostate
cancers given the patterns of metastatic spread. While prostate cancer is generally considered to be an
immunologically cold tumor, devoid of large numbers of tumor-infiltrating T cells, it nonetheless remains the only
human cancer type to date for which an anti-tumor vaccine has been FDA-approved, likely on the basis of its
ability to elicit tumor-specific T cells. This current Project will focus on prostate cancer and evaluate TRT in
combination with antigen-specific anti-tumor vaccination. The hypothesis to be tested, based on existing
preliminary data, is that TRT can modulate the tumor microenvironment by depleting immunosuppressive cell
populations and promote infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells, and this may be modulated by the use of different
TRT vectors, vaccination, and androgen deprivation therapy. This approach is complementary to the other
Projects and Project 4 will inform the other Projects by permitting the direct evaluation of effects of TRT on the
number and function of tumor antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, a level of analysis not possible in other Projects in
which the targeted tumor antigens are not known. The work proposed will rely heavily on the RPR Core 1 for
TRT vector production, AID Core 2 for dosimetry studies, and BB Core 3 for statistical and bioinformatics support.
The underlying hypothesis will be tested with the following Aims: 1) to determine the effects of different TRT
agents on the composition and effector function of immune infiltrating cells in murine prostate cancer models; 2)
to determine whether antigen-specific tumor vaccination, when combined with different TRT agents, elicits
greater numbers of tumor-specific infiltrating CD8+ T cells; and 3) to determine if CD8+ T cell infiltration and anti-
tumor efficacy elicited with antigen-specific tumor vaccination and TRT treatment are augmented with androgen
deprivation. It is expected these studies will inform the best design and sequence of rational, novel future clinical
trials for patients with prostate cancer evaluating treatments using TRT in combination with anti-tumor vaccines."

10871559,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Rabies is the deadliest infectious disease with a case fatality rate of virtually 100%. Fortunately, rabies can be prevented
through vaccination or be treated post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)—the latter of which is much more common. When
PEP is administered shortly after exposure to the rabies virus and the full 3- or 4-dose regimen is completed, the
prognosis is excellent with a 100% survival rate. Unfortunately, there are 59,000 people that die each year due to the
lack of adequate access to rabies PEP. 99% of these individuals are from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)
and 84% of them come from rural areas in those countries, underscoring that poor healthcare infrastructure in these
areas is a key factor. Over the past few decades, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other healthcare ministries
have sought to decrease the number of doses required to confer protection to improve access. At present, the WHO’s
current 3-dose sequence maintains its high efficacy, but further decreases in the number of doses required have not
been forthcoming due to substantial sacrifices in efficacy. Therefore, there remains a major clinical need to further
truncate rabies PEP—ideally down to the point where only one injection is required.
In this project, we will develop a single-injection rabies vaccine for use in PEP. Leveraging the Particles Uniformly
Liquified and Sealed to Encapsulate Drug (PULSED) fabrication process that we have pioneered, we will create
biodegradable microparticles that release rabies antigen in its native (i.e., bioactive) state at time points that match
current rabies PEP schedules known to be safe and effective. PULSED microparticles composed of poly(lactic-co-
glycolic acid) (PLGA) can be readily tuned to release their contents after a delay of days to weeks that is dependent on
the copolymer ratio, molecular weight, and end group of the PLGA used. By combining and co-injecting particles with
different compositions, multiple discrete doses of antigen can be released on the PEP time schedules known to be safe
and effective (e.g., on days 0, 3, and 7 according to WHO recommendations) while requiring only a single injection.
However, a key challenge in the realization of this strategy is the ability to maintain antigen stability through microparticle
fabrication and in vivo release. During these stages, the antigen will be exposed to stressors including drying and short-
term heating during particle production and then be exposed to body temperature for up to 2 weeks prior to release
inside a particle that is acidifying as the PLGA degrades. These stressors can cause the antigen, which is a whole
inactivated virus, to change its conformation, undergo deamidation, aggregate, or otherwise assume an architecture
that no longer confers protection against rabies. Therefore, we will implement stabilization strategies that prevent
microparticle acidification and protect the antigen from thermal instability. Then, using a rat model, we will evaluate the
humoral and cellular immune response to the stabilized single-injection rabies vaccine to assess its non-inferiority to the
current standard of care that requires multiple injections."
10871147,"Project Summary
 Brain arteriovenous malformation (bAVM) is a high-risk factor for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which
leads to a high rate of disability or death. However, the treatment options for patients are severely limited,
primarily relying on surgical methods that possibly cause intraoperative hemorrhage or even death. No
pharmacologic treatment is available, primarily because of the poor understanding of the mechanisms in bAVM
pathophysiology. A recent study reported that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is a common
feature in human bAVM, irrespective of the underlying genetic background. Our proteomic analyses also
confirmed increased EndMT markers in human bAVMs. EndMT is involved in physiologic and pathologic
angiogenesis, and endothelial cells (ECs) undergoing EndMT showed decreased junctional proteins. KRAS
mutations are detected in human bAVMs at a high frequency (~76%), and KRAS-mutant bAVMs are more
prone to rupture (1.7 fold). These results suggest that KRAS mutations may induce more severe EndMT,
leading to exacerbated bAVM development and rupture. In this exploratory grant, we propose to use our
existing and prospective biorepository of human bAVMs and cultured endothelium we earlier established using
fresh human bAVMs. The study will be guided by our animal translational studies that used our recently
established mouse model of bAVMs by brain EC-specific overexpression of KRASG12V (KRASG12V mice). The
bAVMs in KRASG12V mice recapitulated salient features of human bAVMs including EndMT (e.g., increased α-
SMA, CD44, CDH2). Our in vitro study demonstrates enhanced EndMT markers in cultured ECs
overexpressing KRASG12V (ECG12V), which were accompanied by dysregulated EC functions. Previous studies
have implicated calpains (a family of Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases) as critical modulators of EndMT by
showing that calpain inhibition attenuates EndMT in cardiac and lung tissues. In our preliminary studies, we
found higher levels of calpain-1 and -2 in ECG12V and human bAVM tissues and confirmed that PD150606 (an
inhibitor of calpain-1 and 2) reverses EndMT marker in ECG12V and ICHs and bAVMs in KRASG12V mice. The
evidence led us to hypothesize that KRAS mutation exacerbates bAVM pathology through exaggerated
EndMT, and calpain-mediated EndMT is a ubiquitous and essential mechanism for human bAVM,
regardless of the etiology. Using our human materials from local surgeries (by Dr. Chen, multi-PI), Aim 1 will
determine if KRAS mutation exacerbates EndMT and pathology in human bAVM by comparing EndMT
features between human KRAS-mutant bAVMs (bAVMKmt) vs. KRAS-wild type bAVMs (bAVMKwt), and Aim 2
will probe the role of calpains in EndMT and EC functions in cultured human bAVM ECs by determining EndMT
markers and EC functions in primary cultured bAVM ECs with calpain inhibition. Our study will provide
preliminary data to justify further therapeutic experiments in preclinical mouse models of bAVM and may yield
a new therapeutic target for treating human bAVMs."

 Neuropathic pain is a pervasive and debilitating condition associated with modifications in synaptic
plasticity and altered gene expression within the spinal cord. However, the specific molecular mechanisms
underlying these synaptic changes remain poorly understood. This proposed project aims to unravel the synaptic

10871380,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:
This proposed study assesses how social contextual stressors over the maternal pre-pregnancy life course
contribute to the unacceptably wide racialized inequities in maternal and infant health in the United States
(US). It aims at uncovering whether and how adolescent girls’ social developmental contexts shape biosocial
stress pathways affecting maternal health and birth outcomes. It uses secondary analysis of newly available
data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), a novel, US-representa-
tive longitudinal cohort with five data collection waves beginning in adolescence and including social, contex-
tual, health, and birth outcome measures. The central hypothesis is that adolescence is a pivotal early-life pe-
riod for racialized social stressors before pregnancy that affect future maternal and infant health, including
through pathways associated with accelerated maternal aging and stress-related weathering that may have
lasting impacts on maternal mental health. This hypothesis is based on early analyses by the study team re-
vealing age-related declines in birth weight and increases in maternal depression risk among Black, but not
White, mothers in Add Health—particularly when exposed to more severe early-life disadvantage. The pro-
posed analyses will further investigate aspects of adolescent contexts, linked lives over the life course, and
biosocial stress mechanisms that may serve as leverage points for future research and interventions to
achieve maternal and infant health equity. The study team will analyze Add Health cohort data spanning all five
collection waves, from ages 12 to 43, including new epigenetic markers of maternal stress and aging. With an
established collaboration record working with Add Health, the team comprises collective expertise in biosocial
frameworks, maternal and infant health, racialized health inequities, social stress, and biomarker analysis.
 The study has three aims: (1) identify how contextual early-life disadvantage (ELD) contributes to ra-
cialized birth outcome ineq-uities through pre-pregnancy stress pathways; (2) identify how ELD shapes racial-
ized inequities in post-childbirth maternal stress, mental health, and accelerated aging through pre-pregnancy
stress pathways; and (3) determine the extent to which adolescent contextual risk and protective factors ex-
plain or modify racialized maternal and birth outcome inequities, and the role of ELD. It focuses on social
stress domains that are sensitive to racialized inequities and that carry implications for early-life interventions
for achieving maternal and infant health equity. It is innovative by measuring and analyzing pre-pregnancy
stress trajectories prospectively over the life course in a US-representative cohort with detailed social contextual
data and new biomarkers of maternal stress and aging after childbirth."
10871442,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. A quarter of the
human population is exposed to TB of which 5-15% will progress to active disease. Despite its
extreme prevalence, prediction of disease progression is poor. To address this, our proposal
integrates whole genome sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) on the
entire repertoire peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) at three crucial TB disease states:
latent TB infection, recent Mtb infection, and post-TB treatment completion. We will be the first
to leverage this unique study design across TB states, for expression quantitative trait
loci (eQTL) mapping. Our study population in South Africa resides in a TB-endemic area
where we have over a decade of established research infrastructure, enabling us to efficiently
capture these critical TB phenotypes at a relatively low cost. Previous TB eQTL mapping
studies have been limited by inadequate phenotyping (e.g., samples from TB cases months-
years after clearing infection), bulk RNA-seq (aggregating cell-type specific effects), or
scRNAseq on one cell type. We are generating CITE-seq profiles from PBMCs, a cutting-edge
technology that enables simultaneous profiling of gene expression and cell surface protein
composition at the single-cell level [funded by CZI, co-PI Suliman]. This approach allows us to
capture the fine-scale heterogeneity of immune cell states. To identify the genetic variants that
regulate these identified cellular and transcriptomic changes, we propose to generate whole
genome sequencing data paired with the transcriptomic data for eQTL fine-mapping. South
African populations exhibits high levels of genetic heterozygosity and are multiway admixed,
amplifying statistical power for discovering eQTL variants. To characterize the unique genetic
diversity of our population we have optimized state-of-the-art ancestry estimation methods.
Outcomes of this grant include multiomic data from 225 individuals across three TB
states and eQTL identification of ancestry- and cell-specific variants which affect gene
expression in early TB infection."
10877456,"We propose 3 interrelated aims to define the biomechanics of the extraocular (eye rotating) muscles and optic
nerve in health and visual disease, understand novel extraocular muscle actions that maintain binocular
alignment, and characterize mechanical effects that may contribute to glaucoma and severe myopia
(nearsightedness). We aim to improve treatment of strabismus, misalignment of visual directions of the eyes,
as well as glaucoma, a common blinding optic nerve disease; and gain insight into the cause of high axial
myopia, an eye elongation and shape distortion that has become a worldwide epidemic and major cause of
blindness. These conditions may all be related to the actions of the extraocular muscles (EOMs). We propose
the dynamic, repetitive strain due to eye movement is a common factor in several visual disorders. Aim I will
clarify superior oblique (SO) palsy, a common cause of vertical double vision often treated by strabismus
surgery. This aim will evaluates EOM function by multipositional magnetic resonance imaging to test an
alternative hypotheses that SO palsy often is not caused by EOM weakness, but instead by benign misdirection
of a cranial nerve, and may improve the way strabismus surgery on the EOMs can correct the double vision.
Aim II will characterize the dynamic way the eyeball is deformed by eye movements. Everyday eye
movements impose much greater mechanical forces on critical parts of the eye than does elevated intraocular
pressure. We will investigate by in living people the mechanical effects of fast and slow eye rotations on the
retina, optic disc, and other parts of the eye during horizontal and vertical eye rotations, using high speed
confocal scanning laser imaging and optical coherence tomography. We propose that the eye deformation,
especially during rapid eye movements ubiquitous in daily life, may accumulate over time to create repetitive
strain injury contributing to glaucoma and high myopia. Healthy children and adults will be compared with
subjects who have glaucoma or high myopia. Effects of eye movement will also be studied ex vivo by precision
3D optical imaging of fresh human eye bank specimens, with and without history of glaucoma, subjected to
mechanical tension on the optic nerve that mimic effects of the eye movements imaged in the living subjects.
Aim III will use computer simulation to model and validate the effects of mechanical strain in the eye
during eye movements. We will the measured time-dependent mechanical properties of donated, post-mortem
human eyes to develop finite element models (FEMs) using modern engineering methods for computational
simulation to predict how rapid eye movements cause time-varying mechanical strains in the optic nerve and
outer eye wall that may produce glaucoma & the ocular deformities underlying extreme myopia. Using FEMs,
we will explore in theory possible options for treatment of glaucoma and axial high myopia that might be
accomplished by scleral cross-linking, and medical treatment of orbital tissues, and strabismus surgical
techniques."

FDA-approved gene therapy trials have treated autosomal-recessive (i.e., loss-of-function) disorders by
supplementation with the wild-type (WT) version of the mutant gene. For patients with autosomal-dominant (ad)
gain-of-function disorders, the best hope for a cure is genome surgery that repairs or removes the malfunctioning
genes at the root of the disease. Currently, that hope lies in CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing {DiCarlo,
Mahajan & Tsang, J Clin Invest. 2018;128:2177}. The strength of the first-generation CRISPR-based therapy
(CRISPR1.0; Fig. 1)—its mutation-specificity—is also its greatest weakness. This is because the therapeutic
components for each mutation (both the guide RNA (gRNA) and the repair template) need to be custom-designed,
engineered, tested, and FDA-approved. This presents a considerable and costly challenge for the many ad
diseases caused by a slew of different mutations. For example, the blinding Best vitelliform macular dystrophy
(VMD) disorder is caused by any 1 of 250 different mutations in the rhodopsin (BEST1) gene. Treatment of all
patients would, therefore, require that 250 sets of CRISPR1.0 components be engineered, validated, and FDA-
approved.
To overcome this major limitation, we developed CRISPR2.0 (Fig.2), a mutation nonspecific strategy.
Unfortunately, CRISPR2.0 is not allele-specific and so eliminates both the mutant and WT alleles. As a result,
CRISPR2.0 requires gene supplementation, which leads to variable expression of the rescued gene and
sustainability concerns. We now propose to develop a third-generation CRISPR-based strategy, CRISPR3.0
(Fig. 2), that, like CRISPR2.0, is mutation nonspecific. However, CRISPR3.0 is allele-specific and therefore
ablates the mutant, disease-causing cis allele while leaving the WT allele intact to support normal function. We
hypothesize that CRISPR3.0 chromosome-specific genome surgery will produce a more sustained therapeutic
response compared to the CRISPR2.0 supplementation strategy."

 The long-term goal of my research group is to understand the mechanisms through which nematodes
molt and to use this information to understand fundamental, conserved biological processes. We will determine
how the collagenous extracellular matrix (ECM) that surrounds all cells is precisely remodeled during
development, informing mammalian dermal physiology, wound healing, and tumor invasion through the ECM.
We will reveal how animals coordinate precise patterns of oscillatory gene expression during development. We
will explore whether nematode molting is hormonally-regulated, a long-standing question in the field. This work
will also provide fundamental insight into how animals couple development with diet. We are also interested in
nematode-specific biology, as it offers an intervention point to combat parasitic nematode infections. As a group,
these animals afflict an estimated 1.5 billion people worldwide, comprising approximately 85% of global
neglected tropical diseases. They also threaten food security by infecting crops and livestock. Our long-term
goal is to define the mechanisms that ensure faithful molting at the molecular, cellular, and organismal level in
C. elegans and then extend our work into parasitic nematode models.
 Molting involves the coordinated replacement of an animal’s exoskeleton to allow further growth and
requires intracellular trafficking, extracellular matrix remodeling, assembly of the new exoskeleton, and a
stereotyped series of behaviors to escape the old exoskeleton. In contrast to the deep understanding that we
have gained on the mechanisms of arthropod molting, we are only beginning to understand the functions of
genes that regulate nematode molting. Shedding light on nematode molting promises to reveal how molting gene
regulatory networks have evolved, and to provide pharmacological intervention points in parasitic nematodes.
 The C. elegans molt cycle is an oscillatory process with similarities to mammalian circadian rhythms, and
is regulated by homologs of mammalian clock proteins, such as NHR-23 (homolog of mammalian RORa). The
C. elegans molt can lengthen or shorten depending on dietary input, making it a valuable model to explore how
environment and diet can impact developmental timing. We will use NHR-23 as an entry point to define upstream
regulatory signals and coordinated action of downstream effectors. Our working hypothesis is that steroid
hormone signaling controls NHR-23 to promote the oscillatory gene expression that initiates molting and
coordinates ECM remodeling. Our aims test key aspects of this hypothesis. In Aim 1, we determine how ECM
remodeling during molting is coordinated by the concerted action of proteases and protease inhibitors. In Aim 2,
we will determine how oscillatory gene expression is promoted during molting. In Aim 3, we will test whether a
ligand drives nematode molting, an elusive question in the field."
10877171,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is well known as a regulator of vertebrate locomotor behaviors, but prior
research has largely ignored the contributions of DA-producing neurons in the hypothalamus. Working in the
larval zebrafish, we have discovered that a population of DA neurons in the hypothalamic preoptic nucleus,
defined by their expression of the tyrosine hydroxylase gene, th2, are critically important for generating most
forms of spontaneous and evoked swimming. Functional imaging reveals that these cells exhibit complex
sensory and motor encodings, firing intense bursts of activity in acute correlation with movement, auditory cues,
or both, and optogenetic manipulation elicits a variety of kinematically distinct swim bouts. When the th2+
neurons are ablated, fish initiate spontaneous swimming dramatically less often. We have identified a group of
premotor spinal projection neurons (SPNs) in the mid- and hindbrain as particularly important mediators of the
th2+ neurons’ behavioral functions. Activation of the th2+ afferents to this region rapidly elicits sustained bursts
of activity in a majority of SPNs, driving the resulting behavior.
The SPNs comprise a group of roughly 250 neurons, which are anatomically and functionally invariant between
animals, and activity in individual SPNs has been directly linked to particular behaviors. As the targets of th2+
DA neuron activity, these cells present a unique opportunity for understanding the functional architecture of a
modulatory network – that is, how DA neurons that project onto distinct functional targets might differ in their
physiological properties, and how that organization might influence the behavioral contributions of specific DA
cells.
We propose that functionally heterogeneous subgroups of preoptic th2+ neurons differentially release DA onto
specific SPNs under different sensorimotor conditions, enabling the selective recruitment of premotor ensembles
to drive contextually appropriate behaviors. To test this idea, we will first use calcium imaging in traceable
neurons to determine whether th2+ afferents to the SPN subgroups that mediate different behaviors – i.e. routine
vs. defensive swimming – are selectively activated during the associated bout type. Next, we will directly image
DA secretion to determine whether the modulatory signals at different sites vary independently from one
another, in a way compatible with selective modulation of particular SPNs. Last, we will use in vivo
electrophysiology to precisely determine how the th2+ neurons affect SPN function. The result of our work will
be a detailed model linking functional heterogeneity in a modulatory network to the performance of specific
behaviors."

Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men
and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder
cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early
stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment.
We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder
cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the
bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced
machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive
model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the
oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will
(1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical
trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical
sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial
(standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4)
analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and
assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve
clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment
response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance
of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy
and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on
clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness,
familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as
a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the
clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently
and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use
of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the
histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of
the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess
the potential impact on clinical outcome."
10879010,"PROJECT SUMMARY IVSA (PROJECT 3)
Evidence from both human and animal studies indicates that a multitude of traits, including novelty seeking,
novelty preference, acute drug response, sensitization to drug effects and impulsivity are strongly correlated with
the propensity to develop a substance use disorder. This suggests that there are shared biological mechanism
for these predictive phenomena and drug self-administration. We propose to identify biological mechanisms of
addiction and predisposing behavior by harnessing recent advances in mouse genetic resources including the
genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) reference panel, the high-precision Diversity Outbred (DO) mouse
population, and the computational and statistical methods in systems genetics and integrative genomics
developed to analyze these populations. Project 3 provides critical data for the correlation of multiple risk factors
for vulnerability to cocaine self-administration. We will utilize male and female mice from the inbred CC strains
to quantify genetic correlations among genomics, predisposing novelty-related behaviors and intravenous
cocaine self-administration, as well as their relationship with other heritable addiction-related behaviors assessed
in the Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction (CSNA), which include impulsivity, and cocaine
sensitization. Intravenous drug-self administration (IVSA), considered the gold standard for the assessment of
addiction in preclinical research, will enable quantification of the core features of addiction including compulsive
drug use, difficulty limiting drug intake and an extremely high motivation to take the drug. We will evaluate genetic
correlations among behavioral phenotypes (novelty-related traits, cocaine IVSA) and the expression of genes
and gene networks in CC mice. Gene co-expression networks, QTL positional candidates and behavioral
correlates of gene expression will be compared with other functional genomics data to refine and characterize
candidate genes and biological mechanisms. Behaviorally relevant cocaine response networks will be genetically
mapped in DO mice to independently identify regulatory variants that influence cocaine IVSA and related traits
through transcriptional regulation of other relevant genes. We will use a large population of DO mice to map
behavioral QTLs—and identify candidate genes—that influence cocaine IVSA and predisposing novelty-related
behaviors. The most compelling and tractable of these candidate genes and mechanisms will be validated in
extreme CC strains and newly-engineered mutant mice."
10879092,"Administrative Core Abstract
The overall aim of the Administrative Core (AC) of this Program Project, entitled the Brown University Alcohol
Research Center on HIV (ARCH), is to provide the scientific, administrative, and financial support needed to
conduct the best possible science on evaluating and implementing interventions to reduce alcohol misuse
among those living with HIV and those at high risk for HIV. The AC will build upon lessons learned and
successful practices developed and refined over the past two segments of ARCH funding. The AC has
overseen the evolution of the ARCH from a broad focus on biobehavioral interactions between alcohol use and
HIV to a more defined purpose of implementing alcohol interventions in real-world settings where our impact
on HIV prevention and care can be greatest. The ARCH contains 5 integrated parts that make unique
contributions to our interdisciplinary approach: three Research Components (RC), a Research Methods Core,
and this AC, which oversees coordination of the projects, training of postdocs, and funding of promising pilot
projects. Under the direction of Program Director Christopher Kahler and Deputy Director Peter Monti, the aims
of the AC are: (1)To provide organizational structure for effective scientific leadership; (2) To provide general
administrative, fiscal and logistical management of daily operations, assure the smooth functioning of the
scientific work, and maintain sound policies/procedures; (3) To obtain external oversight from a Program
Advisory Committee, seek Committee advice for major decisions/strategic direction and evaluation of pilot
projects, and arrange timely presentations to the Committee; (4) To ensure appropriate allocation to and
tracking of use of core resources by RCs and Pilot Projects; (5) To provide and monitor a training/mentoring
plan for all ARCH-affiliated postdocs; (6) To provide for and monitor a pilot project program that will fund four
pilot projects, one of which is proposed herein; (7) To ensure collaboration and communication among ARCH
and collaborating investigators, both within and outside of Brown; (8) To coordinate new extramural grant
submissions consistent with the Project’s mission; (9) To increase local, regional, national and international
visibility of this ARCH, attract outside scientists to become active participants, and foster new collaborative and
interdisciplinary relationships. The AC enhances the RCs by allowing more comprehensive, ambitious, and
innovative alcohol/HIV intervention projects to be conducted with high cost efficiency and greater coordination
of research methods and implementation frameworks. Further, the AC will serve as the nexus for training and
integration of alcohol/HIV science across RCs, pilot projects, and complementary studies, so as to yield new
insights into the implementation of interventions to reduce alcohol misuse in HIV prevention and care settings."
10879093,"Project Summary
To achieve the most impact on the HIV epidemic, interventions that address alcohol misuse in the context of
HIV prevention and care must be evaluated and implemented with an emphasis on real-world effectiveness,
scalability, and sustainability. Consistent with this, the central theme of this segment of support for the Brown
University Alcohol Research Center on HIV (ARCH) involves evaluating novel methods of addressing alcohol
use in HIV prevention and care contexts both domestically and globally, using technology-delivered
interventions, telehealth, and state-of-the-art implementation strategies. The Research Methods Core (RMC) is
a shared resource that will support the mutual needs of the ARCH’s constituent research components by
providing assistance with (1) data collection, management, synergy, and analysis, (2) technology-assisted
assessments and interventions, and (3) implementation science. With contributions from faculty in biostatistics,
digital health, and implementation science, as well as experienced data management and programming staff,
the RMC will directly support these needs by creating data collection instruments and intervention components,
developing participant and data management systems, authoring scripts to compile and harmonize datasets
across multiple sources, and facilitate data archiving. RMC personnel will also provide consultation on
research design, assessment best-practices, and will lead primary statistical analyses proposed in each
project. Finally, RMC personnel will provide ongoing guidance on implementation science methods for each
project, compile resources on implementation science frameworks and methods, and offer education and
training on implementation science topics. As such, the resources provided by the RMC core will enable the
research components to utilize best-practices in the areas of study design and data analysis and ensure that
the research they produce is rigorous and achieves the most impact. Providing general support for data
management through the RMC can also ensure that consistent approaches are used in each project, that data
are harmonized whenever possible, and that data are archived and shared efficiently. It also creates an
economy of scale, where data management tasks used in one study can more easily be applied across others,
obviating the need for each study to develop and support these methods themselves. Finally, providing a
shared resource for training and guidance on implementation science issues will enable each project to utilize
best practices in the field and ultimately help advance each toward its goal of integrating and sustaining alcohol
interventions in practice settings."
10879094,"Project Summary/Abstract
In the United States, rates of new HIV infections have remained stable among men who have sex with men
(MSM) in recent years despite declines among most other at-risk groups, highlighting the continued need for
innovative approaches to prevention for MSM. Alcohol use is a major risk factor for HIV infection among MSM,
in part due to the tendency for heavy drinking to increase the odds of engaging in sex that can transmit HIV.
Our work has also shown that heavy drinkers are less likely to have tested for HIV within CDC-recommended
intervals. This level of drinking is common among MSM, with up to 40% reporting heavy drinking in the past
month. Home-based HIV and STI self-testing is a promising strategy for encouraging regular testing. Regular
testing can help detect more new infections earlier, preventing onward infections and improving mortality.
Despite self-testing’s promise, little is known about the best ways to provide support alongside HIV/STI self-
testing programs. Although many current self-testing programs provide recipients with access to a 24-hour
helpline they can call for counseling and referrals, few use this service. The counseling provided is also rarely
informed by theory and often does not address key factors that maintain risk, like alcohol use. Web-based,
brief interventions may be one approach that is well-suited to provide support alongside these programs and
could help MSM participating in these programs to reduce their alcohol use and begin using HIV prevention
methods that work. With previous support, we developed Game Plan, an interactive, responsive web
application modeled after evidence-based brief motivational interventions. It is designed to help high-risk,
heavy drinking MSM consider reducing their binge drinking and sexual risk behavior when they get tested for
HIV. In a preliminary study of 40 heavy drinking, high-risk MSM, those who used Game Plan after HIV testing
reported 24% fewer binge drinking days, 17% fewer alcohol problems, 50% fewer new anal sex partners, and
12% fewer high-risk condomless sex (CAS) acts compared to controls over a three-month follow-up period.
The proposed study involves conducting a larger-scale study exploring Game Plan’s effects among MSM in the
real-world, alongside innovative approaches for expanding HIV testing. Using a hybrid 1 effectiveness-
implementation approach, we will recruit 360 high-risk, heavy drinking MSM online from several high-incidence
areas in the US to participate in a program providing home-based HIV/STI self-tests in the mail at regular
intervals over a year (baseline, 6 months, 12 months). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive access
to either (1) a 24-hour helpline for counseling/referrals, or (2) the helpline plus Game Plan. We will test whether
those who use Game Plan show lower rates of heavy drinking, any STIs, and high-risk CAS events compared
to those receiving access to the helpline alone. Mixed-methods approaches will also be used with Game Plan
users (N=30) and testing outreach program stakeholders (N=12) to begin understanding key implementation
outcomes that can guide us in designing strategies for implementing Game Plan into HIV/STI testing programs."

Among people living with HIV (PLWH), alcohol misuse has been associated with reduced adherence to
antiretroviral therapy and decreased odds of HIV viral suppression, as well as liver and neurocognitive
dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, cancer, systemic inflammation, and decreased survival. Behavioral
interventions can significantly reduce drinking in PLWH as well as increase condom use, increase ART
adherence, and decrease HIV viral load. We recently found that motivational interviewing (MI) with booster
sessions through 6 months, compared to HIV care as usual, results in particularly large reductions in drinking
that are well-maintained over a 12-month follow-up and have been validated biochemically. However,
delivering MI requires trained staff to conduct repeated sessions of counseling, a resource that is unlikely to be
available at most community health centers caring for PLWH. In our recent work, we have found that it is
feasible to deliver MI by videoconferencing and telephone with high fidelity using a resource-efficient
centralized core of counselors. We further have found that a combination of both extended counseling by video
or telephone and interactive text messaging shows promise in further reducing drinking and in increasing the
odds of HIV viral suppression. The purpose of the proposed study is to test the real-world effectiveness of the
ReACH (Reducing Alcohol use and related Comorbidities in HIV care) telehealth counseling protocol in a
pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation randomized trial. We will recruit 600 heavy-drinking
PLWH from four federally-qualified health centers in geographically distinct regions across the U.S, which
provide services to over 14,000 PLWH. Upon completing enrollment, participants will be randomized to receive
either single-session brief intervention (BI) by phone with referral to local treatment when appropriate or BI plus
referral to ReACH telehealth counseling (TC). Participants will complete follow-ups through 24 months after
baseline to assess longer-term changes in drinking and health outcomes. We will test the hypothesis that TC
compared to BI will result in (a) reduced number of drinks consumed per week and frequency of heavy drinking
and (b) increased odds of having an undetectable viral load at 12- and 24-month follow-ups. Secondary
outcomes include self-reported ART adherence, engagement in condomless sex with non-exclusive partners,
frequency of other substance use, phosphatidylethanol levels (a biomarker of recent alcohol use), and
Veterans Aging Cohort Study index scores. We also will examine potential moderators of TC effectiveness. As
a secondary aim, we will assess implementation measures corresponding to aspects of the Dynamic
Sustainability Framework and examine implementation outcomes of acceptability, appropriateness, and
feasibility guided by Proctor’s Implementation Outcomes Framework. Thus, this pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 trial
will help establish the real-world effectiveness of the ReACH TC intervention while also providing key
implementation-related measures and outcomes that will inform future ReACH TC scale up and sustainability."
10879098,"PROJECT SUMMARY
South Africa is at the epicenter of the global HIV pandemic with the largest country population of individuals
living with HIV in the world. South Africa also has alarming rates of alcohol use, which pose a significant
challenge to the HIV care cascade. Integrated alcohol-HIV care is the gold standard, but delivery of integrated
care in South Africa is extremely rare. To promote treatment integration, the South Africa HIV ATTC (led by M-
PIs Becker, Kuo, and Sibeko) was established in October 2017. The South Africa HIV ATTC is a national
center, jointly funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) and the
President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), dedicated to providing training to health professionals
and lay workers who serve patients with HIV, alcohol use, and other mental health problems. On an annual
basis, the South Africa HIV ATTC is charged with training 1,000 individuals as a means of driving the uptake of
evidence-based approaches to address alcohol-HIV throughout the country. Recognizing the detrimental
effects of heavy alcohol use and alcohol use disorders on the HIV care cascade, and in response to a needs
assessment of national stakeholders and policy-makers, the South Africa HIV ATTC is preparing to roll out a
national training initiative on Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) for risky alcohol
use. Using a novel task sharing approach, the South Africa HIV ATTC will provide SBIRT training and ongoing
consultation to over 900 health professionals and lay workers embedded within HIV treatment organizations
over a three-year period. Rollout of this national initiative presents unparalleled opportunities to advance
implementation science for integrated alcohol-HIV treatment in a global priority site. However, research and
data collected by the South Africa HIV ATTC is severely restricted under the SAMSHA and PEPFAR funded
streams. Indeed, the only data currently collected by the South Africa HIV ATTC is a brief SAMHSA-required
form called the Government Performance and Reporting Act (GPRA) tool, which measures satisfaction of
training attendees. Thus, the current study proposes to first codify and then conduct comprehensive evaluation
of training effectiveness on a range of key implementation science constructs. Study activities will occur across
three phases. First, we will develop a SBIRT train-the-trainer manual consisting of a coding system to measure
training fidelity, which will greatly enhance the rigor of the proposed training rollout. Second, we will evaluate
the effectiveness of the SBIRT train-the-trainer model on key implementation science outcomes measured at
the trainer (e.g., fidelity, knowledge), provider (e.g., attitudes, self-efficacy, acceptability), and patient levels
(e.g., proportion of patients who receive each component of SBIRT – screening, brief intervention, and referral
to treatment). Finally, we will examine the relationship among trainer-level, provider-level, and patient-level
outcomes. Results of this study will advance knowledge of key implementation science questions, while
promoting the integration of alcohol and HIV care, in a global priority setting."

10879171,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Cervical cancer (CC) is the fourth most common female malignancy worldwide. Mortality rates are three times
higher in Latin America and the Caribbean than in the United States, and Puerto Rico (PR) has the highest
age-adjusted incidence for cervical cancer in the US despite of vaccination. Persistent infection with high-risk
human papilloma virus (hr-HPV) types is a necessary, but not sufficient to cause cervical cancer. Other yet
unknown cofactors are required to promote hr-HPH persistence and progression to cancer, however these
pathways are not completely understood. Besides HPV infections, the key factors that promote cancer
progression likely reside in the cervical environment, notably its local microbiome. Preliminary evidence
suggests that increased bacterial diversity and reduction in Lactobacillus are associated with High grade
squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), however, except for preliminary data from our group that studied
cervical yeast, we have not yet understood the importance of the fungal communities and other combined
metabolic and host factors on disease progression. Here we propose to comprehensively study virus-
microbiota-host interactions, using state of the art sequencing technologies and novel bioinformatic algorithms
to address a malignancy, that is characterized by health disparities in the US and globally. Our overarching
goal is to identify microbial inter-species interactions and host factors that control hr-HPV persistence
and cervical disease. We will leverage samples and data already collected from over 300 participants in a
cross-sectional pilot study cohort, and to additionally select 200 participants to follow up longitudinally.
In Aim 1, we will quantify the cervicovaginal bacterial and fungal community composition and metabolome
cross-sectionally, differentiating women with or without cervical dysplasia and presence or absence of high risk
(hr) HPV. In Aim 2 we will identify bacterial and fungal strains, functional gene pathways and metabolites that
over a longitudinal timeseries distinguish women without cervical disease (NILM - HPV negative and low-risk),
from high-risk HPV infected women who progress to high grade dysplasia. Having shotgun metagenomics data
from selected patients longitudinally is unique to be able to understand gene and functional changes of key
taxa to inform on their role in progression or regression. We hypothesize that there will be genomic bacterial
strains that differentiate women without lesions and with cervical disease and that multiple levels of omics data,
including the microbiome, the metabolome and the cytokine profiles may have higher predictive value than
HPV risk alone. This work will develop a strong platform for a long standing and central question regarding
cervical disease in Hispanics and will lay the foundation for elucidating the mechanisms by which
microbiomes affect HPV persistence and dysplasia."
10879173,"ABSTRACT
Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is up to 99% effective in reducing the risk of HIV through sexual
exposure. Studies in high-prevalence settings have found a significant association between PrEP
uptake and a decline in HIV incidence. In the U.S., Latino men who have sex with men (MSM)
have high HIV prevalence rates. However, PrEP awareness and uptake are significantly less
compared with White MSM. Puerto Rico has one of the highest HIV rates and the lowest PrEP
uptake in the U.S. To have an impact on the HIV epidemic, priority groups for the Ending the HIV
Epidemic Initiative including Latino MSM, need to have access to PrEP. Behavioral interventions
can improve PrEP uptake among MSM, but we still need to identify the best delivery method for
implementing interventions to enhance PrEP uptake. After the COVID-19 pandemic, increased
use of online tools might impact interventions delivery for health outcomes. Given the HIV
incidence among MSM and the health disparities that hinder HIV prevention efforts for this
population, adequate PrEP uptake is fundamental to end the HIV epidemic in Puerto Rico. There is
an urgent need to optimize PrEP to prevent new HIV transmissions. The proposed study employs
Comparative Effectiveness Research approach and will be guided by the PrEP care continuum
framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to reduce
barriers for PrEP uptake among MSM in Puerto Rico through the following specific aims: 1. Aim 1.
To develop a motivational interviewing intervention, we refer to as ""ConPrEP"" to be tested for
efficacy of PrEP uptake between face-to-face or online formats. Latino MSM in Puerto Rico. Based
on previous intervention research, we will develop the ‘ConPrEP’ intervention to increase PrEP
uptake among MSM using two modalities: face-to-face and online. The development of the
intervention will be guided by three previous interventions and employ Motivational Interviewing for
behavior change, proven to improve HIV prevention and health outcomes. Aim 2. To assess and
compare the effectiveness of the ‘ConPrEP’ intervention for each modality (face-to-face and

randomized control design to determine effectiveness and compare delivery modalities of the
behavioral intervention. Outcomes between both modalities will be compared. The goal is to
reduce new HIV infections by increasing PrEP uptake in a highly affected population. Research
findings will help advance EHE efforts to optimize PrEP among Latino MSM in a priority

10876709,"While the development of effective vaccines against CoV-2 is cause for optimism, vaccine hesitancy in
developed countries and shortages in low-income countries are jeopardizing efforts to curb the pandemic. Out
of the 6.4 billion people living in low-income countries, only 2% have access to vaccines. Consequently, the
conditions are ripe for continued spike mutation and evolution to increasingly transmissible strains causing more
severe illness. Some of these emerging strains may even challenge the protection of vaccines. In this application,
we propose a novel therapeutic approach for the eradication of CoV-2. We developed a new strategy, which
consists of hijacking the viral replication machinery to trigger the death of CoV-2-infected cells, while preserving
uninfected cells. We propose to administer intranasally human ACE2 transgenic mice and Syrian hamsters a
“tailored” RNA encoding the diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA) called {CoV-2 Hijack DTA} that is only recognized
and transcribed by the CoV-2 polymerase (Pol/RdRp) present in infected cells, triggering DTA expression and
rapid death of infected cells. Since DTA cannot cross the cellular membrane, it cannot kill uninfected cells.
Because RNA can be easily broken down in the body, it needs to be transported within a protective carrier.
Noninvasive aerosol inhalation is a well-established method of drug delivery to the respiratory tract and
represents an ideal route for nucleic-acid-based therapeutics as demonstrated in various clinical trials. We
propose to design degradable polymer-lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that can deliver RNAs by nebulization
(inhalation) to the respiratory tract. We propose to synthesize hyperbranched poly-beta amino esters (hPBAEs)
to enable nanoformulation by nebulizer of stable and concentrated polyplexes suitable for inhalation. This
strategy should achieve uniform distribution of RNAs throughout lungs resulting in high levels of proteins of
interest 24h post-inhalation of hPBAE polyplexes without local or systemic toxicity due to rapid degradation of
hPBAE vectors. The safety and antiviral efficacy of nebulized {CoV-2 Hijack DTA} RNA LNPs stably protected
by degradable hPBAEs will be analyzed. Our in vivo imaging IVIS Lumina S5 system permits a daily
bioluminescence (NanoLuc-CoV-2) or fluorescence (mNeonGreen CoV-2) quantification of the {CoV-2 Hijack
DTA} RNA LNPs-mediated killing of infected lungs in live animals. We will investigate the MoA causing the killing
of CoV-2-infected cells by {CoV-2 Hijack DTA}. We will use complementary approaches to determine whether
{CoV-2 Hijack DTA} triggers apoptosis, membrane permeability and/or chromosomal degradation leading to cell
killing. By scRNA-Seq, we will analyze i) the specific killing of infected cells at high resolution on large numbers
of cells exposed to {CoV-2 Hijack DTA}; ii) the global map of apoptotic DNA breakpoints such as DNA
fragmentation; and iii) the phenotype of immunological target cells. We will examine whether {CoV-2 Hijack DTA}
RNA LNPs counteract the deleterious inflammatory response, which occurs during CoV-2 infection including
histopathological lesion development, interstitial pneumonia and cytokine cascade."
10876710,"SUMMARY
Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHV), made from glutaraldehyde-fixed xenografts, are widely used for surgical
(SAVR) and transcatheter valve interventions (TAVR), but suffer from limited durability due to Structural Valve
Degeneration (SVD). Advances in BHV device engineering and delivery have created the possibility to provide
state-of-the-art care to heart valve disease patients that were once deemed inoperable due to their risk score
and advanced co-morbidities. However, the same class of devices is offered to all patients, irrespectively of their
co-morbidities and susceptibility to structural valve degeneration. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a common
comorbidity in patients who require BHV and is a known risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Our published
and preliminary results show the enhanced susceptibility of bio-implantable materials to oxidation, glycation, pro-
calcific proteins, and crosslinkers in patients with Metabolic Syndrome or rodent model of MetS, using Zucker
Diabetic Fatty (ZDF, Obese fa/fa). We have also shown that poly-2-methyl-2-oxazoline (POZ) functionalization
of clinically graded BHVs and bovine pericardium mitigates SVD by reducing protein absorption, decreasing
glycation, and oxidation products accumulation, and enhancing thromboresistance. Notably, POZ
functionalization reduces calcification using human serum-incubation assays and subcutaneous implants in ZDF
rats. In MetS patients, both surgical (SAVR) and percutaneous (TAVR) approaches are valid treatment options,
although some recent studies raise the possibility that, in the long term SAVR could exhibit higher survival rates.
Finally, given their conditions, MetS patients are often pharmacologically treated to control hyperglycemia and
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, SVD - in the clinical setting of Metabolic Syndrome - is driven by
three main factors: a) the biochemical profile of the patients, b) device selection and the susceptibility of the
implanted material to degradation, and c) the pharmacological treatments that MetS patients are receiving. This
application will address these three aspects and test the hypothesis that a combination of POZ-modified surgical
or transcatheter bioprosthetic valve and pharmacological management of MetS is needed to mitigate SVD and
improve durability. Once completed, the expected outcomes are to identify the main driving factors responsible
for the accelerated structural degeneration and calcification of implantable materials in patients with MetS."
10878629,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by the acute onset of severe hypoxemia
associated with bilateral pulmonary opacities on imaging that are not fully explained by cardiac dysfunction.
ARDS has a major impact on global health, representing 10% of intensive care unit admissions, 23% of
patients supported on invasive mechanical ventilation, and has an associated mortality of 35%. Despite this
burden on public health, there are no disease-modifying therapies for ARDS that have shown efficacy.
Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are an attractive therapeutic target for ARDS because they play a central role in
almost all aspects of its pathophysiology. In animal models, different AM “subsets” can augment inflammation,
clear debris/dead cells, halt inflammation, and coordinate responses from other cell-types (e.g. T cells). These
distinct AM functions are largely determined by cell “ontogeny” (resident vs. recruited). Resident AMs (rAMs)
are embryonically-derived and self-renew during life. In injury, blood monocytes are recruited to the lung and
mature into monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMs) that replenish depleted rAMs. Preliminary data in this
proposal and prior publications has identified AM subsets that are associated better (e.g. CD71HIPD-L1HI,
CD123HI) or worse (e.g. CD163HI, CD14HI alveolar monocytes) ARDS outcomes. The functional roles of these
different AM subsets in humans, and how ontogeny contributes to their development and fate, are not known.
The primary objective of this project is to determine how AM subset ontogeny and function contribute to ARDS
clinical outcomes. Aim 1 is a mechanistic aim that will leverage AM chimerism in lung transplant recipients to
test the hypothesis that recruited blood monocytes can mature into either protective or harmful MoM subsets.
Aim 2A is a translational aim that will perform intracellular cytokine staining, efferocytosis assays, and AM/T
cell co-culturing on AM subsets collected from a multi-center cohort of subjects with ARDS to test the
hypothesis that different AM subsets have highly distinct functional properties. Aim 2B is a clinical aim that will
test for associations between AM subsets and patient-centered ARDS clinical outcomes.
This project leverages a multi-disciplinary team of experts in ARDS, lung transplant, macrophage biology,
immunology, and computational biology. Findings from this project will provide key insights into ARDS
pathobiology, forming a basis for future interventional studies to determine how to target AMs in ARDS and
other inflammatory conditions of the lung."
10881672,"Dr. Dong is a nationally and internationally recognized investigator in the research field of kidney
injury and repair. His current work is focused on mitochondria, metabolism, autophagy, and
epigenetic regulation in kidney injury and repair under the disease conditions of renal ischemia-
reperfusion, diabetes, and cisplatin nephrotoxicity. As of July 1, 2019, Dr. Dong has published
256 research articles that have been cited for over 20,000 times with H-index of 66, attesting his
scientific contributions. Dr. Dong is currently the principal investigator on a VA Merit review award
and two NIH RO1 grants.
 In the project of the VA Merit review award, Dr. Dong and colleagues will elucidate the
mechanism of renal fibrosis after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Specifically, they will determine the
role of renal tubular autophagy in kidney fibrosis after ischemia-reperfusion injury, delineate the
involvement of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) in autophagy activation, and identify the key
profibrotic factors that are produced in renal tubules in an autophagy-dependent manner for
interstitial fibroblast activation. By elucidating tubular autophagy in renal fibrosis after ischemia-
reperfusion injury, this project may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic strategies.
 In the project of NIH 5R01DK058831, Dr. Dong and colleagues propose to investigate the
mechanism underlying the heightened kidney injury sensitivity in diabetes. They will specifically
determine the role of p53 in miR-214 induction in diabetic kidneys, delineate microRNA-214 (miR-
214) repression of ULK1, and elucidate autophagy impairment as a key to injury sensitivity in
diabetic kidneys. Completion of this project will delineate a novel pathway of p53/miR- 214/ULK1
that leads to autophagy impairment and kidney injury sensitivity in diabetes. As a result, it may
identify miR-214 and autophagy as novel therapeutic targets for kidney injury in diabetic patients.
 In the project of NIH 5R01DK087843, Dr. Dong and colleagues will investigate nephrotoxicity
induced by cisplatin, one of the most widely used cancer therapy drugs. Specifically, they will
elucidate mitophagy as a protective mechanism of autophagy in cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity,
determine the autophagy-promoting role of p53, and analyze the effects of PKCδ inhibition in
autophagy-suppressed and non-suppressed mice. The research will not only gain insights into
autophagy protection and regulation in renal pathogenesis, but will also elucidate autophagy as
a mechanism of the renoprotective effect of PKCδ inhibition, suggesting novel therapeutic
strategies for kidney protection during chemotherapy in cancer patients.
 In conclusion, Dr. Dong is an outstanding investigator who has made seminal contributions to
the research field of kidney injury and repair, which are highly relevant to veterans’ health. In the
ongoing projects funded by VA Merit and two NIH R01 grants, Dr. Dong will continue to make
important discoveries that may lead to novel therapies for kidney diseases for the improvement
of veterans’ health."
10881673,"This application is for a competitive renewal of the SRCS program of Dr. Pradeep K Dudeja. His program is
focused on elucidating the mechanisms of regulation of electrolyte and fluid absorption in the human intestine
in health and disease. His studies are aimed at understanding the pathophysiology of diarrheal diseases as it
pertains to infectious diarrhea and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) associated diarrhea and to develop
better therapeutic interventions. Diarrheal diseases are very common in our Veterans due to high incidence of
IBD, infections and deployment related chronic illnesses and stress. Our program utilizes state-of-the-art
approaches including human intestinal enteroids or mini guts and enteroid derived monolayers, organ-donor
human intestine derived purified antipodal plasma membranes from various regions of the gut, in vitro
molecular approaches and in vivo approaches utilizing knock out and transgenic mouse models to better
understand the pathophysiology of diarrhea and to identify novel therapeutic targets. Our group has had a
unique advantage of leading this field globally due to some of the pioneering techniques established by us
using the organ donor human intestines. We have extensively published our work in over 220 original peer
reviewed research articles in many prestigious journals in the field including Gastroenterology (impact factor
21) and J Clin Invest (12.3). We have also extensively defined the role of gut-microbe interactions in diarrheal
diseases with respect to infectious diarrhea and the beneficial role of probiotics in these diseases. In addition,
one of the key hallmarks of our program has been a multidisciplinary and collaborative nature of the research
enterprise with a deep focus on mentoring new generation of VA and affiliated university investigators to
enable them to establish their own independent research programs. We have been successful at both the
fronts of making new discoveries in the field and mentoring new generation of young scientists and
establishing a solid research environment at our local VA as well as at affiliated university. Our program has
been continuously funded by multiple VA and NIH awards. This current application is intended to highlight the
success of our program and requesting renewal of this SRCS program to continue the progress towards the
new heights of success by nurturing and mentoring a new generation of investigators."
10881674,"The PI, Mark S. Kindy, Ph.D., has been studying the mechanisms and pathways associated with a number of
neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. These include, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), stroke, Parkinson’s
disease (PD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), spinal cord injury (SCI),
among others. All of these disorders are afflictions that are present in the VA population and contribute
significantly to the overall health of the Veterans. The overarching goal is to understand the mechanisms
involved in the disease processes and to develop therapeutic approaches to treat them. I have three basic areas
of research that we focus on. The first program is centered around stroke and the impact of negative vascular
health factors (such as: obesity, diabetes, age, salt sensitivity hyperlipidemia, and hypertensivity) on the
induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and activation of the inflammation (inflammasome). We
have shown that aged animals with the risk factors have worse outcomes and recovery is exacerbated due to
the presence of both systemic and neuroinflammation. The generation of better clinical models of stroke to test
these risk factors and health disparities following injury. Studies using low-density lipoprotein receptor (ldlr)
deficient mice with and without high fat diet are being used to study the impact of oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs)
on stroke outcomes. Mice expressing OxPL antibodies will be tested for protection from stroke. Finally, we are
examining the impact of chronic kidney disease, left ventricular hypertrophy and FGF23 on stroke and stroke
outcomes. Mice with targeted deletion of the fgfr4 gene or overexpression of the FGF23 are being examined for
stroke outcomes. These studies will better capture the true nature of veterans and civilians who have a stroke
and provide a better approach to treating the disease. A second line of research focuses on the role of serum
amyloid A (SAA) proteins in the pathogenesis of stroke. Recent studies have implicated SAAs in innate immunity
and various disorders, however the precise mechanism eludes us. SAAs are elevated following stroke (cerebral
ischemia) and TBI, and our studies show that SAA increases the cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), which is
mediated by Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, cathepsin B and caspase-1 and may play a
role in the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. Using transgenic and gene deleted mice as well as AAV
expressing constructs we are evaluating the impact of SAA on stroke and other neurological diseases. Another
line of research focuses on serum amyloid P component (SAP), which is found in all amyloids and studies have
suggested that it plays an integral role in the formation, progression, and maintenance of the amyloid disease
processes. The amyloid diseases include: AD, PD (tau, -synuclein, TDP-43), tauopathies, CTE, ALS (SOD1,
TDP-43, C9ORF72), systemic amyloids (AA, TTR, amylin), Huntington’s disease (HD), ABri and ADan.
Inflammation modifies SAP function, and inflammatory signaling pathways impair cognitive function in vivo. Our
long-term goal is to determine the mechanisms regulating SAP function, particularly within the setting of AD and
inflammatory diseases. Consequently, the objective of this grant is to characterize the role for SAP in
inflammation and AD. We have developed and amassed various transgenic and gene deleted mice as well as
viruses and inhibitors to determine the impact of SAP in the amyloid diseases. Since both SAA and SAP are
produced mainly in the liver, we are working with Ionis Pharmaceuticals in the design and testing of antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) as therapeutic approaches to these disorders. In addition, we are working with
clinicians at the Haley VA and other VAs (Boston CTE Center) and Universities around the US to correlate the
animal studies with human disease. Using autopsy tissues, blood, CSF and other reagents to validate the studies
in our mouse and rat models. This is critical to our basic understanding of the disease process and in the
development of therapeutics for treatment."
10881737,"Most human pregnancies fail around the time of embryo implantation. Yet, the developmental mechanisms
of this stage and how they go awry remain a mystery, because the implanted embryo is inaccessible to
analysis within the body of the mother. Uncovering these mechanisms is of critical importance to overcome
existing barriers to fertility and proper development. We have successfully generated systems that enable
development of natural mouse and human embryos from pre- to post-implantation stages in vitro, and built
stem cell-derived synthetic mouse embryos that can mimic some aspects of early post-implantation
development. But approaches to study development continuously through the implantation stage and
beyond gastrulation are lacking. We now propose to create a maternal-like environment that permits the
long-term survival of both natural and synthetic mouse embryos. Our first challenge will be to engineer
synthetic pre-implantation blastocysts with an expanded ability to generate the full range of correctly
functioning extra-embryonic tissues. This breakthrough is expected to enable their implantation and
development in utero, and may eventually transform approaches for engineering genetically modified mice.
We will use these new tools to determine the precise cellular and molecular mechanisms that allow synthetic
blastocysts to interact with the uterus in foster mothers. Our second challenge will be to generate artificial
substrates, comprising hydrogels and proteins of the decidual extra-cellular matrix, to facilitate implantation
events. In parallel, we will engineer synthetic placental-like structures for natural and synthetic embryo
development using organoids derived from trophoblast and endometrial tissue. These systems would allow
investigations and tracking of how insults to pre- and peri-implantation development, such as the exposure
to pathogens, toxins, or teratogens affect subsequent development and life. Our third challenge will be to
utilize these systems to discover the molecular events that accompany implantation. We will take advantage
of our in vitro placental systems to investigate the chemical and physical signalling events that are key for
development and determine how improved extra-embryonic contributions affect embryonic development
until neurulation. These innovations will allow us to finally decipher a stage of development that is currently
out of reach and of which our knowledge is greatly lacking. This will bring insight into a time of development
when most pregnancies fail and thereby lead to advances in assisted reproductive technology; it will offer
new screening routes for drug testing and environmental safety; and it will advance our knowledge of the
use of stem cells in organogenesis and regenerative medicine."
10888087,"ABSTRACT
Auditory function relies on highly specialized and precise neuronal connectivity. A significant
challenge for the field of auditory neuroscience is to understand how these neural circuits form during
development. Our previous work suggests an important function for caspase-3, a protease best
known for its role in apoptosis. Cleaved (active) caspase-3 is present in the developing auditory
brainstem prior to the period of programmed cell death. During embryonic development, it is first
seen in auditory nerve axons, then in the synaptic target of these axons in nucleus magnocellularis
(NM), then in the synaptic target of NM, in nucleus laminaris (NL) dendrites. Caspase-3 inhibition
during development results in substantial errors in NM axon targeting and in structural abnormalities
in NL, with incomplete lamination. We propose to investigate the regulation of caspase-3 activation
during development. We will examine the basis for the progression of caspase-3 activation through
the auditory pathway and test the hypothesis that cleaved caspase-3 is necessary in auditory axons
for activation of caspase-3 in their synaptic targets. Given the extent of anatomical circuit disruption
that occurs when caspase-3 is inhibited, we will investigate the effects of caspase-3 inhibition on
maturation of auditory brainstem synapses. We will test auditory brainstem responses in hatchlings
after caspase-3 inhibition to determine effects on hearing. We have begun to investigate the
molecules through which caspase-3 influences auditory development. Our proteomics study revealed
hundreds of proteins that are cleaved by caspase-3 in the developing auditory brainstem. Gene
ontology analysis revealed that the most abundant cellular localization category for caspase-3
substrates was exosomes/extracellular vesicles (EVs). This finding suggests an overarching model in
which caspase-3 influences the composition of EVs, which in turn provide an effective means of local
communication between cells during development. We will examine enriched EV samples using
tandem mass spectrometry to determine how caspase-3 regulates the protein content of EVs. We will
test whether pharmacological disruption of EV formation impairs auditory development. We will use an
EV grafting strategy to investigate whether EVs can rescue developmental deficits in caspase-3
inhibited host embryos. Together, these studies will advance our understanding of neural circuit
assembly in the developing auditory brainstem."

Core C is co-directed by Venkat Malladi, M.S., who is the Director of the UTSW Department of Bioinformatics
Core Facility and supervises genomics analyses (>3,000 WES/RNA-Seq datasets). It is also co-directed by
Alana Christie, M.S., who is the Co-Leader of Biostatistics for the KCP and oversees data management and
Kidney Cancer Explorer (KCE), a pioneering tool that automatically extracts information from the electronic
medical record, self-updates, and links this information to experimental genomics as well as a state-of-the-art
BioBank in OpenSpecimen. During Years 1 – 6, Core members assisted with study design, bioinformatics, data
management, and data analysis for individual Projects, the Career Enhancement Program (CEP) and the
Developmental Research Program (DRP) and jointly published 30 manuscripts including in high-impact journals.
The Core also made significant contributions by developing novel biostatistics and bioinformatics methodologies
with direct impact on SPORE Projects. For the next funding period (Years 7 – 12), the Core will provide state-of-
the-art biostatistics and bioinformatics support as well as database management. Core members will work with
SPORE investigators to ensure that the appropriate statistical design is incorporated into all studies from their
inception, that the data are appropriately linked and validated, and that all results are interpreted on statistical
as well as biological significance. In addition, the Core will expand KCE by increasing functionality and linking it
to external resources/datasets. To support the kidney cancer SPORE, Core C will assist with the following
Specific Aims. Aim 1: To provide strong biostatistical support for experimental design with power calculation,
statistical analysis, and interpretation for all KCP SPORE research activities. Aim 2: To provide strong

The Translational Imaging Core (TIC) is a technologically advanced state-of-the-art radiology Core characterized
by the breadth of its scope and versatility. Its adaptability to the needs of the SPORE is illustrated by the prior
and current SPORE proposals. In Years 1 – 5, the TIC developed and deployed novel tools to support
investigators centering on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We advanced novel applications of
multiparametric MRI in kidney cancer to evaluate a broad range of areas central to the projects including tumor
aggressiveness, angiogenesis, and heterogeneity. For the renewal, the TIC will support SPORE investigators
through the development of innovative radiotracers to query oncogenic drivers and tumor/microenvironment
interactions using positron emission tomography (PET). For Project 1, we have developed a novel radiotracer,
[18F]PT2385, to visualize what is arguably the most important driver of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC),
the HIF2α protein. Of note, we showed that PT2385, a first-in-class HIF2α inhibitor, exclusively binds HIF2α.
This offers a unique opportunity to turn this drug into a radiotracer that, for the first time, enables visualization of
HIF2α in patients. In July 2021, we obtained an investigational new drug (IND) approval from the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA; IND 156933). In Project 2, the TIC will support the In Vivo Metabolism Lab with pre-clinical
MRI imaging of patient-derived tumorgrafts and enable new research directions through the generation of PET
imaging methods to query tumor metabolism using nutrient-derived radiotracers. For instance, PET imaging with
L-[5-11C]glutamine provides a noninvasive method for real-time monitoring of glutamine metabolism and
assessment of the impact of drug inhibitors. For Project 3, the TIC has generated a PET radiotracer to enable
a deeper understanding of the interplay between the tumor and its microenvironment, particularly the interaction
between tumor cells and the immune system. The TIC turned the therapeutic anti-PD-L1 antibody, atezolizumab,
into a specific imaging biomarker for PD-L1. After evaluation in our tumorgraft platform, we conducted dosimetry
studies and obtained an IND in 2019. Since then, we have successfully initiated the first immunoPET (iPET) trial
in the U.S. of 89Zr-labeled atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced and metastatic kidney cancer
(NCT04006522). The TIC goals are: Aim 1: To develop and evaluate a novel radiotracer, [18F]PT2385, to monitor
expression of the most important driver of ccRCC, HIF2α (Project 1). Aim 2: To enable real-time evaluation of
novel immunotherapy combinations through iPET (Project 3). Aim 3: To expand metabolic experiments with
novel metabolic radiotracers and support the In Vivo Metabolism Lab with preclinical imaging (Project 2). Aim
4: To empower SPORE investigators with novel image-based services. We will offer image-based targeted tissue
procurement, expert image analysis, and imaging archive. The TIC is committed to supporting investigators in
Projects 1–3, the Career Enhancement Program (CEP), and the Developmental Research Program (DRP).
Core personnel will continue to work closely with SPORE PIs to provide state-of-the-art imaging support."

10890833,"This is a revised application for an R35 grant from the National Cancer Institute entitled, “Mechanisms of
human papillomavirus entry.” HPV is responsible for 5% of human cancer, millions of cases of genital warts,
and countless cases of other types of papillomas (most caused by non-vaccine HPV types). Despite the
existence of effective vaccines, HPV infection and the cancers it causes will remain a major public health
problem for decades because vaccine uptake is poor and vaccination does not clear established infections.
There are no specific treatments for HPV or HPV-associated cancers. The DiMaio lab has received more than
35 years of continuous funding from the NCI, during which time it has made seminal contributions to tumor
virology. We recently discovered that HPV traffics via the retrograde transport pathway during infection,
showed that retromer is required for sorting of the incoming virus particle into this pathway and that HPV is a
novel type of retromer cargo, and discovered a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) that drives the HPV L2 capsid
protein into the cytoplasm to engage retromer. This is the first example where either retromer or a CPP has
been shown to play a role in virus entry. These results have been paradigm-shifting in the field and have been
published since 2013 in Cell, PLoS Pathogens, mBio, PNAS, and Journal of Cell Biology, and they have
fundamentally changed our understanding of HPV entry and the role of retromer and CPPs in biology. Here,
we will discover how HPV accomplishes these amazing feats. We will determine the requirements for L2
membrane protrusion and establish how sequences flanking the core CPP modulate its activity. We will test
whether the abundance of CPP sequences in the extant papillomavirus virome reflects their membrane-
penetrating activity, determine whether L2 truly adopts a transmembrane existence, and map L2 segments
exposed in the cytoplasm. We have designed an innovative new functional genetics approach and used it to
isolate artificial small transmembrane proteins that inhibit HPV entry, and we will use these artificial proteins to
identify new HPV entry factors and dissect their role in HPV entry. We will exploit our understanding of HPV
entry to design inhibitory peptides that harness the membrane-penetrating activity of CPPs to deliver the
retromer binding site into the cytoplasm to compete for binding with incoming HPV, validating an entirely new
approach to prevent virus infections. We will develop the first genetic system to select HPV mutants with
informative phenotypes, attempt to identify the HPV entry receptor, and extend these studies to additional
tumor viruses and HIV. These experiments will elucidate important aspects of the mechanisms of HPV entry,
validate new approaches to prevent and treat HPV infection, and revolutionize genetic analysis of HPV.
Critically, our studies will provide new insights into fundamental cell biology. If this proposal is funded, we will
continue to make novel and important contributions to virology and cancer research for many years."

Summary/Abstract:
The dynamics of cell signals are instructive features that guide cell and tissue behavior. Yet, many important
pathways, like the Wnt/-catenin pathway, lack probes to observe and dissect endogenous signal dynamics
with precision in space and in time. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop novel molecular probes that
can visualize and perturb endogenous signal dynamics, with a focus on the Wnt/-catenin pathway. Our
proposal is divided into two projects. In the first project, we will develop a novel fluorescent biosensor to enable
direct visualization of Wnt signal dynamics. Existing Wnt reporters can be dim and require genomic
engineering of the target cell, act on slow transcriptional timescales that can obscure the upstream pathway
dynamics, and provide no spatial information about the input Wnt signal. Because Wnt stimulation requires the
aggregation of pathway co-receptor LRP6, observation of LRP6 oligomerization could provide a
spatiotemporally resolved readout of pathway activity. We thus envision a new class of biosensor that allows
observation of the aggregation of intracellular proteins. Our reporter must meet two important design criteria.
First, it must report on endogenous protein clustering to avoid overexpression of signaling proteins or genomic
modifications. Second, because physiological protein aggregates are small and often below the diffraction limit
of visible light, our reporter must “visually amplify” endogenous clusters such that they are visible by
conventional microscopy. We describe plans to develop, characterize, and apply such a reporter, called
CluMPS. CluMPS visually magnifies small endogenous protein clusters through principles of protein phase
separation. Using both experiments and simulations, we will characterize the ability of CluMPS to detect and
amplify intracellular protein aggregates, using optogenetic clustering of GFP as a model analyte. We will then
apply CluMPS to detect clusters of endogenous proteins known to form physiological aggregates. Finally, we
will apply CluMPS to detect the clustering of endogenous Wnt receptor LRP6 in response to cellular Wnt
stimulation, and we will validate LRP6-CluMPS activity in cell, tissue, and developmental models. The
modularity of CluMPS will allow its adaptation to generate sensors of diverse signaling pathways and cell
states. In the second project, we will engineer the first optogenetic tools to allow inhibition of endogenous
signaling pathways with spatiotemporal precision. We will target inhibition of both Wnt/-catenin signaling and,
separately, Ras-Erk signaling. We will validate successful pathway inhibition in the context of cell culture
models of cancer and patterning of in vitro intestinal organoids. Notably, all of our probes will be designed in a
modular fashion and thus could be readily modified to observe or inhibit diverse targets of interest. Success in
our work will result in a suite of new tools to observe, perturb, and understand the fundamental biochemical
processes that underlie normal physiology and its breakdown in disease, in close alignment with the central
mission of NIGMS."
10890836,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Achieving functional ambulation post stroke continues to be a challenge for stroke survivors,
clinicians and researchers. The proposed study builds on our earlier R01 where we successfully
examined the feasibility of a clinically implementable walking program which involves high
intensity speed-based treadmill training (HIISTT) in combination with cortical priming to improve
walking speed of individuals with stroke. Cortical priming has emerged as a promising adjuvant
to enhance the outcomes of motor training. Our research team has pioneered and successfully
developed neuromodulation techniques for the lower limb motor cortex using non-invasive
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and ankle motor skill training. In this renewal
application, our goal is to quantify the effectiveness of 36 sessions of cortical priming plus
HIISTT intervention in comparison to sham priming plus HIISTT. Outcome measures will include
gait variables, balance, aerobic capacity, quality of life, neurophysiological measures of
descending and interhemispheric corticomotor excitability measured with transcranial magnetic
stimulation (TMS), and changes in serum BDNF before, immediately after and 3-months post
training. There has been a growing interest in understanding responsiveness to training to
personalize stroke rehabilitation. We aim to understand variability in responsiveness to training
using patient-specific parameters such as participant demographics, neurophysiological
measures and the presence of genetic variations such as brain derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) polymorphism. With our innovative mechanistic approach to enhance walking recovery,
we seek to optimize gait rehabilitation post stroke and characterize relationships between neural
mechanisms, motor function and genetic variations. Improved gait will enable stroke survivors to
be more independent in the community and advance their quality of life, which is highly relevant
to the mission of the NIH."
10888472,"PROJECT SUMMARY
While dementia is considered a disease of learning and memory, early disruptions to sensory processes such
as visual impairments are shown to occur prior to cognitive decline and increase risk for Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) diagnosis. There is a lack of essential knowledge on the role visual sensory impairment plays in onset
and progression of AD. One targeted approach to resolving this gap in knowledge requires identifying how
pathological amyloid and tau protein accumulations in the eye damage the entire primary visual circuit from retina
to brain. Understanding how and when dysfunction occurs along this primary retinal pathway may illuminate new
opportunities for early intervention in AD. The objective of this R03 proposal is to uncover novel disease
mechanisms arising from visual dysfunction that can be targeted for prevention or early dementia intervention.
The central hypothesis of this research is that presence of pathological Aβ or tau in the retina causes damaging
changes along the primary retinal pathway to primary visual cortex (V1), where disease mechanisms can then
spread via V1’s interconnections to brain regions affecting learning and memory. Preliminary research shows
that pathological amyloid and tau proteins injected in the mouse eye cause hyperactivity of neurons in V1, which
can ultimately lead to neurodegeneration. This hyperactivity may result from damage to GABA interneurons in
this region. We will use experimental models that induce amyloid and tau pathology into the visual system of
healthy mice by injecting these proteins into the a) eye or b) V1 and measuring the effects of this manipulation
on visual system circuitry in accordance with the following Specific Aims: SA1) Determine how pathological
AD proteins in the eye affect structure and function of the primary visual pathway in the brain; SA2)
Determine how pathological amyloid and tau proteins in primary visual cortex (V1) impact
interconnected brain pathways. These studies will generate important preliminary data identifying
mechanisms by which early visual system pathology may damage non-visual brain regions. This work will provide
the foundation for future research addressing a critical barrier in the field of identifying targets for intervention
that can protect both visual function and disease progression in AD."

Melissa Wong, Ph.D., and Mara Sherman, Ph.D., Program Co-Leaders
The Cancer Biology Program (CB) is the unified discovery engine of the Knight Cancer Institute (KCI). Its focus
is on discovering novel therapeutic mechanisms and targets for cancer therapy, through integrative investigation
of genetic, molecular and cellular processes underlying cancer initiation and progression. CB members drive the
basic and basic-to-translational research innovation that is foundational to advances in Precision Early Detection
and Precision Oncology, in alignment with the KCI Strategic Plan. Scientific research within the program spans
the continuum from cancer initiation through progression, with emphasis on how cell signaling and the crosstalk
between cells within the tumor microenvironment influence tumorigenesis and the response to therapy. To
accomplish these goals, the program is organized into three research themes: Tumorigenesis & Genetic
Instability (examining cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms that predispose to cancer, including regulation of
cell cycle checkpoint control, DNA damage and repair, and genetic and epigenetic alterations); Signal
Transduction (focused on cellular signaling mechanisms relevant to homeostatic and neoplastic cell
proliferation); and the Tumor Microenvironment (investigating mesenchymal support, immune, and vascular
cell interactions with neoplastic cells). Program co-Leader Melissa Wong, Ph.D. is an expert in stem cell biology,
particularly in colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer. Co-Leader Mara Sherman, Ph.D. is an expert in micro-
environmental regulation of solid tumorigenesis, with a focus on pancreatic cancer. The 38 members of CB are
drawn from five basic science departments, five clinical departments or divisions in the OHSU School of
Medicine, and four institutes within OHSU. Total direct cost funding as of December 31, 2020 was $9,955,528
with peer-reviewed funding of $9,120,686 of which $4,436,923 or 49% was from the NCI. The discoveries made
in this program have resulted in 323 publications during the funding period, of which 20% are intra-programmatic
collaborations, 48% are inter-programmatic, and 44% are inter-institutional collaborations; 24% of these
publications are in journals with an impact factor greater than 10. CB members made numerous impactful
scientific discoveries, including the development of new genetically-engineered mouse models for breast cancer
and pancreatic cancer that faithfully recapitulate the inter-tumoral heterogeneity seen in patients; a novel,
hierarchical relationship between myeloid enhancer mutations and oncogene activation in the initiation and
progression of acute myeloid leukemia; and continued insights into micro-environmental contributions to tumor
development, progression, and therapeutic resistance. These investigations align with and directly support the
KCI Strategic Plan’s foundations of Precision Early Detection and Precision Oncology."

Jeffrey W. Tyner, Ph.D., and Lara Davis, M.D., Program Co-Leaders
The goal of the Translational Oncology (TO) Program is to translate cutting-edge biology into high-impact
interventions, with the aim of improving outcomes for patients with cancer. TO serves as the translational engine
of the Knight Cancer Institute (KCI), collaborating with members of all KCI Programs to translate their findings
into clinical investigations to benefit patients and advance understanding of the disease. TO research is
organized into two themes 1) Target Validation and 2) High-Impact Interventions that align with and directly
support the KCI Strategic Plan's foundations of Precision Early Detection and Precision Oncology. TO is a
transdisciplinary program comprising 70 members from 18 departments, divisions, and institutes at OHSU. TO
members produced 1,286 publications, of which 23% were intra-programmatic, 28% inter-programmatic and
70% inter-institutional collaborations. Total direct cost funding as of December 31, 2020 was $24,777,777, with
peer-reviewed funding of $4,929,404 and $2,833,122 or 57% being from the NCI. TO activities, often in
collaboration with other KCI Programs, have led to paradigm- and practice-changing impact across numerous
catchment area priority cancers. These include the largest-to-date integrative multi-omic cancer dataset, which
has been leveraged into cutting-edge clinical trials and is used by researchers around the world (Beat AML).
Numerous practice-changing therapeutics, originating from collaborative, trans-programmatic discoveries, have
been validated in pivotal trials in leukemia, sarcoma, and prostate cancer. The development of transformational
platforms has enabled real-time allocation of novel combination therapies in a cancer-agnostic manner based
on broad and deep tumor analytics conducted in a CLIA-approved environment. TO investigators also conducted
clinical trials leading to the first-ever demonstration of drug class activity in specific cancer types (e.g., checkpoint
blockade in prostate cancer). TO activities spearheaded precision early detection trials of non-invasive
technologies with exquisite sensitivity that facilitate diagnosis, monitoring, and follow-up. These and other TO
accomplishments engage the community and catchment area in a bidirectional manner where transformational
research and novel therapies are made available to the community while patient and advocate engagement
helps shape and inform research strategies. These activities also offer numerous opportunities for the education
and training of the next generation of scientists and physician-researchers. The TO Program plans to build on
the success of these existing projects with new endeavors, such as the Center for Experimental Therapeutics,
which will provide a resource for drug development and rapid translation into clinical trials."

The Quantitative Oncology (QO) Program is a multi-disciplinary research program formed to facilitate the
development of advanced technologies for cancer measurements and treatment, deeply characterize the
molecular and phenotypic states of cancers, and apply computational models to predict cancer behaviors and
outcomes. Program members develop and apply advances in ‘omic and imaging technologies, coupled with big
data analytics to enable quantitative understanding of the behavior of cancerous cells and tissues as they evolve,
respond to therapy, and interact with their microenvironments. This collaborative research program is organized
around three themes: 1) Technology Development (imaging, devices, and single-cell analyses), 2) Omics and
Characterization (comprehensive assessment of cancer cells and tissues), and 3) Systems Biology
(properties of cancer-related molecular networks, the molecular and cellular phenotypes they regulate, and their
evolution and adaptation during cancer development and treatment). QO research and innovation provides a
strong foundation for advances in the strategic priorities of the Knight Cancer Institute (KCI), Precision Early
Detection and Precision Oncology. The expertise in QO is essential to the development and deployment of tools

population health discoveries to at-risk populations and communities. CPC has 38 members conducting research
to reduce cancer burden through transdisciplinary collaborative science within three themes: 1) Prevention and
Risk Reduction, 2) Early Detection and Screening, and 3) Survivorship. There is also a cross-cutting theme
to improve cancer prevention and control for at-risk populations in our catchment area, including low-income,
rural, older adults, tribal communities and those with a familial predisposition to cancer. CPC has nearly doubled
peer-reviewed direct cost funding since the last cycle from $2,755,855 to $4,822,697, with NCI funding
accounting for $3,405,640, an increase of 98%. CPC scientists’ discoveries have resulted in 659 publications;
22% are intra-programmatic, 30% inter-programmatic, 55% are inter-institutional, and 20% are in journals with
an impact factor greater than 10.
CPC work addresses several of our high-priority cancers, and aims to improve equity in at-risk populations in
our catchment area. Highlights include translating discoveries from animal models of cancer cachexia and of
young women’s breast cancer to preclinical trials of therapeutic agents; advancing knowledge of the biology of
melanoma genetic risk and disease progression to advance our War On Melanoma; leading collaborative
research focused on increasing uptake of evidence-based cancer screenings in Oregon’s rural and low-income
populations; and improving decision-making and care planning for older patients with advanced lung cancer.
CPC members have led updates to national screening guidelines in breast, lung, and colon cancer and evidence-
based exercise recommendations for cancer survivors. Program members also lead innovative multi-investigator
initiatives. The Healthy Oregon Project led to an inter-programmatic Biden Cancer Moonshot grant, Evaluation
of Population Based Testing for HBOC and Lynch Syndromes to develop genetic screening approaches to
identify persons at risk for heritable cancers, while a new P50 NCI Implementation Science Center is conducting
intervention studies to transform clinical practice and increase delivery of cancer screening services to tens of
thousands of low-income community health center patients. CPC members also lead national training programs
for under-represented minorities, including cancer control training programs for American Indian and Alaskan

increase from 25% of the US population in 2015 (~83 million) to over 100 million by 2030,
accompanied by an increase in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of the
disease, that can lead to cirrhosis with liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite
its public health importance, there is currently no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of
NAFLD. NAFLD/NASH is a complex heterogeneous disorder involving multiple molecular
pathways. Development of efficacious pharmacotherapy has been hampered by the limited
utility of preclinical drug testing models. Simple cell culture and animal models do not
recapitulate the spectrum of NASH phenotypes in humans. Highlighting these species
differences, knock-in murine models with the high-risk NASH-associated genetic polymorphism,
PNPLA3 I148M, develop hepatic steatosis but do not recapitulate the progressive disease seen
in humans. Additionally, heterogeneity in risk of progression of NASH, individual genetic
variations modulating risk of fibrosis progression, and presence of NAFLD-associated metabolic
comorbidities such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), adds additional complexity. We will
implement the vLAMPS to initially characterize both a “normal” and a NAFLD/NASH vLAMPS
generated from primary human liver cells (hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, stellate
and Kupffer cells) and then reproduce the results with induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
We will ultimately generate patient-specific iPSCs of the four cell types from patients in our
NAFLD clinic to create patient-specific vLAMPS. We will test two cohorts: 1) patients with the
PNPLA3 I 148M variant and 2) patients with the wild-type PNPLA3 to identify the patients who
respond to two NAFLD drugs that have or are now going through clinical trials and two control
drugs. Importantly, this paradigm circumvents the conundrum of high-risk patients being
enrolled in large prolonged studies with a high likelihood of failure being simultaneously
disqualified from other potentially beneficial studies/treatments. This approach will prove
transformational for clinical trial design by enriching for subjects most likely to benefit from a
therapy, and in the future, after more than one currently investigational drugs are approved, for
precision medicine to identify the most efficacious therapy for high-risk subgroups."

Inflammation plays a critical role in secondary tissue damage after spinal cord injury (SCI), however, there is no
widely accepted therapeutic for mitigating destructive inflammatory events in the injured spinal cord. L-selectin
is an adhesion and signaling receptor on immune cells that has been recently shown to be a critical mediator of
long-term neurological deficits following SCI. Disrupting L-selectin function with diclofenac, an FDA-approved
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that induces L-selectin “shedding”, improves tissue sparing and
long-term recovery when administered by 3 hours post-SCI. L-selectin shedding, therefore, represents a
potential therapeutic strategy to mitigate damage associated with acute inflammation. However, the specific
mechanisms through which L-selectin attenuates secondary tissue damage remain unclear. L-selectin has been
shown to promote destructive effector functions in neutrophils, the most abundant immune cell type in human
blood and first to invade the injured spinal cord in large numbers. The hypothesis of this proposal is that L-
selectin shedding reduces the pathogenic activities of neutrophils and associated secondary tissue
damage after SCI. The objectives of this work are to determine the effect of L-selectin shedding on the activation
of neutrophil effector functions, further elucidate the role of neutrophils in secondary tissue damage after SCI,
and determine if intravenous delivery extends the therapeutic window for diclofenac. Specific Aim 1 will test the
hypothesis that L-selectin shedding reduces the activation of cytotoxic neutrophil effector functions in the
presence of myelin. Myelin can serve as an abundant ligand for L-selectin and may exacerbate cytotoxic effector
functions in neutrophils. Using mice that cannot shed L-selectin (L(E) mice) and WT mice treated with diclofenac,
the effect of L-selectin shedding on neutrophil effector functions will be quantified in vitro in response to myelin
exposure as well as in the acutely injured spinal cord. Specific Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that neutrophils are
the primary immune cell type whose destructive functions are mitigated by L-selectin shedding. Early neutrophil
depletion will be investigated in L(E) mice and in WT mice treated with diclofenac to determine the extent to
which L-selectin shedding reduces secondary damage and neurological deficits by attenuating pathogenic
neutrophil activities. Specific Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that intravenous delivery of diclofenac can induce
rapid shedding of L-selectin on neutrophils in the blood and extend the window of opportunity. Long-term
neurological recovery and tissue sparing will be assessed following delayed intravenous administration of
diclofenac in WT mice. Diclofenac treatment will also be assessed in L(E) mice to confirm that the therapeutic
mechanisms of action is through L-selectin shedding. The collective results will help uncover the roles of L-
selectin shedding and neutrophils in secondary damage after SCI and validate L-selectin shedding as a
therapeutic target to improve long-term neurological recovery. The findings from this proposal will also be
applicable to attenuating damaging inflammation observed in other central nervous system injuries or disorders."

 Transfer RNA (tRNA) is traditionally viewed as an adaptor molecule that helps ribosomes synthesize
proteins by decoding nucleotide triplets linking mRNA sequence to amino acid sequence of protein. Recent
findings demonstrate that tRNAs also serve as a major source of small non-coding RNAs, so called tRNA-derived
fragments (tRFs). The emerging concept in molecular biology is that these tRFs perform regulatory functions,
although relatively little is known about their precise roles in cell physiology.
 Work from our and other laboratories has shown that in response to a variety of abiotic stresses (e.g.
oxidative or nutrient stress), the vertebrate-specific ribonuclease (RNase) angiogenin (ANG) is activated to target
the anticodon loops of tRNAs to produce a specific subclass of tRFs, known as tRNA-derived stress-induced
RNAs (tiRNAs). Since their discovery in 2009, tiRNAs have been found to play roles in stress adaptation, cell
survival and apoptosis. One of the relatively well studied roles of selected subset of tiRNAs (derived from tRNAAla
and tRNACys) is inhibition of translation initiation via interference with functions of the cap-binding complex eIF4F
(Ivanov et al. Mol Cell 2011).
 This proposal will further investigate functions of novel, previously unexplored, tiRNAs in regulation of
translation. Our preliminary data suggest that alternative mechanisms of translation modulation exist that are
different from the mechanisms used by tiRNAAla/Cys. In Aim1, we will dissect the molecular mechanisms of tiRNA-
mediated regulation of translation. Our preliminary data strongly support a model in which multiple non-
overlapping mechanisms are used by specific tiRNAs to mediate both inhibition and stimulation of mRNA
translation. In Aim 2, we will identify and characterize mRNA targets of tiRNAs by employing candidate and
unbiased proteomic and ribosome profiling approaches. Our preliminary data suggest that specific tiRNAs target
specific pool of mRNAs thus reprogramming cellular translation.
 Our proposal is highly innovative and will broadly impact RNA biology. Successful completion of the
proposed studies will result in characterization of novel translational control mechanisms acting during stress.
Our studies are also important from a therapeutic point of view because multiple pathophysiological conditions
are linked to changes in tiRNA production. Mutations affecting the RNase activity of ANG are found in patients
with the neurodegenerative diseases Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease. Also, ANG is over-
expressed in multiple cancers and its expression correlates with misbalanced tiRNA production, indicating a
necessity to understand the function of tiRNAs. Finally, this proposal will generate many resources for the entire
RNA/tRNA community and we will ensure that these resources are available for future use."

Age-related decline in cognitive health is a pressing public health concern. Variation in late-life
adult cognitive health is associated with adverse interpersonal experiences (AIEs, e.g.,
loneliness), although documenting the full extent of this association requires further study of a
greater diversity of AIEs. Social isolation and lower quality relationships, characterized by
greater conflict, tend to disrupt psychosocial and biological functioning, resulting in increased
risk for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which, in turn, increases risk for Alzheimer’s Disease
and Related Dementias (ADRD). Conversely, adults who receive more warmth, support, and
responsiveness in their social experiences typically have better cognitive outcomes. This project
takes advantage of an unparalleled opportunity to further this important line of work on the
significance of relationship experiences in later adulthood for MCI by conducting a follow-up of
the Minnesota-Carolina Twin Study of Aging (MCTSA). MCTSA is a longitudinal study targeting
800 ethnically diverse monozygotic and dizygotic same-sex twin pairs. Most twin participants
have already completed assessments of AIEs in the previous project period. In this proposed
continuation period, we will complete novel assessments of MCI. Further, a daily diary study
aimed at connecting AIEs and fluctuations in cognitive functioning on a day-to-day timescale will
allow us to document processes that presage the development of Alzheimer’s Disease and
Related Dementias (ADRD). Our overarching objectives are to investigate the degree to which
diverse AIEs predict subsequent MCI, to take advantage of the twin aspect of our design to
document the environmental basis for AIE-MCI associations, and to understand how these
connections are manifest in the day-to-day flow of interpersonal experiences and cognitive
functioning. Specific aims of this project include: AIM 1: Document longitudinal associations
between a comprehensive array of earlier, specific adverse interpersonal experiences (AIE) and
subsequent mild cognitive impairment (MCI); AIM 2: Model environmental pathways linking
earlier adverse interpersonal experiences (AIE) and subsequent MCI; AIM 3: Complete a twin
daily diary study of within-person dynamics connecting adverse interpersonal experiences and
daily fluctuations in cognitive functioning."

Lack of insurance coverage and individual income have been associated with considerable disparities in
cancer care for patients with solid organ malignancies, including later stage disease at time of presentation,
decreased probability of undergoing cancer-directed surgery, and decreased survival. However, much less is
understood about upstream geospatial determinants of health that influence access to and receipt of care for
the 20% of Americans that live in rural communities. Furthermore, the degree to which recent health policy
changes have impacted cancer care delivery for patients living in rural and socioeconomically vulnerable
communities remains unclear. To address these gaps, Dr. Loehrer plans to conduct a population-based
observational and quasi-experimental cohort study to evaluate the influence of rural residence, community-
level socioeconomic deprivation, and their interaction with insurance coverage on presentation with and
management of solid organ malignancies. Additionally, we will evaluate the degree to which Affordable Care
Act associated insurance expansion influenced cancer care delivery across rural and socioeconomically
diverse communities. The study capitalizes on the novel use of select state cancer registries with
geographically linked measures of community-level socioeconomic deprivation. Multilevel quantitative
methods, geovisualization, geocomputational approaches, spatiotemporal analyses, and econometric
modelling will all be used to describe and visualize complex relationships between insurance coverage, rural
residence, local community-level socioeconomic factors in addition to determining the influence of state-level
insurance expansion on disparities in cancer care delivery. The study will provide important information on
upstream geospatial drivers of cancer care disparities while also evaluating the heterogeneous influence of
health policy on rural cancer disparities.
Dr. Loehrer is a surgical oncologist and health services researcher at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center and
The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice. His clinical practice includes care for patients
with skin, soft-tissue, and liver malignancies while his academic focus is at the intersection health policy, social
determinants of health, and equity of cancer care delivery. His long-term career goal is to become an
innovative and independently funded health policy researcher with a focus on vulnerable populations. The
research plan presented complements both career development and training plans that are focused on
geospatial methodologies and application. The award will lay the methodological and policy foundation for
follow-up studies on state-specific waivers in Medicaid delivery that are too early to be evaluated at present."
10868589,"Most patients with pancreatic cancer present with advanced incurable disease, but patients
diagnosed with Stage I pancreatic cancer have a much better outcome. The early detection of
pancreatic cancer requires simple and effective pancreatic screening tests that can be applied
to high risk populations. The Cancer of the Pancreas Screening (CAPS) study currently follows
a familial/genetic “high-risk” cohort of ~1000 patients undergo regular pancreatic surveillance.
Recent results from the CAPS program indicate that pancreatic cancers detected during
pancreatic surveillance are down-staged; 40% of those who maintained annual surveillance had
a Stage I pancreatic cancer. These results indicate that early detection can improve overall
outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer. Circulating tumor marker tests are not currently
used for pancreas surveillance. Genetic factors are known to influence tumor marker levels, but
gene tests have not been evaluated to determine if they could improve the accuracy of tumor
markers. Recent studies from the PI's lab indicate that the normal reference ranges of
commonly used tumor markers (CA19-9, CA-125 and CEA) are better defined by an individual's
tumor marker genotype. A tumor marker genotype test can improve the diagnostic sensitivity of
tumor markers at 99% specificity compared to conventional diagnostic cut-offs. We propose to
establish genetically-defined normal reference ranges for tumor marker levels and evaluate their
diagnostic accuracy in a prospective clinical trial of patients undergoing pancreatic imaging
surveillance through our CAPS program. The addition of annual blood tests to pancreatic
surveillance is expected to improve the detection of early-stage pancreatic cancer."

 Glioblastomas are highly malignant and invasive, making these neoplasms extremely difficult to surgically
resect and these properties often result in tumors which are refractory to standard chemotherapeutic therapies.
Unfortunately monotherapies targeting known drivers of glioblastomas such as hyperactive EGFR and c-MET
RTKs have proven to be ineffective suggesting redundant mechanisms of activation. We have identified
circular RNA-derived proteins which are overexpressed in glioblastoma and these novel products are capable
of stimulating receptor tyrosine kinase activity leading to enhanced proliferation, mobility and invasive
characteristics. In this application we propose to 1.) determine the mechanism(s) of circ-HGF mediated
activation of c-MET in glioblastoma, 2.) clarify the role of PKA/PTBP1 signaling in the regulation of circ-HGF
and circ-E-Cad translation initiation and expression in GBM, 3.) evaluate a novel small molecule inhibitor of
circ-HGF and circ-E-Cad IRES-dependent translation in orthotopic GBM PDX models. We also propose to
investigate and chemically modify the inhibitor to build in desired anti-glioblastoma effects."

Neurotransmitter release at synapses critically depends on the precise assembly of the secretory machine.
Within a presynaptic nerve terminal, synaptic vesicles fuse at the active zone, a protein scaffold that forms
release sites apposed to postsynaptic receptors. This protein complex contains RIM, ELKS, Munc13, RIM-BP,
Liprin-α and Bassoon/Piccolo as central components. Recent work provides ground for new models of
how these proteins assemble into functional release sites. First, the active zone is remarkably resilient and
ablation of individual genes has at most modest effects on its assembly. Instead, combined deletions of RIM,
ELKS, or RIM-BP strongly disrupt active zone assembly, establishing scaffolding redundancy. Second, current
studies have led to a working model of assembly through liquid-liquid phase separation, with robust contributions
of multivalent low-affinity interactions to assembly. Regardless of exact mechanisms, an overarching model
that arises from these and other studies is that the active zone is a dynamic protein network that is held together
by redundant, low-affinity protein binding. This is different from conventional models in which master organizers
mediate assembly through rigid complexes with well-defined stoichiometries.
Here, we build on our and other’s recent progress with the goal to identify what mechanisms mediate assembly
of the initial active zone scaffold, and how opposing surfaces of these active zone protein networks interact with
the target plasma membrane and with the synaptic vesicle cluster, respectively. We will use a three-pronged
approach to answer these questions. Aim 1 defines roles and mechanisms of RIM in active zone assembly.
We build on our finding that RIM drives recruitment of interacting proteins after removing scaffolding redundancy
through RIM+ELKS knockout. We test the model that RIM organizes active zones through a two-step process
that mechanistically separates RIM-targeting to active zones from RIM’s activity in recruiting other active zone
proteins. Aim 2 dissects how synaptic vesicle clusters and active zones, two presynaptic sub-
compartments, interact with one another. We rely on a new, “in-synapse” reconstitution approach and test
parallel models to define which binding activities are sufficient to mediate vesicle docking. Aim 3 determines
active zone anchoring mechanisms at the target plasma membrane. This aim makes use of our unique
collection of conditional and compound mutants to solve the long-standing question of how the active zone
scaffolds are physically attached to the right place at the target membrane. We use state-of-the-art methodology
including conditional gene knockout, stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, fluorescence recovery
after photobleaching (FRAP), high pressure freezing- and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM), and
electrophysiology to answer these questions.
Our work will establish mechanistic models on how the target membrane, the active zone, and the vesicle
cluster interact with one another to support both stability and dynamics in the synaptic vesicle cycle."

While much research has been devoted to exploring the impact of environmental chemical exposures during
pregnancy on infant and child health, relatively little attention has focused on the potential influence of these
exposures on maternal health. Recent evidence suggests that pregnancy may be a sensitive period in the life
course, during which chemical exposures may have long-lasting effects on cardio-metabolic disease risk
among women. Using a well-characterized existing cohort study that enrolled 1,410 pregnant women in 2009-
2014, we propose the following aims: (1) quantify the relationship between environmental exposures during
pregnancy and short-term maternal health outcomes including: postpartum weight retention, reduced
breastfeeding initiation and duration, and incident diabetes; (2) quantify the relationship between environmental
exposures during pregnancy and long-term maternal health outcomes: body composition, weight trajectories
from pregnancy through ~10 years after parturition, hepatic fat, dysglycemia and incident diabetes, and
cardiovascular disease; and (3) evaluate the potential role of maternal characteristics and behaviors during
pregnancy, specifically obesity and diet quality, in modifying associations between environmental chemical
exposures and outcomes. Exposures during pregnancy will include serum per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
(PFAS), urinary phthalate metabolites, phenols and parabens, metals, organophosphate flame retardants, and
modeled air pollutants at the maternal residential address during pregnancy. We propose to recruit 700 of the
original study participants to return for a follow-up visit at ~10 years postpartum. At this visit, participants will
undergo a comprehensive metabolic health evaluation including body composition via air displacement
plethysmography (BOD POD), dysglycemia via oral glucose tolerance test, and hepatic fat fraction via MRI.
Medical records will be abstracted to document incident diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and to
reconstruct body weight trajectories. We will estimate associations between exposures during pregnancy and
maternal outcomes using covariate-adjusted multivariable regression models for continuous, binary, or time-to-
event data, as appropriate. Exposures will be evaluated as single pollutants and as mixtures using advanced
statistical methods including Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression and Bayesian hierarchical Cox survival
models. We hypothesize that maternal body mass index prior to pregnancy and diet quality during pregnancy
will modify the effects of environmental chemical exposures on cardio-metabolic outcomes, such that
associations will be stronger among women with obesity entering pregnancy or with poor diet quality during
pregnancy. The results of this study will inform public health interventions to identify women who may be
especially susceptible to the effects of environmental chemical exposures during pregnancy, and to improve
the environment of pregnancy to promote the long-term health of both the offspring and the mother."
10867749,"Project summary: The purpose of our study is to determine the role of synaptosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression and pathogenesis. Synapses are the most important compartments of
neuron that deliver signals to adjacent neuron and maintain healthy synaptic functions of the brain. Recently,
several studies identified the miRNAs enrichments at synapse, synaptic vesicles and synaptosomes. However,
the role of synapse-associated miRNAs in AD progression is completely unexplored. In the first part of our
study, we identified synaptosome-specific miRNAs those were deregulated in AD and involved in nervous
system development, cell junction organization, synapse assembly formation, and function of GABAergic
synapse. The high expression of synaptosomal miRNAs were significantly correlated with Braak stage-based
disease progression. Currently we are studying the protective and/or deleterious properties of synaptosomal
miRNAs against Aβ and p-tau toxicities. The effects of synaptosomal miRNAs will be determined on overall
synapse functions and synaptic activity. In second part we will determine the role of synaptosomal miRNAs in
Aβ induced synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD. The impact of synaptosomal miRNAs will be studied on
healthy neurons and AD neurons with Aβ induced toxicities. We will focus on neuronal processing, neuronal
growth and network development and synaptic plasticity using APP primary neuronal cultures. Alteration of
synaptosomal miRNAs expression and synaptic proteins will be studied with disease progression in APP
transgenic (TG) and APP knockout (KO) mice. We will execute the synaptosome-specific miRNAs expression
with various cognitive behavioral and biochemical tests in 2-, 6-, 12- and 18-month-old APP TG and APP KO
mice lines relative to age-matched TG negative wild-type (WT) mice. Lastly, we will study the role of
synaptosomal miRNAs in phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) induced synaptic and cognitive dysfunction in AD. The
impact of synaptosomal miRNAs will be studied on p-tau induced toxicity in neurons, healthy neurons
processing, neuronal growth and network development and synaptic plasticity using tau primary neuronal
culture. Alteration of synaptosomal miRNAs and synaptic proteins will be studied with disease progression in
Tau TG and Tau KO mice. We will execute the synaptosome-specific miRNAs expression with various
cognitive behavioral and biochemical tests in 2-, 6-, 12- and 18-month-old tau TG and KO mice relative to WT
mice. Our study outcome will provide the answers for - 1) deregulation of synaptosomal miRNAs at AD
synapse, 2) synaptosome-associated miRNAs linked with Aβ and p-tau pathologies in AD, 3) Overall synapse
function, synaptic activity, assessment of therapeutic value of synaptosome-associated miRNAs in AD."
10864074,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a complex public health crisis with far-reaching consequences for Veterans
and their families. The healthcare system plays an integral role in the detection and treatment of IPV through
implementation of IPV screening and provision of resources in response to IPV disclosures. The National IPV
Assistance Program (IPVAP) is in the process of expanding the screening directive from women and at-risk
Veterans to a national rollout and updated directive indicating that Veterans of all genders are to be screened
annually for IPV using the Relationship Health and Safety (RHS 3.0) screener. Evaluating the implementation
and impact of this updated national screening rollout is a critical priority for IPVAP. Prior HSR&D funded
research has focused on identifying barriers and facilitators of implementing IPV screening among women of
reproductive age in primary care settings. However, little is known about the implementation or clinical impact
of screening patients of all genders and ages for IPV. The proposed study builds on past findings by evaluating
the national rollout expanding IPV screening to all Veterans. IPVAP’s updated directive requires foundational
screening implementation and outcome data among non-women Veterans and the development of data
tracking and systems. Additionally, a critical missing piece needed to inform scale-up of IPV screening to all
Veterans is data on the impact of IPV screening through identification of patient outcomes following IPV
disclosures. A robust partnered evaluation of the expanded IPV screening national rollout will extend prior work
and assist IPVAP in determining implementation and clinical impact outcomes. We plan to simultaneously
evaluate the rollout of IPVAP’s expanded national IPV screening directive now targeting all patients while also
examining the impact of this new initiative to provide innovative and critically needed data on the impact of
screening non-women patients to the Program Office. As a result, we will develop the tools and systems
essential for IPVAP to monitor screening implementation across clinical settings and identify Veteran-focused
outcomes related to IPV screening and positive disclosures, and best practices for scale-up and maintenance
of IPV screening among all Veterans. The specific aims of this PEI are to (1) Evaluate implementation of the
expanded RHS 3.0 screening and response national by (a) assessing IPV screening implementation outcomes
across RE-AIM domains (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance); (b) examining
potential differences in outcomes by patient characteristics (e.g., gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual
orientation, marital status); and (c) identifying clinical settings and provider types most and least likely to
screen for IPV and yield positive IPV disclosures during screening. (2) Identify impact of IPV screening on
patients as well as potential gender differences in impact by (a) examining service utilization and clinical
outcomes following positive IPV disclosures during screening; and (b) understanding experiences of screening
among patients who disclosed IPV during screening encounters. We will use implementation science
frameworks and mixed quantitative and qualitative data to simultaneously evaluate implementation and impact
of IPV screening. The RE-AIM domains and clinical outcomes data following IPV disclosures will be assessed
using data extracted from the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) and clinical impact of IPV screening will be
examined through qualitative interviews with Veterans who disclosed IPV experiences during routine
screening. This robust and highly-partnered evaluation will (1) extend prior research conducted primarily with
women Veterans; (2) provide critically needed clinical data to enhance and inform national programming; (3)
result in the development of data systems essential for monitoring screening; and (4) lead to optimization of
future IPV screening implementation strategies."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent malignancy and a leading cause of cancer death in men in the United
States. Once PCa progresses to an advanced metastatic therapy-resistant stage, it becomes a lethal disease.
To date, the understanding of mechanisms involved in the pathobiology of lethal PCa remain limited.
Transcriptional rewiring of the cancer cell plays a fundamental role in enabling disease progression. GATA2 is a
master regulator transcription factor that participates in prostate development and PCa pathogenesis. In PCa,
GATA2 levels increase during disease progression and are elevated in almost all (~100%) of metastatic therapy-
resistant tumors. We and others have shown that GATA2 is essential to enable androgen receptor (AR)
transcriptional activity, as well as control the transcription of other genes independently of AR that participate
through distinct mechanisms in the pathogenesis of lethal PCa. Most relevant to this proposal, our preliminary
studies point to a key role of GATA2 in disease progression and in conferring plasticity to PCa cells. Indeed, our
computational and functional studies suggest that elevated GATA2 levels increase the metastatic potential of
PCa cells by transcriptionally regulating a subset of genes regulating the motility and invasiveness of PCa cells.
Moreover, our transcriptomic single-cell analysis and functional studies indicate that PCa cells expressing high
levels of GATA2 develop an undifferentiated stem cell-like phenotype. In addition, we have identified a novel
therapeutic that significantly disrupts GATA2 transcriptional activity and demonstrates in vivo anti-cancer
efficacy. Based upon these novel preliminary data, we hypothesize that transcriptional rewiring caused by
elevated GATA2 expression contributes to PCa progression to lethal disease stages and that this mechanism
can be targeted. We will investigate this hypothesis as follows: In Aim 1, we will define the extent and
mechanisms by which GATA2 elevation enhances PCa metastasis, focusing on defining a GATA2 motility
regulated molecules, as well as determine the role of GATA2 in disease progression using a transgenic
conditional knock-in mouse model. In Aim 2, we will determine the impact of GATA2 in PCa cell plasticity and
disease progression at the single-cell level, focusing on functionally validating the cistrome changes induced by
increased GATA2 levels. We will also assess in human samples the clinical relevance of the GATA2-induced
stem-like phenotype during disease progression in circulating tumor cells. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate
the efficacy of targeting GATA2 in combination with standard therapy in pre-clinical PCa models. At its
completion, results from this innovative proposal will not only enhance our understanding of how elevated GATA2
expression transcriptionally rewires the cancer cell and contributes to the pathobiology of lethal PCa, but will
also have significant impact by identifying new therapeutic strategies to treat this lethal disease."

The Yale Superfund Research and Training Program (YSRTP) will foster problem-based, solution-oriented
research related to the theme of water contaminant fate, exposure, remediation, and adverse health effects. To
be most effective, this endeavor requires cross-trained scientists, engineers, and biomedical researchers with
wide-ranging communication skills to successfully address emerging research and health questions. The
proposed YSRTP unites the fields of public health, medicine, genetics, environmental chemistry, environmental
engineering, and chemical fate and transport. We will leverage this disciplinary diversity, departmental and
University resources, and YSRTP’s diverse research areas and cores to produce trainees with depth in their
specialized field, and a breadth of knowledge and professional experiences in environmental health, chemistry,
and engineering; disciplines that are important for controlling exposure to hazardous environmental chemicals.
The goal of the YSRTP Research Experience Training Coordination Core (RETCC) is to expand the breadth of
educational, research, and professional development opportunities to pre- and post-doctoral trainees. Four
specific aims are proposed. 1. Recruit a cadre of diverse, academically prepared doctoral students and post-
doctoral researchers; 2. Provide interdisciplinary training through a requirement of cross-disciplinary
coursework and focused training in community outreach, results dissemination, risk communication, and
research translation; 3. Design and implement a program for interdisciplinary research exchanges within and
external to Yale; and 4. Encourage trainee professional development through planned interactions with
community partners, government agencies, and private industry. RETCC central activities will include specific
symposia and workshops to broaden trainee education and research skillsets, mentorship programs to prepare
students for candidacy exams and monitor dissertation progress; a graduate research seminar and other
ancillary activities to encourage interaction among trainees and build a scholastic community, and an
evaluation process to continually update and improve the RETCC. Training will leverage the broader Yale
University teaching, research, and mentoring infrastructure and build synergies with the YSRTP cores in
administration (research translation), community engagement and data management and analytics.
This training core will focus on pre- and post-doctoral trainees working in the fields of chemistry, environmental
engineering, public health, and biomedical research within the YSRTP and includes an interdisciplinary
(environmental engineering and biomedical research) directorship. Specific research areas include: the effects
of water contaminants on reproductive toxicology, evaluation of 1,4-Dioxane (1.4-DX) exposure and early
biological effects in drinking water, identification of early vs. late 1,4-DX-induced liver damage and

10866332,"Approximately 1 out of every 70 people (~5,000,000 patients) are transfused each year in the USA alone. Over
340 red blood cell (RBC) alloantigens have been identified in addition to the well-known ABO and RhD antigens.
Over time, some patients generate antibody responses against so many RBC alloantigens that compatible RBC
units become increasingly difficult to identify, and in some cases are unavailable. This leads to considerable
morbidity and in extreme cases mortality. Despite the large number of alloantigens, only a minority of patients
ever become alloimmunized (~2-5%). This remains very significant given the number of people transfused each
year and leads to the question of why certain people become alloimmunized and others do not. Moreover,
patients tend to be either “responders” with a relatively high frequency of alloimmunization or
“nonresponders” with no detectable alloantibodies even after chronic transfusion. Responder vs.
nonresponder status has been shown to have both environmental and genetic components. Viral infection with
RNA viruses at the time of transfusion is associated with RBC alloimmunization in both mice and humans and
has been shown to cause alloimmunization in mice by inducing interferon-alpha and signaling through the
interferon-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR). Preliminary data presented in this grant demonstrate that murine
cytomegalovirus (mCMV) infection induces RBC alloimmunization through IFNAR independent pathways. Less
progress has been made in defining genetic factors that regulate responder vs. nonresponder status. A number
of genome wide association studies in humans have identified potential candidates, but running trials with
sufficient statistical power is challenging. In such cases, the use of animal models is a reasonable alternative.
We have reported that, much like in humans, there is substantial variability in genetics of responder vs
nonresponder biology across different strains of inbred mice. Using RBC alloimmunization as a trait, we
performed a GWAS study on 584 mice from a diversity outbred population and identified a region of chromosome
19 associated with alloimmunization (LOD score of 8.2, genome-wide p-value (0.036)). This region contains a
cluster of IFIT (IFIT1-IFIT3) genes (interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats) that are interferon-
alpha response genes downstream of IFNAR signaling. Moreover, IFIT induction also occurs downstream of
mCMV infection. Thus, the two known pathways of RBC alloimmunization have IFIT induction as a common
distal event. Although best known for antiviral function, IFIT genes are increasingly being appreciated as being
immunoregulatory. Thus, multiple lines of evidence support the Central Hypothesis of this application: IFIT1
and IFIT2 suppress while IFIT3 enhances RBC alloimmunization. The current application proposes to use mice
with deletions of IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 or the whole IFIT locus to test their causal roles in RBC alloimmunization.
The proposal is structured as a single Specific Aim, testing the role of each IFIT gene member individually, or
as a group, in RBC alloimmunization."

Alcohol abuse damages liver, pancreas, heart, brain, and muscle. One severe outcome of alcohol abuse is
cognitive impairment and dementia. Although a role for alcohol in promoting Alzheimer's disease (AD) is
suspected, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. One proposed underlying mechanism in AD is
impaired or insufficient autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved lysosomal degradation pathway that regulates
organelle and protein homeostasis. Autophagy generally declines with age, resulting in an accumulation of
misfolded proteins including tau and β amyloid, as well as damaged mitochondria. Our recent work has
demonstrated that alcohol induces dysfunction of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of
lysosomal biogenesis. Impaired TFEB leads to decreased lysosomal biogenesis and mitophagy resulting in
alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis. In addition to regulating autophagy, we also demonstrated that TFEB
increased mitochondrial biogenesis by up-regulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma
coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1-α). More importantly, decreased nuclear TFEB levels is associated with human
alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis but its role in alcohol-associated AD has not been investigated. Our
preliminary results showed that alcohol decreased total and nuclear TFEB but increased ubiquitinated proteins
in mouse hippocampi. In addition, aged mice (22-months old) also have decreased nuclear TFEB staining but
increased p62 and phosphorylated Tau in the hippocampi compared with young mice (3-months old). These
collective observations suggest that alcohol consumption and aging may synergistically interact to perturb the
TFEB-lysosome biogenesis axis, thereby leading to impaired brain autophagy. Here, we hypothesize chronic
alcohol consumption compounds age-related decrease of TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis in the brain,
which in turn leads to an accumulation of damaged mitochondria and protein aggregates. These phenomena
occur in AD, and our proposed experiments promise to establish links between brain aging, alcohol
consumption, and AD pathology. We further predict overexpression of TFEB and TFEB knockin transgenic
mice will protect against these brain aging and alcohol-induced pathologies. We also propose to assess
potential neuroprotective effects of novel TFEB agonists identified from a high-throughput screening that were
recently completed. The successful completion of the proposed work will provide a new paradigm of
uncovering the role of TFEB in autophagy and lysosome biology in alcohol-associated AD and brain aging."

Chemotherapy-related cognitive decline (CRCD) is common and consequential to quality of life and function, but
there is no standard of care to prevent or treat CRCD. Three major barriers to developing effective interventions
include: 1) interindividual variability in pre-systemic risk factors; 2) multiple mechanisms of CRCD; and 3) a lack
of investigators capable of developing mechanism-driven interventions and deploying them in complex medical
settings (e.g., concurrent with chemotherapy). Memantine is a promising medication for CRCD, as it modulates
pathways involving brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammation, two interrelated mechanisms of
CRCD and of cognitive aging broadly. Exercise is an optimal behavioral augmentation strategy, as it also targets
BDNF and inflammation, improves frailty, and is recommended for mood, fatigue, and physical function in cancer
patients undergoing treatment. In the proposed K23 study, we will conduct a three-arm randomized controlled
trial (RCT) of MEM+EX (combined memantine and an established cancer exercise program [Get Real & Heel]),
memantine, or placebo to mitigate CRCD in 90 patients with breast cancer. Specific research aims are to:
determine the feasibility and acceptability of MEM+EX during breast cancer chemotherapy (Aim 1); evaluate the
preliminary efficacy of MEM+EX and memantine to mitigate cognitive decline (Aim 2) and changes in CRCD
biomarkers (Aim 3); and explore the impact of frailty on changes in cognitive function and CRCD biomarkers
(Exploratory Aim 4). We hypothesize that 1) our RCT will be a) feasible (≥ 40% recruitment rate; ≥85% retention
rate; ≥75% adherence to ≥90% medication doses and ≥75% exercise sessions) and b) acceptable; MEM+EX
and memantine will 2) exhibit lesser decline in objective and patient-reported cognition; and 3) mitigate BDNF
decline and inflammation; and 4) treatment changes in cognition and CRCD biomarkers will be moderated by
baseline frailty levels. The primary outcomes are feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes are a
composite of objective measures of attention and executive function, patient-reported cognition, BDNF, and an
inflammatory composite measure. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, post-intervention (primary
endpoint), and 6 month follow-up. Dr. Nakamura’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator who
develops and tests effective, mechanistically-based cognitive interventions for patients with cancer. His short-
term goals for this award are to obtain training in: 1) design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials; 2) cognitive
measurement; and 3) mechanisms of CRCD. The mentorship and resources at the University of North Carolina
at Chapel Hill create an ideal environment for this K23 award. The proposed research and training aims are
consistent with the NIA’s goal to develop effective interventions to maintain well-being and function and reduce
the burden of age-related diseases. This award provides Dr. Nakamura with the necessary education, training,
and pilot data to prepare him to conduct a future definitive trial of MEM+EX and lead other large-scale RCTs of
interventions targeting the pathophysiology of cognitive decline induced by cancer and its treatments."
10865571,"PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT
 Coronary artery disease, aggravated by arterial calcification, poses a significant challenge to successful
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Coronary artery calcification (CAC) reduces vessel compliance and
increases the complexities of stent deployment, stent expansion, balloon expansion, and results in uneven drug
distribution. Specifically, reduced vessel compliance prohibits stent delivery and reduces the ability of deployed
stents to expand, or causing “stent regret”, resulting in stent failure through either restenosis or stent thrombosis.
Importantly, these complications are exasperated in highly stenotic CAC lesions – hence, endovascular devices
and therapeutic techniques are needed with improved safety and efficacy to advance the clinical management
of CAC.
 The objective of this proposal is to develop novel metasurface optical guidewires for therapeutic applications
to treat previously untreatable highly stenotic CAC lesions. Our project addresses these challenges by
hypothesizing that: 1) metasurfaces are specialized planar lens elements that can provide optimal energy
delivery over a sub-millimeter profile; 2) with advances in fiber-coupled diode laser technologies, fiber-optic
metasurfaces are an attractive platform for endovascular devices; 2) a flexible, small-diameter fiber-optic
embedded guidewire with metasurfaces – termed 'metasurface optical guidewires' – can offer dual benefits of a
rapid exchange monorail for PCI devices and provide light-based endovascular therapeutic capabilities including
laser intravascular lithotripsy (L-IVL). The metasurface optical guidewires and associated innovative light-based
endovascular therapies will be successfully developed and demonstrated by completing the following specific
aims: Aim 1: Design, develop and manufacture metasurface optical guidewires for precise control of
intravascular laser dosimetry; Aim 2: Develop a PCI workflow for use of an metasurface optical guidewire for
laser intravascular lithotripsy (L-IVL); Aim 3: Develop a PCI workflow and study L-IVL’s efficacy in a preclinical
model; Aim 4: Evaluate L-IVL treatment efficacy in a pre-clinical CAC animal model.
 Successful completion of these aims will lead to the development of the metasurface optical guidewire and
other innovative devices and procedures that can significantly improve PCI outcomes in patients with calcified
coronary arteries, reducing complications and enhancing patient care."

 This NIH K08 proposal describes a four-year career development training program in autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) genomics research. With this research program, Dr. Mo will develop expertise in human
genetics, analysis of next-generation sequencing data, and interpretation of somatic variants in non-neoplastic
tissue. These skills complement Dr. Mo’s prior research and clinical training and ideally position her to
transition to an independent investigator position studying somatic mutations in ASD.
 Dr. Mo’s mentor for this proposal is Dr. Christopher A. Walsh, a Professor of Neurology at Harvard
Medical School, an HHMI Investigator at Boston Children’s Hospital, and a leader in the genetics of human
neurological diseases. With over 25 years of mentorship experience, Dr. Walsh has an established track record
of mentoring trainees to successful academic careers in biomedical research. Dr. Mo will be supported by a
scientific advisory team and collaborators with complementary expertise in autism genetics, computational
genomics, genotype-phenotype correlations of somatic mutations, and career mentorship. The institutional
resources available at Boston Children’s Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School, are world-
class and provide an ideal environment to foster the development of a physician-scientist career.
 The primary scientific objective of the proposed research plan is to study the role of somatic (post-
zygotic) variants in ASD. Dr. Mo’s central hypothesis is that somatic variants contribute to ASD risk. Dr. Mo
provides pilot data indicating that somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) are increased in gene exons in
ASD probands compared to controls, particularly in highly constrained genes with loss-of-function intolerance.
Furthermore, Dr. Mo shows that sSNVs in non-coding gene regulatory regions can be efficiently detected using
ATAC-seq, which allows the detection of non-coding sSNVs in larger sample sizes than previously possible
using whole genome sequencing.
 To achieve the research objective, a combination of whole exome sequencing, ATAC-seq, whole
genome sequencing, amplicon sequencing, and computational analysis will be used. These strategies will
systemically examine two independent, but related, aims: (1) the burden of sSNVs in functionally-relevant
genes in ASD compared to neurotypical individuals; and (2) the distribution of sSNVs in non-coding gene
regulatory regions in postmortem human brain neurons from ASD and neurotypical individuals. Findings from
this study may improve our understanding of the genetic architecture and mechanisms of ASD as well as the
genetic diagnosis of ASD in clinical practice."
10870207,"Alzheimer’s disease is a cognitive and neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive cognitive decline and neuronal dysfunction. Defects in synaptic transmission are the earliest events leading to the disease, and downregulation in both inhibitory and excitatory transmission has been observed in Alzheimer’s disease patients as well as mouse models of the disease. It remains unclear whether this downregulation is the result of two independent mechanisms acting on each type of synapse or of a single mechanism acting on both. In this project, I aim to identify an initial defect leading to the disease by systematically measuring synaptic transmission, plasticity, network excitability and cognitive behaviors of Alzheimer’s disease model mice. Successful completion of this project will lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for restoring synaptic dysfunction at the early stages of the disease. This project will serve as the basis of an independent career that will combine novel translational neuroscience research with entrepreneurial activities aiming to translate discoveries on disease mechanisms for Alzheimer’s disease into drug treatments. To achieve this, the research activities of this project will be complemented by hands on and course-based training on biomedical entrepreneurship that will generate a strategic business plan for the development of therapeutics with a successful path for commercialization in the neuroscience space. The broad range of intellectual expertise that can be found at Yale, the technical support of advisors and mentors, as well as the invaluable support by the Yale Office of Cooperative Research on strategic business development makes this a unique institution to achieve this career goals."

The integral roles of histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), including lysine
methylation and acylation, in chromatin remodeling is well established, but new roles of histone
PTMs in disease are continually discovered. This rapidly evolving field necessitates the
development of new molecular approaches to probe the biological impacts of these PTMs.
Herein we focus on the reader proteins for lysine methylation and acylation as reader proteins
are responsible for sensing the PTM and triggering the biological outcome, and both r have
biomedical relevance. Our research will encompass development of new chemical biology tools
to investigate binding mechanisms, improve detection of PTMs, and to generate designer
nucleosomes to study the role of dual PTMs in biological pathways. This research is expected to
advance the ability to develop selective inhibitors and molecular probes for these two classes of
proteins. To develop new methods for creating new sensing methods and designer
nucleosomes, we will exploit the inherent selectivity of reader proteins to develop engineered
reader proteins (eReaders and eWriters) for sensing, labeling, and introduction of dual PTMs in
a site selective manner. This combined effort will advance the field by providing new insight and
new tools to study the biological pathways that depend on these PTMs and their role in disease."

Growing evidence suggests an etiological link between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) wherein mild-to-moderate persistent asthmatics are susceptible to persistent airflow obstruction, putting
them at a higher risk for developing COPD. Furthermore, epigenetic modulation due to in utero smoke (IUS)
exposure during fetal lung development may play a role in asthma and COPD. These and other data suggest a
lifelong trajectory of lung impairment from prenatal lung development to childhood asthma to COPD in adulthood.
Longitudinal and carefully phenotyped multi-omic data offer the opportunity to understand the molecular
determinants of this disease trajectory. Systems and network biology methods hold the potential to effectively
integrate, analyze and interpret multi-omics data. Multilayer networks, in particular, offer a feasible first step to
model disease perturbations jointly across multiple molecular levels, from the genome to the proteome. In this
application, we will simultaneously analyze the rich multi-omics data (SNP genotyping, DNA methylation, mRNA
and miRNA expression) collected as part of long-standing asthma and COPD cohorts using multilayer network
methods. We will first integrate IUS exposure, asthma and COPD multi-omics data into networks and develop
their statistical framework to facilitate subsequent bioinformatics analyses. We will then track the developmental
origins of asthma by the integrated temporal analysis of fetal lung and childhood asthma multi-omics data. Finally,
we will identify key molecules and pathways of the phenotypic transition from asthma in early life to COPD in
adulthood using multilayer networks. Dr. Halu’s training in statistical physics and complex networks has prepared
him well for his proposed research. However, understanding the molecular basis connecting complex lung
diseases such as asthma and COPD through the analysis of multi-omics data is a formidable task that will require
further training in specific areas. Dr. Halu will leverage the excellent intellectual environment of Harvard Medical
School (HMS) and its teaching hospitals, and will have access to extensive computational resources through the
Channing Division of Network Medicine and HMS. Through formal coursework and workshops, and with the help
of a mentoring and advisory team with complementary expertise, Dr. Halu will immerse himself in a training
program focusing on statistical genetics, epigenetics, and omics integration, big data in medical informatics, and
the biology of pulmonary diseases and clinical translation. Dr. Halu will also participate in regular meetings with
his mentors and advisory board members, which will allow him to share his progress. Altogether, Dr. Halu’s
training and research plan will enable him to expand his current skill set to include the ability to address the
challenges of analyzing the complex genomic and epigenomic data of large epidemiological cohorts, identify
open questions in the systems biology of asthma and COPD, and ultimately contribute to the precision medicine
of lung disease."

This renewal application requests support for pre- and post-doctoral trainees in an Integrated
Cardiovascular Pathophysiology (ICVP) training program. Faculty mentors in the ICVP training
program primarily have their appointments within the Cardiovascular Research Center (Directed
by Dr. Steven Houser, ICVP program director) or the Center for Translational Medicine (directed
by Dr. Walter Koch, Co-Director of the ICVP program) at Temple University School of Medicine.
The purpose of our program is to provide a broad based multidisciplinary training experience for
pre-doctoral fellows, post-doctoral fellows and summer medical students in the area of
integrative cardiovascular pathophysiology (ICVP). ICVP faculty members reside with many
different basic science and clinical Departments, but their research laboratories are largely
within the CVRC and CTM which are housed on two adjacent floors of a new medical research
building. ICVP investigators/mentors have related interests in fundamental properties of the
cardiovascular system and the aberrant changes in these properties that cause cardiovascular
dysfunction in diseases including ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease,
atherosclerosis, ischemic vascular disease, metabolic syndrome and diabetic cardiovascular
diseases. Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will receive didactic training in human
physiology and pathophysiology, complemented by advanced training in cellular and molecular
biology and the appropriate use of animal models of human cardiovascular disease. Graduate
student and fellow research projects will have basic and translational components. The students
and fellows will be expected to investigate problems that go beyond a single molecule and
address questions within the context of cardiovascular disease models. Portions of these
projects will be performed in the laboratories of different investigators, ensuring that students
and fellows are exposed to varied scientific approaches. All trainees will be involved in activities
to enhance their grant and manuscript writing and oral communication skills. Group mentoring
by junior and senior faculty will ensure trainees are well qualified to assume positions as leading
investigators able to rapidly translate new knowledge into new therapies or targets for therapies.
A variety of recruiting strategies will be used to attract a diverse group of trainees that reflect the
diversity of our country. The goal is to train a diverse group of new Ph.Ds. and post-doctoral
fellows that are able to fill a national need for the next generation of biomedical scientists who
can develop therapies for cardiovascular diseases.."

A growing consensus gives researchers the responsibility to report results back to individual participants
in most studies, based on the ethical principles of autonomy, respect, equity, beneficence, and
trustworthiness. Yet, ethical report-back of research results (RBRR) is context-specific, requiring
consideration of the people and data in a particular study. New adaptations are needed, for example, to
align report-back ethics with the emerging science of the exposome, defined as the totality of social and
environmental factors across the life cycle. Exposome studies generate hundreds of measurements from
many techniques, including geospatial assessments of neighborhood stressors, biomonitoring for multiple
classes of chemicals, and indicators of health-related effects at the cellular level. Importantly, because
exposome studies evaluate the joint effects of chemical mixtures and social stressors, they are well-
positioned to support participants who are grappling with exposures in a context of environmental and
social injustice, underlining the value of RBRR to promote equity. To support ethical practices in
exposome-focused studies, this project will address a key challenge – report-back methods have yet to be
tested for large numbers of measures across multiple domains. This project will develop innovative
participant-centered methods for personalized RBRR for multi-level data in large studies and evaluate
these methods in two diverse cohorts recruited during pregnancy: Chemicals in Our Bodies (CIOB, at the
University of California, San Francisco and Berkeley) and Illinois Kids Development Study (IKIDS, at the
University of Illinois). It will build on the well-tested capabilities of the Digital Exposure Report-Back
Interface (DERBI) to generate high-quality personalized reports for smartphone, computer, and print in
studies of any size. Aim 1. Use participatory methods to develop ethical guidance for personalized RBRR
for multi-level data, including large chemical biomonitoring panels, geospatial socio-environmental
indicators, and early effect biomarkers. This aim will bring together input from participants, researchers,
and bioethicists, first to focus on CIOB/IKIDS and then to broaden input and discussion to other studies.
Aim 2. Enhance the value of RBRR for participants by developing digital tools that support participants’
ability to take action and offer them scalable social support. Drawing on theories of health behavior, a new
DERBI feature will offer opportunities for participants to identify sources of harmful chemicals that are
relevant for them and commit to individual and social actions to reduce exposures. Participants will be
invited to a social media group. Aim 3. Develop, deploy, and assess personalized RBRR for diverse types
of data in CIOB/IKIDS. New contextual information will be developed for DERBI to help participants
interpret new data types, and updated design will distill results across multiple domains. We will
randomize half of participants to test the new DERBI take-action feature. Outcome assessments include
follow-up surveys and in-depth interviews about experiences and environmental health literacy as well as
digital analytics to assess participants’ engagement with their reports."
10869936,"An exciting new area in neurodegenerative disease research is the emerging phenomenon of prion-like spreading of neurodegenerative disease proteins. Prions are well established as the protein-based infectious agent underlying the spongioform encephalopathies. In these rare, albeit devastating, diseases the prion protein converts from the normal soluble form to the aggregated self-templating infectious form. This process initiates an inexorable spread of pathology and contingent neurodegeneration throughout the brain. But could this disease mechanism extend to the more
common neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia? If so, it represents a game changer in terms of understanding disease mechanisms and opens many new avenues for therapeutic development. However, any therapeutic or mechanistic investigation into prion-like spreading will require the development of powerful new imaging approaches to track the path of prion-like spread and understand how these protein aggregates alter brain function as they spread. We will need to understand why they take some routes but not others and how this impacts brain function. To address this challenge, we have formed an interdisciplinary team, consisting of an engineer and a geneticist. First, we will use state of the art brain clearing technology to obtain
high-resolution images of prion-like protein propagation of the Parkinson’s disease protein α-synuclein. We will monitor these aggregates as they spread from one neuron to the next, tracking their paths. These high-resolution brain wide 3D maps of alpha-synuclein spreading will empower us to identify gene expression patterns associated with spreading paths and to nominate genes for functional studies. Then, we will utilize advanced high-resolution optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging (ofMRI) to reveal the longitudinal effects of prion-like spreading on brain network activity and
likewise the impact of neural activity on prion-like spreading. Our experiments will provide fundamental mechanistic insight into prion-like spread of neurodegenerative disease. The tools we apply and the lessons we learn will likely be broadly applicable to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias."

Regulated necrotic death of cardiomyocytes is the direct cause of mortality during a myocardial
infarction. One crucial step that is required for regulated necrosis to occur is the opening of the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). Opening of the MPTP, leads to loss of ATP
production, mitochondrial dysfunction, and eventual necrotic cell death. Identification of the
components of the MPTP has plagued the scientific community for over 30 years. The
identification of the inner mitochondrial membrane pore-forming components and regulators of
the MPTP is vital for the mechanistic understanding of regulated necrosis. The adenine nucleotide
translocator (ANT) family was previously thought to be the pore-forming component of the MPTP
within the inner mitochondrial membrane, but this was genetically disproven when mitochondria
lacking ANT1 and ANT2 still underwent mitochondrial permeability transition. However, these
mitochondria are significantly desensitized to MPTP opening. Recently, we generated mice
lacking all three isoforms of the ANT family in liver and showed that the MPTP in mitochondria
isolated from ANT null livers are even more desensitized, but the pore eventually opens in the
presence of very high Ca2+. Surprisingly, when we treated the ANT null mitochondria with
cyclosporine A (CsA), a cyclophilin D (CypD) inhibitor, the MPTP was inhibited. Treatment of CsA
normally desensitizes the MPTP, but with enough Ca2+ CsA can be overcome and the MPTP still
engages. We now have the ability to definitively determine the full therapeutic potential of
complete MPTP inhibition during I/R injury by generating mice lacking the predominant isoforms
of ANT and CypD in the heart. In addition to the ANT family and CypD, the MPTP is also regulated
from from the outer mitochondrial membrane by Bax and Bak. The relationship between the
ANTs, CypD, and Bax/Bak in regards to MPTP regulation is undefined. In this proposal, we aim
to elucidate how they function in concert with one another to lead to MPTP opening. Our
preliminary data suggest the existence of multiple inner membrane pore-forming components of
the MPTP including the ANT family and some other unidentified pore. We will utilize ANT null
mitochondria to explore this hypothesis in further detail and aim to identify the novel pore-forming
component by using targeted and unbiased approaches. Together this proposal will provide
crucial mechanistic insight in the composition and regulation of the MPTP that will reveal potential
strategies to inhibit MPTP opening to prolong cardiomyocyte survival in the face of an ischemic
event."

The broad goal of this translational study is to determine if maternal depression treatment affects
ventricular development through comprehensive echocardiography measurements immediately after
birth and over time. The decision to medically treat maternal depression is challenging and includes
careful consideration of the risks versus benefits. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a
class of antidepressants currently prescribed to 10-13% of pregnant women. Interpersonal
psychotherapy (IPT) is an alternative non-pharmacologic treatment that has shown efficacy in mild to
severe depression. Treatment of maternal depression is not only critical for the health of the mother
and fetus but may impact overall health as research has shown that a deleterious intrauterine
environment can predispose individuals to cardiovascular disease. To date, we have demonstrated
both short- and long-term effects from SSRI exposure on ventricular size and cardiac function in mice
and zebrafish where maternal depression is eliminated as a contributing factor. Epidemiologic reports
continue to be conflicting if SSRIs influence cardiac development and maternal depression remains a
confounding factor. Thus, it is critical to determine if these ventricular findings after SSRI exposure in
animal models translate to humans and if similar findings are noted with non-pharmacologic treatment
for maternal depression. To address these issues, a collaborative team of experts in pediatrics
(neonatal hemodynamics, cardiology, and cardiac critical care) and psychiatry will recruit mothers
without depression and with maternal depression treated with SSRIs or IPT and their offspring. We will
apply advanced echocardiography techniques which have been validated in the newborn and pediatric
populations to pursue two specific aims: (1) Measure the impact of maternal depression and its
treatment on offspring ventricular size immediately after birth, at 1 week, and at 1 year of age; and (2)
Quantify the impact of maternal depression and its treatment on offspring ventricular function following
birth, at 1 week, and at 1 year of age. Because heart size and ventricular function are important
predictors of outcomes in many adult and pediatric diseases, this study will provide important answers

Age-related increase in the burden of systemic inflammation is a key player and potential treatment target in
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other age-related dementias. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune hyper-
inflammatory disease and an excellent model for understanding the role of chronic inflammation and
autoimmunity in cognitive decline and the modulating effects of anti-rheumatic therapies. Longitudinal studies
on the magnitude of the risk and timing of dementia in chronic inflammatory conditions such as RA are lacking,
resulting in a substantial knowledge gap.
Chronic inflammation precedes the onset of dementia. Furthermore, growing evidence suggests a protective
effect of anti-rheumatic medications on AD. We propose to utilize data from existing cohorts of patients with RA
and matched comparators without RA (R01 AR046849) to quantify and compare the risk of dementia in RA vs.
non-RA participants and to define the role of chronic systemic inflammation in cognitive decline using RA as a
prototype. We will determine the impact of chronic systemic inflammation and anti-rheumatic treatments on
dementia in RA patients, adjusting for important confounders (age, sex, education, socio-economic status,
smoking, obesity, cardiovascular disease, depression). Additionally, using the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging
resources (U01 AG006786), we will define change of cognitive function and neuroimaging markers in patients
with RA according to the level of inflammation and use of anti-rheumatic treatments.
Successful completion of the proposed series of studies will be a key step towards understanding whether
chronic exposure to systemic inflammation has adverse cognitive effects and whether tight control of systemic
inflammation with anti-rheumatic treatments has protective effects. Our existing cohorts offer a rare opportunity
to efficiently address this knowledge gap. Potential downstream effects are significant, including new strategies
for prevention and management of dementia in patients with RA and new insights for future studies on
prevention of dementia in the general population."

The broader use of T-cell-based therapies is still hindered by challenges related to the identiﬁcation of peptide-
targets that are both immunogenic (capable of activating T-cells) and safe (do not trigger on-target/off-tumor or
off-target toxicities). This is in part due to persistent dependency on biased sequence-based methods, despite
recent breakthroughs in structural modeling and machine learning that could be leveraged to support new workﬂows
for the identiﬁcation of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). To address this issue, and foster the design of better
T-cell-based immunotherapies, we propose a new computational environment (HLA-arena 2.0) that will integrate
existing ITCR resources, with new bioinformatics methods for structural modeling and analysis of key cellular
immunity receptors; namely T-cell receptors (TCRs) and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) receptors. Our working
hypothesis is that the combination of multi-omics data with large-scale structure-based analysis can overcome
most of the limitations of existing pipelines for TAA discovery, therefore enabling the design of better and safer
T-cell-based immunotherapies. To test this hypothesis, we will implement a new workﬂow for structure-guided
TAA discovery, integrating HLA-Arena with pVACtools (ITCR-funded package for sequence-based neoantigen
discovery) and CrossDome (an R package for off-target toxicity prediction). In collaboration with researchers
from MD Anderson Cancer Center, the PI will develop and test workﬂows to address existing needs in T-cell-
based immunotherapy. We will focus on two different cancer types, that represent different challenges for cancer
immunotherapy. In collaboration with Dr. Lizée, we will benchmark our structure-guided TAA discovery workﬂow
using immunopeptidomics data on melanoma. We will also run off-target toxicity predictions to identify the safest
among 10 potentially therapeutic T-cell clones targeting two melanoma-derived TAAs from SLC45A2. Melanoma is
a type of solid tumor for which greater success has been observed with immunotherapy treatments. On the other
hand, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer in which severe reactions to immunotherapy have
been observed. In this context, we will work with Dr. Abbas to examine transcriptomic datasets (bulk and single-cell
data) from AML patients, aiming at uncovering TAAs and TCRs that are associated with effective immune response
to AML. Finally, we will use CrossDome and existing data on known TAAs to develop The Cancer off-target Toxicity
Atlas (TCTA). For each known TAA, this new database will contain a list of potential off-targets that should be tested
when targeting these TAAs with immunotherapies. Predicted off-targets will be annotated with additional data (e.g.,
tissue expression, HLA-binding, immunogenicity, etc). All methods will be made available to the community through
user-friendly workﬂows, facilitating the design of better and safer T-cell-based immunotherapies for numerous types
of cancer. The proposed methods will be deeply integrated into the ITCR network, creating many opportunities for
future collaborations. In addition, the long-term goals of the proposed research are well aligned with NCI’s mission
to achieve more effective and less toxic cancer treatments, therefore helping people live longer and healthier lives."

Rough sexual behaviors (i.e., sex that involves slapping, hard spanking, punching, choking, and/or other
physically aggressive acts) appear to be increasingly common among adolescents and young adults (ages 15–
29; AYA) in the United States (US). Rough sex can have negative mental and sexual health consequences for
AYA. Even when rough sex is consensual, it can cause injury (e.g., concussion, bruising, lacerations) and—in
rare cases—death. Further, preliminary data suggests that youth may feel pressured or coerced into rough
sex. In these cases, the distinction between rough sex and sexual assault is unclear and the after-effects may
mirror those experienced by sexual assault survivors including an increased likelihood of physical and
emotional dating abuse; depression, anxiety, and trauma symptoms; unintended pregnancy; and sexually
transmitted infection (STI). Lastly, some AYA may consent to rough sex, only to be unprepared for the level of
intensity or aggression used by their partner or the health consequences of those actions. This differentiation
between expectations and experience may prove to be emotionally harmful in addition to any physical harm
that is caused. Given that preliminary data suggest that sexual and gender minority and racial/ethnic minority
youth may be more likely to engage in rough sex, it is critical to understand how rough sexual behaviors are
associated with the mental and sexual health of youth already facing substantial health inequities. Presently,
there are no national estimates of the prevalence of rough sexual behaviors across adolescence and young
adulthood. There is an urgent need for us to assess the prevalence and diversity of rough sexual behaviors
among AYA, explore which factors influence whether and how AYA engage in rough sex (e.g., partners, peers,
media), and examine how engaging in rough sex relates to the mental and sexual health of AYA. As such, the
aims of this sequential explanatory mixed-methods study are to: (1) use a nationally representative survey of
800 adolescents (15–17 years old) and 1,000 young adults (18–29 years old) to determine the prevalence and
correlates of rough sexual behaviors among AYA in the US; (2) conduct follow-up in-depth interviews with a
diverse subsample of AYA from Aim 1 (N = 150) to assess how rough sex behaviors are understood,
experienced, and related to health by AYA; and (3) examine whether rough sex experiences, expectations, and
consequences vary for demographic subgroups (i.e., by age, sex assigned at birth, gender identity, sexual
orientation identity, racial/ethnic identity). A youth advisory board will be involved in all stages of the study. This
study will provide critical information about the prevalence, correlates, and consequences of rough sex,
including how rough sex relates to the mental and sexual health of AYA. Results will inform meaningful and
impactful mental and sexual health programming aimed at addressing sexual assault, mental health,
unintended pregnancy, and STI acquisition among AYA."

 New experimental models are needed to develop treatments for varicella zoster virus (VZV), a
DNA virus that has infected over 90% of individuals worldwide. Primary infection causes chickenpox,
while reactivation of the virus within the nervous system can have dire consequences. Encephalitis is
the most fearsome complication, and VZV represents one of the most common infectious causes of
encephalitis worldwide. Shingles (herpes zoster) is the most common manifestation of viral
reactivation, affecting one out of every three people in the U.S. and causing post-herpetic neuralgia
(PHN), a severe, often chronic, pain syndrome with annual U.S. costs of over $1 billion. Importantly,
VZV continues to exact a marked toll despite the advent and widespread use of antiviral agents
(acyclovir) and vaccination, which only afford partial protection and do not specifically address PHN.
Thus, new therapies are needed to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with neuronal infection
and reactivation.
 The major limitation in the study of VZV infection is the strict species-specificity of the virus, as
it essentially exclusively infects human cells. As a result, there are no robust animal models that
recapitulate essential features of human disease. Moreover, the virus appears to utilize distinct
cellular and molecular pathways in different cell types. Thus, studies of viral infection in human
fibroblasts or other skin cells may not directly bear on pathogenesis within human neurons. Recently,
VZV has been shown to infect neurons derived from human neural stem cells and human pluripotent
stem cells, suggesting that stem-cell based approaches for the study of VZV pathogenesis are likely
to hold great promise for the development of new treatments. However, most human neuronal
cultures systems derived from stem cells are typically comprised of few, if any, sensory neurons.
This is a great limitation since sensory neurons are the main cell type in which the virus establishes
latency and later re-emerges during reactivation.
 Recently, we have developed a human pluripotent stem cell based model of sensory neuron
infection by VZV, in which the neurons are capable of harboring VZV in a latent state. We anticipate
that this model will allow characterization of cellular and molecular mechanisms of latency and will
serve as the basis to develop new treatments for VZV reactivation."
10866496,"The novel SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes the severe pneumonia-like coronavirus
disease (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 infected over 170 million individuals and has claimed over
3.5 million lives worldwide to date. If otherwise healthy, children were thought to be largely
spared from SARS-CoV-2 disease. However, in areas of high SARS-CoV-2 infection rates,
some children started presenting to pediatric critical care units 4-6 weeks following SARS-CoV-
2 infection with Kawasaki-like disease. Clinically, we now know that this is a distinct disease,
which was recently termed - multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). While the
characteristic clinical features of MIS-C are becoming clear, the pathophysiology remains
unknown. Here we propose to evaluate three independent cohorts of MIS-C during acute and
convalescent phases of disease at clinical, genetic and immunologic levels using the latest
technology. We will not only perform systemic immunological mapping of MIS-C as compared to
controls, but also utilize machine learning algorithms to delineate how best to predict, diagnose
and outcome stratify MIS-C. We anticipate discovering immunologic and genetic features which
can aid us in assessing risks of MIS-C development, diagnosis and prognosis. In summary, our
systematic analysis and computational modeling of the clinical and immune features of MIS-C
will not only help illuminate the pathogenesis of this syndrome, but will also provide us with
actionable biomarkers for disease risk, diagnosis and progression."
10866501,"Project Summary/Abstract
Patterns of neural activity underlie information processing in the brain. Most work to date has focused
on separate stages of computation by looking at separate regions in the brain - one at a time. We
propose that techniques from graph theory can help us better understand how information is processed
by entire populations of neurons. To this end, we use the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study
the processing of an ecologically-relevant signal in most of the nervous system at once. Specifically,
we will record activity from all of the neurons in the head of the worm, where most olfactory processing
occurs, while we expose the animal to an innately attractive odor, diacetyl. We will then test how this
representation changes in two behavioral states – after adaptation, at which point the worm no longer
finds diacetyl attractive, and when C. elegans recovers from adaptation, when it again finds diacetyl
attractive. We will do all of this in a transgenic worm which will allow us to identify all neurons by name,
and thus to analyze our results based on the known anatomical connections between neurons. Work
we are preparing to submit for publication has established that one graph-theoretic feature can identify
a stimulus’ valence, i.e. whether or not it is attractive or repellent, and we will determine which neurons
are driving changes in this feature. Finally, we will optogenetically test the predictions from our analyses
to ensure that they are biologically significant. For instance, some non-overlapping subsets of neurons
may represent positive and negative valence, and their activation may induce either forward, or
backward, movements, respectively. If, for example, a neuron provides an important link between
neurons that represent any valence (i.e. it is on the shortest path between these neurons) and the motor
command interneurons, then we might reason that it facilitates the transfer of information, and that
inhibiting it would delay the animal’s odor-seeking behavior. A future extension of this work would
combine graph theory and information theory to understand how efficiently neurons process and
transfer information. Importantly, this field, called network coding, proposes that an efficient way to
transmit information is to allow downstream nodes to decode information that is processed along the
path. During my postdoctoral work, as I gain experience with new theories and a new neural system
that uses spiking neurons, I seek to develop the field of network coding for neuroscience. I am
interested in spiking neurons to ensure my work is applicable to the larger field of neural systems which
employ spiking, not graded, potentials."
10866502,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Most U.S. children fall short of the recommended 60 minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
(MVPA). Our research and that of others show that this gap disproportionately affects children who are female
and overweight/obese. Programs designed to increase children's physical literacy (PL), defined as the
competence, confidence, and motivation to be physically active for life, hold particular promise for closing this
gap and achieving equity. Furthermore, policy recommendations promote school- and home-based PA
interventions, and evidence suggests that interventions incorporating both settings may have synergistic
effects. However, no prior studies have tested the efficacy of a multilevel, PL-focused intervention. Our overall
objective is fill this gap by designing and testing a program that will reach children both at school and at home
to increase their PL and, in turn, total daily PA and MVPA. We will meet this objective through a partnership
between Tufts University and the New York Road Runners. This partnership is a unique and significant
strength given our organizations' collective dissemination experience and networks to scale PA programs
nationwide. Our preliminary studies include a feasibility trial of the school component of the physical literacy
program. This informs our proposed study in which we aim to further develop a family engagement component
and subsequently pilot test the multilevel program: Supporting Physical Literacy at School and Home
(SPLASH). The SPLASH home component will be informed by focus groups with n=80 parents in NYC (n=40)
and Greater Boston, MA (n=40). We will then pilot the multilevel SPLASH program to evaluate implementation
processes and outcomes. This will be accomplished in n=8 New York City (NYC) schools using a mixed-
methods approach. The learnings from the R21 phase will further inform the final development and
implementation of the SPLASH program during the R33. In the R33 phase, we will conduct a group
randomized trial in MA to determine the impact of the full, multilevel SPLASH program on children's PL and
total daily PA and MVPA. We propose to assess these outcomes in n=8 randomly selected schools (n=4
intervention, n=4 control, delayed intervention) using a pre-post study design with objective measurement
(accelerometry) of PA and valid, reliable tools for PL assessment. We will further examine whether effects of
the multilevel program differ by child sex or weight status and test whether changes in PL mediate changes in
daily total PA volume or MVPA. This randomized and controlled study will provide empirical evidence about the
efficacy of a multilevel PL-focused program on children's PL and PA. If the results demonstrate effectiveness,
Tufts and New York Road Runners collectively have the dissemination experience and networks to scale the
program nationally."
10866598,"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a debilitating condition of language loss associated with Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD) affecting many patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), lacks effective treatments. One of the most common and burdensome impairments associated with this manifestation of AD/ADRD is anomia, the inability to access the names of objects, experienced by patients as word-finding difficulty. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of noninvasive neuromodulation, shows promise as an intervention for anomia in persons with PPA. However, efforts to introduce this novel treatment approach into clinical practice are hampered by the modest size and scope of prior tDCS studies in this patient population, which prevents establishment of clear, robust clinical evidence to support the widespread use of tDCS in clinical contexts. To address this gap, this proposal aims to conduct the world’s first well-powered, multi-site Phase 2 clinical trial of tDCS therapy in PPA. In order to accomplish this goal, the current project solidifies a collaboration between research teams at Johns Hopkins, University of Pennsylvania, and Baycrest Health Sciences, which have collectively produced 100% of the published studies on tDCS in PPA in North America and 80% of the studies internationally. In a total cohort of 120 patients with PPA, we will employ a randomized, double-blind, within-subject, cross-over design similar to trials that have been previously employed at each of the contributing sites. Following baseline behavioral testing focused on language abilities and MRI imaging, subjects with PPA will receive 10 daily sessions over two weeks of either tDCS paired with NAming and SPelling treatment (NASP; a behavioral language therapy targeting both oral and written naming production) or sham (placebo) tDCS paired with NASP. Participants will undergo behavioral testing and imaging again at the end of the intervention, receive behavioral testing a month later, and then repeat testing and brain imaging 3 months after the end of the intervention. Participants will then switch study arms and receive the intervention, testing, and imaging at the same intervals. We will also conduct baseline behavioral testing and neuroimaging (with no treatment) on 60 neurologically healthy older adults for comparison to PPA subjects with respect to language performance and brain imaging. Subsequent analyses will determine whether tDCS over the left frontal language areas paired with naming treatment results in persistent improvement in oral and written naming, and will also identify the clinical, neural, biological, cognitive, and demographic characteristics that predict tDCS effects on naming performance. Owing to our unique opportunity to study a largely bilingual population in Canada, we will focus specific attention on bilingualism as a demographic feature that may influence outcomes. Overall, this impactful trial will provide the most reliable answer to date as to whether tDCS is effective for treating naming deficits in PPA and will help the field to identify patients best suited for this promising intervention in AD/ADRD."

 Despite high prevalence rates of mental illness in youth, up to 80% of U.S. youth with mental health (MH)
need do not receive MH services, with the disparity in need and service use highest among racial/ethnic
minority and socially disadvantaged families. MH literacy - knowledge and beliefs about the nature of problems
and effective treatments – is among the most common perceptual barrier limiting the use of effective
treatments. Psychoeducation, which provides basic information about MH problems and treatment options, has
emerged as a promising tool for engaging families in MH care. Yet, there is limited psychoeducational content
designed for underserved families that is co-developed, free, easily accessible, and available in English and
Spanish. To address this gap, we propose to develop, with our community partners in Santa Barbara County, a
Psychoeducation Toolkit designed to engage underserved families in community-based mental health settings
(CMHS). The long-term goal of the proposal is to achieve health equity for underserved families by co-
developing a Psychoeducation Toolkit with community stakeholders and assessing implementation outcomes.
Using a collaborative, iterative approach with community stakeholders in Santa Barbara County, the toolkit will
ultimately be designed to increase mental health literacy, reduce stigma, and enhance help-seeking behaviors.
The following aims will allow us to produce the toolkit to examine implementation outcomes using the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research as a theoretical framework to guide implementation
efforts of the evidence-based, culturally responsive toolkit created for the context of CMHS. Aim 1: Co-Develop
the Psychoeducation Toolkit with Providers and Families in CMHS. It is expected that this aim will increase the
feasibility, acceptability, utility, and adaptability of the toolkit for providers to implement in the CMHS context.
Aim 2: Examine the feasibility, acceptability, utility, and adaptability of Psychoed Toolkit in a pilot. It is expected
that this aim will address potential implementation barriers and increase the external validity of the toolkit for
use in the CMHS context. We will employ a mixed methods, Delphi approach in the development and
implementation of the toolkit, which allows the examination of quantitative data on implementation outcomes
and an assessment of qualitative consumer perspectives impacting the delivery of the toolkit. Importantly, this
proposal will achieve the goal of this funding mechanism by engaging students from underrepresented groups
in research. As CSUN is a Hispanic Serving Institution with a high proportion of first-generation college
students from disadvantaged backgrounds, this project will enable the PI to mentor underrepresented students
in hands-on psychological research. The PI has a strong track record of mentoring underrepresented students
that have successfully entered into Ph.D. programs. It is expected that accomplishing this project will address
community stakeholder needs to achieve health equity. As the current proposal is focused on implementation
outcomes, future studies will examine the intended effects of the toolkit in a randomized control trial (R34)."

Microbial production of fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides
This proposed project aims to establish efficient and specific microbial production processes for human milk
oligosaccharides (HMOs). HMOs are potent bioactive compounds that modulate neonatal health and are of
interest for development as potential drug treatments for adult diseases. HMOs are a class of over 200
compounds present at 20-23 g/L in colostrum and 12-14 g/L in mature milk. Unlike their common precursor
lactose, HMOs are indigestible by human infants and instead improve neonatal health by serving as effective
antimicrobials and antivirals, prebiotics, and regulators of inflammatory immune cell-response cascades. These
and other potential benefits of HMOs make them attractive targets of study for preventing or treating diseases in
both children and adults. β1−3-Linked galactosides Galβ3GlcNAcβOR, which are called Type 1 glycans, are
major HMO components found in more than 100 HMOs. Among the 20 HMO core structures that have been
identified, 11 contain at least one Type 1 glycan-terminated branch. Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT, Galβ3GlcNAcβ3Lac)
is the simplest Type 1 glycan HMO. LNT and its fucosylated derivatives are among the most abundant HMOs.
While Type 1 glycan structures are predominant in human milk, they are less abundant (and sometimes
completely absent) in the milk of other mammals. Investigating the biological functions of individual Type 1
glycan-containing HMOs and their potential applications as prebiotics and antimicrobials requires access to
sufficient quantities of these structurally defined compounds. The potential of these molecules, their limited
access from natural sources, and difficulty in large-scale isolation of individual HMOs for studies and applications
have motivated the development of novel production methods. Chemical and in vitro enzymatic syntheses of
HMOs based on current methods are expected to be costly for industrial-scale synthesis. Whole cell biocatalysts
are emerging as alternative self-regulating production platforms that have significant potential to reduce the
production cost of HMOs. Short-chain, linear and small monofucosylated HMOs have been produced in whole
cell biocatalysts, but structures with higher complexity have not been explored. In this proposed project, we will
establish a strategy for producing fucosylated HMOs including lacto-N-fucopentaose II (LNFP II), lacto-N-
fucopentaose I (LNFP I) and lacto-N-difucosylhexaose I (LNDFH I) from lactose and L-fucose in live engineered
Escherichia coli cells. Notably, we will develop an innovative method to control the order and the site of
glycosylation in whole cell systems to lay the groundwork for future microbial production of other complex HMOs."

Understanding the forces that drive structural changes in the genome remains a key challenge in genetics and
evolutionary biology. Since the earliest days of genetics, scientists have understood the vast implications that
structural variation has on phenotypes. Chromosomal variation is ubiquitous across nature. It has been shown
to play a role in several biological processes and is associated with multiple traits, including number of
offspring, disease states, and the regulation of gene expression. Yet, despite this ubiquity and importance,
several longstanding questions about the evolution of structural variation remain unanswered. Over the next
five years, my lab will advance two parallel and complementary research lines that focus on two major features
of the genomic landscape: chromosome inversions and sex chromosomes. First, my group will investigate
the evolutionary forces maintaining inversions and the specific mutations within inversions that underlie
important phenotypes. To this end, I will create and deploy a full-featured open-source software package
that simulates whole chromosomes that carry polymorphic inversions and use it to quantify evolutionary
forces acting on inversions in the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae. This proposed computational
infrastructure will deepen our understanding of the biology of inversions and their role in processes like
adaptation and speciation, and will motivate further work by allowing the rapid simulation of genome-scale data
with chromosomal variation. A second research line uses comparative and population genomics to test
theoretical predictions on the evolution of sex chromosomes, perhaps the most dynamically evolving
region of the genome. I will focus on two independently evolved sex-chromosome systems in Solanum (a
speciose plant genus of agricultural importance and considerable genomic resources), to study the mode and
tempo of sex chromosome divergence. I will produce chromosome-level genome assemblies for two dioecious
species (i.e., those with separate male and female individuals), characterize their sex chromosomes, and use a
comparative approach to test for gene movement on and off the sex chromosomes. Further, I will search for
two key features of the sex-linked regions predicted by theoretical models: an enrichment of sex-biased gene
expression and an accumulation of sexually antagonistic polymorphism. My research will leverage the benefits
of working with evolutionarily recent sex-chromosome systems, gaining a unique perspective on the origin of
sex and the dynamics of sex-linked genomic regions, and learning about the conditions that affect the evolution
of recombination suppression, subsequent sex-chromosome divergence, and potential degeneration. By
developing computational tools necessary for genomic analysis and by testing core hypotheses of the
evolution of large genomic features, this research program will make important strides in our understanding of
how and why the structure of the genome evolves."

Newborn screening (NBS) provides early diagnosis of treatable disorders. Most NBS is based on
measurement of biomarkers in dried blood spots (DBS). However, there are hundreds of pediatric and
actionable diseases for which a biomarker is difficult to imagine. This has led to consideration of whole
genome sequencing as a new paradigm in NBS (newborn sequencing, NBSeq). NBSeq has significant
challenges one of which is the false negative problem expected when DNA variants of unknown significance
(VOUS) are ignored. Ignoring VOUS is a necessary element of NBSeq because downstream biochemical
analysis of all newborns with VOUS is not feasible because of the commonality of these DNA variants.
 The goal of this grant is to develop and explore new technology for massively parallel, rapid, and
inexpensive biochemical annotation of VOUS. We have developed a new technique we call VOUSDO where
we prepare a library of DNAs that encode every possible amino acid substitution in a protein at one change per
protein. Human cells are then transfected with this library, and the cells are engineered to express only a
single protein variant per cell. The cells are also engineered to express an RNA barcode whose sequence
serves to identify the protein variant. After protein variant expression, the protein is engineered to capture its
respective barcode. The degree of barcode capture depends on the abundance of the protein. Thus, any
amino acid substitution that causes the protein to misfold and become degraded will lead to a protein variant
that under-captures its barcodes. Barcodes are converted to DNA at the end of the analysis and these are
subjected to next generation sequencing to reveal their sequences. The DNA sequence read frequency of
each protein variant is compared to that of the wild type protein to provide the fraction of variant that folds in
cells relative to wild type.
 The above technique works for cytosolic proteins. For proteins that target cellular organelles or are
secreted, we will employ a second technique called VAMP-seq. Here, the protein is fused to a fluorescent
protein, and the degree of fluorescence depends on the level of folded protein expressed in cells. Again, cells
are engineered so that each cell expresses a single protein variant. RNA barcodes are used as well to identify
the protein variant. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting is used to collect cells depending on the extent of
fluorescence. Barcodes in each collection bin are read as for VOUSDO to give the relative extent of folding of
each variant relative to that of wild type protein.
 These techniques have the potential to provide biochemical annotation of every single site amino acid
substitution in the full list of proteins being included in NBSeq pilot studies worldwide. Knowing which VOUS
greatly reduce the extent of protein folding is expected to massively reduce the false negative problem
associated with ignoring VOUS in NBSeq programs."

Synchronization of biological processes and behaviors with the 24-hour light-dark cycle is fundamental to
optimal physiology, cognitive function, and health. Because humans have, on average, a longer than 24-hour
internal clock, most people must perform this synchronization process on a daily basis. An inability to
adequately entrain internal circadian rhythms to the external environment, even a small misalignment, can
have severe consequences including poor cardiometabolic outcomes (i.e., cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
obesity) and impaired sleep, cognitive function, and learning. Entrainment is believed to be entirely
orchestrated by exposure to morning light, as it has been assumed that non-photic exogenous stimuli have
little influence on circadian entrainment in humans. However, emerging evidence from animal models indicates
that circadian entrainment to light could be hampered by dietary composition. Specifically, mice fed a high-fat
diet have a 20% slower rate of entrainment to light and a longer circadian period. If these findings hold true in
humans, this would challenge current theory within the field of human circadian physiology and would have
vast public health implications as so many Americans consume high-fat diets. Thus, quantifying the interaction
between typical dietary choices and circadian entrainment has great importance. The goal of this project is to
determine if these diet-related circadian effects in rodents translate to humans. Our specific aims are to
establish the impact of a high-fat diet on the: 1) rate of entrainment of the circadian system to light; 2) circadian
period and the resultant circadian timing of daily behaviors i.e., phase angle of entrainment (time difference
between melatonin and sleep onsets); and 3) how the combination of eating a high-fat diet and circadian phase
(i.e., circadian alignment vs misalignment) and the rate of re-entrainment impacts cardiometabolic health,
cognitive function, and learning. To accomplish our aims, we have designed a randomized cross-over
mechanistic study in controlled laboratory settings. We hypothesize that when individuals that habitually eat a
low-fat diet are provided an isocaloric high-fat diet (versus when provided an isocaloric low-fat diet), they will
take longer to entrain to a shift in the light-dark cycle, have a narrower phase angle of entrainment, and have
increased circadian misalignment and associated impairments in cardiometabolic health, cognitive function,
and learning. These data will provide a fundamental understanding of how common dietary patterns alter the
way humans synchronize to the environment. Importantly, these data will have far-reaching implications for the
large portions of society that endure: 1) travel across multiple time zones (jet-lag); 2) a need to readjust
sleep/wake timing on workdays (social jet-lag); and 3) work and school start times that are too early for the
circadian clock of most young adults and teens. This study is important because of the ubiquity of the need for
circadian adjustments and the fact that even slight effects of diet on circadian entrainment can have large
effects on health, cognitive function, and learning."

Management & Analysis Core (DMAC) to offer solution-oriented interactive summer workshops as well as data
sharing opportunities and access to DMAC facilities and expertise. In Aim 3, RETCC will facilitate trainees’
ability to generate and apply scientific knowledge in ways that effectively engage stakeholders and
communities, and to translate scientific knowledge to inform policy-making and support environmental and
social justice through micro-internship opportunities with the Community Engagement Core and the
Administrative Core’s Research Translation function. Aim 4 is focused on enriching career and leadership
development of CLEAR trainees, through a CLEAR Leadership Fellowship program to support leadership
development in grant and budget management, leading diverse teams, and enhancing their national profile as
emerging environmental health science leaders through trainee-led invited speaker series and virtual knowledge
exchanges with other Superfund trainees across the country. RETCC will also provide funding to support
scientific conference travel and pilot studies that incorporate collaborations across disciplines and stakeholders,
and coordinate access to WSU state-of-the-art core facilities, expertise, and mentoring."
10867399,"SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is an important determinant of
maternal-offspring health, with implications for preterm birth and associated adverse health outcomes. VOCs
contaminate shallow soils and groundwater of post-industrial cities at Superfund, residential, commercial, and
industrial properties, leading to exposure via vapor intrusion. The Center for Leadership in Environmental
Awareness and Research (CLEAR) is dedicated to understanding and mitigating this serious environmental
health problem. The Chemical Analysis Core (CAC) will create a comprehensive toolbox to quantitate, monitor,
and determine the extent of VOC exposure for CLEAR research projects and the Community Engagement
Core (CEC). The CAC supports CLEAR’s mission by providing analytical knowledge, guidance, training and
new technologies designed to detect, assess and mitigate the adverse health effects emanating from chronic
and low-level exposure to VOCs. The CAC leadership and laboratory personnel will work with and within the
CLEAR project teams to ensure sensitive, accurate analyses and develop advanced techniques for VOC
analysis in novel matrices as required. Specifically, the CAC will offer precise, sensitive, low cost, high volume
quantification of VOC molecules and their metabolites, which are known or suspected to impact health.
Proteomic and adductomic analyses will identify markers of environmental exposures as well as the extent of
disease. Targeted and untargeted VOC analyses, proteomic, and adductomic workflows, which are available to
investigators through partnership with the CAC, is tailored for each of the five CLEAR projects and the CEC.
For each, analytical quantification of unique samples and new innovative sample preparation methods are an
expected outcome. The CAC integrates small molecule mass spectrometry, proteomic mass spectrometry and
high throughput cytokine analysis. These complementary analytical technologies enable the CAC to be
integrated into CLEAR research projects and facilitate assessment of the degree of exposure and VOC
exposure impacts on human health."
10867515,"Project Summary/Abstract for Core A: Administrative and Research Support Core
The overarching objective of the Administrative and Research Support Core (hereafter “Administrative Core”) is
to provide operational oversight for the Center for Aging and Policy Studies (CAPS), ensuring that all cores
achieve their aims; function efficiently, effectively, and in tandem; and that all outcomes are monitored and
reported. The Administrative Core will also provide substantive oversight, ensuring that CAPS remains at the
forefront of scientific developments in the demography and economics of aging, including and especially related
to CAPS signature and cross-cutting themes. The Administrative Core will achieve its objective through four
specific aims. Aim 1 is to provide governance, strategic direction, and centralized communication to support
CAPS activities. The CAPS five-person leadership team brings extensive experience leading NIH-funded and
other centers as well as large, multi-institution research programs. The overall director of CAPS and leader of
the Administrative Core is an internationally recognized scientist with significant leadership experience and
demonstrated skill at managing the strategic, fiscal, and operational aspects of cross-site programs. Aim 2 is to
monitor, evaluate, and ensure compliance of all CAPS activities. This core will track performance metrics (e.g.,
center participation, grant activity, scientific impact); ensure compliance with NIA, IRB, and other relevant
entities; and report information to the Coordinating Center. Aim 3 is to enhance human capital in population-
based aging research among emerging, underrepresented, and established scholars. Although all cores will
provide coordinated development activities, the Administrative Core will oversee the majority of activities in this
area. Activities include an innovative teaming program, visiting scholars program, onsite-online colloquium
series, and workshops in the latest research methodologies related to CAPS thematic areas. Aim 4 is to foster
innovative and interdisciplinary research related to CAPS signature and cross-cutting themes. The teaming
program and pilot project program are central activities for achieving this aim. The structure and operation of the
Administrative Core contains several innovative elements. First, CAPS will use a hub-and-spoke operating
model, with Syracuse University as the hub and nearby Cornell University and the University at Albany–State
University of New York as the spokes. This model combines the benefits of both a brick-and-mortar Center and
a virtual network that is nimble, cost-effective, and wide-reaching. Second, the CAPS leadership team spans
multiple disciplines and career stages. Consequently, it is well-positioned to promote innovative and
interdisciplinary research and bring both tested and new perspectives on Center operations. Third, CAPS will
use new platforms for intellectual exchange, including an onsite-online hybrid colloquium series and a teaming
program, to accelerate opportunities for research collaborations and human capital development. Fourth, CAPS
will strategically partner with other institutions and NIA-funded centers and networks to foster innovation in
research and training and to support the collective enterprise in population-based aging research."

Focal disease processes affect a specific organ, or part of an organ. Examples include primary
tumors, inflammatory bowel disease, focal epilepsy, post-surgical pain, embolisms. The
mainstay of medical management of these disease processes is drug treatment. However, the
vast majority of our drug treatments of focal disease processes lack spatial targeting. For
example, oral or intravenous drug treatments will deliver drug to the affected region; however,
they will also expose all other organs to therapeutic drug levels. This systemic, off-target drug
exposure causes severe, lethal side effects which limits our use of these medications in treating
disease. To limit off-target side effects, there is significant interest in developing spatially
targeted, focal drug delivery technologies. While some technologies have had important clinical
impact, focal drug delivery has not yet achieved widespread success. We have developed intra-
arterial drug-eluting bioresorbable composite implants that can reduce off-target drug exposure
by 40-fold. For many drug treatments, this would effectively eliminate off-target side effects. Our
implants are designed according to the four following criteria: (1) maximize drug storage and
elution, (2) minimize disruptions to blood flow, (3) biocompatible for clinical use, and (4)
biodegradable with tunable absorption rate when no longer needed. Moreover, this is a platform
technology for delivery of a wide range of drugs, which can be used to treat an array of disease
processes. Through this award, we intend to demonstrate the platform potential of our
technology, by focally delivering two different drugs to two different organs. Additional analyses
will assess for safety and efficacy of our intervention. If successful, the data obtained from this
award would strongly motivate the next steps of product development for pre-clinical trials."
10868837,"Project Summary
Intercellular communication based on the delivery of miRNAs from one cell to adjacent or remote cells is now
known to be a critical part of normal cellular/organismal function. Recent work has demonstrated that a new
class of extracellular nanoparticles, exomeres, may be more important for miRNA-mediated intercellular
communication than extracellular vesicles (EVs). Exomeres are small, non-membranous secreted particles
that are different from EVs. Compared to EVs, exomeres are smaller, have distinct protein and nucleic acid
content, and are not encapsulated by lipid membranes. Also, exomeres contain Argonaute-2 (Ago2), one of
the principal proteins of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. With respect to intercellular communication,
exomeres contain miRNAs, which are likely bound by Ago2, and the EGFR ligand, amphiregulin, which could
initiate receptor-mediated endocytosis. Thus, exomeres are a natural RNA-containing nanoparticle evolved to
have molecular and physical properties that facilitate efficient endocytosis and intracellular processing of the
miRNA cargo by recipient cells. In this work, we will begin to explore whether exomeres could be used for
delivery of exogenous miRNAs (or siRNAs) for therapeutic applications.
The mechanisms of exomere biogenesis, secretion, endocytosis, and intracellular trafficking remain poorly
understood. This is due, in part, to the challenges of isolating exomeres. Current exomere isolation approaches
have allowed for preliminary characterization of exomeres, but further study of exomeres, and their critical
roles in RNA-mediated intercellular communication, will require approaches for isolating exomeres that yield
high concentrations of reasonably homogeneous complexes. In this work, we will develop a novel, scalable
exomere isolation approach based on tangential flow filtration (TFF) that will enhance our ability to study
exomeres and the endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of exomeres by recipient cells. The overarching
goal of this work is to demonstrate the utility of TFF for exomere isolation and to demonstrate that exomeres
isolated by TFF are identical to those isolated by current approaches. Given that TFF is compatible with
possible industrial production methods for exomeres, our results will provide the foundation for future efforts to
use exomeres for RNA delivery in clinical applications."

 Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) are heterogenous and usually present with complex etiology.
Individuals with these conditions present cognitive impairment accompanied by lifelong deficits; yet remarkably
little is known about their neurological basis. To develop effective treatments, it is imperative to understand the
dysregulation of molecular and cellular processes leading to these conditions. PACS2 syndrome is a NDD
characterized by epilepsy, intellectual disability, craniofacial abnormalities, and hypotonia. PACS2 syndrome
results from a recurrent de novo c.625G>A variant in the gene encoding Phosphofurin Acidic Cluster Sorting
protein 2 (PACS2) resulting in a Glutamate to Lysine (p.E209K) substitution. PACS2 encodes a multifunctional
sorting protein that mediates protein trafficking between the endomembrane system which includes the ER,
Golgi, mitochondria, lysosomes, and the plasma membrane. The mechanism of PACS2 syndrome is relatively
understudied, however, a recent report found that PACS2 p.E209K has an increased half-life compared to WT
PACS2. They also found an increased association of PACS2 p.E209K with 14-3-3ε, and that cells
overexpressing PACS2 p.E209K or 14-3-3ε undergo apoptosis. Given that PACS2 function has rarely been
studied in neurons or model organisms and the neuronal-specific effect of the p.E209K variant are not known.
Here, we will use patient-derived and CRISPR knock-in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models to study the
molecular and neuronal-specific deficits associated which PACS2 p.E209K. We hypothesize that neurons
carrying the PACS2 p.E209K substitution present with increased susceptibility to apoptosis via the lysosomal
pathway. We will test this hypothesis by addressing whether PACS2 p.E209K promotes apoptosis, precocious
neural differentiation and hyperexcitability in neurons (aim 1) by increasing PACS2 stability and PACS2-
mediated recruitment of pro-apoptotic proteins to the lysosomes in neurons (aim 2). Results from this proposal
will greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which PACS2 p.E209K affects developing
neurons. Moreover, we will uncover mechanisms by which PACS2 in general and PACS2 p.E209K in particular,
regulate pro-apoptotic pathways. Finally, results from this proposal will contribute to our knowledge of disease
mechanisms for PACS2 Syndrome, which may reveal therapy targets."
10869448,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals comprise a growing population of over 20 million people in the
United States. SGM individuals experience cancer care-related disparities with comparatively more frequent
late-stage cancer diagnoses and more premature cancer deaths. Although these disparities are stark, the
cancer-specific needs of SGM patients are under-reported and under-studied. Our preliminary data reveals
that fewer than half of oncology practices nationwide collect SOGI data, because oncology clinicians lack
training in how to discuss SOGI information in an affirming and culturally appropriate manner. Invisibility of
SGM people further exacerbates cancer-related disparities; clinicians and researchers cannot even begin to
discuss ways to improve these patients’ cancer care without first identifying them and their cancer-specific
needs. We propose to remedy this by refining a training module for oncology clinicians, which will teach
clinicians why and how to ask patients about their SOGI status in cancer clinics. In the first aim, we propose to
pilot this training module among oncology clinicians at three clinical sites nationwide. We will learn oncology
clinicians’ views and attitudes of this module and feelings of competence in caring for SGM people after
participating in this module, using qualitative interviews. Interview questions will be derived from a model
highlighting five fundamental constructs to provide culturally responsive healthcare to diverse groups of
patients, developed by Campinha-Bacote and colleagues. We will use an iterative process to improve the
module content, based upon this qualitative data. In the second aim, we propose to learn the views and
attitudes of SGM patients about the training module content using qualitative interviews, and, based on this
data, further refine the module so that it is as patient-centric and SGM-affirming as possible. Upon completion
of these aims, the final training module will be: 1) concise and thereby easily implementable into clinical
practice – it will take 45 minutes or less to complete, 2) specifically targeted to both patient and clinician
concerns and needs, 3) applicable to a wide and diverse audience. With the completion of these two aims, the
finalized module will be ready for further development within the context of a national clinical trial and ready for
broad dissemination among oncology practices."
10869449,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a deadly mental health disorder characterized by pronounced low bodyweight resulting
from reduced food intake and oftentimes simultaneous hyperactivity, typically through compulsive exercise.
Individuals experiencing AN, who are at least 75% more likely to identify as female, bear the brunt of this
condition. AN has the second highest mortality rate among mental health disorders, recently surpassed only by
opioid-use disorder. In addition to the strikingly low bodyweight, AN leads to chronic medical conditions and
lifetime disability. The overwhelming majority of deaths in AN patients are attributed to either unknown medical
complications or suicide. Interestingly, the prioritization of hyperactivity over food intake, a prominent feature in
many individuals with AN, has been observed not only in humans but also in various species, including rodents.
Leveraging this parallel, researchers have employed the activity-based anorexia (ABA) rodent model to shed
light on the evolutionarily conserved motivational drives potentially underlying AN. Nevertheless, the specific
neurobiological factors driving these maladaptive behaviors in ABA and AN are still largely unknown. Our
previous studies have implicated hypothalamic hunger-promoting agouti-related peptide (AgRP) cells as
potential contributors to the valence reassignment that occurs in AN between hunger, feeding, and hyperactivity.
Notably, we have demonstrated that increasing AgRP neural activity can promote bodyweight gain in ABA mice,
offering a potential therapeutic target for reversing weight loss in ABA and, potentially, AN. However, the precise
mechanisms through which AgRP neurons coordinate these effects and whether they modulate valence
associations with hunger, physical activity and feeding behavior in ABA remain elusive. The objective of this
proposal is to determine the neurobiological mechanisms employed by AgRP neurons to orchestrate the re-
prioritization of feeding behavior over hyperactivity in ABA, utilizing cutting-edge behavioral technologies and
knock-in mouse models. In Aim 1, we will expand upon our previous findings to determine if AgRP cells can
sense and modulate both hyperactivity and feeding during ABA. Through in vivo fiber photometry and
optogenetics, we monitor and manipulate AgRP populations, respectively, in ABA and control mice while they
are freely behaving on the behavioral paradigm. In Aim 2, we will unravel the circuits involved in AgRP-mediated
bodyweight gain in ABA mice using projection-defined chemogenetics. By defining and characterizing the cellular
and circuit functions of AgRP neurons in female ABA mice, our research endeavors hold the potential to identify
a therapeutic target for the re-prioritization of feeding over exercise in AN. Ultimately, our findings have the
potential to alleviate the chronic disability associated with AN, leading to improved survival and enhanced quality
of life for individuals affected by this severe disorder."
10869494,"Project summary description
 In cystic fibrosis (CF), lung damage is responsible for the majority of disease morbidity and
mortality. While CF lungs host polymicrobial infections, lung disease has only been linked to a few
bacterial pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is the most prevalent infectious agent
in the respiratory tract of CF patients. Neutrophil granulocytes represent the most powerful component
of the healthy immune system to kill S. aureus. In CF, though, neutrophils fail to eliminate this bacterium
despite their robust recruitment to the airways. It remains largely unknown why neutrophils in CF cannot
eliminate S. aureus. Our published results show that the CF airway environment reduces the ability of
human neutrophils to kill CF isolates of S. aureus. In contrast, the CF sputum does not affect S. aureus
phagocytosis by neutrophils, extrusion of neutrophil extracellular traps or neutrophil viability. Our
additional data demonstrate that CF blood neutrophils are not impaired in their abilities to kill S. aureus
in vitro but the CF sputum also reduces their bactericidal activities against this bacterium. Our long-term
goal is to identify why CF patients are unable to clear S. aureus from their airways. Our goal in this
proposal is to determine which components of the CF sputum are responsible for its inhibitory action on
neutrophils’ S. aureus killing. The rationale of the proposed work is that a deeper understanding of S.
aureus pathogenesis in CF will aid to develop new, anti-staphylococcal intervention strategies for CF in
the near future. Our central hypothesis is that a concerted action of IgG immune complexes and
exosomes present in the CF sputum mediate the inhibitory action of CF sputum on S. aureus killing by
neutrophils. Our proposed work will be expected to determine the exact component(s) of the CF sputum
that compromise(s) the ability of neutrophils to kill S. aureus. This knowledge is essential for our better
understanding of airway inflammation, host-pathogen interactions and S. aureus pathogenesis in CF. In
addition, this exploratory work will open future studies focusing on the exact mechanism of how the CF
sputum components identified here impair neutrophil functions and on exploring new, neutrophil-targeting
therapies for CF."

The Department of Medical Physics controls three different particle accelerator laboratories equipped with a
variety of irradiation, radiochemistry, and radioanalytical equipment that will be used to investigate the symbiotic
effects of targeted radiotherapy (TRT) and the immunological methodologies of Projects 1-4. The Cyclotron
Laboratories’ principle site in the Wisconsin Institutes of Medical Research (WIMR) hosts a General Electric
PETtrace 16-MeV proton / 8-MeV deuteron cyclotron surrounded by 4000 square feet of laboratory space used
for radiochemical and accelerator research, as well as the routine production and international distribution of
numerous radionuclides to a global customer base. The cyclotron laboratory infrastructure accommodates tens
of Ci-quantities of radioactivity in automated processes using homemade and commercial equipment and is
internationally established as a leader in solid, liquid, and gas phase accelerator targetry, primarily for positron-
emission tomography (PET) radionuclide production. Spectroscopic/spectrometric analysis is accomplished with
multiple high purity germanium detectors and a variety of configurable electronic equipment. Most recently, our
research into alloy targetry for small, medical accelerators has enabled us to increase production of several
radionuclides of interest to previously unprecedented levels. This laboratory currently produces 89Zr, 76/77Br, 86Y,
52gMn and more than two dozen other radionuclides on a weekly basis for local use and shipment to over 60
collaborators, colleagues, pharmaceutical companies, and globally premier research institutions in the US and
abroad. The laboratory also hosts biosafety cabinets inside radiation areas for in vitro study of the unique
radionuclides we produce, adjacent to the laboratory space of the Small Animal Imaging Core. Finally, the
Department of Radiology recently finished construction of a GMP Radiopharmacy lab. The Radiopharmaceutical
Production Facility (RPF) is situated within the WIMR complex across the hall from the cyclotron facility. It houses
a new manufacturing area designed for the production of cGMP radiopharmaceuticals. This area is equipped
with multiple hot cells and synthesis modules and includes multiple quality control instruments to accommodate
segregation of clinical and preclinical production activities. A dispensing area designed in compliance with USP
<797> has the capability to compound and distribute radiopharmaceuticals. Although clinical trials are not the
aim of the PO1, we have the ability to rapidly translate the treatment paradigms discovered and developed within
the PO1 to the clinical trial stage. The specific aim of the Radionuclide Production and Radiochemistry Core
(RPRC) is to directly produce and supply pure imaging and therapy radionuclides and radiochemically synthesize
all imaging/therapy/immunomodulatory doses of radiopharmaceuticals for use in the four PO1 Projects. This
core will also be responsible for obtaining adequate amounts of alpha- and beta-emitting isotopes like Ac-225,
Y-90 and Lu-177 from external commercial sources and/or the Oak Ridge National Laboratory."
10873226,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The Advanced Imaging and Dosimetry Core (AIDC) provides the infrastructure, resources, and expertise
required to facilitate quantitative multiscale imaging and dosimetry calculations, which are required to optimally
synergize the combination of molecular targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) and immunotherapy (ImmRx). The
AIDC is a centralized dosimetry service that will ensure consistent scientific rigor and dosimetry reporting across
each of the Projects of this PO1 proposal, entitled “Molecular targeted radionuclide therapy for tumor
immunomodulation and enhancing immunotherapy response”. Furthermore, the significance of centralizing this
process for each Project is the tremendous gain in efficiency that are achieved, ultimately saving individual
investigators time and effort. Additionally, the AIDC will expand the leadership and operation of the Small Animal
Imaging and Radiotherapy Facility (SAIRF) by offering support in all stages of the imaging and TRT dosimetry
process, including calibration, experimental design, image acquisition optimization, pharmacokinetic profiling
and modeling, micro-and macroscopic 3D dose calculations, and treatment response assessment. The
AIDC will emphasize quality assurance and quality control in all aspects of the imaging and dosimetry process
so that results are validated for application to the FDA. The AIDC will collaborate closely with the Radionuclide
Production and Radiochemistry Core (RPRC) for dose calibration and traceability of the radiopharmaceuticals;
and, the AIDC will collaborate with the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC) to help interpret imaging and
dosimetry findings to validate response assessment. Lastly, the AIDC will help investigators disseminate their
findings to the scientific community through publications and conference presentations. Renowned experts in
the field of TRT dosimetry, Professor Bryan Bednarz and Joseph Grudzinski, will lead administrative and
technical efforts, respectively."
10873227,"PROJECT SUMMARY – BIOSTATISTICS AND BIOINFORMATICS CORE 3
The overarching goal of the P01 application “Molecular Targeted Radionuclide Therapy for Tumor
Immunomodulation and Enhancing Immunotherapy Response” is to develop a broad mechanistic understanding
of the immunomodulatory capacity of molecular targeted radionuclide therapy as part of the next generation of
immunotherapy approaches to improve the treatment of immunologically “hot” and “cold” tumors. The
overarching goal of the Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core (BBC) is to promote excellence in pre-clinical
translation research proposed in this P01 application by providing dedicated and outstanding consultation and
collaborative support and expertise in biostatistics, bioinformatics and research data management for the P01
Projects 1-4, Administrative Core, Core 1 (Radionuclide Production and Radiochemistry Core), and Core 2
(Advanced Imaging and Dosimetry Core), and as needed.
The biostatistics component will provide support for all four projects and two cores. The biostatistics team draws
its strength from biostatistics faculty with many years of collaboration with the P01 investigators. Biostatistics
support for Project 1 and Core 2 (Advanced Imaging and Dosimetry Core) will be descriptive and exploratory in
nature and involve statistical modeling and estimation in dosimetry studies. Biostatistics support for Projects 2-
4 will involve statistical modeling and inference and will be comparative in nature.
The bioinformatics component proposes to provide support for Projects 2-4. The bioinformatics team draws its
strength from bioinformatics faculty who have active collaboration with the P01 investigators. More specifically,
it will provide bioinformatics support and analysis expertise with 1) T cell receptor sequence data, 2) RNAseq
data from selective tumors of mice that show curative eradication of tumors in comparison with control tumors
and to tumors receiving sub-optimal therapy resulting in escape of immunotherapy, and 3) single cell RNAseq
data.
In supporting the Administrative Core and the P01 overall, the BBC will develop a P01-wide database using a
relational database management system that will serve as the database of record for all projects and cores for
this P01. The BBC will provide support in research data management using this database, which will hold all
data generated from the Projects and Cores of the P01 and serve as the central data hub upon which all
biostatistics and bioinformatics analyses will be based."
10873312,"ADMINISTRATIVE CORE: SUMMARY
 The Administrative Core (AC) supports work in all of the Population Studies Center’s (PSC) primary
research areas (PRAs) and advances the overarching objective of this P2C application - to support research to
design, create, and analyze new data to advance population science. The AC oversees and coordinates
activities and resources across all three Cores and maximizes the efficiency of funding for population dynamics
research by reducing administrative burdens. We will continue to focus particularly on the needs of junior
scientists, and newly on enhancing the broader research community’s access to these resources. The AC
Lead and the P2C Steering Committee carry out their duties with the assistance of senior administrative staff
and shared services via the Institute for Social Research (ISR). They are responsible for planning,
coordinating, and evaluating the activities of the Cores and the pursuit of Overall and Core-specific Aims. They
review and recruit Center affiliates, oversee budgetary and resource distribution decisions to increase
synergies across Cores, and assess the activities of all Cores. AC activities are designed to enhance scientific
impact and innovation, including faculty meetings, coffee hours, and a Brown Bag Series. We will also pursue
two new activities, if funded, to more effectively support the careers of junior scientists: regular check-in chats
with groups of junior PSC researchers and the AC Lead, and junior affiliate wraparound strategy sessions held
by the P2C Steering Committee. We also propose to add additional opportunities for all affiliates to convene
and collaborate, with new Specific Aims Clinics and Research Incubator Groups organized around our PRAs.
The AC also provides comprehensive research project management. Services centrally provided by the AC
staff minimize the financial and time burdens associated with administering research projects by providing
comprehensive support through the project lifecycle, including assistance with grant proposal preparation,
managing awarded funding, hiring and managing project staff, and connecting affiliates with ways to
disseminate their findings. AC staff maximize the efficiency of service provision by assisting PSC affiliates in
accessing a range of essential services provided elsewhere at ISR and U-M. In a new initiative, the AC will
coordinate outreach services to engage population scientists at institutions that are not funded by the NICHD
Population Dynamics P2C Program. The Steering Committee and staff will work to ensure that research
community members obtain access to services across all three Cores as appropriate. In the absence of the
AC, our productive PSC affiliates would need to devote large amounts of time to administrative tasks and to
seeking out resources across the Administrative, Development and Scientific and Technical Cores, reducing
productivity and limiting their contributions to population dynamics research."
10873314,"DEVELOPMENT CORE: SUMMARY
 In the Development Core (DC), our main objectives are to engage and support early-career population
scientists and launch innovative research projects by interdisciplinary teams. The services of the Core will
maximize the scientific impact of our affiliates by catalyzing the design, creation, and analysis of new data to
advance population science, increasing all Population Studies Center (PSC) scientists’ productivity, innovation,
and competitiveness for external funding. The Core’s activities will harness the significant resources available
at our Center, the Institute for Social Research (ISR), and the University of Michigan (U-M) to enhance the
reach of P2C funding. We will continue to offer activities tested over the past funding period: (1) pilot small
grants; (2) intensive mentoring; and (3) experienced peer review. Careful assessment have led us to propose
several important changes and additions for the next five years.
 First, we propose a new leadership structure that eliminates Associate Directors in favor of a five faculty
member Scientific Advisory Committee (DC-SAC) representing our strengths in innovative, large-scale
surveys; cutting-edge data science work using “organic” data from administrative records and other sources;
and pioneering work with experimental designs and interventions, along with special expertise in the study of
population health disparities and population genetics.
 Second, we will add: (1) an ongoing program of DC consulting services, with initial consultation and “triage”
from the DC lead and research administrator, and follow through from appropriate scientists on our DC-SAC,
the STC, or the AC; (2) an annual series of DC workshops to demystify NIH proposal components and the
application process; (3) a new plan for ongoing access to senior peer review of draft proposals; and (4) a more
structured use of key data collection projects in each PRA to provide examples and learning opportunities to
our new investigators and to maintain a strong connection between existing projects in each PRA and
innovative plans for new projects by affiliates. All of these resources and services will prioritize junior scientists.
 Third, we will begin to make DC resources available to population scientists at institutions that are not
funded by the NICHD Population Dynamics P2C Program. To outreach to early career scientists interested in
pursuing population dynamics research, we will harness ISR’s networks of non-U-M scientists connected
through: (1) multi-institution data creation projects; (2) ISR Summer Institute instructional programs; and (3) our
family of R25 educational programs. These coordinated, intensive resources for U-M affiliates and those at
institutions without PDB infrastructure funding would not be available in the absence of continued P2C funding."
10873316,"SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL CORE: SUMMARY
 The objective of the Scientific and Technical Core (STC) is to advance the overarching objective of this
P2C proposal - to design, create, and use new data to advance population science - by enhancing methods
used for all three activities, and by providing technical support and guidance for computing. The STC will
provide support across a range of activities to both junior and established affiliates of the Population Studies
Center (PSC) at the University of Michigan (U-M), and to researchers from other institutions, enhancing their
productivity, increasing the scientific impact of their work, and facilitating innovative, collaborative population
science. The STC will provide enhanced, individualized STC consulting that advises on data management and
analysis problems, while also providing access to state-of-the art methodological tools. If more extensive
project assistance is needed, STC staff data scientists and statisticians can also provide paid research support
for those with external funding, subsidizing a portion of their salary and effectively leveraging P2C funds that
support only a portion of their time. We will expand this popular STC consulting service by establishing a six-
member Scientific Advisory Committee (STC-SAC) of experts in new sources of population data and advanced
statistical and data science techniques. STC consulting and the STC-SAC will also link PSC affiliates with
other major methodological programs at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) that will enhance the innovation
of the methodological and substantive contributions affiliates make to PSC’s Primary Research Areas (PRAs).
The STC will consult on improving and fielding innovative and large-scale surveys, analyzing big data and
complex sample survey data; linking administrative and organic data; designing and implementing
experimental and quasi-experimental studies; collecting and analyzing biosocial and genetic data; designing
adaptive interventions for improving population health; collecting and analyzing qualitative and ethnographic
data; and working with restricted data. The STC will also guide and support access to university-level high-
performance computing resources and restricted data enclaves. The STC will continue to organize hands-on
workshops instructed by internal and external experts on state-of-the-art methods topics. These workshops
and their archived materials will be available to researchers at U-M and beyond. Finally, the STC will continue
to provide small grant support for PSC affiliates to develop and implement new research methods, and funding
for junior scientists to obtain necessary storage and computing resources. These methodology-related
activities form the backbone of our approach to increasing the scientific innovation and impact of PSC affiliates’
research and the success of affiliates’ grant proposals. These shared resources could not be efficiently
supported by any single affiliate and will additionally be a public good for researchers beyond U-M."
10879116,"Project Summary-Cell Biology Core
The OVERALL aims of this Vision Research Core (VRC) are to provide:
• access to resources outside the scope of individual R01 awards
• access to technical expertise outside the scope a single laboratory
• staff training to remove barriers to efficient translational research and collaboration
• collaboration initiatives among VRC labs
The research areas supported by the VRC span the analysis and treatments of retinal degenerations,
developmental disorders, glaucoma and other disorders, as well as a range of cutting-edge basic science
initiatives. We have implemented four resource modules that continue the natural evolution of how this
research group works together, serving 17 investigators holding 22 NEI R01 awards.
The Cell Biology Module derives from the strengths in mouse genetics at the Moran Eye Center and the high
demand for tissue culture and profiling. Almost every JMEC laboratory has need of high quality resources for
cryosectioning, paratoming, genotyping, immunocytochemistry, quantitative PCR (qPCR), cell culturing, and
mouse colony preservation. Some JMEC laboratories will have future need for induced pluripotent stem cell
(iPSC) generation and retinal organoid differentiation.
Specifically the Cell Biology module provides:
 • High-quality cryotomy resources through two professionally maintained Leica CM3050S systems
 • Paraffin embedding and section services via a Leica Paratome

Prion disease is an incurable and uniformly fatal neurodegenerative disease of humans and other mammals.
PrP lowering is a pharmacologically validated therapeutic strategy for prion disease, and antisense
oligonucleotides (ASOs) with this mechanism of action are currently advancing toward the clinic. The promise
of this progress, and indeed our ability to advance any therapy for prion disease, will critically depend on our
capacity to leverage molecular biomarkers as windows into the brain. To date the molecular states of the brain
during lifelong genetic risk prior to disease, first prion formation, and early phases of prion replication all remain
elusive, and yet, it is precisely these upstream disease stages that have shown themselves most amenable to
PrP-lowering intervention. To become a clinical reality, early treatment paradigms will require biomarkers to
report on drug safety and efficacy but also the earliest molecular stages of risk and disease; critical decisions
about trial eligibility, timing of treatment, and advancement or termination of whole experimental drug programs
will rest on our ability to accurately interpret and mechanistically contextualize these molecular readouts. The
goal of the present proposal is to discover and illuminate biomarkers across three key categories. 1) Markers
of PrP misfolding. Using CSF and plasma samples from healthy at-risk humans and from prion-infected rats
and hamsters at pre-symptomatic stages, we will track the earliest molecular changes resulting from prion
replication. We will characterize new markers as well as determine the temporal sequence and prognostic
value of existing markers. 2) Markers of PrP mutation. In a mouse model of a common human prion disease
mutation, we will dissect the mechanism by which a pathogenic missense variant results in under-expression
of not only mutant PrP but also wild-type PrP and other bystander proteins. We will determine whether
resulting changes will confound other biomarker readouts, and whether the under-expression reflects a host
protective mechanism or a harmful pathological consequence of PrP mutation. 3) Markers of PrP deficiency.
Leveraging new PrP knockout rats and hamsters as well as PrP knockout mice, we will perform experiments to
gain a mechanistic understanding of the molecular changes resulting from PrP’s reduction or absence. Taken
together, these studies will on one hand illuminate core mechanisms of prion biology, from the early
consequences of PrP mutation and misfolding to the native function of PrP. On the other hand, these studies
will facilitate informed clinical development of PrP-lowering therapies by allowing biomarkers to be correctly
interpreted so that harmful therapies are halted while promising therapies are advanced."
10876814,"Project Summary
Transgender, Non-Binary, and Gender Diverse (TGD) communities have been historically marginalized in the
United States and experience poor quality of care and significant health disparities in the setting of multiple
barriers to accessing quality, affordable medical care for routine and gender affirming health care. Inadequate
provider training leads TGD individuals to avoid care due to fear of mistreatment. Until we effectively expand
the primary care workforce competent to care for TGD individuals, these disparities will continue.
The goals of this educational program are to increase resident comfort and preparedness in caring for TGD
patients, increase resident exposure to TGD patients, increase the number of residents who intend to provide
Gender Affirming Healthcare (GAHC) after residency graduation, and increase the number of residency
graduates providing GAHC, thereby improving the primary care experience for TGD patients and increasing
the workforce competent to provide welcoming, affirming, and supportive care to TGD populations.
We propose to create a comprehensive, longitudinal, systematically implemented, and reproducible didactic
and clinical curriculum for family medicine and other primary care residents addressing the unique healthcare
needs of TGD people across the lifespan that leverages both didactic and clinical education to create long-
lasting gains in knowledge, comfort, and desire to provide GAHC to TGD communities. We will disseminate
this curriculum for other primary care residency programs to adapt and implement. Residents will be involved
in the curriculum development, and we will conduct annual resident surveys and evaluations to create a
curriculum that is effective and responsive to their educational needs. Importantly, the clinical component of the
curriculum will address the lack of adequate resident exposure to high-quality TGD patient care by providing a
blueprint for assessing and improving clinical care for TGD patients within a residency teaching clinic and
creating lasting partnerships with local GAHC programs for additional elective rotations. An Advisory
Committee composed of patients and clinical experts will guide the development of the curriculum to ensure
that it is responsive to the needs of the local TGD community.
The paradigm of the curriculum will focus on partnering with TGD people to holistically address their social,
mental, and medical health needs and well-being while respectfully affirming their gender identity. This entails
patient-centered, trauma-informed preventive care and chronic disease management, in addition to gender-
affirming interventions. This curriculum has the potential to improve care for people of all genders by
challenging many of the binary assumptions inherent in healthcare. The application of the knowledge gained
through learner participation in the curriculum will enhance the healthcare experiences of TGD people by
expanding the workforce of competent GAHC providers, thereby improving physical and mental health and
reducing health disparities within this marginalized community."
10881738,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 Non-Hispanic Black infants have twice the rates of low birthweight births as non-Hispanic White infants. As
disparities in adverse birth outcomes drive disparities in infant mortality and adverse outcomes across the life
course, improving inequities in birth outcomes is a national priority. Despite this longstanding inequity, many
public and private payers are unable to address disparities in adverse infant outcomes because of a lack of
race/ethnicity data. This K01 fills a critical need for evidence-based recommendations for collection and use of
racial/ethnic data among payers to enable population health management programs to develop predictive
algorithms that could be used to reduce adverse birth outcomes. Failure to include race/ethnicity in predictive
models used for resource allocation may ultimately lead to biased algorithms that exacerbate health disparities.
 Aim 1 of this study will use an algorithmic fairness framework to test multiple algorithms for developing
predictive models for low birthweight birth. In addition to testing model accuracy, predictive models will be
tested for seven measures of algorithmic fairness to assess whether having race/ethnicity improves algorithmic
fairness (e.g., equal [or better] predictive accuracy for non-White relative to White women) after applying four
fairness-enhancing approaches. This project will utilize medical claims, birth certificates, and beneficiary
information from the Arkansas All Payer Claims Database. Linkage to the birth certificates uniquely allows this
study to have race/ethnicity, which are absent in the commercial claims given lack of collection by most payers.
 The seminal Institute of Medicine Report Unequal Treatment recommended collection of race/ethnicity to
mitigate disparities in health and healthcare delivery; however, it is well known that payers fear accusations of
redlining and rarely collect race/ethnicity in most states. Research on payer and provider views regarding
collection of race/ethnicity has been conducted, but similar research on the views of minority beneficiaries are
severely lacking. Aim 2 of this study will conduct racially-homogenous focus groups among Black, Hispanic,
and Marshallese women in Arkansas regarding attitudes on acceptability of collecting and using race/ethnicity
data as well as administrative aspects (e.g., when to collect the data), with an emphasis on perinatal programs.
 These aims will provide an evidence-base and serve as a national model for collecting and using
racial/ethnic data with community input. Large third-party payers have the infrastructure to improve health
disparities, but lack a community-engaged approach to inform collection and use of these data to guide
development of algorithms using an equitable framework. The K01 will allow the investigator to build on her
expertise in insurance claims analysis to acquire skillsets in predictive modeling, community engagement, and
qualitative methodologies. These important skillsets will allow the researcher to achieve her long-term goals of
becoming a productive and independent researcher with a focus on identifying and mitigating factors that serve
as drivers of racial/ethnic disparities in adverse infant and maternal outcomes."
10878052,"In our daily lives, we explore and learn about the world around us through body movement. For
instance, to find your keys in your bag, you use your fingers to touch each object in turn. When navigating a
slippery environment, you coordinate your arms and legs to maintain your balance. These are natural,
everyday examples of how movement is coordinated over the body, sequenced over time, and aligned with
sensory input, but the way we typically study body movement and learning in the lab is quite different.
 Neuroscientists including ourselves have long relied on restraining the subject, to make it easier to
position recording technology around the head and to suppress task-irrelevant movement. For instance, mice
are commonly head-fixed during sensory tasks, which has advanced our understanding of how specific brain
regions perform specific functions. However, a more integrative and naturalistic approach is needed to
understand how multiple brain areas work together to coordinate complex and whole-body behavior.
 Thus, in this planning project, we will integrate existing technologies for detailed measurement of brain
and behavior in mice while minimally impacting free movement. Specifically, we will implement 3D tracking of
body posture (Aim 1), wireless multi-area neural recording (Aim 2), and wireless optogenetics (Aim 3). We will
study the large-scale dynamics of populations of individually identified neurons, defined by cell type and
projection pattern, at millisecond scale. We will use our machine learning tools to understand neural dynamics
in our new freely-moving behavioral paradigms that probe sensorimotor integration and whole-body
coordination in complex 3D environments. Specifically, we will measure the neural signals exchanged between
motor cortex and other brain regions during free behavior. Previous work has shown that movement signals
are widespread in the brain; our hypothesis is that movement signals are specifically routed where needed for
each behavior. Completing this R34 will enable two future TargetedBCP R01s. One will study how motor and
auditory cortex exchange sensorimotor signals for active sensing of sound, and another will study how left and
right motor cortex coordinate movement of both sides of the body in 3D.
 Our investigative team has the experience to complete this project. The PI (Rodgers) has expertise in
neuroengineering, systems neuroscience, animal behavior, electrophysiology, computational analysis, and
optogenetics. Dr Berman (Co-I) brings theoretical expertise on identifying the statistical structure of animal
behavior. We provide letters of support from experts in 3D tracking, motor cortex, wireless neurotechnology,
and cell type-specific manipulation. Our research team includes diverse perspectives that allow us to innovate
and to provide an inclusive training environment. In sum, this planning project will launch a new
experimental/theoretical collaboration and integrate the tools we need to study the fundamental question of
how the brain controls free behavior in 3D."
10878089,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Orofacial clefting is the most common birth defect in the United States and the leading cause of velopharyngeal
insufficiency, the inability to close the velopharynx by separating the oral and nasal cavities while speaking.
Adequate velopharyngeal closure is essential for intelligible speech production; it has been suggested that
children with repaired cleft palate acquire velopharyngeal closure and oral stop consonants later than typically
developing peers, and thus are not able to produce intelligible speech during a critical time in speech and
language development. Despite typical surgical reconstruction of the palate by 12 months of age, an estimated
84% of children with cleft palate will require speech therapy and nearly 40% will need additional surgical
management to facilitate adequate velopharyngeal closure. Although literature has demonstrated that specific
anatomical variables consistently result in velopharyngeal insufficiency, variability and genuine uncertainty exist
regarding early treatment decisions for this population, resulting in umbrella protocols for surgical timing and
speech monitoring. The proposed research aims to address this need by identifying which pre-operative
dimensions are predictive of surgical selection in infants with cleft palate and by comparing post-surgical
anatomical dimensions with speech production skills. The proposed study will enroll 30 infants prior to their
palate repair at 10 months and follow them until 16 months of age. Non-sedated magnetic resonance imaging of
the velopharynx will be completed at both time points (pre- and post-palate repair), and a home-based speech
recording will accompany the 16-month scan. Additional demographic, hearing, development, and speech and
language data will be obtained at both timepoints to help explain any variability not accounted for by age or
surgical type. Specific Aim I will establish which pre-surgical anatomical features are predictive of surgical
procedure selection based on perceptual assessment of intraoperative tension for palate repair. We hypothesize
that pre-operative cleft width and levator veli palatini muscle length are predictive of surgical procedure selection
based on intraoperative tension of palatal tissue. Specific Aim II will determine which post-surgical anatomical
features are associated with the greatest diversity in oral stop consonant production at 16 months in children
with repaired cleft palate. We hypothesize that a longer velum, greater effective velopharyngeal ratio, and
continuity of the levator veli palatini muscle are associated with greater diversity of oral stop consonants by 16
months, but not with surgical procedure type. The proposed research will provide information that has the
potential to shift the current clinical paradigm, allowing for informed surgical selection based on patient-specific
anatomy and early identification of velopharyngeal insufficiency within a critical window for typical speech
development. In addition, this research has important implications for improving our theoretical understanding of
anatomical and physiological factors that directly contribute to surgical success within this population and could
be leveraged to individualize treatment techniques and optimize speech outcomes for children with cleft palate."
10890837,"The goal of the proposed project is to understand rural-urban disparities in cognitive aging and how the social environment influences development of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD) in later life. We propose to gather two waves of surveys and ecological momentary assessments to characterize the mechanisms underlying relationships between personal social networks, face-to-face interactions, activity spaces, and cognitive symptoms of ADRD in older adults living in urban and rural areas. Rates of ADRD are disproportionately high among older adults in rural areas compared to those in urban areas. A critical point of intervention is the social environment, which has the potential to reduce these geographic disparities by offering opportunities for cognitive stimulation. For instance, stimulating social interactions and activities (e.g., number of network friends, frequency of social contact, and participation in social events) have been identified as promising avenues for interventions to develop resilience against ADRD. However, the existing literature relies on limited and unidimensional measures of the social environment. We adopt a multi-method approach to identify which aspects of the social environment best explain rural-urban cognitive aging disparities. Our specific aims are as follows: Aim 1 is characterize the daily social interactions and activities of older adults in rural and urban areas. Aim 2 is to assess how a combination of personal networks, social interactions, and activity spaces either mediate or moderate the relationship between geographic residence and aging-related cognitive impairments linked to ADRD. Aim 3 is to explore longitudinal relationships between changes in the social environment and aging-related cognitive impairments among rural and urban older adults. By combining leading-edge methods from the social sciences—including social network analysis and ecological momentary assessments—this project seeks to identify novel targets for assessment and intervention to reduce the burden of cognitive aging on individuals, families, and the health care system across rural and urban areas. This knowledge is critical for identifying effective social intervention targets for reducing risk of ADRD in rural and urban areas."
10890889,"Abstract
The `central dogma' of molecular biology is that in cells, the functions of proteins and nucleic acids are primarily
determined by their sequence. However, this dogma has been challenged by studies of secreted molecules
including the membrane encased extracellular vesicles (EVs) and the membraneless structures known as BMCs,
which indicate that cells create discrete chemical environments where they organize complex biomolecules.
BMCs form in many compartments of the body, including the nucleus (nucleolus, centrosome, Cajal body, stress
granules), the cytoplasm (P-bodies, stress granules), and even the neuronal cytoplasm (neuronal transport
granules). While the details of BMC biology is still evolving, it is known that RNA and proteins with intrinsically
disordered regions (IDRs) are key factors that influence intracellular composition, size, and morphology of BMCs.
The size and composition of BMCs are also thought to be different. BMCs participate in the regulation of various
physiological processes, such as modulation of host transcription and stress response. BMCs also play important
roles in pathophysiological conditions, including cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral pathogenesis,
including modulation of HIV replication. Indeed, it is known that HIV infection results in peripheral and neuro
inflammation, and that chronic exposure to THC in the context of HIV in humans or SIV infection in rhesus
macaques results in amelioration of disease or symptoms. However, the regulators of HIV disease and THC
response is not completely understood. Despite the reported role of BMCs in various conditions, whether or not
BMCs regulate the pathogenesis of HIV infection and the intersection of HIV and THC use is unknown. It is also
unknown whether BMCs assemble in vivo, where they may play relevant biological roles. There is paucity of
information on the presence of BMCs in body fluids (in vivo) and their role in HIV pathogenesis. The reason for
this scarcity of information is partly due to lack of tools for isolation of BMCs from body fluids. In preliminary
studies, we developed a novel size-guided Particle Purification Liquid Chromatography (PPLC). We used PPLC
to isolate and retrieve dye-free BMCs from human semen, rhesus macaque blood plasma and cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF). Using standard electron microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray equipped transmission electron
microscope (TEM-EDX) analyses, we obtained structural and elemental information of the BMCs. Proteomics
analysis and RNA bioanalyzer study were used to show that the BMCs contain protein and RNA, while cell
biology assay indicate that BMCs are cytotoxic to cells. These data provide compelling evidence that bioactive
BMCs are present in vivo. Thus, in this proposal, we will use PPLC to isolate BMCs from rhesus macaque blood,
CSF, saliva, and intestinal contents. We will then use various structural, biochemical, and cell biology assays to
provide structural, molecular, and functional classification of BMCs from SIV infected and THC treated
macaques, which will provide a framework to dissect BMC functions in HIV/AIDS and THC use."
10888544,"Project Summary:
While elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor for glaucoma, up to
one third of patients have glaucoma at normal IOPs and patients with ocular hypertension may
have high IOP for years without any detectable glaucoma damage. This is in part because, in
biomechanical terms, the IOP describes the applied force or stress applied to the ocular tissues
but not the effect of the applied force, the deformation or strain. Differences in intrinsic
biomechanical properties of collagenous ocular tissues may explain the difference in response
to the stress of IOP. While prior work has shown some differences in the corneal biomechanical
properties between glaucoma subjects and controls, the widespread adoption of corneal
biomechanics as glaucoma biomarkers has been hampered by the limitations of current
technologies. Specifically, the currently used modalities rely on mechanical perturbations of the
cornea which give variable results that are confounded by IOP. The rationale underlying this
proposal is that Brillouin microscopy, a highly precise, IOP-independent, and more direct
method for determining corneal biomechanics, will improve our understanding of glaucoma
biomechanics and that its use will result in robust biomarkers for the disease. In Specific Aim 1,
we will compare the Brillouin corneal modulus in a cross-sectional study of primary open angle
glaucoma (POAG) patients and age-matched controls. We hypothesize that the Brillouin
corneal modulus will be significantly lower in eyes with POAG, indicating a cornea that is less
stiff. In Specific Aim 2 we will conduct a longitudinal study to assess the effect of short-term use
of topical prostaglandin analogs (PGA) on the corneal modulus in POAG patients and controls.
We expect that PGA use will result in a reduced corneal modulus (i.e. a decrease in corneal
stiffness), which has important implications in terms of assessing the IOP targets and treatment
success after use of PGAs. We plan to use the results of this study as preliminary data for a
larger, longer-term, and more comprehensive study to establish corneal biomechanics as robust
biomarkers for the disease."
10888548,"PROJECT SUMMARY: This R21 project will develop new classes of synthetic liquid-infused porous surfaces
(or `SLIPS') that address challenges related to bacterial fouling and virulence in clinical and healthcare
settings. Our objectives will be accomplished by the pursuit of two focused and synergistic Aims: (1) to explore
designs of novel drug-patterned `proto-SLIPS' that can release potent and highly water-soluble antibiotics and
thereby reduce biofouling and bacterial load, and (2) to explore new designs of `proto-SLIPS' that release
synthetic anti-virulence agents that can block bacterial communication and attenuate virulent behaviors.
 Colonization and fouling of surfaces by bacteria pose persistent and costly threats to human health. These
problems are urgent, and the potential societal and economic impacts of robust methods to prevent bacterial
fouling and virulence are nearly impossible to overstate. Many strategies have been used to design materials
that resist bacterial fouling, but all of them ultimately fail when deployed in real-world scenarios. Fundamentally
new approaches to the design of antifouling or `anti-virulence' surfaces that move beyond conventional design
strategies are desperately needed and would have substantial impacts on human health and well-being.
 One promising approach to prevent bacterial fouling is to exploit the inherent anti-biofouling properties of
polymer-based SLIPS coatings. These liquid-infused coatings have enormous potential in healthcare settings,
but are generally passive materials—i.e., they can strongly repel bacteria with which they come into contact,
but cannot reduce microbial load or attenuate the virulent behaviors of organisms in surrounding environments.
This proposal seeks to advance innovative new designs of `drug-eluting' SLIPS that can address this challenge
and enhance inherent anti-biofouling properties by releasing either antimicrobial or anti-virulence agents.
 The proposed work is based on our recent and unexpected discovery that the infusion of hydrophobic oils
into porous polymer coatings patterned with small spots of a potent and highly water-soluble antibiotic leads to
drug-patterned `proto-SLIPS' that can (i) release antibiotic into aqueous environments and, subsequently, (ii)
transform or self-heal into SLIPS coatings that are uniformly slippery and strongly antifouling to pathogenic
bacteria. This approach is unprecedented, conceptually simple, and has potential to lead to innovative polymer
coatings that can both strongly prevent surface biofouling (via inherent slippery character) and reduce bacterial
load or alter bacterial behavior in ways that could advance the application of SLIPS in healthcare contexts
(e.g., to prevent fouling or infection on or around interventional devices). Our cross-disciplinary research plan
seeks to explore these new ideas and test hypotheses to create a foundation for the design of new synthetic
polymer coatings with superior anti-biofouling properties. The proposed studies embody novel questions and
associated levels of risk and reward appropriate for an R21-level study and unite a team of established and
actively collaborating investigators to demonstrate and explore the feasibility of this new approach."

laboratory. Dr. Watso’s research interest is to examine cardiovascular disease prevention and treatment
strategies in clinical populations. CAREER DEVELOPMENT PLAN: Dr. Watso’s training objectives are to: 1)
Master new technical skills, such as “gold-standard” respiratory function assessments and measuring circulating
cardiovascular biomarkers; 2) Establish independent research expertise in human obesity through meetings,
coursework, and workshops; 3) Improve technical writing skills through co-writing grants with his mentors and
UT-Southwestern’s ‘Successfully Obtaining an R’ program; and 4) Refine professional skills through journal club
participation, mentoring trainees, and presenting at regional/national scientific meetings. RESEARCH: Obesity
affects four-in-ten American adults and is associated with hypertension and greater all-cause mortality.
Irrespective of weight loss, aerobic exercise reduces arterial blood pressure (BP) and improves cardiometabolic
health. However, nearly half of adults with obesity do not perform aerobic exercise because of low leisure time
availability and exertional dyspnea secondary to high chest wall mass-related inspiratory muscle dysfunction. In
other clinical populations, emerging data demonstrates time-efficient high-resistance inspiratory muscle strength
training (IMST) reduces BP and improves respiratory muscle function. Therefore, we will determine whether
eight weeks of daily high-resistance IMST reduces BP, improves respiratory muscle function, and concomitantly
reduces exertional dyspnea in a randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled (i.e., very low-resistance IMST)
clinical trial among adults with obesity. ENVIRONMENT: Dr. Watso will train in a world-leading research
environment and receive mentoring from a multidisciplinary team. Internationally-recognized human physiologist
Craig Crandall, PhD, has completed four NHLBI-R01 grants as the principal investigator and mentored >20

10890697,"ABSTRACT
Although many people are familiar with the staggering statistic that up to 30% of Americans suffer from chronic
pain, a less-known fact is that most individuals with chronic pain suffer from more than one comorbid pain
condition. Pain conditions which frequently co-aggregate have come to be known as chronic overlapping pain
conditions (COPCs). Co-aggregation of multiple chronic pain conditions frequently results in negative side
effects in addition to pain, including fatigue, sleep deficits, cognitive impairment, functional impairment, and
mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and even suicidal ideation. Given the complexity of
these side effects and their impact on patient well-being, COPCs have worse health outcomes compared to
patients with a single chronic pain condition. In addition, the majority of individual COPCs such as
temporomandibular joint disorders (TMD), fibromyalgia (FM), and migraines have a higher prevalence in
biological females than in biological males, and their coaggregation is likewise higher in females. Thus, it is
imperative that additional research investigations be undertaken which explores the mechanistic determinants
of COPCs in patients with multiple comorbid conditions, and which critically evaluates the underlying
mechanisms in biological males and females. We have developed methods that use clinical, biological, and
psychological patient variables to group patients with COPCs into distinct patient clusters: (1) an “adaptive”
cluster, which is free of hypersensitivity and psychological distress; (2) a “pain-sensitive” cluster, which has
increased pain sensitivity to pain stimuli, but lacks pain-related comorbidities; and (3) a “global symptoms”
cluster of patients which has increased sensitivity to pain, along with multiple symptoms of depression and
anxiety, and other widespread symptoms. By separating phenotypically distinct COPC patients and analyzing
these cohorts as separate entities individually in males and females, we believe we can better understand
these conditions and create a more personalized approach to patient care, which will ultimately improve our
ability to treat patients with multiple chronic pain conditions. Our overall hypothesis is that patients within each
cluster will exhibit a greater degree of similarity in their cellular and molecular makeup compared to patients in
other clusters, and we can exploit these cluster-related differences to identify biological markers and treatment
approaches that are personalized for each patient group. To test this hypothesis, we will employ proteomic,
transcriptomic, and preclinical screening approaches to ascertain molecular and cellular mediators of pain in
individual patient clusters and in each sex. In doing so, this project will yield new mechanistic insights into the
divergent pathophysiological mechanisms that give rise to pain and its associated comorbidities in males and
females."

10865680,"Project Summary/Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects millions of people each year who recover to widely disparate levels of
independent function. It is not currently possible to reliably predict who will remain functionally dependent on
caregivers. Most patients assessed with existing models are assigned an intermediate likelihood of recovery,
remaining in a prognostic ‘grey area’. Accurate prediction is important, because withdrawal of life sustaining
therapy based on perceived prognosis is the leading cause of death after TBI. Though advances in brain
imaging have enabled precise localization of focal brain injuries, injury location is not incorporated into existing
TBI prognostic models. This is because it is not known whether dependency results from injury to specific brain
structures or networks. This knowledge gap creates ongoing heterogeneity in clinical practice and limits the
development and evaluation of targeted therapeutics. This K23 award addresses this knowledge gap, using
multi-modality neuroimaging to identify brain structures, connections and networks that produce dependency
when disrupted, and testing whether injury location improves prognostication after TBI. The principal
investigator, Dr. Samuel B. Snider, is a Neurocritical Care Neurologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital
(BWH), whose goal is to become a translational neuroscientist using advanced imaging techniques to better
understand recovery mechanisms and predict outcomes after acute brain injuries. Dr. Snider has an
established early career track record in advanced MRI, and in measuring and predicting TBI outcomes. His
preliminary data demonstrate the feasibility of mapping focal traumatic brain injury with CT and MRI at the
scale required for this project. Through novel analysis of three existing datasets and one prospectively
enrolling TBI study at BWH, Dr. Snider will test whether the locations of hemorrhagic contusions on CT scans
(1), axonal injury on diffusion MRI (2a) and functional network disruption on resting state functional MRI (2b)
independently improve the prediction of functional dependency after moderate or severe TBI. Using multiple
sources to create one of the largest TBI imaging datasets ever assembled, this project will generate novel
insights into mechanisms of recovery from brain injury and improve existing prognostic models. The mentored
research and structured training in multi-center data harmonization and analysis, resting-state functional MRI,
and prospective clinical data collection will provide Dr. Snider with the skills, experience and preliminary data
needed to submit an NIH R01 validating the first imaging-based TBI prognostic model. His career development

10865814,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
This proposal describes a five-year mentored physician-scientist training program to define the scope and
functional consequences of mitochondrial genome mutations in skin tissue aging. The mitochondrial genome
(mtDNA) is an extranuclear source of genetic variability that regulates critical cell functions. MtDNA is highly
susceptible to mutagenesis, including the development of large deletion mutations. When a mutation is
present, it can affect all copies, or only a fraction of the copies of mtDNA. This portion is referred to as
heteroplasmy. Increased levels of mtDNA mutation heteroplasmy have been frequently reported in aging
tissue. Despite this potential, the scope and consequences of age-related mtDNA mutations are not well
understood due to difficulties in sequencing mtDNA and a paucity of in vitro models, making it challenging to
use these mutations as a metric of aging or to develop targeted interventions. To address these limitations, I
developed a long-read sequencing method to profile mtDNA and an induced pluripotent cell-based system to
study the impact of high mtDNA mutation heteroplasmy in multiple cell types.
 Aged facial skin contains the highest frequency of mtDNA deletion mutations across tissues profiled
and prior work suggests a link between mtDNA and function of skin keratinocyte progenitor cells. Skin thus
offers an appealing system to begin understanding the breadth and consequences of age-associated mtDNA
mutations. I hypothesize that mtDNA alterations are acquired with aging in a tissue specific pattern and directly
contribute to age-associated functional changes. To test this, I will pursue three study aims 1) Map and
determine the tissue specificity of mtDNA mutations in aged skin, 2) Quantify mtDNA genetic diversity in age-
associated neoplasia, and 3) Determine whether high mtDNA mutation heteroplasmy alters the function of
human iPSC-derived keratinocyte progenitor cells. This work will provide foundational knowledge for the study
of mitochondrial genome mutations in aging. The K08 will support me to develop advanced skills in the
identification acquired genomic variation and the use of pluripotent and progenitor cells in the study of aging in
order to become a pioneering physician scientist studying the biology of aging. Dr. Michael Teitell, a world-
renowned expert in the study of mitochondrial metabolism and highly experienced and successful mentor, will
serve as my primary mentor. Dr. Jonathan Wanagat and Dr. Paul Boutros will offer guidance in the study of
mitochondrial genomic variation, Dr. Thomas Rando will offer guidance in the study of progenitor cell aging and
Dr. Phillip Scumpia will guide work studying cutaneous tissue, all as members of my advisory committee. A
K08 award will enable my carving out a unique, critical niche of multidisciplinary research that blends
mitochondrial genomics and regenerative biology at the launch of my career as an independent investigator."

methods
Abstract:
Despite the power of single-cell RNA-seq, the data presents a multitude of analytical challenges and
researchers continue to struggle with data analysis. The long-term goals of this research program are to
develop robust, efficient, and scalable statistical methods and tools that enable all scientists to obtain accurate
biological inferences. Specifically, we propose to develop interactive data-driven decision-frameworks to guide
researchers through analyses and make informed analytical decisions. We also propose developing methods
that retain interpretability while accommodating complex experimental designs. All of our approaches will be
developed as highly accessible statistical software with interactive visualization and analysis modules available
via webservers. Our proposed methods will result in richer analyses and biological insights, as well as,
improved reproducibility and reliability of scientific results."
10868739,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease in
the world, and currently has no FDA-approved therapies for treatment. While the
pathophysiology of NAFLD is complex, mounting evidence supports a central role for
chronic inflammation in disrupting insulin signaling and normal liver metabolic function.
Our understanding, however, of the transcriptional mechanisms by which inflammation
triggers metabolic dysfunction remains incomplete. Interferon regulatory factors (IRFs)
are transcription factors that have been implicated in nearly all aspect of immune
function. Our laboratory has identified and characterized numerous points of crosstalk
between IRFs and the metabolic effects of overnutrition, including the discovery that
IRF3 controls adipose tissue inflammation and thermogenesis. Here, we show that high
fat diet activates liver IRF3, and that whole body deficiency in IRF3 protects against both
hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. By generating mice carrying a floxed or
constitutively active Irf3 allele, we demonstrate that obesity-induced liver IRF3 activation
operates in a 2-cell model, where hepatocyte IRF3 establishes insulin resistance and
macrophage IRF3 promotes steatosis. We hypothesize that IRF3 sits at a critical
junction between metabolic and inflammatory responses in the liver, and plays a causal
role as a transcriptional regulator in the development of hepatic insulin resistance and
steatosis in NAFLD. The scientific aims of this K08 are to 1) identify how hepatocyte
IRF3 regulates insulin signaling, and 2) to define the precise role of Kupffer cell IRF3 in
promoting steatosis. The long-term goal of these studies is to improve the metabolic
health of patients by manipulating inflammatory pathways and transcriptional programs
in the liver."
10864197,"Background: Tobacco inflicts a tremendous health burden on its users. Veterans use tobacco products at a
higher rate than seen in the US adult population. Nearly 16% of African American Veterans and 11% of
Hispanic Veterans smoke, compared to 12% of White Veterans. Risk of developing tobacco-related disease is
highest for African American Veterans, with higher use of menthol cigarettes than other Veterans increasing
burden. Hispanic Veterans are also at elevated risk for developing tobacco-related disease. However, both
African American and Hispanic Veterans’ use of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment in the Veterans
Health Administration (VHA) is low, despite the 2019 VHA Directive 1056 updated requirements for increasing
access to evidence-based tobacco cessation to Veterans. African American and Hispanic Veterans who use
tobacco report greater readiness to quit and are more motivated to quit than White Veterans. High levels of
motivation, desire to quit, and acceptability of treatment options should result in high levels of treatment
initiation. However, low initiation of treatment may reflect cultural barriers to treatment and the need for tailored
strategies to increase use.
Significance/Impact: The project aims to improve the health of African American and Hispanic Veterans by
addressing health equity and evaluating social determinants of health associated with accessing tobacco
cessation treatment use, combining two important HSR&D research priorities. Increasing the proportion of
African American and Hispanic Veterans that use tobacco cessation treatment in the VHA would greatly
diminish disease burden, prevent mortality, and increase functioning in this underserved population. That, in
turn, would decrease the healthcare burden on VHA, as well as the $2.7 billion dollars spent annually on
tobacco-related care. Lastly, the project aligns with ORD-wide research priorities to expand historically
underrepresented Veterans’ access to quality clinical trials and promotion of equity.
Innovation: Project innovations include: 1) focusing on vulnerable and underrepresented African American
Veteran and Hispanic population, 2) addressing under-researched health equity in tobacco cessation treatment
in VHA, 3) novel use of the population-specific, health communication research methods, and 4) obtaining
input from both Veterans and national stakeholders.
Specific Aims: The project has 3 aims. Aim 1: Identify barriers and facilitators impacting delivery of tobacco
cessation treatment to African American and Hispanic Veterans across facilities within VISN 16. Aim 2:
Develop the Engagement, Navigation, and Transmission Intervention for Cessation Efficiency (ENTICE)
intervention to increase African American and Hispanic Veteran initiation of tobacco cessation treatment. Aim
3: Conduct a pilot trial of ENTICE for African American and Hispanic Veterans at the Houston VAMC.
Methodology: For Aim 1, a mixed-methods evaluation (interviews and VA administrative data) will identify
barriers and facilitators of delivery of tobacco cessation treatment to African American and Hispanic Veterans
across VISN 16. For Aim 2, the Boot Camp Translation process will integrate patient recommendations to
develop two population-specific ENTICE interventions with 8 African American and 8 Hispanic Veterans who
use tobacco and 4 African American and 4 Hispanic community members during a full-day retreat followed by
3, 1–3-hour sessions. For Aim 3, a pilot randomized controlled trial will assess the feasibility and acceptability
of ENTICE compared to Enhanced Usual Care for 32 African American and Hispanic Veterans tobacco users.
Next Steps/Implementation: Strategies and information generated during this project will highlight potential
gaps in care that affect African American and Hispanic Veteran health and overall strength of the VHA system
by addressing under-researched gaps in health equity. Activities in this project will foster the PI’s growth as an
independent VA researcher and allow execution of a line of research that advances health equity in VHA."
10868620,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will investigate mammalian DNA polymerase θ (Pol θ), the defining enzyme for repair of DNA
double-strand breaks by polymerase theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). This is Project 1 (“Cellular
requirements for Pol θ”) which is part of a Program Project titled, “Polymerase theta, genome instability, and
cancer”.
TMEJ mechanism and biological role is not well understood. Importantly, loss of Pol θ is tolerated in normal
cells but is lethal in many cancers, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Unfortunately, the major
knowledge gaps in both the mechanism of action and biological role for Pol θ have undercut the development
of safe, effective targeting strategies.
Project 1 will identify requirements for Pol θ function by leveraging existing specialized cellular assays and a
robust platform for identifying genetic interactions. We will additionally develop new methods to probe the
different roles of Pol θ in cellular repair.
This project aims to fill several major gaps in knowledge:
In Aim 1 “We will identify requirements for cellular TMEJ”. We will use cell lines defective in specific Pol
q activities and other factors linked to TMEJ, and assess the impact of these defects on cellular TMEJ.
In Aim 2 “We will determine cellular contexts that engage TMEJ”. We will assess the extent to which blocks to
late steps in another repair pathway engage TMEJ (2A). We will also employ high throughput sequencing to
investigate the impact of Pol θ loss on genomic scars caused by a chemotherapeutic agent (2B).
In Aim 3 “We will employ a genetic screen to identify new mediators of TMEJ”. We will identify a set of genes in
the same pathway as Pol θ, by finding those genes that when mutated are lethal in a panel of cells defective in
other repair pathways that renders them acutely dependent on TMEJ for survival.
The research work will be highly coordinated within the Program Project with the other three Projects and the
three Cores. Our combined diverse approaches include molecular biology, biochemistry, structural biology, and
biophysics. We will employ mutants and initiate experiments based on results shared with projects 2, 3, and 4,
which will be constantly monitored with feedback via Core A. Protein purification will be supported by Core B,
and cell line construction by Core C."
10868622,"PROJECT SUMMARY
This project will investigate mammalian DNA polymerase θ (Pol θ), the defining enzyme for repair of DNA
double-strand breaks by polymerase theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). This is Project 2 (“Biochemical
reconstitution and inhibition of TMEJ”) which is part of a Program Project titled, “Polymerase theta, genome
instability, and cancer”. Despite the biological importance of TMEJ, we know surprisingly little about its
molecular mechanism and how defects in the process confer specific vulnerabilities in tumors. Pol θ is a large
protein (290 kDa in mammalian cells) with a distinctive arrangement of a DNA polymerase domain, a helicase-
like domain, and a connecting central domain.
 This project aims to fill several major gaps in knowledge: First, we will focus on functional domains in Pol θ
to analyze the mechanism of DNA microhomology selection and end-trimming. Second, we will define core
components that can carry out the TMEJ reaction. Third, we will determine how the genetic background of
cancers influences the response to Pol θ suppression, PARP inhibition, and DNA damage sensitivity.
 In Aim 1 “Structure-activity analysis of Pol θ in TMEJ”, we will determine the permitted and optimal
conditions for end joining, and functional roles of unique Pol θ residues and insertion loops, and candidate
nucleases for end-trimming.
 In Aim 2, “Function of TMEJ components in a reconstituted reaction”, we will investigate the most
biologically relevant DNA ligases roles for PARP and RPA, and we will assess the ability of Pol θ to perform
translesion synthesis during joining of DNA tails with damaged bases.
 In Aim 3, “Targeting the TMEJ pathway”, we will investigate genetic factors that cause vulnerability in Pol θ
defective cells, the influence of PARP inhibitors, and we will begin to explore Pol θ inhibitors. New Pol θ small
molecule inhibitors, a Project 2-3 collaboration, will be investigated as research tools.
 The research work will be highly coordinated within the Program Project with the other three Projects
and the three Cores. Our combined diverse approaches include molecular biology, biochemistry, structural
biology, and biophysics. Substrates, proteins, and experiments will be designed with Projects 1, 3, and 4 and

10868625,"PROJECT SUMMARY
 This project will investigate mammalian DNA polymerase θ, the defining enzyme for repair of DNA
double-strand breaks by polymerase theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). Despite the biological importance of
TMEJ and its relevance to cancer, we know surprisingly little about its molecular mechanisms. Pol θ is a large
protein (290 kDa in mammalian cells) with a distinctive arrangement of a helicase-like domain linked to a DNA
polymerase domain. In addition to the polymerase domain (PolD), Pol θ possesses a helicase-like domain
(HelD) and a connecting central domain (CenD).
 Structural information is essential for analyzing DNA polymerase mechanisms, especially for a large
multi-domain enzyme such as Pol θ. We determined the first crystal structure of the polymerase domain (PolD)
of Pol θ, together with DNA and an incoming nucleotide. The structure revealed unique features, which help
explain some of the properties of the polymerase. We located 5 insertion loops in the polymerase and pseudo-
exonuclease domains. We presented evidence for dimerization of the PolD, which could function during joining
of two DNA molecules.
 This project aims to fill several major gaps in knowledge, needed to help us understand the unique
activities and structure of Pol θ: (1) What role do the “insertion” loops play in mammalian Pol θ (2) What is the
structural basis of helicase-like domain (HelD) function? (3) How does end-trimming occur during
microhomology selection? (4) How do molecules of Pol θ coordinate repair, using specific interfaces? In
addition to gaining a fundamental understanding of the TMEJ mechanism, the research will reveal new
targeting opportunities for Pol θ inhibition in cancer therapy.
 These structural studies will be highly coordinated within the Program Project with the other three
Projects with complementary experimental approaches – single-molecule characterization of molecular
function, activity assays using full-length proteins, and cellular studies of repair. Substrates, proteins, and
experiments will be designed with Projects 1, 2, and 4 and monitored with feedback via Core A. Protein
purification will be supported by Core B, and cell line construction by Core C. Our combined work will provide
unparalleled insight into the TMEJ pathway, and how its mechanism impacts its ability to fulfill its biological
role. These insights will be critical to our understanding of the contribution of this pathway to genome instability
and carcinogenesis, as well as the evaluation of this pathway as a safe and effective target for cancer therapy."

This project will investigate mammalian DNA polymerase θ (Pol θ), the defining enzyme for repair of DNA
double-strand breaks by polymerase theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ). This is Project 4 (“Single-molecule

 This project aims to fill several fundamental gaps in our knowledge of TMEJ, and explore novel hypotheses
by employing an array of innovative biochemical, cellular, and single-molecule techniques and assays to define
the key steps and molecular mechanisms of TMEJ. First, we will focus on the initial elusive steps of TMEJ
including synapsis and DNA microhomology search process, and how it is modulated by other repair factors.
Second, we will define the kinetics and regulation of TMEJ during cellular DSB repair. Third, we will establish
how TMEJ contributes to repair of collapsed replication forks and repair of replication conflicts at secondary
DNA structures.
 In Aim 1 “Mechanism of TMEJ synapsis via biochemically reconstituted system” we will establish the
specific contributions of Pol θ helicase, polymerase and other structural domains for initial strand pairing
activity, micro-homology search, and crosstalk with NHEJ and HR
 In Aim 2, “Interplay of TMEJ with NHEJ at DSB sites in cells”, we will measure the specific modes of
recruitment-exclusion and organization of TMEJ repair intermediates as a function of DDR and canonical DSB
repair, and how they are affected by key repair deficiencies.
 In Aim 3, “TMEJ role(s) in repair of collapsed replication forks”, we will investigate the roles of Pol  in repair
of single-ended DSBs (seDSB) formed at collapsed replication forks and resoltuon of toxic secondary
structures.
 The research work will be highly coordinated within the Program Project with the other three Projects

the cell-based assays performed in Projects 1, 2, and 4 of the Program Project.
 The authentication of mammalian cell line reagents is vital for rigor and reproducibility of laboratory
experiments. By establishing and implementing standardized protocols for cell line validation, efficient genome

a standardized and comprehensive protocol for authentication and characterization of mammalian cell line
models used across the Program Project.
 In Aim 2, “CRISPR-based cell line genome engineering services for the Program Project”, we will provide

Program Project goals. Cas9 protein utilized in this Aim will be provided by Core B.
 In Aim 3, “Controlled and stable expression of transgenes in mammalian cell lines”, we will utilize
doxycycline-inducible and constitutive transposon vectors for the generation of cell lines that express a variety
of mutagenized and/or tagged transgenes of interest.

N-Nitrosamines include some of the most mutagenic chemicals known to humankind, and they are present at
and near Superfund Sites, in drinking water, in food and in drugs. Given their ubiquitous presence and potent
mutagenicity, research focused on N-nitrosamines is critical. What is needed are better ways to predict N-
nitrosamine-induced disease so that intervention strategies can be developed. A key barrier has been the
difficulty of studying long-term low-dose conditions. To overcome this challenge, Project 1 will create ‘canary in
a coal mine’ genetically engineered model (C-GEM) mice. The C-GEM mice will harbor genetic mutations in the
alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (Aag) and the O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (Mgmt), two of the most
important repair activities for NMDA-induced DNA damage. They will also harbor two transgenes for detecting
mutations (to be analyzed in collaboration with Project 2). C-GEM mice will be exposed to environmentally
relevant levels of NDMA, to be determined by Projects 3 and 4, and systems-level data (to be collected with
Project 2) will be merged by the Data Management and Analysis Core (DMAC) to create predictive biomarkers
and to better understand mechanisms of disease. Project 1 will also study a probiotic organism shown to
suppress NDMA-induced cancer. Finally, Project 1 will also create “Chem-Sense Cells,” a novel cell array-based
platform for screening environmentally relevant N-nitrosamines (to be identified by Projects 3 and 4) for their
DNA damaging potential. Specific Aim 1 is to leverage the C-GEM mice at a sensitive window of susceptibility
to reveal the long-term low-dose impact of NDMA administered under environmentally relevant conditions.
Specific Aim 2 is to use chemical-genetics to create Chem-Sense Cells as a novel biosensor for DNA damage
induced by N-nitrosamines present at Superfund Sites. Specific Aim 3 is to leverage the C-GEM mice to reveal
the biological mechanisms by which probiotics modulate mutation susceptibility via studies of systems-level
responses. Trainees will drive the research and will be supported by the Research Experience and Training
Coordination Core to ensure optimal professional development. With support from the Community Engagement
Core, Project 1 Leaders and trainees will also listen to and work with community members and tribes to develop
novel hands-on teaching curricula that explain key concepts in biology that underlie their research activities.
Importantly, Project 1 is part of a greater Systems Approach for the entire MIT SRP, for which interactions and
interdependencies (supported by the Administrative Core) give rise to impact that is not otherwise possible. This
includes using machine learning (in collaboration with the DMAC) to merge research results from this Project
with that of other Projects to gain a better understanding of risk. The Administrative Core also promotes the
dissemination of this Project’s innovative mouse and cell technologies, and it supports bringing research results
to the EPA and other stakeholders in order to maximize impact on public health."

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a devastating cancer with limited options, despite decades of intensive
searches for curative therapeutics. The average 5-year survival of AML is about 30% (for all patients) but for
most elderly patients over 60 years, the 2-year survival rate is less than 5%. About 30% of AML patients harbor
a mutated FLT3 kinase and these patients have the worst outcome. Midostaurin and gilteritinib, FLT3 inhibitors
were approved in 2017 and 2018 respectively. Crenolanib another FLT3 inhibitor is in advanced phase III clinical
trials, whereas quizartinib was approved in Japan but failed to gain FDA approval. However patients on all of the
four FLT3 inhibitors ultimately relapse due to secondary mutations in the FLT3 kinase (such as FLT3-ITD, D835
and F691 mutants) and other compensatory resistance mechanisms. Breast cancer has an average 5-year
survival rate is 93% for stage I and II but for a small but significant percentage (15-20%) of breast cancer patients,
who harbor hormone refractory cancer (called triple negative breast cancer, TNBC), there are few therapeutic
options. Clearly new therapeutics, which are effective against AML and TNBC cancers, are needed. The PIs
have identified novel 3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]quinoline-based kinase inhibitors, synthesized in only a single flask
operation, that potently inhibit FLT3 and/or CDK2 or CDK12/13 or CDK18. The selectivity for these kinases
depend on the substitution pattern of the 3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]quinoline core. CDK12/13 and CDK18 are involved
in the cell's response to DNA damage and the inhibition of these kinases lead to BRCAness in various cancers,
making such cancers sensitive to agents that damage DNA or inhibit DNA damage repair, such as doxorubicin
or PARP inhibitors respectively. The overall goal of this project is to optimize these interesting new class of
kinase inhibitors for possible translation into AML and breast therapeutics. In aim 1, second-generation 3H-
pyrazolo[4,3-f]quinoline-based compounds, (first-generation compounds have already shown impressive in-vivo
efficacy against AML in vivo), will be biochemically characterized and evaluated in vivo (Aim 3). Additionally new
chemistries will be used to make third-generation 3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]quinoline-based kinase inhibitors that have
better drug-like properties. Aim 2 characterize how these new potent anti-proliferative compounds affect protein
phosphorylation in cancer cells and to determine the potencies of the compounds at killing various AML cell
lines, which are resistant to current therapies such as gilteritinib, and triple negative breast cancer cell lines in
vitro. In aims 3, the PIs will evaluate the in-vivo efficacies of lead compounds against AML and breast tumors.

Pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) is a heterogeneous group of mostly recessive pediatric brain
disorders that show features of both impaired neurodevelopment and presence of neurodegeneration.
PCH is characterized by severe age-dependent neurological impairment, and notable radiographic
volume loss of the pons and cerebellum with loss of brainstem and cerebellar neurons. Currently
there are 32 genes known mutated in PCH, but still more genes await to be discovered, and molecular
mechanisms are poorly understood. Some of the genes implicate key steps in protein synthesis and
genomic integrity including tRNA and mRNA splicing, suggesting disruption to homeostatic cellular
functions, but many questions remain: 1] How many genetic subtypes remain to be discovered? 2]
Why do loss of broadly expressed genes predispose specifically to neurons? 3] Are there convergent
molecular pathways for PCH? Over the past 5 years, we have: 1] Grown our unique cohort of PCH
patients, containing 248 families including 132 still without a molecular cause. 2] Applied a range of
genomics and transcriptomics methods to uncovered mutations in several novel genes including
TOE1, TBC1D23, PRP17 and PPIL1 leading to specific PCH subtypes. 3] Revealed defects in RNA
splicing and genome integrity as underlying causes. 4] Uncovered the first spliceosome protein
mutations. 5] Revealed new genotype phenotype correlations. In our preliminary data we have: 1]
Secured resources to advance whole genome sequencing to evaluate our remaining unsolved cases.
2] Identified a further ten new genes as causes for PCH. 3] Remarkably, found that six of the novel
causes encode spliceosome proteins. 4] Uncovered R-loop accumulation as a cause of DNA damage
by which mutations lead to genotoxic stress. The goal of this application is to: 1] Identify the remaining
‘discoverable’ genes for PCH. 2] Functionally validate mutations within a pathogenic framework. 3]
Test the hypothesis that PCH gene loss leads to neurons cell death through R-loop accumulation,
DNA damage and genotoxic stress. This work will lead to insight into causes and mechanisms of an
important cause of infantile encephalopathy, and uncover mechanisms of selective neuronal
vulnerability and pediatric neurodegeneration underlying developmental brain disease."
10868552,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The research proposed here addresses drugs that inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs),
which are 4-subunit ionotropic glutamate receptors found at most vertebrate excitatory synapses. NMDARs are
involved in a remarkable range of both nervous system physiology and nervous system disorders. Ca2+ influx
through NMDARs is a signal of central importance to synaptic plasticity throughout the brain. Excessive NMDAR-
mediated Ca2+ influx, however, has been linked to many nervous system disorders, including Alzheimer's
disease and other neurodegenerative diseases, stroke, and traumatic brain injury. It therefore would appear that
NMDAR inhibitors should have wide therapeutic potential. However, most NMDAR inhibitors have been
unsuccessful in clinical trials, probably because widespread inhibition of NMDARs has multiple unacceptable
side effects. Memantine, however, is an NMDAR channel blocking antagonist that is one of the few drugs
approved for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The reasons why memantine is both effective and unusually well-
tolerated remain under debate. An explanation is suggested by the recent observation that memantine acts to
stabilizes a Ca2+-dependent desensitized state of NMDARs while blocking the NMDAR channel. As a result,
memantine preferentially inhibits NMDARs that are exposed to high intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, which are
the NMDARs most likely to mediate pathological Ca2+ influx. Thus, designing drugs that, like memantine, inhibit
NMDARs more effectively as intracellular Ca2+ rises offers a promising new strategy for developing especially
effective therapeutic agents. The goals of the proposed research are to deepen understanding of interactions
between memantine and NMDARs, including of NMDARs composed of three different types of subunits, which
are widely expressed by challenging to study. Binding sites on NMDARs for memantine and other channel
blockers will be identified and distinguished using an advanced combination of computational chemical modeling
and physiological study of wild-type and mutant NMDARs. Guided by computational models, new compounds
designed to interact with NMDARs in a strongly Ca2+-dependent manner will be synthesized and used to deepen
understanding of channel blocker-NMDAR interactions. The dependence on intracellular Ca2+ of inhibition by
memantine and other channel blockers will be examined using neuronal preparations, and the Ca2+ dependence
of their neuroprotective properties evaluated. New channel blockers with enhanced dependence on intracellular
Ca2+ will serve as lead compounds for future development of more effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease
and related neurodegenerative diseases."

NMDARs more effectively as intracellular Ca2+ rises offers a promising new strategy for developing especially
effective therapeutic agents. The goals of the proposed research are to deepen understanding of interactions
between memantine and NMDARs, including of NMDARs composed of three different types of subunits, which
are widely expressed by challenging to study. Binding sites on NMDARs for memantine and other channel
blockers will be identified and distinguished using an advanced combination of computational chemical modeling
and physiological study of wild-type and mutant NMDARs. Guided by computational models, new compounds
designed to interact with NMDARs in a strongly Ca2+-dependent manner will be synthesized and used to deepen
understanding of channel blocker-NMDAR interactions. The dependence on intracellular Ca2+ of inhibition by
memantine and other channel blockers will be examined using neuronal preparations, and the Ca2+ dependence
of their neuroprotective properties evaluated. New channel blockers with enhanced dependence on intracellular
Ca2+ will serve as lead compounds for future development of more effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease
and related neurodegenerative diseases."
10865717,"Non-Hispanic Black women have a 1.5 times greater risk to have a preterm birth (PTB) than non-Hispanic
White women. This inequity in PTB is not fully explained by low socioeconomic status or poor physical health.
Black pregnant women more often live in disadvantaged neighborhoods with higher disorder and crime than
White women. Women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods experience higher levels of psychological stress.
Yet, the biological pathways by which neighborhood disadvantage and psychological stress increase PTB
remain unclear. Glucocorticoids (GCs) mediate the stress response, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis controls GC secretion. Chronic stress exposures can dysregulate the HPA axis and alter GC levels.
Pregnancy maintenance and parturition depend upon a delicate pro- and anti-inflammatory balance. GCs exert
potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects. In contrast, macrophage migration inhibitory factor
(MIF), which is also released in response to stress, exhibits pro-inflammatory effects that override GC’s
suppression of inflammation. Neighborhood disadvantage and low SES are associated with greater
inflammation and differential DNA methylation (DNAm) of inflammatory genes. Epigenome-wide and candidate
gene studies reported relationships among maternal stressors, differential DNAm, and PTB. The combined
effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near DNAm sites may modify gene expression, potentially
increasing PTB risk; but this possibility is unexplored. Integrated omic approaches may clarify mechanistic
pathways to PTB by exploring integrated omic data sets. The goal of this study is to examine the relationships
among perceived (disorder, crime) and objective (census data) neighborhood disadvantage, psychological
stress, integrated SNP and DNAm data, and PTB in Black women (90 PTB, 90 term births). We will leverage
data from two related R01 studies (R01MD018293, MPI Giurgescu & Ohm; R01MD011575; PI Giurgescu). We
will use sociodemographic, neighborhood, psychological stress, DNAm data, and DNA blood samples from the
R01 studies. We will add objective crime data, screen for SNP variants, and combine SNP and DNAm data in
an integrated analysis. We aim to: Aim 1. Identify PTB-associated SNPs in MIF-mediated GC regulation
pathway genes between women with PTB and term births; Aim 2. (a) Identify differential DNAm of genes
within the MIF-mediated GC regulation pathway in women with PTB compared to women with term births, and
(b) Determine the extent to which differential DNAm of genes within the MIF-mediated GC regulation pathway
associate with neighborhood disadvantage, psychological stress, and gestational age at birth; and Aim 3.
Explore the extent to which DNAm (Aim 2a) in the presence of SNPs ( Aim 1) mediates the association of
neighborhood disadvantage and psychological stress with PTB. This study is the first step toward using
integrated omics datasets to identify the biologic-environmental phenotypes that increase risk for PTB. The
award will provide the training required for an independent career focused on birth equity for Black women."

Human pancreatic islets are the key regulator of whole-body lipid and glucose homeostasis. The dysfunction of
hormone secretion from islets, and/or loss of β cell mass is an important part of the pathogenesis of diabetes,
often requiring insulin or islet replacement. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) provide a potential
alternative source to cadaveric human pancreatic islets, but the generated islets from hiPSCs in vitro commonly
shows functional heterogeneity (batch-to-batch difference) and limited scalability. In addition, even with
autologous delivery strategies, hiPSC derived islets (hiPSC-islets) still require life-long immune suppression
because of a hyper-active immune reaction especially in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients. Therefore, universal
human PSCs that evade immune detection constitute a major goal of translational research in T1D research.
Our research proposal focuses on investigating methods for the functional selection, mass production, and
immune protection of hiPSC-islets. The rationale is that Identifying such a pathway is necessary for large-
scale islet cell therapy for diabetes. Our preliminary results revealed that 1) the mineral absorption FXYD2
pathway is a novel hallmark of functional heterogeneity of hiPSC-islets. 2) Newly developed giant islet (GiSLETs)
technology provides better scalability than traditional hiPSC-islets. 3) PD-L1 provides immune evasive function
in hiPSC-islets. We hypothesize that FXYD2 enriched GiSLETs with PD-L1 expression provides long-term
viability and functionality in immune competent diabetic condition. This hypothesis will be tested with the
following specific aims. Aim 1: Identification of FXYD2 as functional stem cell derived β cell marker. Using
a newly developed three-dimensional protocol to mimic human islet organogenesis, we will test the role of
FXYD2 in islet functionality, a core mineral absorption pathway using genetic and physiological approaches.
Aim 2: Explore the in vivo efficacy of FXYD2 enriched GiSLETs. We hypothesized that FXYD2 can be
selection marker of functional GiSLETs. We will isolate FXYD2 enriched GiSLETs (fGiSLETs) by FXYD2
promoter driven reporter system and will explore the efficacy for glycemic control of fGiSLETs in T1D model mice.
Aim 3: Explore the long-term efficacy of immune evasive GiSLETs in allogenic and autoimmune reaction.
To investigate whether overexpression of PD-L1 with HLA-A&B deletion will limit the immune response of
fGiSLETs upon transplantation and prolong survival in human patients, we will use humanized CD34+ mice
(CD34+-NGS-SGM3, Jackson Laboratory) as an in vivo graft rejection model. The significance of the proposed
study is in its focus on the mechanisms involved in human islet maturation, tissue engineering of practical scaling
of functional insulin producing cells by GiSLETs. The success of this study will enable us to create more robust,
reproducible, and functional multi-cellular islet-organoids from hiPSCs. This relies on our innovative concepts
of functional selection, mass production and immune protection for cell therapy in diabetes."

Computational analyses have become instrumental to cancer research, but only a minority of cancer
researchers are computational scientists. Cancer researchers—especially those with limited computational and
data science skills—face substantial technical challenges performing data analyses. These challenges fall into
three broad categories—data, tools, and computational infrastructure—and include (1) connecting datasets,
software tools, and analysis workflows to perform an analysis; (2) using compute resources such as
institutional computing clusters or cloud computing to process often enormous datasets; and (3) performing
high-quality analyses by selecting from the bewildering array of tools and visualizations available. The impact
of these technical challenges on cancer research is severe, restricting the cancer research community’s
advances toward understanding, preventing, and treating the disease. Without resolving these issues, cancer
datasets and software analysis tools be substantially underutilized, and in turn the multimillion-dollar
investment in cancer data science will not translate into improved patient outcomes. We will address these
challenges in this project by creating the Galaxy for Cancer (Galaxy-C) platform. Galaxy-C will meet the
emerging data science needs across the spectrum of cancer researchers—individual experimentalists and
computational scientists, research labs, clinical trials, and national consortia. Our project has four aims. Aim 1:
Extend Galaxy-C with datasets and workflows to enable emerging cancer research in single-cell spatial and
multimodal data analyses. With these extensions, Galaxy-C will enable many new cancer analyses by making
high-value cancer datasets and novel analysis workflows widely available. Aim 2: Expand Galaxy-C with new
machine learning (ML) tools and an intelligent user interface. These new capabilities will ensure Galaxy-C
supports the increasing number of cancer analyses that require ML and help users be more productive with
assistance from its user interface. Aim 3: Integrate and use external computing services in Galaxy-C to power
larger cancer data analyses. Using external computing services will ensure Galaxy-C performs efficient and
cost-effective cancer data analyses, and use of community APIs will maximize the number of services Galaxy-
C can connect with and use. Aim 4: Grow a Galaxy-C cancer data analysis community through collaborations
with ITCR, the NCI Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN), and individual cancer researchers. The Galaxy-C
community will ensure that the Galaxy-C platform meets the needs of cancer researchers and maximizes the
impact of the platform on cancer research. The Galaxy community numbers tens of thousands, the ITCR
community has hundreds of analysis tools, and the HTAN consortium has hundreds of cancer researchers.
Successful completion of this project and creation of a Galaxy-C workbench will have tremendous impact
across these large communities doing state-of-the-art cancer research by making it possible for all cancer
scientists to do accurate, robust, and efficient computational and data science research."

Esophageal cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of human malignancy. Esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (ESCC) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are the primary histological subtypes of esophageal
cancer. Clear race-based disparities exist with regard to incidence of esophageal cancer in the US with EAC
most often affecting Caucasian ancestry men (CA) and ESCC primarily occurring in African American/Black
(AA/B) men. Moreover, esophageal cancer collectively is more deadly in AA/B patients as compared to their CA
counterparts. Currently, our understanding of the biological underpinnings of the described racial disparities in
esophageal cancer remains limited. In the current proposal we will directly perform scRNA-Seq on esophageal
biopsy specimens from esophageal mucosa of AA/B and CA subjects to test the innovative hypothesis that race-
associated alterations in the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of esophageal mucosa contribute to disparities
in esophageal cancer incidence. In Aim 1, we will interrogate tissues from AA/B and CA healthy controls with
normal esophageal pathology. In Aim 2, we will interrogate adjacent normal tissue from human subjects with
esophageal tumors. This study represents the first evaluation of race-based differences in esophageal mucosa
at the level of single cell resolution. It will also be the first study to examine this cellular heterogeneity in both
healthy and esophageal cancer patients. To successfully reach this goal, the proposed studies leverage (1) the
diverse patient population at TUH; (2) the PIs established pipeline for esophageal biopsy procurement and
expertise in esophageal pathophysiology; and (3) the collaborators respective expertise in esophageal cancer
(Dr. Whelan), clinical and translational esophageal research (Dr. Reichenbach), bioinformatics analysis of large-
scale genomics data (Karami), and health disparities (Dr. Ma). Identification of cell types and pathways
displaying differential representation or expression in AA/B and CA subjects has great potential to inform our
understanding of the biological underpinnings of established racial disparities in esophageal cancer incidence."
10866652,"Project Abstract - A Global Syphilis Vaccine Targeting Outer Membrane Proteins of Treponema
pallidum
The scientific premise of this CRC proposal rests upon our three decades of work defining the molecular
architecture of the outer membrane (OM) of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA), coupled with our
successes combining bioinformatics, biophysical techniques, and localization methods with live TPA to
topologically characterize TPA outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and define the syphilis spirochete’s
‘OMPeome’--its repertoire of OMPs. The central hypothesis is that the principal targets for a syphilis vaccine
reside within TPA’s repertoire of rare OMPs.
The current application builds upon the work of the current CRC U19 grant awarded to the two mPIs of this
proposal (Moody and Radolf). This proposal brings together the expertise in spirochetology (Univ. of
Connecticut) and vaccine development (Duke Human Vaccine Institute) to develop vaccines targeting TPA
OMPs. The overarching hypothesis is that vaccines targeting TPA OMPs will elicit antibodies that can
recognize intact treponemes, provide protection in animal models, and be producible using Good
Manufacturing Practices (GMP) at the scale needed to perform a phase 1 clinical trial.
This CRC proposal will focus on two main aims: Aim 1) Selection of an ECL vaccinogen panel and production
of ECL mAbs with functional activity, with subaim 1.1 of finalizing the ECL vaccinogen panel through robust
preclinical animal studies (Univ. of Connecticut) and subaim 1.2 of producing ECL mAbs with functional activity
(Duke Human Vaccine Institute), and Aim 2) Selection and optimization of an ECL vaccine platform, with
subaim 2.1 of generating functional ECL-specific Abs using mRNA-LNP immunogens (Univ. of Pennsylvania),
and subaim 2.2 of generating functional ECL-specific Abs using SpyVLPs (Univ. of Connecticut), to be
compared in animal protection studies in subaim2.3.
Successful completion of the aims of this CRC U01 proposal will provide the preclinical data needed for an IND
submission to the FDA, complete the process development for GMP production, and will result in the full
design of a GMP campaign strategy and a plan for toxicology testing."
10870149,"Abstract
Microbes in host microbiomes, human infections and the natural environment often live in spatially
structured aggregates and interact antagonistically with each other. Toxin-mediated antagonistic
interactions are widespread in the gut, skin, and other human microbiomes, and protect these
communities against external invasion. Recent results suggest that spatial structure can strongly
affect the evolutionary dynamics of microbial populations, and, in turn, microbial interactions can
feedback on the formation of spatial structure. For example, we found that mechanical interactions
among dividing cells in growing yeast colonies reduce the power of natural selection by reducing
the rates at which lower fitness strains go extinct and fitter ones expand in these populations.
Despite spatial structure and microbial interactions have a strong impact on the evolutionary
dynamics of microbes relevant for human health, most of what we know about microbial
evolutionary dynamics comes from experiments with well-mixed liquid cultures with limited
interactions among cells. To fill this gap, my group is interested in understanding quantitatively
how spatial structure, mechanics and biological interactions impact the adaptive evolutionary
dynamics of microbial populations. We approach this question via experimental evolution,
synthetic biology, and mathematical modeling. In preliminary experiments, we found that evolving
yeast colonies selecting for faster expansion on agar surfaces results in notable changes in cell
shape: cells evolved from an ellipsoidally shaped ancestor to being elongated and almost rod-
like, changing the way cells interact mechanically when growing and dividing. We hypothesize
that an elongated cell shape is advantageous for faster expansion because it reduces cell
packing, and that this adaptive change is associated with changes in the way genotypes cluster
in space leading to increased genetic drift, the temporal change in allele frequencies due to
chance events. Recently, we showed that a toxin-producing microbe can only invade a landscape
occupied by a weaker toxin-producer if its inoculum is larger than a critical size, and that adaptive
evolution can alter the dynamics of antagonism. We will experimentally investigate the
dependence of the critical inoculum size on the strength of the interaction, and we will study how
spatial structure controls the fate of mutations that confer resistance to the toxin produced by
either the invader or resident strain. Finally, we will investigate how antagonistic interactions
among microbes affect the dynamics of invasion in the gut of the nematode Caenorhabditis
elegans: these experiments will help us translate results obtained in simple laboratory settings to
the more complicated but more realistic dynamics of invasion of a host microbiome."
10868188,"Summary
Single-stranded (ss) DNA gaps have emerged as key determinants of genome stability and PARP inhibitor
(PARPi) sensitivity, particularly in the context of cancers with mutations in the breast cancer susceptibility genes
BRCA1 and BRCA2. During this funding period, we unveiled a central role for PRIMPOL-repriming in generating
ssDNA gaps in cells treated with platinum-based compounds and PARPi. This work was enabled by the unique
combination of electron microscopy (EM) and single-molecule DNA fiber approaches available in our lab. Using
these technologies, we provided the first molecular insight into the mechanisms that repair PRIMPOL-dependent
gaps. We also showed that these mechanisms are impaired in BRCA1-deficient cells, explaining why gaps
accumulate in these cells. However, we found that gap repair can be restored in BRCA1-deficient cells by
inhibiting MRE11 nuclease activity, indicating that nuclease processing plays a central role in ssDNA gap repair.
This renewal builds on new EM data showing that the ssDNA gaps in BRCA1-deficient cells treated with PARPi
are significantly larger than the ssDNA gaps of BRCA1-proficient cells, and on new biochemical data showing
that MRE11 efficiently resects ssDNA gaps in vitro. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that MRE11 plays
a key role in processing ssDNA gaps, and that over-resection of the ssDNA gaps by MRE11 in BRCA1-deficient
cells prevents gap repair. The first Aim will define the mechanism(s) by which ssDNA gaps are processed by
MRE11, in concert with other long-resection nucleases. While processing of double-stranded breaks has been
widely studied, the same molecular details are not available for ssDNA gaps. These studies will establish a new
paradigm for the roles of nucleases in ssDNA gap resection and repair at DNA replication forks, as well as
elucidate the mechanisms controlling nuclease activity and how these are deregulated in BRCA-deficient tumors.
We discovered that inhibiting MRE11 activity not only reinstates gap repair in BRCA1-deficient cells, but also
changes the pathway of gap repair in BRCA1-proficient cells. The second Aim will determine the mechanisms
by which gaps are repaired in PARPi cells and test the innovative hypothesis that MRE11 processing is the key
step that governs the choice between template switching and more error-prone translesion synthesis
mechanisms of gap repair. Finally, we observed that, unlike the PARPi-sensitive BRCA1-deficient cells, ssDNA
gaps are efficiently repaired when the same cells become PARPi-resistant. Thus, we will determine how MRE11
inhibition restores gap repair in BRCA1-deficient cells and whether targeting these repair pathways represents
a novel strategy to overcome PARPi resistance in BRCA1-deficient cells. This knowledge is crucial for basic
research to inform how nucleases control the balance between error-free and mutagenic mechanisms of ssDNA
gap repair and how targeting these mechanisms modulates chemotherapy response in BRCA1-deficient tumors."

We propose to broadly disseminate and extend intuitive, powerful cloud-based resources for optical brain
mapping that facilitate efficient, accurate, and standardized processing that will harmonize the emerging set of
optical measurement strategies within the growing ecosystem of network level analyses used throughout the
greater brain mapping community. The neuroimaging community faces numerous challenges in data collection,
preprocessing, estimation of brain connectivity, and analyses of relationships between brain connectivity and
behavior. An ever-expanding community of researchers are employing optical methods based on functional near
infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in order to infer pathophysiological state of tissue, such as inflammation and
metabolism for detection/characterization of disease or cerebral hemodynamics for understanding human brain
health, development, and aging. Recent developments of high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a
silent, flexible, and scalable technology have demonstrated dramatically improved anatomical specificity and
image quality over traditional fNIRS. Further, recent developments in wearable HD-DOT, even using frequency
domain and time resolved strategies, open the door to unconstrained mapping of naturalistic human brain
function with superior image quality than previously possible. Given the growing worldwide adoption of fNIRS
and HD-DOT methods and further developments of next-generation optical brain mapping methods via the
BRAIN Initiative, there is an urgent and present need for standardized, accessible and flexible tools that directly
support workflows from optical tissue parameter recovery to functional brain mapping to relating variance in brain
function to behavior and outcome. To address these needs, our teams have developed and validated
computational tools including NIRFAST, NeuroDOT, and Network Level Analyses (NLA), for tissue parameter
recovery, optical brain mapping, and model-based connectome-wide association studies of brain function and
behavior, respectively. While these tools each support growing user communities, the tools are based in Matlab,
which significantly limits accessibility and adoption. Additionally, much of these analyses are computationally
intensive and expensive, limiting full use to institution-based, server-level resources. Further, extant widely
available software packages for fNIRS are limited in scope and do not support the full set of pipelines for end-
to-end analyses that together NIRFAST, NeuroDOT, and NLA provide. We therefore propose herein to utilize
funding from RFA-NS-23-026 to address this unmet need for data resources with (1) greater dissemination and
training for our tools, (2) cloud deployment of our software to increase scale and accessibility, while easing the
computational burden for the user, and (3) expanded utility of these powerful, flexible tools to meet the evolving
needs of users at the forefront of optical imaging technology development. This proposal executes BRAIN
Initiative goal 7 that seeks to integrate new technological and conceptual approaches to discover how dynamic
patterns of neural activity are transformed into cognition, emotion, perception, and action in health and disease."

The human genome encodes over 2 million DNA regulatory elements called enhancers that
control gene expression in specific cell types and states. Enhancers harbor tens of thousands of
genetic variants that influence risk for common diseases and traits. Each of these enhancer
variants could reveal insights into the molecular mechanisms of human diseases. Yet, we have
lacked tools to systematically map which enhancers regulate which genes in each of the
thousands of cell types in the human body.
To address this challenge, we have recently developed CRISPR tools to experimentally test
thousands of enhancers in parallel, and discovered a simple computational model that can predict
enhancer-gene regulation from chromatin state. These nascent technologies suggest a new
strategy to map enhancers across many cell types to connect noncoding variants to target genes.
Here we will develop and extend these new technologies to map and predict enhancer-gene
connections at single-cell resolution. First, we will characterize how enhancer function changes
across developmental trajectories, by combining our CRISPR tool with a new single-cell readout
method to survey thousands of enhancer-gene connections in differentiating vascular cells.
Second, we will develop a computational model that can predict enhancer-gene regulation from
single-cell measurements of chromatin accessibility. Third, we will apply these tools to build maps
of enhancer-gene regulation in the adult human heart, and demonstrate the utility of these maps
by characterizing genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease.
These technologies will enable mapping enhancer-gene regulation in many cell types, building a
foundational resource for connecting noncoding genetic variants to their molecular functions. This
approach will be broadly applicable to any common, complex disease. This proposal builds on
the PI’s experiences in genomics and team science with the ENCODE Consortium and Variant-
to-Function Initiative. This R35 Genomic Innovator Award will help the PI launch a career at the
interface of human genomics and cardiovascular disease that will include significant contributions
to team science efforts. The environment at Stanford University in the Department of Genetics
and Children’s Heart Center is ideal for supporting these scientific and leadership roles."

Over 200 million people worldwide are chronically exposed to arsenic in drinking water at concentrations above
the EPA or World Health Organization safety standard. There is strong experimental and epidemiological
evidence that low levels of arsenic in combination with other environmental insults such as ultraviolet radiation
(UVR) increases carcinogenesis, suggesting arsenic is a co-carcinogen in humans. However, little is known
about the molecular mechanisms of arsenic co-carcinogenesis or effective strategies for prevention of arsenic-
augmented cancers. Recent advances in analysis of next generation sequencing have given rise to powerful
tools to define distinct mutational signatures in tumors that identify specific defects in DNA repair processes or
carcinogenic exposures as part of cancer etiology. In current proposed study we will apply this new technology
to advance our understanding of arsenic as a co-carcinogen when combined with the DNA damaging UVR. We
have published an extensive body of work demonstrating that arsenic interferes with the zinc finger motifs of
select DNA repair proteins leading to decreased repair capacity and increased DNA damage and mutations
that are alleviated by zinc. A preliminary mutation pattern analysis of normal human keratinocytes exposed to
0.1 µM arsenite, UVR, or both revealed that this low concentration of arsenite was sufficient to enhance UVR-
induced C>T mutations and zinc supplement reduced C>T mutations suggesting a potential intervention.
Furthermore, the mutational signatures generated by UVR and arsenite differ from those of UVR alone,
indicating that arsenite modifies the mutation spectrum rather than simply amplify the UVR signature. Based on
our published and preliminary findings, we hypothesize that arsenic enhances UVR-induced skin
carcinogenesis by disrupting the zinc finger function of the key DNA repair protein XPA, which in turn, results in
deficient nucleotide excision repair leading to greater accumulation of somatic mutations. In Aim 1, we will
determine whether exposure to arsenic, UVR or both generates unique mutational signatures and the impact of
zinc on identified signatures using whole genome sequencing and advanced computational approaches
developed by co-investigator Dr. Alexandrov. Aim 2 will investigate the molecular mechanism of C>T mutation
enhancement by arsenic through transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair inhibition using both
biochemical approaches and computational analysis of whole genome sequencing data. In Aim 3, we will use a
proven animal model of UVR-induced skin carcinogenesis to define in vivo mutational signatures from UVR-
induced tumors with or without arsenic and the impact of zinc on the mutation signature. The outcomes from
our rigorously designed studies are expected to provide the first experimental definition of a metal-induced
mutation signature and the first analysis of mutational signatures generated by combination exposures to two
important and relevant environmental insults, as well as the insights into mechanisms by which arsenic
enhances UVR-induced carcinogenesis and how zinc confers protection."

Cancer incidence, mortality, and disparities between rich and poor are projected to rise at staggering rates. It is
estimated, for example, that cancer will kill one million Africans each year by 2030, with cervical cancer
accounting for the most cancer deaths in African women. Global efforts to eliminate cervical cancer are currently
focused on expanding access to HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening. However, these efforts lack
equal investment in treatment of precancerous cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3 (CIN2/3), particularly
among HIV-infected women. This gap leaves a generation of HIV-infected women at high risk of
persistent/recurrent CIN2/3 and progression to cervical cancer because standard treatment for CIN2/3 (excision
or ablation) is far less effective in this population. The need for novel treatment approaches for CIN2/3 in HIV-
infected women is therefore substantial. The central hypothesis of our proposal is that topical 5-fluorouracil
(5FU), a widely available low-cost generic drug, can be repurposed as a patient-controlled, adjuvant treatment
for CIN2/3 after surgical excision to reduce the risk of persistent/recurrent CIN2/3 and progression to cervical
cancer among HIV-infected women. Our overarching goal is to build on U.S. efficacy studies and test the
acceptability and feasibility of combination treatment for CIN2/3 (i.e., surgical excision followed by self-
applied adjuvant 5FU) in a low-resource setting. First, we will explore South African perspectives on current
cervical cancer prevention strategies and identify barriers to and facilitators of combination treatment in the local
context. We will accomplish this through a series of focus groups and in-depth interviews with diverse
stakeholders (HIV-infected women, male partners, healthcare personnel). Second, and informed by our
formative research, we will conduct a feasibility trial of the combination treatment strategy to determine safety,
tolerability, adherence, and retention. We will randomize 180 HIV-infected women with CIN2/3 who will undergo
loop excision (LEEP) followed by self-apply 5FU versus placebo (8 doses, once every 2 weeks). Women will be
followed for 24 weeks. Third, to better understand the immune response to combination treatment in HIV-infected
women, we will assess changes in genital HIV-1 shedding and local immune activation associated with surgical
excision followed by 5FU/placebo. Our study will be conducted in South Africa, where more than 4 million women
are living with HIV and women’s lifetime risk of cervical cancer is among the highest in the world. If successful,
our findings will have broad relevance for HIV-infected women in both resource-rich and resource-poor regions
worldwide, including rural and remote areas of the U.S."
10870030,"Project Summary/Abstract: Humans emit an array of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as part of
normal metabolism. There are metabolic shifts in many disease states, and animals with highly sensitive
olfactory systems can be trained to identify patients with certain diseases based on their characteristic scent.
We seek to translate detection of these unique VOCs emanating through the skin to a more robust,
standardized, and mechanized platform, readily adaptable for the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of a
variety of human disease states with distinct pathophysiologies. We hypothesize that systemic metabolic
derangements in many high burden infectious, inflammatory, metabolic, malignant, psychiatric, and
neurologic diseases can be identified via skin emissions. We will adapt a novel, portable gas chromatography-
differential mobility spectrometry (GC-DMS) device that rapidly examines volatile samples directly at the point
of care for the assessment of these skin volatile metabolite signatures. This device is highly sensitive, allowing a
comprehensive and biologically representative assessment of the landscape of human volatile emissions, is
more robust to confounding and environmental factors than many other gas sensing devices, has a long track
record of successful use in various real-world sensing applications, and is already undergoing commercial
development, which will greatly facilitate its rapid development for the skin VOC-based diagnosis of these 20
disease states. We propose further development and rigorous evaluation of this scent-based diagnostic
approach to these disease states, (1) integrating additional process analytical technologies (PATs) to ensure
instrumental accuracy and precision between samples and devices through repeated, high-volume patient
testing over time and modifying the device inlet for skin volatile analysis, (2) identifying and validating GC-
DMS signatures and the corresponding set of skin volatile metabolites that distinguish individuals with and
without each of these 20 disease states using machine learning methods, integrating automated detection of
these signatures on the GC-DMS device, and (3) developing a wearable sensor for at least one disease with a
simple volatile signature, determining the test characteristics of this wearable diagnostic device. A lack of
reproducibility is a major issue plaguing the field of volatile metabolite analysis, often due to confounding and
study design flaws. We will make every effort to minimize and eliminate any sources of confounding, bias, and
extraneous variability as we develop and evaluate this scent-based diagnostic approach, to yield generalizable
signatures for each disease state. Ultimately, successful completion of these aims will yield rapid, noninvasive
skin volatile metabolite assays for the screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of each of these diseases, with a
clear, binary (yes/no) assessment of whether the individual has evidence of one or more of these diseases,
facilitating early administration of appropriate therapeutics in these patients and mitigating the clinical
consequences of each of these diseases."

Arthrogryposis is present in 1 in 3,000 live births causing joint contractures in both upper and lower limbs.
There is no cure making it an unmet medical need. Mutations in the MYBPC1 gene encoding slow skeletal
myosin-binding protein C (sMyBP-C), expressed in both slow and fast muscle types are associated with
distal arthrogryposis (DA). MYBPC2 encodes for fast skeletal MyBP-C (fMyBP-C) and is found only in fast-
twitch muscle. As a myosin-anchored protein of muscle, MyBP-C extends toward actin, positioned centrally in
the sarcomere to regulate actomyosin interactions in force development. MyBP-C in skeletal muscle has three
major regulators: isoform (slow vs. fast), splice variant (long vs. short sMyBP-C), and posttranslational
modification (phosphorylation). sMyBP-C is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) at its N terminus. The
role(s) of sMyBP-C, its phosphorylation and DA mutations in skeletal muscle are not known. Our preliminary
studies of sMyBP-C show that binding to actomyosin is dependent on phosphorylation and DA mutations. We
have developed innovative biophysical tools that enable evaluation of skeletal MyBP-C structural dynamics,
actomyosin interactions in muscle, and effects of phosphorylation and mutations. Our new preliminary studies
demonstrate that we have successfully developed fluorescent sensors in N terminal sMyBP-C whose structure
and dynamics are sensitive to PKA-mediated phosphorylation and binding to actin. We have also developed
inter-molecular fluorescence assays that resolve actin binding between fMyBP-C, long sMyBP-C, and short
MyBP-C due to phosphorylation and the presence of tropomyosin on actin. These preliminary results suggest
key physiological mechanisms of regulation for the different skeletal MyBP-C and provides additional scientific
premise and feasibility for pursuing the proposed studies. Aim 1 will evaluate effects of sMyBP-C binding and
DA mutations on interactions with actomyosin, capturing structure and proximities of N terminal sMyBP-C,
actin and myosin. Spectroscopic probes will be placed in these proteins and approaches will be employed to
detect key conformations in vitro and in situ with wild type and DA mutant sMyBP-C. For fiber experiments,
muscle will be isolated from novel sMyBP-C knockout (KO) mice and permeabilized with recombinant sMyBP-
C, DA mutants, and muscle protein probes. Samples will be assessed for binding and contractile function. Aim
2 will determine how PKA-mediated phosphorylation of sMyBP-C affects the parameters evaluated in Aim 1.
Aim 3 will determine how fMyBP-C affects the parameters evaluated in Aim 1 except using fMyBP-C KO and
sMyBP-C/fMyBP-C double-KO mice for fibers experiments. The proposed studies capture structural dynamics
and interactions in real time and myofilament space using novel high-resolution approaches. These aims
outline a stepwise plan for studying normal and mutant skeletal MyBP-C during the contractile cycle. By
monitoring distances between points on proteins and the order (or disorder) of those distances under
physiological conditions, mutants can be separated into bins to facilitate targeted mechanistic-based therapies."

Arthrogryposis is present in 1 in 3,000 live births causing joint contractures in both upper and lower limbs.
There is no cure making it an unmet medical need. Mutations in the MYBPC1 gene encoding slow skeletal
myosin-binding protein C (sMyBP-C), expressed in both slow and fast muscle types are associated with
distal arthrogryposis (DA). MYBPC2 encodes for fast skeletal MyBP-C (fMyBP-C) and is found only in fast-
twitch muscle. As a myosin-anchored protein of muscle, MyBP-C extends toward actin, positioned centrally in
the sarcomere to regulate actomyosin interactions in force development. MyBP-C in skeletal muscle has three
major regulators: isoform (slow vs. fast), splice variant (long vs. short sMyBP-C), and posttranslational
modification (phosphorylation). sMyBP-C is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) at its N terminus. The
role(s) of sMyBP-C, its phosphorylation and DA mutations in skeletal muscle are not known. Our preliminary
studies of sMyBP-C show that binding to actomyosin is dependent on phosphorylation and DA mutations. We
have developed innovative biophysical tools that enable evaluation of skeletal MyBP-C structural dynamics,
actomyosin interactions in muscle, and effects of phosphorylation and mutations. Our new preliminary studies
demonstrate that we have successfully developed fluorescent sensors in N terminal sMyBP-C whose structure
and dynamics are sensitive to PKA-mediated phosphorylation and binding to actin. We have also developed
inter-molecular fluorescence assays that resolve actin binding between fMyBP-C, long sMyBP-C, and short
MyBP-C due to phosphorylation and the presence of tropomyosin on actin. These preliminary results suggest
key physiological mechanisms of regulation for the different skeletal MyBP-C and provides additional scientific
premise and feasibility for pursuing the proposed studies. Aim 1 will evaluate effects of sMyBP-C binding and
DA mutations on interactions with actomyosin, capturing structure and proximities of N terminal sMyBP-C,
actin and myosin. Spectroscopic probes will be placed in these proteins and approaches will be employed to
detect key conformations in vitro and in situ with wild type and DA mutant sMyBP-C. For fiber experiments,
muscle will be isolated from novel sMyBP-C knockout (KO) mice and permeabilized with recombinant sMyBP-
C, DA mutants, and muscle protein probes. Samples will be assessed for binding and contractile function. Aim
2 will determine how PKA-mediated phosphorylation of sMyBP-C affects the parameters evaluated in Aim 1.
Aim 3 will determine how fMyBP-C affects the parameters evaluated in Aim 1 except using fMyBP-C KO and
sMyBP-C/fMyBP-C double-KO mice for fibers experiments. The proposed studies capture structural dynamics
and interactions in real time and myofilament space using novel high-resolution approaches. These aims
outline a stepwise plan for studying normal and mutant skeletal MyBP-C during the contractile cycle. By
monitoring distances between points on proteins and the order (or disorder) of those distances under
physiological conditions, mutants can be separated into bins to facilitate targeted mechanistic-based therapies."

Black Americans have the highest hypertension (or high blood pressure, HBP) rates in the world, with stark
racial disparities between Black and White adults that have persisted for decades and at the highest cost to
society of all cardiovascular conditions. The underlying cause of HBP disparities is unknown, and previous
studies have mostly focused on individual-level behaviors, stressors, and physiologic risk factors leaving a
missed opportunity to uncover and address the root causes of these disparities. Structural racism may be a
root cause of HBP disparities and, as such, HBP disparities will persist if structural racism is not addressed.
Thus, to eliminate HBP disparities, we must first investigate if structural racism is a fundamental cause and use
longitudinal studies to explore the pathways through which structural racism influences HBP risk factors and
disparities. Using a novel 5-domain measure of structural racism, our previous cross-sectional studies have
demonstrated that greater structural racism is associated with higher BMI, one behavioral risk factor for HBP;
however, this work has left gaps in understanding how structural racism is related to other risk factors for HBP,
as well as questions about the timing and geographic scales at which structural racism operates. We seek to
fill these gaps in responding to RFA-MD-21-004’s request for “observational research to understand the role of
structural racism…in causing and sustaining health disparities” for HBP. Our goal is to conduct a multi-level
national study to investigate associations between our novel multi-dimensional measure of county-level
structural racism (CSR) and: physiologic, behavioral, and structural risk factors for HBP (Aim 1), HBP
incidence, prevalence, and severity (Aim 2), and how much counties could save in HBP healthcare costs if
CSR was eliminated (Aim 3). We leverage pre-existing resources that are uniquely available to us: (a) our
published County Structural Racism Scale, (b) US News & World Report hospital rankings of healthcare
quality, and (c) longitudinal behavioral and biomarker HBP data from 30,239 Black and White adults across the
US in the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. We expand beyond
previous studies by using a multi-domain measure of structural racism, applying it to longitudinal health data
that allows us to assess exposure to structural racism at multiple times in the lifecourse, and quantifying how
much structural racism costs counties in HBP healthcare spending when it goes unaddressed. We will
translate our findings into policy briefs targeted toward county-level executives in the US. Our team of experts
in CVD disparities, social and clinical epidemiology, and health economics, with representation from
REGARDS, two Hopkins disparities centers, Hopkins’ CVD Epidemiology, and former county leaders, are well-
equipped to execute this New Investigator application. Our results will offer evidence of how CSR influences
HBP, with the potential to build support for policy decisions on CSR that can ultimately reduce HBP disparities."

Resistance to anti-CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1 (PD) T cell-based immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy in large
subsets of cancer patients necessitates the search for other tumor-associated T cell immune checkpoints that
critically affect tumor immunity. Lymphocyte activating gene 3 (LAG-3) is a T-cell inhibitory receptor and
represents a promising target for cancer immunotherapy, as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) blocking LAG-3 with
its known ligand, MHC-II, in combination with anti-PD-1 show modest but promising efficacy in recent clinical
trials. The FDA recently accepted for priority review the biologics license application for LAG-3 blocking mAb
relatlimab and anti-PD-1 nivolumab fixed-dose combination for treating melanoma. However, very few single-
agent activities of these MHC-II blocking anti-LAG-3 mAbs were observed, and no useful biomarkers for patient
stratification have been suggested thus far. Motivated by numerous studies suggesting that the
immunosuppressive effect of LAG-3 is largely independent of MHC-II, we identified for the first time that
fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) is a high affinity and major functional ligand for LAG-3 whose interaction interface is
distinct from MHC-II. FGL1 is a hepatocyte-secreted protein that can be detected in circulation. We found that
soluble FGL1 inhibits antigen-specific T cell activation in a LAG-3 dependent manner. FGL1 genetic ablation or
antibody blockade in mice promotes anti-tumor immunity in established mouse tumors, even in FGL1 negative
tumors, suggesting a functional role of host-derived FGL1. In contrast to its minimal expression in normal tissues
except the liver, FGL1 is upregulated by cancer cells in multiple cancers, such as non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and melanoma; however, the role of tumor-associated FGL1 in the control of tumor immunity is still
unclear. The major anti-LAG-3 clinical programs currently focus on those blocking only the MHC-II/LAG-3
interaction, which do not elicit any single-agent activities. Thus, it is critical to mechanistically dissect the
immunological function of the FGL1/LAG-3 axis in the tumor microenvironment to design better LAG-3 targeted
approaches for clinical application. In this project and through two complementary aims, we will leverage our
extensive experience and expertise in cancer immunology and immunotherapy to 1) determine the functional role
of tumor-associated FGL1 in modulating tumor immunity, its cancer induction mechanism by oncogenic Kras
mutations and functional biomarker value in predicting responses to immunotherapies; 2) develop FGL1-guided,
next-generation anti-LAG-3 cancer immunotherapy. We will compare the anti-tumor efficacy of our in-house anti-
human or mouse LAG-3 antibodies that differentially block either or both FGL1/MHC-II and map the LAG-3
binding interfaces of these antibodies via CryoEM and X-ray crystallographic studies. In sum, our proposed
studies will significantly deepen our understanding of the newly defined FGL1/LAG-3 axis and foster new
immunotherapy designs for treating human cancers."

 The United States is in the midst of a substance abuse and mental health epidemic. Over the past decade,
abuse of psychostimulant (and sometimes hallucinogenic) cathinones, often referred to as “bath salts”, and
variants such as ‘flakka’, has become increasing popular in America’s youth. Although there has been substantial
research into the mechanisms underlying the addictive and adverse effects of some of these agents, such as
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a wide variety of variants are available for sale on the internet.
Furthermore, these represent only a small fraction of conceivable structures which can be produced on kilograms
scale for sale online. Gaining a more complete understanding of the drug targets and toxicity associated with
these agents is an important step to treat substance abuse disorders and episodic toxicity.
 The over-arching goal of our work is to unite whole system level analysis involving the neurobehavioral
effects of psychoactive agents with the study of binding partners at the molecular level. The focus of this
proposal is to implement a novel in vivo photoaffinity labeling (PAL) approach for cross platform analysis of
psychoactive agents, with an emphasis on structures related methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and α-
pyrrolidinovalerophenone (α-PVP). In Aim 1 we will synthesize a carefully designed set of probes to be
cataloged in Aim 2 assays. This includes stereoselective synthesis of PAL probes, structure activity relationship
(SAR) controls, and stable isotope labeled standards for LC-MS studies in Aim 2C. The synthesized library will
be assayed for 1) receptor binding profile; 2) effect on monoamine uptake and release in rat synaptosomes;
and 3) toxicity in multiple cell lines HepG2 (liver), SHSY-5Y (neuronal), AC16 (cardiac myocyte) and PC-12
(neuronal [rat]). In Aim 2C, active compounds (and select inactive controls) will be studied in an adult zebrafish
behavioral paradigm utilizing the novel tank test with concurrent in vivo PAL. The concentration of each drug
will be measured by LC-MS/MS to correlate target tissue (brain) drug exposure with behavioral responses.
Select compounds will be re-examined in the Aim 2 assays using PAL for side-by-side comparison of binding
interactome of Aim 2 experimental systems versus the in vivo binding interactome. Chemical biology in Aim 3
will utilize click chemistry to visualize protein labeling via fluoroimaging of SDS PAGE gels. Proteomics will
determine protein identification after affinity purification to define the binding interactome of each probe. A
variety of competition experiments will be performed to characterize background PAL and recognize bona fide
targets. Bioinformatics will be used for network analysis to provide an unbiased comparison of the binding
interactomes for each experimental system to propose potential therapeutic targets to treat toxicity and episodic
lethality of these agents."

Our perception of food in the mouth is a multi-modal sensory experience involving taste, olfaction, and
somatosensation. All of these stimuli combine to contribute to the recognition and palatability of food. The first
step leading to the perception of ‘mouth feel” in the oral cavity is activation of peripheral somatosensory
neurons. Multiple classes of these trigeminal somatosensory neurons innervate the oral cavity and can be
defined by the types of stimuli to which they respond. For example, low threshold mechanoreceptors (LTMRs)
carry information concerning touch or mechanical stimuli. In skin, at least 7 clear subtypes of these neurons
have been defined by using gene expression to relate the anatomical features of these neurons with their
functions. We do not know how many specialized neuron subtypes mediate touch sensation in the tongue or
their specialized anatomical and functional properties. Understanding the sensations evoked by a food
stimulus requires us to determine the unique anatomical and functional properties of each LTMR subtype in the
tongue. Equally important is how each LTMR’s activities are integrated with other oral sensory neuron types
(i.e. taste and temperature). Toward these long-term goals we propose to use two genetic identifiers to
examine trigeminal neuron subtypes innervating the fungiform (taste) papillae. Our Aims specifically test the
following hypotheses: 1) Taste papillae are innervated by a Aβ LTMRs with a small receptive fields that
express the neurotrophin receptor, TrkC, and that they neurons can further be divided into rapidly adapting and
slowly-adapting types based on the presence or absence of Parvalbumin. 2) These Aβ LTMRs project to the to
a region of the brainstem immediately adjacent to the primary taste terminal field where they activate
postsynaptic neurons that are responsive to touch. 3) These Aβ LTMRs are capable of modulating responses
to taste stimuli at the first gustatory synaptic relay. Successful completion of these experiments establishes the
fungiform papilla as a mechanosensory end organ and provides the genetic tools to explore the contribution of
a specific subtype of LTMR in the integration of sensations produced by the multi-modal food stimulus."

This project will develop a new tool, SpliceTag, for conditional knock-in/knockout and demonstrate its utility.
SpliceTag uses highly cell type specific alternative exons as a vehicle for carrying protein and RNA tags for
conditional labeling, or premature stop codons for protein knockout. It can be introduced in an intron of the
target gene through CRISPR/Cas9 induced homology directed repair. The SpliceTag exon will then be spliced
in mRNA labeling the protein in the desired cell type. In Aim 1 we will create a mouse line in which we use a
SpliceTag in Rpl22 to label ribosomes with ALFA peptide in photoreceptor cells. The photoreceptor specific
SpliceTag is based on Ttc8 microexon 2a which we have shown in the past to be highly specific to
photoreceptor cells. To demonstrate the utility of our approach we will use the Rpl22 SpliceTag line to analyze
translational efficiency in photoreceptor cells and how translation is controlled during the diurnal cycle. In Aim 2
we will determine the feasibility of using SpliceTag to label proteins in epithelial cell and inner retina neurons.
We will also determine if it can incorporate commonly used tags, SNAP and CBP/Strep, that are significantly
larger than the Ttc8 exon 2a on which SpliceTag is based. Since SpliceTag does not rely on recombinases it
can enable experimental designs where recombinase and floxed alleles are used for genetic manipulations in
parallel with SpliceTag, including knockouts in cell types other than the cell type in which the protein is being
labeled."

 Electronic nicotinic delivery systems (ENDS) or e-cigarettes are widely used in the
nation today, despite a paucity of information regarding their safety. In particular, ENDS usage
by pregnant women is prevalent, as cigarette smoking during pregnancy is associated with
miscarriage and fetal death. However, little is known regarding the safety of ENDS use during
pregnancy. ENDS is made up of a liquid containing a mixture of propylene glycol and vegetable
glycerine with additions of flavorings, nicotine, and thickening agents that is heated, aerosolized,
and inhaled. Supplementation of ENDS with flavors and thickening agents can dramatically
enhance the toxicity level and thus, impair fine-tuned biological processes such as pregnancy.
At the start of pregnancy, the uterine stroma and epithelium communicate in a complex
orchestration of molecular and hormone signaling events to coordinate the implantation of an
embryo. After implantation, the fetal-derived trophoblast cells invade into the maternal tissue to
remodel the spiral arteries, initiating the formation of the placenta. My recently published data
was the first to describe that ENDS exposure elongated the timing of pregnancy and caused a
delay in embryo implantation. I also determined ENDS exposure elicited a dramatic
transcriptomic shift at the time of implantation. However, no studies have further examined the
mechanism causing implantation delay. ENDS exposure was identified to impair trophoblast cell
function in vitro, yet no in vivo studies have examined placental development. Although most
ENDS users enjoy the addition of flavors, no studies have examined ENDS with flavor usage or
thickening agents on pregnancy. Thus, there is an urgent need to further examine how ENDS
can influence pregnancy. This proposal aims to 1.) test how ENDS with additives affects fertility
and placental development, 2.) investigate the ENDS-driven mechanisms resulting in delayed
implantation using an in vitro human epithelial organoid model, and 3.) determine the timing and
cause of in vivo ENDS-induced delayed embryo implantation. This proposal provides a detailed
plan to examine how ENDS regulates fertility and early pregnancy success and proposes to
validate ENDS-mediated molecular mechanisms delaying implantation. This study can advise
the public on the measure of caution observed for ENDS usage in pregnancy and can expand
our understanding of mechanisms that regulate implantation success, benefitting women
experiencing infertility or recurrent implantation failure."

The overarching objectives of the Program Development (Pilot) Core (hereafter “Pilot Core”) are to: (1) generate
new lines of innovative, interdisciplinary, policy-relevant, and cross-institution research in CAPS thematic areas;
(2) enhance human capital in population-based aging research and build the pipeline of emerging and
underrepresented scholars; and (3) promote research that informs and responds to priority areas identified by
NIA, including and especially CAPS thematic areas. The Pilot Core will accomplish its objectives through four
specific aims. Aim 1 is to promote new lines of research in CAPS signature and cross-cutting themes as well as
other emerging high-priority areas. The CAPS Pilot Project Program is a key mechanism through which the
CAPS leadership team will stimulate scientific research on CAPS thematic areas and other high-priority issues,
with such research explicitly sought through the program’s annual call for proposals. Aim 2 is to encourage
innovative team science in the demography and economics of aging. The pilot program’s annual call for
proposals will emphasize that such features are among the major evaluation criteria for funding. CAPS will
provide many opportunities and supports for forming collaborative teams. In the Pilot Core, these supports
include a mentoring session at the CAPS Annual Conference and regular availability of the CAPS leadership
team to consult with and mentor prospective applicants as they form teams and draft proposals. Aim 3 is to foster
strategic growth in the size and scope of the list of CAPS affiliates. The Pilot Core will achieve this aim in part by
coordinating with the Administrative Core and the Dissemination Core to advertise the pilot program to non-
affiliate scholars at CAPS sites and via curated distribution lists with a broad reach, including to other universities
in Upstate New York and to other NIA-funded centers and networks. Aim 4 is to accelerate research and external
funding success of CAPS affiliates. To achieve this aim, the Pilot Core will take an innovative, highly integrated
approach that ensures touchpoints throughout the entire life cycle of a pilot project. Pilot investigators will benefit
from sustained mentorship, starting with how to craft a competitive pilot proposal and, ultimately, how to extend
a successful pilot project into a competitive external grant proposal. The Pilot Core will coordinate closely with
the Administrative Core to implement the pilot program, with a clear set of responsibilities outlined in each core.
The CAPS leadership team identified four significant, innovative, and methodologically rigorous pilot project
proposals for Year 1. In addition to achieving those essential criteria, these proposals support: (1) each of CAPS
thematic areas; (2) emerging scholars in order to help launch their externally funded research portfolios; (3) mid-
career scholars who have impressive track records of innovative, externally funded, high-impact population-
based research but who are relatively new to aging science; (4) an even mix of projects lead by demographers
and economists; and (5) underrepresented scientists in the demography and economics of aging."
10867519,"Project Summary/Abstract for Core D: External Research Resources and Dissemination Core
The overarching objective of the External Research Resources Support and Dissemination Core (hereafter
“Dissemination Core”) is to advance scholarship related to CAPS signature and cross-cutting themes by
providing external research resources and disseminating scientific information that promotes the development
and translation of population-based aging research. Specifically, the Dissemination Core will enable scientists to
amplify the impact of their research by offering multiple avenues to share findings; encouraging the use of new
data resources; enhancing the competitiveness of external grant applications; and communicating research
findings to researchers, practitioners, decision makers, and the public. It will also facilitate CAPS community
building, stimulate collaboration among affiliates, and recruit new scholars into population-based aging research.
The Dissemination Core will accomplish its objective through three specific aims. Aim 1 is to support CAPS
affiliates’ efforts to disseminate their research findings and data resources. CAPS will provide the infrastructure
to facilitate this aim, including an annual conference to showcase the innovative research of CAPS affiliates and
provide a key opportunity for them to intellectually engage with each other and invited guests. Furthermore, in
addition to hosting a dynamic website, CAPS will develop a Bulletin Series for distributing research findings of
its affiliates as single-page Data Briefs with infographics, Research Briefs, and op-ed Issue Briefs. As part of this
effort, CAPS will offer expert instruction on how to write effective briefs and provide editorial assistance. To build
infrastructure that is beneficial to the broader research enterprise, CAPS will promote new databases for
population-based aging research being developed by CAPS affiliates (e.g., a contextual data catalog and
repository, the Longitudinal Study of Generations) by coordinating with other NIA-funded Centers to host the
resources and by sponsoring sessions at national conferences to promote their use. Aim 2 is to nurture the next
generation of intellectual leaders and support their efforts to develop high-impact research programs in the
demography and economics of aging. The annual CAPS Grant Writers Workshop will provide expert instruction
on successful grant writing for NIA as well as individualized mentoring to participants. The grants workshop will
prioritize participation by CAPS pilot-project investigators, thereby complementing Pilot Core activities and well
as Administrative Core activities such as the CAPS Teaming Program. Additionally, CAPS will advertise the
grants workshop beyond CAPS sites, particularly to other NIA-funded centers and networks, in order to include
non-affiliates as approximately one-half the participant group each year. Aim 3 is to advance understanding of
the latest population-based aging science by disseminating findings and data resources to researchers,
practitioners, decision makers, and the public. Drawing on the communications expertise at its three sites, CAPS
will publish attractive and accessible research bulletins on a regular cycle, maintain an active website, and utilize
its extensive social media reach to widely distribute research findings."

The overall goal of the Administrative Core of the WVU Stroke CoBRE is to provide leadership 
and manage the development of a center of excellence in basic and translational stroke research 
at West Virginia University (WVU). To achieve this goal, the following specific aims will be 
achieved: The thematic research focus area is stroke and the research projects assess linked 
areas of the prediction, causes, acute treatment and rehabilitation of stroke. To achieve this goal, 
the follow specific aims will be achieved: Specific Aim 1: Develop high quality mentored research 
and career development in the WVU Stroke CoBRE. All five research projects emanate from the 
research activities of assistant/associate professors in a tenure track appointment in their 
respective departments. Aim 1 be achieved by expanding our mentoring program for junior faculty 
that addresses the transition to and attainment of independent research funding, with an 
emphasis on supporting the professional development of junior faculty. Clear expectations and 
milestones for mentees and their respective mentors (both internal and external) are highlighted 
in the annually signed mentoring agreement. Specific Aim 2: To hire new faculty with a research 
expertise in stroke. The Program Director and Internal Advisory Committee members are well 
positioned to direct recruitment of stroke researchers into new positions at WVU. Additionally, 
mid-funding cycle graduation of the current group of junior investigators will free up funds to 
provide startup packages for new recruits. These strategic appointments have already resulted in 
the active recruitment to WVU of 13 new faculty in stroke research in Phase I. Specific Aim 3: 
To continue a formative and summative evaluation strategy with specific milestones. Achieving 
these aims will launch the JIs as independent scientists in stroke research fields and provide a 
foundation of professional development for their long-term academic career success. 
Accomplishing these goals will position the WVU Stroke CoBRE to become a national center of 
excellence in stroke research that addresses the issue of stroke and its co-morbidities in West 
Virginia (WV) and the nation. The CoBRE mechanism will increase the number of stroke 
researchers, expand our capacity to programmatically address important issues in stroke and 
enhance our vital research cores that serve the stroke, cardiovascular and neuroscience 
communities at WVU and across the state while meeting the nation’s need for innovative 
approaches to this devastating disease."

Sepsis is a life-threatening condition characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, leading to
systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction. Despite advances in medical care, sepsis remains a
significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with early detection and intervention being critical to
improving patient outcomes. However, the early detection of sepsis poses several challenges due to its
heterogeneous presentation, non-specific symptoms, and the dynamic nature of patient populations and clinical
practices. Traditional machine learning approaches have shown promise in addressing these challenges, but
their performance may degrade over time as the underlying data distribution changes, necessitating periodic
model retraining. Continual learning is a learning paradigm that enables models to adapt to new data continually
without forgetting previously learned knowledge. This approach is particularly well-suited to the early detection
of sepsis, as it allows models to capture the evolving nature of the condition, incorporate new diagnostic tools
and biomarkers, and provide personalized risk assessments. Despite its advantages, continual learning can
incur several safety issues in sepsis early detection. First, periodic retraining may lead to catastrophic forgetting,
which is a phenomenon that occurs when a machine learning model, upon excessive adaptation to new data
during retraining, loses its previously acquired knowledge from the original training data. Second, as models are
retrained with new data, there is a risk of overfitting to the most recent data, which may reduce their
generalizability to future patient populations or clinical settings. Ensuring a balance between updating the model
to adapt to changing conditions and maintaining generalizability is crucial for maintaining safety. The overarching
goal of this project is to develop safe continual learning methods for early sepsis detection that can adapt to new
data while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and maintaining generalization. First, we will develop methods that
update a small subset of weights in the existing model based on the new data, thereby preserving the previously
learned knowledge while adapting to the new information and leading to a more robust and adaptive model for
early sepsis detection. This will allow us to test the hypothesis that avoiding catastrophic forgetting in continual
learning will increase early prediction accuracy of sepsis for new patients without compromising accuracy for
historical patients. On several electronic health record datasets, we will perform experiments to test the
hypothesis that our methods will outperform state-of-the-art sepsis early prediction methods by more than 10%.
Second, we will develop methods to automatically detect distribution shift from streaming sepsis data, improve
the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization capability of continual learning models, and quantify their prediction
uncertainty. This will allow us to test the hypothesis that improving OOD generalization in continual learning will
significantly improve the accuracy and robustness of early sepsis prediction on future patient cases."

Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are lethal brain tumors in children. Patient prognosis is very bleak with median
overall survival of ~9 months. These tumors typically arise in delicate anatomical locations such as the brain
stem that prohibit surgical resection. Radiation is the only standard of care and provides symptomatic relief.
However, disease control is transient, and children inevitably face tumor recurrence and premature death. There
is a need for novel therapies for DMG patients, especially those that can be combined with radiation.
Glutathione (GSH) is essential for scavenging reactive oxygen species generated by radiation. GSH is also
essential for the detoxification of methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive metabolite that is spontaneously
produced during glycolysis. MGO induces apoptosis by irreversibly damaging proteins and DNA, and cancer
cells adapt to MGO production by upregulating expression of glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), which detoxifies MGO by
conjugation with GSH. Analysis of TCGA data as well as our preliminary studies with patient-derived DMG
models indicate that GLO1 expression is upregulated in DMGs. Inhibiting GLO1 using the potent brain-penetrant
GLO1 inhibitor S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (BBG) abrogates MGO detoxification and inhibits
proliferation of patient-derived DMG cells. Importantly, while BBG alone arrests tumor growth in mice bearing
orthotopic patient-derived DMGs, combined treatment with BBG and radiation induces tumor regression in vivo.
Based on these results, in Aim 1, we will determine whether the combination of BBG and radiation is an
actionable therapeutic strategy in patient-derived DMG models.
Successful translation of novel therapies is aided by the identification of imaging biomarkers that report on early
response to therapy. Deuterium magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a novel, clinically translatable method of
visualizing the metabolism of 2H-labeled substrates in vivo. Our preliminary studies indicate that BBG
downregulates lactate production from [6,6-2H]-glucose in DMGs. Therefore, in Aim 2, we will determine whether
[6,6-2H]-glucose provides a readout of response to combined BBG and radiation, prior to MRI-detectable
anatomical alterations, in mice bearing orthotopic DMGs in vivo.
Our proposal is innovative because we will validate GLO1 as a druggable vulnerability in DMGs. This project
is significant because our studies will set the stage for translation of the combination of BBG and radiation to
DMG patients. Concomitantly, [6,6-2H]-glucose will enable early assessment of efficacy in clinical trials and in
patient management. In essence, by leveraging metabolism for therapy and for imaging treatment response, we
will deliver precision medicine that enhances outcomes and quality of life for DMG patients."

The calvaria (upper part of the skull) comprises plates of bone and fibrous joints (sutures and fontanels).
While the bone protects the brain, the sutures contain stem cells for osteoblasts, and thus allow the skull to
grow coordinately with the expanding brain of a child. Craniosynostosis (a premature loss of the suture(s)) is
a major class of human birth defects. It can lead to dysmorphic skull, and further affect brain and orofacial
development. Current treatment for craniosynostosis often involves invasive and repetitive surgeries at young
ages with relatively high rates of complications. Therefore, improving the methods of intervention for this
defect is of great importance to public health.
Mutations of FBN1, encoding fibrillin-1, underlie several human syndromes affecting cardiovascular, skeletal,
and ocular systems, including Marfan syndrome (MFS). Fibrillins are components of microfibrils in the
extracellular matrix, which provides mechanical supports in the connective tissue. Furthermore, fibrillins can
modulate intercellular signaling by sequestering ligands such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and
tumor growth factor (TGF) β proteins. Craniosynostosis is one of the features associated with FBN1
mutations in humans. However, unlike other MFS defects, it has not received any attention from the
perspective of basic science research, and thus the connection between FBN1 mutations and
craniosynostosis remains poorly understood. In our preliminary study, we have discovered that mouse Fbn1
mutants carrying a MFS mutation have severe deficiency in calvarial sutures at birth, thus establishing a
model to investigate FBN1-associated calvarial defects.
The proposed project will define the role of fibrillin-1 during normal cranial suture development, and
investigate the molecular and cellular mechanism underlying the calvarial defects in Fbn1 mutants. The
specific aims will uncover temporal and spatial specificities of fibrillin-1 function in this context, identify
candidate fibrillin-1-downstream pathways in an unbiased manner, and establish the importance of TGFβ
signaling to the function of fibrillin-1 in suture development. Findings from this project can have a major
impact on both basic science research and translational research involving sutures by providing new
information on crucial factors necessary for suture generation and maintenance."

 Infants are especially susceptible to infectious agents, in particular intracellular pathogens, which require
mounting a Th1 response for immune protection. The fact that CD4 T cells before birth and in early life
are inherently skewed in favor of T regulatory or Th2 responses contributes to this clinical outcome and helps
explain why infections are a leading mortality cause among children under the age of 5 years.
 Contrary to CD4 T cells, innate-like Vγ9Vδ2 (Vδ2) T cells are poised to secrete Th1 cytokines even before
birth and acquire potent cytotoxic function shortly after birth. They mount rapid responses against a broad array
of pathogens, including protozoa, bacteria and viruses, by sensing microbial intermediates of cholesterol
biosynthesis in an MHC-unrestricted manner. Additionally, they can be activated by innate cytokines such as IL-18 and IL-15, secreted by myeloid cells during infections. Despite these key antimicrobial features, Vδ2 cell role
against pathogens in early life is understudied and our ability to harness their potential is very limited. Our long-
term goal is to fill this gap in knowledge and exploit Vδ2 cells to improve vaccine responses in infants.
 We recently observed that the inhibitory receptor PD1, which we know serves as a key regulator of Vδ2 cells
at birth, appears to mark cells that are unlikely to have developed cytotoxic potential. Specifically, both ex vivo
and after expansion, cord blood PD1+CD56- Vδ2 cells contain the lowest proportion of perforin+ cells among the
four subsets identified by concomitant assessment of the two markers, while the PD1-CD56+ subset contains the
highest. Bulk RNA sequencing performed on sorted Vδ2 cell subsets after in vitro expansion validated the flow
cytometry findings. We hypothesize that expression of PD1 in neonatal Vδ2 lymphocytes, especially in absence
of CD56, marks cells with specific functional features, possibly representing a unique differentiation state.
 With the help of key collaborators, we aim to test our hypothesis with existing cord blood samples and assess
feasibility and effectiveness of state-of-the-art single cell approaches to study ex vivo sorted Vδ2 cells. We will
rely on Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and a variation of the Assay
for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with sequencing (ATAC-Seq), called ATAC with Select Antigen Profiling
by sequencing (ASAP-seq), to investigate the significance of PD1 for Vδ2 cell differentiation and function. We
will perform paired CITE-seq and ASAP-seq analyses to address two aims: Aim 1) Compare the transcriptional
profile of ex vivo sorted Vδ2 cells at a single cell level using a CITE-seq approach; and Aim 2) Compare
the chromatin accessibility profile of sorted PD1+ and PD1- Vδ2 cells by ASAC-seq.
 This study will advance our understanding of Vδ2 cell function in early life. The results of the proposed
research will inform future studies, including a proposal aimed at investigating the impact of maternal placental
malaria on infant Vδ2 cells, which may serve as biomarkers of higher (of lower) risk of malaria in early life."

Viridans group streptococci (VGS) are the most common causes of bacteremia in neutropenic patients with
hematologic malignancies and cause substantial morbidity and mortality. Fluoroquinolone (FQ) prophylaxis is
recommended to prevent bacterial infections in neutropenic patients, but VGS that cause bacteremia despite FQ
prophylaxis are FQ-resistant. There is an urgent need for novel approaches to prevent VGS infections in neutro-
penic patients. The objective of this proposal is to determine how screening for colonization with FQ-resistant
VGS could identify patients at high risk of developing VGS bacteremia despite FQ prophylaxis. An alternative
approach to prophylaxis could then be pursued in these high-risk patients. The hypothesis is that neutropenic
patients who develop VGS bacteremia despite FQ prophylaxis are colonized with FQ-resistant VGS prior to
neutropenia and that microbial factors, such as the species of VGS and expansion of VGS in the oral microbiome,
increase the risk of bacteremia in colonized patients. The specific aims of this project are: 1) Determine the
optimal screening method to detect colonization with FQ-resistant VGS; 2) Determine the prevalence and clinical
significance of colonization with FQ-resistant VGS in neutropenic patients and identify alternative prophylactic
antimicrobial agents; 3) Identify risk factors for VGS bacteremia despite FQ prophylaxis in FQ-resistant VGS-
colonized neutropenic patients. In this study, oral (buccal), oropharyngeal, and perianal swab specimens will be
collected from 135 participants prior to hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Specimens will undergo selec-
tive culture to identify FQ-resistant VGS by direct plating and with a broth enrichment step to identify the optimal
body sites to screen and the need for broth enrichment to detect colonization. The prevalence of and risk factors
for colonization will also be identified. Study participants will be followed to determine how pre-transplant coloni-
zation with FQ-resistant VGS increases the risk of VGS bacteremia during neutropenia. Colonizing and blood-
stream FQ-resistant VGS isolates will undergo sequencing to determine whether patients develop bacteremia
from their colonizing strain and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to identify alternative prophylactic agents with
activity against these bacteria. Clinical and microbial risk factors for VGS bacteremia among colonized patients
will then be identified, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to assess the impact of the oral microbiome on this risk.
The contributions of this proposal are that we will identify the optimal screening test to detect colonization with
FQ-resistant VGS, determine the prevalence of colonization prior to HCT and the risk of VGS bacteremia in
colonized neutropenic patients, and identify which colonized patients are at highest risk of VGS bacteremia.
These contributions are significant and innovative because, if confirmed and expanded upon in a larger multi-
center study, they could lead to a novel individualized approach to prevent VGS bacteremia where patients are
screened for colonization with FQ-resistant VGS prior to neutropenia and their prophylactic approach is modified
if colonization is detected, as opposed to the current “one-size-fits-all” approach of universal FQ prophylaxis."

 Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant health crisis in the U.S., which can result in numerous damaging
effects on multiple organ systems including the brain. Although various cell-type-specific and associated
molecular mechanisms underlie these negative effects of alcohol in the brain, the neuroimmune response,
modulated in part by microglia, has been considered a key pathological driver during alcohol misuse. Microglia,
the resident immune cells of the brain, exhibit a broad range of reactivity from alcohol exposure that is context-
dependent; however, the full molecular landscape of this phenotypic spectrum has yet to be fully characterized.
Additionally, most studies that have investigated alcohol-induced microglial reactivity utilize rodent animal
models, which have limited translational relevance to neuroimmune-specific outcomes related to AUD in
humans. To address these limitations, we propose a novel in vivo model called Chimera-BioOrthogonal Non-
Canonical Amino acid Tagging (BONCAT), which will allow comprehensive, unbiased, and cell-type-specific
characterization of the human microglial response to alcohol in an in vivo environment. In order to rigorously test
the utility of this innovative model to study human microglial reactivity to alcohol at the proteome level, we have
developed the following Specific Aims: 1) Characterization of human microglia derived from induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) bearing mutant MetRS (an enzyme necessary to carry out the BONCAT approach) and
determine in vitro reactivity to alcohol and 2) Characterization of the human microglial response to alcohol in vivo
using Chimera-BONCAT, which will utilize a chimeric mouse model with human microglia that are engineered
for BONCAT labeling. This project will be the first of its kind to investigate alcohol-induced reactivity of human
microglia using an in vivo chimeric model as well as a novel approach to selectively enrich human microglia from
the chimeric mouse brain for downstream proteomic analysis. The results from this study will provide key insights
into alcohol-induced phenotypic changes that occur in human microglia with potentially higher translational
values compared to conventional models."
10869608,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a potentially curative therapy for
patients with hematologic malignancies. It is believed that alloreactivity upon HSCT is initiated by lymphoid
cells that express rearranging receptors upon recognizing the alloantigens on the graft. Unlike lymphoid cells,
cells from the innate immune system do not express rearranging receptors and are nonspecifically induced by
“danger” molecules. However, recent studies demonstrated that the innate immune system could specifically
distinguish the non-self graft and subsequently enhance the alloimmune response. Signal regulatory protein α
(SIRPα) is a polymorphic immunoglobulin receptor that is exclusively expressed on the surface of innate cells.
The interaction between SIRPα and its ubiquitously expressed ligand, CD47, suppresses the macrophage's
phagocytic function. As shown in the murine transplant model, mismatches of SIRPα between donor and
recipients can upregulate the allorecognition response. Our group recently investigated the role of SIRPα
variant mismatch in recipients of allo-HSCT from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched related donors
(MRD) for the treatment of different hematological malignancies. We found that for the first time,
donor/recipient SIRPα mismatch is commonly detected and associated with a significantly increased risk of
chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) and a lower rate of early relapse (Blood Advances 2021; Frontier in
Immunology 2022). We proposed a large registry-based study to validate our results in allo-HSCT recipients
with MRD, which is one of the most common donor sources in allo-HSCT. The study is approved by the Center
for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) immunobiology working committee.
CIBMTR and the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) will facilitate the study by providing scientific and
statistical expertise, as well as associated clinical outcome information and biospecimens. We hypothesize that
the mismatched SIRPα elicits a non-self recognition which will further promote adaptive immunity leading to a
higher risk of cGVHD and a lower risk of relapse. In Aim 1, we will perform a retrospective analysis of the
SIRPα mismatch in allo-HSCT with MRD using the CIBMTR data and specimens. Aim 2 is to determine the
relative clinical significance of SIRPα mismatch in the entire cohort and the subgroups of allo-HSCT. The study
will not only define the clinical role of SIRPα variant mismatch in the allo-HSCT setting but also significantly
advance our knowledge of GVHD/ Graft versus Leukemia (GVL) and the allorecognition of the innate immune
system in the context of stem cell transplant."

Brain microstructure imaging is an exponentially growing area of quantitative MRI. It offers the unique ability of
noninvasively probing vital cellular-level tissue properties that provide key information on human development,
aging and neurological disorders. While no scanner can resolve micrometer-level properties directly, they can
be probed from millimeter resolution MRI by employing biophysical modeling of MRI signals of diffusion and
other microstructural contrast. The MRI Biophysics group (Drs. Fieremans and Novikov) at the Department of
Radiology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine has been at the forefront of this research area, working on
modeling, validation and clinical translation of microstructure MRI. However, to optimally serve the large user
group of brain researchers, future progress now requires an adequate investment in cutting-edge MRI hardware.
Indeed, accurate quantification of microstructural features, such as axon diameters, myelin thickness, cell density
and permeability, can only be achieved on MRI systems with magnetic field gradients much stronger than those
on the human MR systems currently available at NYU and nearby institutions in New York City.
This S10 application requests funding to obtain a unique Human Connectome 2.0 scanner (C2.0), a 3T head-
only scanner. Its performance will be extraordinary: 500mT/m gradients and 600 T/m/s slew rate. In comparison,
the current best commercial clinical 3T systems offer 80 mT/m gradients at 200 T/m/s slew rate. The world’s first
C2.0 system, under development at the moment, is to be delivered to Harvard/MGH site at the end of 2023, and
ours will be the second one delivered soon after should the S10 grant be funded. This Siemens scanner will be
equipped by the same software as all our other Siemens MR scanners, which will be instrumental for enabling
transfer of existing research studies. In addition, the order-of-magnitude boost of the diffusion weightings will
enable advanced microstructural mapping of brain gray and white matter in a wide range of neurological
disorders. The unprecedented switching speed (slew rate) will push the envelope in diffusion encoding, as well
as enable echo-planar images with minimal distortions and joint random matrix theory-based noise reduction.
The acquisition of C2.0 aligns with the mission of the Department of Radiology and of the NIH-funded Center for
Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research, to translate novel and highly impactful imaging technology rapidly
and effectively into clinical practice. A host of collaborative projects with a diverse focal area stands to benefit
dramatically from the non-invasive microstructural information which may be gleaned from the C2.0 system. The
addition of the C2.0 will provide much needed scan time for a large group of brain researchers and enable
transforming the field of microstructure imaging, benefiting basic researchers, patients and physicians who care
for them, as well as other academic medical centers within the greater New York City area."

Anemia frequently accompanies infections, contributing to adverse outcomes and even death. The mechanisms
underlying this complication in different infections appear to be diverse and are, in general, not well-defined.
The major infectious disease contributing globally to pediatric anemia is malaria, which is responsible for the
majority of anemia-related hospital admissions in endemic areas and is a major cause of death in children.
Although malaria is caused by Plasmodium infection of red blood cells (RBC), the main contributing factor to
malarial anemia is the loss of uninfected RBC through still largely uncharacterized mechanisms. Therefore, there
is a great need for a better understanding of the mechanisms causing malarial anemia that could lead to targeted
treatments for this severe complication.
We have recently analyzed plasma samples from a cohort of 552 Ugandan children with severe malaria to study
the role of Xanthine Oxidase (XO), an oxidative enzyme that is upregulated in the plasma of malaria patients.
We have observed a strong association between the levels of XO in plasma and the development of severe
malarial anemia in children. Additionally, the levels of XO correlated significantly with biomarkers of hemolysis,
suggesting that XO activity may contribute to the loss of uninfected RBC during malaria.
In this project, we intend to determine whether there is a causal relation between the increased levels of XO and
development of severe malarial anemia by studying the mechanisms underlying XO-induced hemolysis and/or
phagocytosis of uninfected RBC in human cells in vitro and in mice models of malaria.
In the first aim we will determine the mechanism underlying XO-induced loss of RBC in vitro. We will study the
effects of XO from patient plasma on healthy human RBC (or RBC co-cultured with Plasmodium falciparum in
vitro) to determine whether XO exposure increases susceptibility to hemolysis, eryptosis and/or phagocytosis by
human monocyte/macrophages.
In the second aim we will determine role of XO in malaria-induced anemia in a mouse model of infection that
reproduces the characteristics human severe malarial anemia: low parasitemia and high, transient loss of
uninfected RBC. We will first determine whether ex vivo exposure to XO increases the loss of RBC transferred
into mice. We will also use specific inhibitors of XO to determine whether XO activity is a major contributor to
anemia.
The validation of XO as a contributor to anemia may open new possibilities for much needed adjunctive therapy
in malaria and other infection-induced hemolytic anemias."
10872207,"Project Summary/Abstract: Effector T cells mediate protective tumor immunity. The goal of tumor immune
therapy including check-point blockade and immune vaccination and adoptive effector T cell is to engender
long-term protective effector T cell immunity, and cause tumor eradiation in patients with cancer. To this end,
effector T cells must traffic into and retain within the tumor microenvironment with potent effector function.
Interestingly, the central scientific efforts in the field of tumor immunology are focused on designing different
combinatorial therapeutic regimens with PD-L1/PD-1 blockade, exploring new types of CAR-T cells, and
evaluating a variety of potential neoantigen cancer vaccination. However, T cells are highly dysfunctional and
susceptible to apoptosis in the tumor microenvironment. Our current knowledge of tumor associated effector T
cell survival and functionality, and its underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood in patients
with cancer. This inadvertent deficiency significantly tempers our efforts toward understanding basic human
effector T cell biology, establishing and evaluating immune therapeutic regimens and tumor vaccines in treating
patients with cancer. It is essential to conduct comprehensive molecular and functional research on the nature
of effector T cell survival and function in the human tumor microenvironment.
Abnormal epigenetic pattern correlates to effector T cell malfunction in tumor. However, their potential causal
and mechanistic connection is poorly defined. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) links one-carbon metabolism to
methylation status. Using patients with colon cancer and mice bearing different types of cancer, our preliminary
studies demonstrated that tumor cells altered methionine metabolism in CD8+ T cells, resulting in insufficient
intracellular methionine, low methyl donor SAM, and diminished H3K79me2. Loss of H3K79me2 led to reduced
STAT5 expression and activation, resulting in impaired T cell-mediated tumor immunity. Mechanistically, tumor
cells were addicted to methionine and outcompeted T cells for methionine via high expression of SLC43A2, a
methionine transporter. These data revealed previously unknown mechanisms of association between specific
amino acid metabolism, epigenetic alteration and T cell immunity in the tumor microenvironment and identified
cancer methionine transporter(s) as a potential novel immunotherapeutic target.
Based on this surprising and novel finding, we hypothesize that dysfunctional methionine metabolism is not
only a novel immune evasion mechanism, but also a key link between specific histone pattern alteration and
survival/functional gene circuits in effector T cells in the tumor microenvironment. We propose two specific
aims to mechanistically, functionally, and clinically test our central hypothesis that (1) methionine metabolic
circuit controls effector T cell survival and functional potency in the tumor microenvironment, and (2) particular
tumor solute carrier family (SLC) member(s) affects T cell methionine metabolism, function and protective
immunity."

The postdoctoral training grant entitled “The Neurobiology of Aging and Alzheimer's Disease” is submitted
through the University of Arizona on behalf of the Arizona Alzheimer's Consortium. The training faculty chosen
from the Consortium consist of highly interactive investigators whose scientific interests include aging,
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) and spans fly, rodent, and nonhuman primate
models of aging, as well as human studies in normative and pathological conditions of aging. Six institutions
within the Consortium contribute Primary Mentors (Preceptors) and Affiliate Faculty to this Training Program,
including: The University of Arizona, Arizona State University, Barrow Neurological Institute, Banner Sun
Health Research Institute, The Translational Genomics Research Institute, and Banner Alzheimer's Institute.
Faculty have complementary strengths in brain imaging, computer science, genomics, molecular biology, basic
systems, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, experimental therapeutics, computational and statistical
analyses of complex datasets and clinical neuropathological approaches. The research is aimed at promoting
the scientific understanding of the aging brain, early detection of AD and ADRD and developing effective
treatment and prevention therapies. Fellows benefit from a 4 person Professional Development Committee
(PDC) whose purpose is to provide guidance on the creation of a collaborative experimental training plan that
fosters opportunities to work, learn and produce across institutions. The primary research Mentor, in whose
laboratory the Fellow is based, is chosen from the Preceptor list, as is the secondary research Mentor, but they
can be from any institution amongst the consortium. The secondary Mentor plays an active role in the
research undertaken by the Fellow, which goes beyond making facilities available. A tertiary Mentor is
selected on the basis of experimental or pedagogical expertise, and a fourth member of the PDC is chosen
from amongst the 6-person leadership team to provide an additional level of oversight. Exposure to the unique
Arizona tradition of cooperation and collaboration that knows no institutional boundaries has significantly
enriched the skill sets and professional development of our Fellows during the training period. In addition to
multi-laboratory research exposure, another unique programmatic aspect takes the form of three workshops
per year, varying from 1-3 days, in which all Fellows participate. These include statewide events that Training
Faculty attend (Annual Arizona Alzheimer's Consortium Retreat), or that faculty, graduate students and
postdocs attend (Alzheimer's Consortium Annual Scientific Conference), as well as broader participation in
national and international professional events (e.g., Society for Neuroscience meeting). Our goal to give the
Fellow the freedom to draw broadly from facilities and expertise across the Consortium has exposed our
Trainees to the power of collaborative, interdisciplinary interactions that can facilitate development of strong
experimental designs to test important questions, providing the foundation for productive future work."
10868792,"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic debilitating pain condition that affects about four million people in the U.S. alone.
Current treatment of FM focuses on symptomatic management because the etiology of FM remains poorly
understood. It is pivotal to develop and validate new animal models to provide a preclinical platform to evaluate
novel therapeutics and conduct in-depth mechanistic investigations. There is significant heterogeneity in FM
etiologies, among which deranged gut homeostasis has been strongly implicated. Intestinal alkaline phosphatase
(IAP), a gut brush border enzyme, is a critical regulator of gut homeostasis. IAP deficiency alters gut bacterial
composition, increases gut permeability, and induces persistent low-grade systemic inflammation. We recently
observed that mice with IAP deficiency [IAP knockout (KO)] demonstrate a robust FM-like phenotype and gut-
derived pathophysiological changes: a) hypersensitivity to mechanical, thermal, and cold stimulation; b)
spontaneous pain behavior; c) fatigue-, anxiety-, and depression-like behaviors; d) signs of deranged gut
homeostasis; e) brain neuroinflammation; f) altered skeletal muscle characteristics; and g) improvement of FM-
like behavior with the gabapentinoid or IAP treatment. We have also detected decreased IAP activity in fecal
samples of FM patients. Accordingly, we propose a novel animal model of FM in IAP KO mice predicated on
the important role of deranged gut homeostasis in the FM pathophysiology. In the R61 phase, reliability and
reproducibility of behavior-phenotyping of IAP KO mice will be established. In the R33 phase, face, construct
and predictive validity will be assessed. In Aim 1 (R61), we will expand our existing IAP KO mice colonies to
obtain sex- and age-matched male and female IAP KO mice and WT (wild type) littermates. Fifteen behavioral
tests in eight domains will be standardized to evaluate behavioral readouts using composite weighted Z-scores
as a primary outcome measure. Reliability of behavioral tests will be assessed by a test-retest procedure in the
same cohort of age- and sex-matched IAP KO mice and WT mice by two testers blinded to the genotype.
Reproducibility of the behavioral phenotype will be assessed by two independent research groups using IAP KO
mice and WT mice raised in two independent animal facilities. In Aim 2 (R33), we will compare behavioral
readouts in IAP KO mice with a) clinical FM symptoms and b) epidemiological FM features (female vs. male;
prevailing ages) to assess the face validity. Construct validity will be examined by comparing biochemical and
histological profiles of IAP KO mice with the pathophysiological features identified in FM patients. In Aim 3 (R33),
we will assess the predictive validity of this mouse model using FDA-approved FM treatment or exogenous IAP
supplementation. Reduced opioid responsiveness, a clinical finding in FM patients, also will be examined. We
anticipate that this preclinical FM model would be instrumental in developing innovative FM biomarkers and
therapeutics. This mouse model also lends itself to investigating the molecular mechanisms of FM when
combined with leading-edge technologies including genetic tools."
10873003,"Schizophrenia (SZ) is a severe and chronic psychiatric illness characterized by cognitive dysfunction. SZ
has a higher prevalence in Veterans and is associated with increased disability and mortality in Veterans.
Genome-wide association studies have identified variants of microglia-related genes as risk factors for SZ.
How such genetic factors might be manifest as molecular alterations in microglia in SZ is not clear.
Understanding microglial function in SZ is important because microglia are involved in the phagocytosis of
dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons. Spines, which receive most of the excitatory input to pyramidal
neurons, are critical mediators of the cognitive functions that are impaired in SZ. Spine density is lower
principally in deep layer 3 of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in SZ, and PFC layer 3 has been reported to subserve
cognitive processes affected in the illness. Thus, we hypothesize that the dendritic spine deficit in deep
layer 3 of the PFC in SZ is due to increased phagocytosis of spines by microglia.
 Testing our central hypothesis requires answering the following questions. First, do microglia in SZ show a
profile of critical molecular features that enables increased spine phagocytosis (Aim 1)? We will quantify levels
of both newly discovered and established transcripts that are selectively expressed by microglia and are
involved in phagocytosis of dendritic spines (or the inhibition of phagocytosis) in laser microdissected deep
layer 3 of PFC area 46 in SZ (n=32; 50% Veterans) and unaffected comparison subjects (n=32; 50%
Veterans). We predict that SZ subjects have higher mRNA levels of microglia-specific markers that promote
spine phagocytosis and lower mRNA levels of markers that inhibit phagocytosis. We will also use a novel
quadruple-label RNAscope approach to quantify transcript levels in individual microglia to determine if all, or
only some, microglia show molecular alterations in SZ. We predict that transcripts promoting spine
phagocytosis are elevated in only a subset of microglia in SZ, which could account for findings that spine
density is ~20% lower and most prominent in deep layer 3 of the PFC in SZ.
 Second, are spine deficits in deep layer 3 of the PFC in SZ associated with molecular and morphological
features that indicate increased spine phagocytosis in nearby individual microglia (Aim 2)? Microglia and their
associated processes have their own individual territorial organization, permitting the quantification of dendritic
spines located exclusively within the territory of an individual microglia. Therefore, in the same subjects studied
in Aim 1, we will use a quintuple-label confocal immunofluorescence microscopy approach to quantify the
density of spines identified using two markers within 3D sampling regions constrained to the territorial domain
of individual microglia. We will also quantify levels of CR3, which is involved in complement-mediated
microglial phagocytosis of spines, and CD68, a phagocytic marker, and microglial process volume and
complexity, which are associated with levels of spine phagocytosis, in individual microglia. We predict that
spine density is inversely correlated with CR3 and CD68 levels and microglial process volume and complexity
in nearby individual microglia in SZ subjects.
 Investigating the relationship between microglia-mediated spine phagocytosis and spine deficits in SZ
will enable the pursuit of novel molecular targets for microglial inhibitors that may remediate dendritic spine
deficits and repair synaptic connectivity, and possibly cognitive dysfunction, in Veterans with SZ."

10871259,"ABSTRACT
One of the biggest challenges for the development of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and
therapeutics is the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with immune-escape or resistance mutations. Multiple
evidence points to the chronic infection of immunocompromised hosts, especially individuals with hematologic
malignancies, as one of the main mechanisms for the emergence and spread of these variants. While most
people with a competent immune system successfully clear SARS-CoV-2 infection within days, some patients
with hematologic malignancies and weakened immunity get persistently infected for months with virus replicating
often at high titers. As for other RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 replication can lead to the rapid accumulation of
mutations over time. Thus, persistent infection of an immunocompromised host provides the timeframe during
which the virus accumulates more genetic mutations than expected from individual infections without the need
of transmission to another host. Moreover, these individuals could remain contagious for longer periods of time
and sustain transmission to the community of variants potentially associated with virus fitness advantages,
including increased transmissibility or resistance to COVID-19 vaccines or treatments. Which host immune
background enables chronic infection, what specific selection acts on the virus, and what effects on the host do
emerging mutations exert over the course of the disease are currently unknown. Moreover, there are no tools
that allow the early identification of subjects that will develop prolonged infection. We hypothesize that specific
defects in B and T cell populations that favor prolonged infection can be leveraged for the development of an
early prediction tool to identify subjects with protracted infection where the virus is accumulating mutations. To
address this, we will integrate patient level and epidemiological data with immune profiling and SARS-CoV-2
deep sequencing to: (1) determine the immune defects linked to prolonged replication or acute disease; (2)
ascertain the effect of different immunosuppressive conditions and therapeutics on SARS-CoV-2 genetic
diversity within the infected host.
Our studies will advance our understanding of the immune mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV2 persistence in
the immunocompromised host and inform the development of optimal therapies and public health interventions
to prevent the emergence and spread of new viral variants. This approach, if successful, is also relevant to other
respiratory viruses."
10870880,"The instrumental role of systematic gene knockdown studies, using RNA interference (RNAi), in identifying
lifespan-extending gene alterations in model organisms like C. elegans is well established. In contrast,
systematic gene overexpression remains mostly unexplored, representing a major knowledge gap in our
understanding of the genetic basis of longevity and health. This gap exists primarily due to previous technological
limitations which restricted studies to a limited selection of candidate genes. The recent advancements in
CRISPR technology for C. elegans overcome those hurdles. These innovations allow rapid, conditional
overexpression of specific genes simply by expressing dead Cas9 (dCas9) fused to a transcriptional activation
domain in chosen tissues and feeding the organism bacteria carrying a particular guide RNA at the desired time
(feeding CRISPRa). This technological leap allows for a systematic identification of genes that modulate
longevity and health. This novel approach could identify a new class of genes pivotal for longevity and health,
transforming our understanding of aging and disease. Our objective in this proposal is to identify new
determinants of lifespan and health by extending these gene-specific overexpression tools to a genome scale.
Results enabled by our labs’ collaborations and joint expertise make us uniquely well prepared to undertake the
proposed research. Specifically, (i) the Apfeld lab pioneered genetic approaches to aging in C. elegans, (ii) the
Levine lab pioneered systems biology approaches in C. elegans, (iii) both labs developed innovative, high-
throughput approaches to study aging and resilience, including the automated Lifespan Machine scanner cluster,
(iv) both labs have robust molecular biology expertise, and (v) we confirmed that feeding CRISPRa works in our
hands for several genes. The rationale of the proposed research is twofold: identifying genes that prolong
lifespan can pave the way for the development of new therapies to promote healthy aging and treat age-related
diseases, while understanding genes that shorten lifespan can provide insights into disorders of accelerated
aging and guide strategies to manage or mitigate their impact. We will accomplish these goals by pursuing two
specific aims: in Aim 1 we will build a well-characterized gene-activation toolkit that enables time-dependent and
tissue-specific systematic gene activation in C. elegans; in Aim 2 we will use this toolkit to identify the set of
genes that modulate C. elegans lifespan and health when activated. The approach is innovative, in our opinion,
because it pioneers the use of a rapid and simple CRISPR-activation technology to systematically identify new
determinants of lifespan and health. This contribution will be significant because it is anticipated to provide a
foundation for understanding how deliberate genetic activation can influence longevity and health, with potential
applications to aging-related diseases and general health maintenance. Moreover, by equipping the C. elegans
research community with a novel genome-scale toolkit for precise gene overexpression control, we are removing
a major obstacle hindering the study of gene functions associated with aging."
10870883,"The primary function of the lung is gas exchange. Immune cells and airway nerves orchestrate interoceptive
defensive responses and adjustments to homeostatic function that preserve airway patency, eliminate noxious
irritants and pathogens from air spaces, clear airway mucus, and optimize the work of breathing. Dysfunction
or dysregulation of these systems directly contribute to the emergence of the physiological and
pathophysiological attributes of respiratory diseases and their associated symptoms. Sensory nerves often
rely on specialized chemosensory signaling mechanisms at their nerve terminals to transduce mucosal
irritation. In the airways, we have described the chemosensory functions of brush cells, their association with
the peripheral terminals of vagal afferent nerves and the reflex effects resulting from their activation. The
central hypothesis of this research proposal is that brush cells orchestrate both immune and reflex responses
in the airways and lungs. We further hypothesize that brush cell dysfunction may contribute to the emergence
of symptoms associated with both acute and chronic diseases of the airways and lungs. Studies proposed
herein aim to: 1) characterize the mechanisms by which brush cells are activated, how they transmit their
activation to adjacent sensory nerves, and the reflexes initiated upon their activation; and 2) determine the role
of ATP and the unique expression of carbonic anhydrase by airway brush cells in transducing airway mucosal
irritation, acidification of airway surface liquid and the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the airway lumen. We
will utilize the innovative techniques that are unique to our laboratories, including transgenic approaches
enabling optical recordings of afferent neurons and brush cells, reflex physiological recordings, single afferent
neuron recording and our molecular approaches to studying both neurons and brush cells. Our focus on brush
cell interactions with afferent nerves is a logical direction for our group, and our plans for hypothesis testing will
be enabled by intriguing recent discoveries summarized below in our Research Strategy. We anticipate that
the results of these proposed studies will reveal novel roles for brush cells and ATP in transducing reflexes
resulting from mucosal irritation in the airways of patients with chronic diseases of the airways and lungs."
10871433,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
As the world ages, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and related dementias are quickly becoming some of the most
pernicious and burdensome diseases around the globe. This burden is particularly high for Latinx older adults,
who have a higher risk of developing AD, and exhibit age-related cognitive decline earlier and with more severe
dementia symptoms than non-Latinx Whites. Despite these known disparities, the Latinx community continues
to be significantly under-represented in AD research. Toward this end, preliminary evidence suggests that
mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) – which refer to training of mindfulness meditation skills in group-based
settings – may help prevent AD in at-risk Latinx individuals. Indeed, MBPs have been found to improve
cognitive health and psychological well-being by addressing major AD risk factors (e.g., chronic stress,
depression), and as such, have significant potential as a low-cost and scalable lifestyle intervention to reduce
AD vulnerability. However, a significant challenge to further research in this area is that the traditional curricular
format of MBPs may not be applicable, relevant, or accessible to Latinx older adults, due to language and cultural
barriers, as well as disparities in access to health care. The goal of this R61 proposal is to address this challenge
by evaluating the feasibility and effectiveness of a culturally-adapted MBP that is sensitive to the specific
needs of the Latinx older adult community. To achieve this goal, we fully leverage the complementary expertise
of our investigative team, drawing on the extensive experience and strong community partnerships forged by
co-PI Parra Perez in adapting mindfulness-based stress reduction (the most widely utilized MBP) for use
with Spanish-speaking immigrant communities, by further refining the curriculum to be targeted towards Latinx
older adults. We rigorously examine the MBP intervention, in terms of effectiveness and key mechanisms of
action, drawing upon cutting-edge advances in the cognitive neuroscience of aging and mindfulness
science, by utilizing a powerful new experimental design strategy developed by co-PI Braver with post-
doctoral fellow Lin. Specifically, we utilize a longitudinal EEG protocol to test whether enhanced engagement
of a focused attention mindfulness state is selectively related to neurocognitive benefits, while monitoring
the translation of mindfulness into daily-life contexts through an Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
protocol delivered via a customized mobile application designed specifically for use with Spanish-speaking
Latinx older adults. Finally, we test for the role of preclinical AD and related neurodegeneration in moderating
MBP-related benefits, using state-of-the-art blood plasma-based biomarkers to assess AD risk with low cost
and participant burden. This proposed project is a direct response to recurrent calls for prioritizing the creation
and dissemination of culturally informed research approaches and programs for Latinx populations. The study
will provide a rich set of preliminary pilot data that can be used to inform a subsequent early-stage clinical
trial at reducing AD prevalence/burden within the Latinx community."
10871645,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT

Insomnia disorder is a common and consequential mental health problem, with prevalence estimates at approximately 10%. The American College of Physicians recommends cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), an efficacious “mind” (psychological and behavioral) treatment, as the first-line treatment for adults with insomnia. Yet, about half of individuals experience residual insomnia symptoms after CBT-I. Accordingly, researchers have sought to augment CBT-I, primarily with pharmacotherapy, but many people do not want to use pharmacologic agents due to concerns about side effects and dependence. Passive-body heating (PBH), a “body” treatment, involves heating the body via hot baths or showers, infrared sauna, or other heat sources. PBH has been found to reduce the time needed to fall asleep and to improve sleep quality. PBH may improve sleep by increasing skin temperature and decreasing core body temperature, a dynamic associated with sleep onset. CBT-I and PBH thus target distinct factors that may contribute to insomnia, and their integration holds promise as a multi-component treatment for insomnia disorder. The overarching goal of the proposed project is to conduct feasibility and acceptability testing of an integrated CBT-I and PBH intervention for insomnia disorder. Participants will complete digital CBT-I (dCBT-I), which is similarly efficacious to traditional CBT-I but with increased potential for scalability, and PBH sessions using a water-sparing, commercially available, lightweight infrared sauna blanket that requires only a regular household outlet. Study 1 will iteratively refine and protocolize study procedures, such as study assessments and the frequency and duration of PBH sessions, in a single-arm trial (N=10). Study 2 will test recruitment, randomization, and retention procedures in a pilot two-arm RCT comparing dCBT-I+PBH to dCBT-I alone (N=40). Studies 1 and 2 will both include a 9-week intervention period and a 6-month follow-up period. The proposed project will prepare the integrated intervention and RCT procedures for a future remotely delivered clinical efficacy trial that tests for added benefit of dCBT-I+PBH above dCBT-I alone. The proposed mind-body treatment option for insomnia holds potential as a scalable, cost-effective, remotely delivered, non-drug treatment option for millions of individuals struggling with insomnia."
10871662,"Project Summary
STriatal-Enriched tyrosine Phosphatase (STEP) is a neuron-specific protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) and a
novel therapeutic target for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder for which no
cure currently exists. Multiple studies indicate that levels of STEP are elevated in AD and other
neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and fragile X
syndrome. The data suggest that increased STEP activity interferes with synaptic function and contributes to the
characteristic cognitive and behavioral deficits in these devastating diseases. Crossing STEP KO mice with
mouse models of AD, schizophrenia, or fragile X syndrome completely reversed the cognitive and behavioral
deficits, generating progeny with lower STEP levels indistinguishable from WT mice. Similar effects were
observed when STEP was pharmacologically inhibited by our tool compound TC-2153. These studies validate
STEP as a novel drug target for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric
disorders. TC-2153 is the only reported STEP inhibitor with cellular and in vivo activity. However, TC-2153 and
similar compounds are known to react with cellular thiols and modify DNA, precluding this inhibitor from further
preclinical studies. Other reported STEP inhibitors suffer from poor selectivity for STEP and lack of efficacy under
physiological conditions. To overcome these typical challenges for inhibitors targeting PTPs - enzymes that have
a highly conserved and highly charged active site - we set out to discover small molecules that bind to less
conserved, allosteric sites in STEP. Using innovative fragment-based screening technologies, we identified 19
fragments, low molecular weight compounds adhering to the “rule of 3”, that selectively bind to novel, less
conserved sites in STEP with up to single digit micromolar affinity. These fragments are ideal starting points for
generating STEP-targeted degraders such as proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) with physicochemical
properties suitable for crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In fact, in preliminary experiments we have
demonstrated that a PROTAC based on our best fragment can effectively reduce STEP levels in vivo. Based on
these exciting results, we propose a STEP-targeted protein degradation approach as a therapeutic strategy in
AD. In Aim 1, we will optimize our fragment binders for ligand efficiency and STEP selectivity. In Aim 2, we will
generate STEP PROTACs from the most promising binders, assess them in our established testing funnel, and
optimize them for drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and toxicity (Tox)
properties. The goal is to generate non-toxic STEP degraders with exposure and efficacy in the brain. In Aim 3,
we will test whether candidate PROTACs are able to improve cognition in mouse AD models. Our studies are
designed to provide proof-of-concept (POC) for STEP degraders as novel therapeutics in AD. We expect to
develop at least one lead series and one backup series of effective PROTACs that are ready for preclinical
development towards a first-in-class early treatment option for AD."
10873098,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 This proposal describes a novel biomaterial and synthetic anticoagulant. Anticoagulants are a mainstay
of modern surgery and of clotting disorder management such as venous thrombosis, yet performance and
supply limitations exist for the most widely used agent - heparin. Specifically, heparin’s heterogeneous
structure affords highly variable activity, patient-dependent dose-responses, and life-threatening side effects
such as heparin induced thrombocytopenia. Additionally, African Swine Fever (a double-stranded DNA virus
in the Asfarviridae family) has wiped out over one-quarter of the world’s pig population leading to global
shortages, contamination issues, and the need for alternatives – i.e., anticoagulants of non-animal origin.
We propose the use of disulfated poly-amido-saccharides (PASs) as heparin mimetics. PASs are new well-
defined, enantiopure carbohydrate polymers that are stereochemically defined, hydrophilic, and possess
pyranose rings in the backbone. PASs are efficiently synthesized by the anionic ring-opening polymerization
reaction of a β-lactam sugar monomer in high-yields with batch-to-batch consistency, defined molecular
weights, and low polydispersity. Sulfation of PAS yields such unique heparin mimetics. Herein, we describe
the novel synthesis along with detailed in vitro and ex vivo mechanism-of-action and in vivo efficacy studies.
The proposed experiments will define the molecular and structural basis for anticoagulant activity
of disulfated PAS (disulPAS) and will test the hypothesis that regioselectively functionalized
disulPASs will be: 1) efficacious in vivo with activity equivalent to or better than low molecular
weight heparin (LMWH); and 2) neutralized by protamine sulfate unlike synthetic Fondaparinux.
Further, sulPAS anticoagulant activity will depend on the number and the position of sulfate
functionalization and not be associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Importantly,
substantial preliminary data support the proposed studies, well-characterized materials and rigorous
experimental designs are established, and essential cross-disciplinary collaborations and expertise are in
place to address the hypotheses. The specific aims of this five-year proposal are as follows. Aim 1
synthesizes and characterizes new regioselectively disulfated PAS. Aim 2 evaluates the in vitro/ex vivo
anticoagulant activity and determines the mechanism of action (MOA) of disulfated PASs. Aim 3 defines the
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of lead disulPAS candidates and efficacy in rodent models of
thromboprophylaxis and bleeding risk."
10874120,"Abstract
 Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that occurs in about 1:3000 individuals. NF1 is caused
by inheritance or de novo mutation/loss of the NF1 gene. Individuals with NF1 are predisposed to numerous
manifestations, including the development of plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) and/or optic pathway glioma (OPG).
Unlike in more aggressive tumors, apart from changes at NF1, PNF cells do not show many recurrent somatic
changes; somatic changes in OPG are rare. Twin studies suggest that germline modifiers of NF1 disease exist,
but these remain largely unstudied. Because the identification of NF1 modifiers should enable risk stratification
and identification of targetable therapeutic pathways in individuals with NF1 we developed a multidisciplinary
team of geneticists, bioinformaticians, statisticians and animal (mouse and fish) modelers. Relying on close
collaboration among team members, we will continue identifying genes showing increased numbers of potentially
disruptive variants to study. In Aim 1, we will expand our number of individuals with PNF and/or OPG and test if
variants are associated with tumor number, tumor burden, or presence of OPG. In Aim 2, we will test candidates
in a well-characterized mouse model of plexiform neurofibroma, using the power of mouse genetics. To enhance
rapid screening of relevant genes and variants we generated a zebrafish model of PNF and OPG, which will be
exploited in Aim 3, by screening for effects of larger numbers of genes predicted to act as NF1 modifiers. The
proposed research will provide a basis for precision medicine in NF1. If risk variants in genes are associated
with disease severity and/or correlate with tumor burden, then the development of genomic risk assessment
tools will be possible at diagnosis."

LAG3 (CD233) is an inhibitory receptor that plays a critical role in controlling T cell tolerance, preventing
autoimmunity and limiting immune-mediated tissue damage. It is highly upregulated on exhausted T cells in
tumors and in chronic viral infections, limiting the development of sterilizing immunity. Consequently, LAG3 is
now a major immunotherapeutic target for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. In early 2022, the FDA
approved a combinatorial treatment with anti-PD1 and anti-LAG3 for treatment of metastatic melanoma. Despite
extensive analysis of LAG3 for over 33 years and with more than 20 LAG3 targeting therapeutic antagonists in
the clinic, there is still a considerable number of critical, unanswered questions regarding how LAG3 works and
thus whether we have, and how we might develop, not only more optimal LAG3-targeting therapeutic antagonists
but also therapeutic agonists to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Therefore, our goal for this
proposal is to gain critical insight into the requirements for optimal LAG3 function enabling us to design more
efficacious immunotherapeutic strategies that block or enhance LAG3 function.
AIM 1: Determine the impact of EP-mediated LAG3 signaling and its importance relative to other motifs.
We will address 2 questions: (A) What is the importance of the LAG3 EP motif in vivo relative to other motifs?
(B) What is the relative importance, hierarchy and functional impact of all LAG3 motifs?
AIM 2: Define LAG3-TCR/CD3 association and its functional relevance compared to MHCII and FGL1. We
will address the structural basis for the biological function of LAG3 by asking 4 questions: (A) Which
regions/residues mediate LAG3 interaction with TCR/CD3 and are they distinct from those that mediate MHCII
or FGL1 interaction? (B) What is the relative importance of LAG3 association with TCR/CD3 versus MHCII and
FGL1 in mediating its function? (C) Do current clinical antibodies disrupt LAG3 association with TCR/CD3 and/or
FGL1 relative to MHCII? (D) Can we enhance LAG3 function?
AIM 3: Define the functional impact of LAG3 dimerization. We will address 3 questions: (A) What are the
functional consequences of monomeric versus dimeric LAG3? (B) Does the proportion LAG3 dimer on the cell
surface change depending upon activation status? (C) Can LAG3 dimerization be modulated by anti-LAG3
mAbs?
Given our extensive analysis of LAG3 function for ~25 years, the unique tools we have in hand, and our
strong and technically diverse collaborative team, we are ideally positioned to conduct this research.
Successful completion of this project will significantly enhance our understanding of LAG3 function and
mechanism of action, providing key insight to generate enhanced LAG3 therapeutics that can improve
treatment for multiple diseases."

interactions and has broad applications in protein science and drug discovery. This instrument is capable of real-
time kinetic measurements using very low sample amounts. The long-term objective of this application is to
provide the infrastructure needed to measure biomolecular interactions at Fresno State. The users of this
instrument propose multi-disciplinary research and educational projects that measure protein interactions in a
range of applications including: antibody engineering, cancer drug discovery, anti-bacterial peptides, and protein
nanomaterials. The Nicoya Alto instrument will also be used in an educational capacity to train a generation of
undergraduate students in the fundamentals of protein structure relationships and quantitative binding. Fresno

10877462,"Voice disorders occur in 6–17% of children, resulting in dysphonia (i.e., altered vocal quality) which has
significant negative health, social, emotional, and educational consequences if left untreated. The most common
cause of dysphonia in children is vocal fold nodules (VFN), callus-like growths on the vocal folds. Although voice
therapy is the preferred treatment, over one-third of children do not show clinically meaningful improvements
from therapy. Two critical issues contribute to this lack of impactful therapeutic changes: 1) children are not mini-
adults, and 2) dysphonia reduction may not be a salient and motivating goal for all children. To maximize
treatment effectiveness for the dynamic pediatric system, we propose shifting from a narrow focus on dysphonia
to a broader focus on improving speech intelligibility. This proposal will examine previously collected speech
samples from children with VFN between 3 – 9 years, a critical developmental period. Speech samples will be
compiled from clinical databases from three top pediatric voice centers, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia,
Boston Children’s Hospital, and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center. Aim 1 will define the relationship
between dysphonia and measures of intelligibility (e.g., speech intelligibility, speech naturalness). As intelligible
speech production requires coordination of the vocal and articulatory systems, we hypothesize that the significant
developmental changes in these systems will impact the relationship between dysphonia and intelligibility. Aim
2 will determine the extent that acoustic measures of the developing vocal system, developing articulatory
system, and dysphonia severity contribute to the relationship between dysphonia and intelligibility. The acoustic
measures with the largest contribution to the relationship between dysphonia and intelligibility will be examined
in a subsequent R01 grant to determine which therapy tasks elicit the largest change in these measures. These
therapy tasks will then be examined in a randomized controlled trial to test their efficacy and effectiveness in
improving intelligibility in children with VFN. This research program is designed to address multiple priority areas
of the NIDCD, with an overall emphasis on improving human communication (Priority Area 4). The current grant
focuses on understanding diseases and disorders (Priority Area 2), with outcomes indicating which acoustic
measures are the ideal method of predicting intelligibility in this population. This R21 lays the groundwork for the
subsequent R01, a randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of therapy tasks at different
developmental stages. This research program will therefore optimize treatment for children with VFN (Priority
Area 3), providing information on developmentally appropriate therapy tasks for this underserved and vulnerable
population. The research will be completed at Temple University (R1 university), which maintains a robust
research environment with exceptional dedication and support to early-career faculty. Outcomes from this
proposal will lay the foundation for a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and treat children with voice
disorders, an understudied and underserved clinical population."
10877461,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Psychiatry faces a significant challenge in the absence of objective measures to assess behavior. Clinicians
form clinical opinions based largely on their impressions from interviewing and what they read in the electronic
health record. As a result, we are currently unable to provide reliable prognoses on an individual basis. One
untapped source of behavioral information for clinical decision-making is the clinical interview itself, which
forms the foundation of the electronic health record (EHR). Every clinical visit provides a wealth of behavioral
information comprising spoken language, eye contact, and facial expressions from both the patient and the
clinician. Another source of behavioral data, which is ecologically valid, comes from smartphones, which
provide physical activity metrics (e.g., step count, distance traveled), geolocation, social interactions (e.g., SMS
messages and phone calls made and received), sleep patterns and audio data from diaries. By analyzing
these rich behavioral datasets from routine clinical visits and smartphones, we can develop clinical signatures
for particularly clinically relevant outcomes in young help-seeking people, namely treatment disengagement,
ER visits and hospitalizations. These individualized clinical signatures are important for the real-life situation
that confronts both clinician and patient at the first visit to a mental health clinic. This proposal includes all new
patients (N = 2100), ages 15 to 30, who seek treatment for the first time at one of six outpatient mental health
clinics in the Mount Sinai Health system. Aim 1 is to create a baseline clinical signature for outcomes using
deep neural network modeling of legacy EHR data and baseline behavior, which includes audiovisual
recordings of intake interviews, ratings of working alliance, and brief surveys and tests of cognition. Aim 2 is to
use Contextual Bandit to create a longitudinal clinical signature for outcomes based on subsequent behavioral
data from clinical interviews (and their accompanying notes), and smartphone passive data and audio diary
data. Contextual Bandit is a model that keeps updating probabilities and odds over time as it is given new data.
Aim 3 is to create clinical signatures based on EHR data alone, such that the added value of behavioral data
for Aims 1 and 2 can be quantified. Study assessments are standard, low-cost, and easy to administer, with
good variance, validity, reliability, and attention to bias. Across all aims, fusion will be used for behavioral
feature extraction and natural language processing (NLP) for analysis of both written language (clinical text)
and spoken language (clinical visits and audio diaries). Data science methods have been optimized for
partnership with the DCC. Health equity, community engagement and ethical issues re privacy, informed
consent and fairness have been prioritized."
10877556,"ABSTRACT: Binaural hearing allows people to benefit from perceiving sounds from different spatial locations
and is critical in solving the “cocktail party problem” (i.e., understanding speech in the presence of competing
background sounds and noise). A vast majority of human binaural-hearing data have been collected in partici-
pants with highly symmetric hearing thresholds (≤10 dB threshold differences across the ears). Those with hear-
ing asymmetries will include many of the 80 million “Baby Boomers” in the US who are reaching the important
milestone of older age (>65 yrs). As we get older, hearing loss increases, binaural abilities decrease, and the
cocktail party problem becomes increasingly difficult. We know very little about how binaural hearing is impacted
by hearing asymmetries and how it changes across the lifespan. The long-term goal of this research is to deter-
mine the mechanisms underlying how age and hearing loss impact speech-perception in noise and cocktail-
party situations. The objective of this proposed project is to understand how age-related binaural-hearing deficits
are affected by small to large hearing asymmetries. To achieve this objective, we will undertake two specific
aims: 1) generate an audiological and binaural-hearing dataset for a large cohort of participants that vary in
hearing asymmetry, age, and hearing loss; and 2) use machine learning to generate innovative and unexpected
hypotheses relating audiometric variables and basic binaural-hearing abilities to the cocktail-party problem. The
need is great because the typical approach usually provides modest (and expected) increments of knowledge.
Using of machine learning has the power to uncover complex associations in large data sets to generate inno-
vative and unexpected hypotheses, but has not yet been applied to understanding aging, hearing loss, and
binaural hearing. This knowledge will help us better understand how hearing asymmetries affect communication
in cocktail-party situations as individuals age and lose their hearing. This contribution of this research is signifi-
cant because it will lead to improvements and breakthroughs in audiological care and hearing interventions,
which will only be possible once we better understand how the cocktail party problem and spatial-hearing abilities
change with age, hearing loss, and hearing asymmetry."
10889906,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Several independent lines of evidence suggest that sleep disturbance may directly contribute
to the generation and maintenance of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) including anxiety, depression, agitation,
irritability, and apathy through fronto-limbic brain networks that regulate emotion, particularly in regions of the
prefrontal cortex (PFC) and limbic areas (amygdala). However, the model of sleep disturbance contributing to
increased NPS through impairments in fronto-limbic function has not yet been tested in a sample of participants
with or at high-risk for developing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: We aim to test this model in patients
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD by characterizing associations between sleep disruption,
fronto-limbic function while regulating emotion, and NPS at baseline and by experimentally manipulating sleep to
determine whether changes in sleep cause downstream alterations in fronto-limbic functioning and NPS.
DESIGN/METHODS: Our hypotheses will be tested in a 2-arm randomized controlled mechanistic trial with 150
patients with MCI and mild AD experiencing sleep disturbances who are also experiencing emotional distress
and other behavioral symptoms. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a sleep manipulation
(Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia; CBT-I) or to the credible control treatment for insomnia group.
Both interventions will be administered in six sessions delivered over eight weeks. CBT-I is an efficacious
behavioral intervention specifically targeted at improving sleep patterns through a combination of sleep
restriction, stimulus control, cognitive therapy targeting dysfunctional beliefs about sleep, and sleep hygiene
education. At baseline, and post-sleep manipulation we will assay each participant’s fronto-limbic functioning
while regulating emotions (amygdala reactivity and PFC-amygdala connectivity), NPS using the Neuropsychiatric
Inventory (NPI), and sleep efficiency using high-density EEG collected overnight during sleep. SPECIFIC AIMS
are to 1) characterize baseline associations among sleep disturbances, emotion regulation brain function, and
NPS prior to a sleep manipulation, 2) test that sleep-induced fronto-limbic brain function improvement mediates
the association between sleep improvement and NPS reductions, and 3) determine baseline predictors of the
NPS improvement. NOVELTY & IMPACT: Using a multi-methodological approach within a mechanistic trial
framework by causally manipulating sleep, we will uncover potential NPS mechanisms across multiple units of
analysis (brain circuit, physiological, behavioral, and self-report). Our results will advance a mechanistic
understanding of how sleep disturbances and fronto-limbic brain function while regulating emotions may
underlie the emotionally distressing and economically relevant problem of NPS in early AD patients. These
results would be a necessary first step in the development of sleep based, mechanism-focused preventative
strategies and treatments that are more personalized for the individual."

The primary objective of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (COVID-CT) registry is to determine if
infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes
COVID-19, results in marked progression of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in patients with previously defined
anatomic coronary artery disease (CAD). COVID-19 induces a pro-inflammatory cytokine release and pro-
thrombotic processes that we hypothesize will accelerate atherosclerotic plaque progression. Coronary
computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is a robust noninvasive method uniquely capable of measuring
angiographic stenosis and quantifying and characterizing atherosclerotic plaque. Our group has extensive
experience in large multicenter trials and registries using CCTA to identify key atherosclerotic plaque features
associated with progression and major CAD events. Moreover, we propose use of a novel CT marker of coronary
artery inflammation - the perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI) – a marker highly predictive of acute CAD events
and to assess serial changes in coronary inflammation.
COVID-19 is rapidly becoming a leading cause of death with substantial evidence that pre-existing CAD
increases risk of serious illness and mortality from COVID-19. By enrolling patients with high risk, atherosclerotic
plaque, findings from the COVID-CT registry will inform this link between the inflammatory response sustained
during COVID-19 to accelerated atherosclerotic plaque progression. If our hypotheses are confirmed, then
clinicians and patients will have clear information that viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, alter the
inflammatory milieu and accelerate progression of atherosclerosis. Importantly, a connection between COVID-
19 and CAD will broadly impact preventive risk assessment for the ~7 million patients infected with SARS-CoV-
2 and millions more yet to be tested in the United States.
To date, evidence is lacking as to whether the COVID-19 results in marked atherosclerotic plaque progression
among racially and ethnically diverse patients with CCTA-defined CAD who reside across a socioeconomically-
diverse, urban setting. The present proposal constitutes a comprehensive approach assessing the clinical
importance of atherosclerotic plaque progression following COVID-19. Currently, the implications of epicardial
coronary injury following SARS-CoV-2 infection is unknown. Yet, the inflammatory pathway of atherosclerotic
plaque progression is well studied and, as such, our hypotheses are supported by this knowledge base. The
proposed COVID-19 registry is poised to provide an improved mechanistic understanding of the role of viral
infection on alterations in atherosclerotic plaque."

career as a clinical scientist with a research focus on the examination of risk and protective factors for alcohol-
related sexual violence and bystander behavior. Ultimately, she aims to conduct research that will inform
violence prevention efforts to reduce the occurrence of alcohol-related sexual assault and its associated public
health burden. Her career development plan has been tailored to expand upon her interests and training to
date and launch her career as one of the few experts in the growing research area of bystander alcohol
intoxication. Through the unique training experiences made possible by this award, she will develop expertise
in qualitative methods and analysis, intensive longitudinal data collection, and advanced statistical analysis for
multilevel data. These skills will be solidified over the course of a 5-year training plan, which involves mentored
training experiences (including guided readings, manuscript development, grant writing, meetings) and
independent training activities (including coursework, seminars, workshops, and presentations). Members of
the mentorship team are experts in their respective fields and their complementary expertise will address
distinct training needs of the applicant. Brown University’s Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies in the
School of Public Health provides an exceptional training environment with an extraordinary record of research
and an impressive history of successfully mentoring early investigators through the transition to independence.
The primary objective of the proposed research project is to answer key questions about bystanders in drinking
contexts. Bystander-focused sexual violence prevention has proliferated in the last decade, though a
consideration of the importance of bystander alcohol use has emerged much more recently. Alcohol use—one
of the most robust predictors of sexual assault—is commonly present when bystanders have an opportunity to
combat sexual assault risk. The proposed project will use weekend morning reports about the prior evening to
elucidate the event-level effects of bystander alcohol intoxication and related contextual predictors on
bystander outcomes. Focus groups will be used following completion of the weekend morning reports to
deepen understanding of the quantitative results and inform bystander-focused sexual violence prevention.
The proposed award is consistent with training and research priorities of NIAAA’s strategic plan, including
cultivating a talented and diverse research workforce to advance the frontiers of scientific knowledge and
continuing to support research with implications for alcohol-related violence prevention."

Neutrophils, the most abundant innate immune cell type, play a critical role in clearing infections, healing wounds,
and repairing damaged tissues. Our laboratory seeks to understand how diverse inflammatory signals regulate
the neutrophil response to inflammation using engineered in vitro platforms designed to mimic in vivo biology
with human cells. Specifically, we are interested in determining how (i) secreted inflammatory signals, (ii)
multicellular interactions, and (iii) the extracellular matrix regulate neutrophil behavior with the long-term goal of
identifying targets to modulate neutrophil recruitment and function to treat infections and neutrophil-associated
diseases. To properly function, neutrophils must integrate the unique set of cues released by each inflammatory
environment into a specific, directed, and tightly regulated response. Defective neutrophil recruitment, excessive
neutrophil infiltration, or improperly controlled neutrophil function contributes to chronic infections, tissue
damage, and the progression of diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disease, and
fibrosis. The individual steps of the neutrophil response (activation, extravasation, migration, and antimicrobial
function) are coordinated by a wide variety of secreted proinflammatory signals released by the activated
vasculature, tissue resident cells, circulating cells, and pathogens; however, the different mechanisms through
which each of these soluble signals and cell populations regulate neutrophil recruitment and function are
undefined. Importantly, how neutrophil behavior varies in response to differing inflammatory cues and how
neutrophils integrate multiple cues into a directed response remain unanswered questions. This knowledge gap
exists due to the limitations of the current experimental platforms, which fail to capture the complex milieu of
signals, multicellular interactions, or three-dimensional architecture of the in vivo environment. To address this
challenge, we have recently developed a novel inflammation-on-a-chip device that includes key aspects of the
inflammatory environment including a model blood vessel, primary human immune cells, extracellular matrix,
and a source of live pathogen or proinflammatory cytokine to investigate the primary human neutrophil response
in a physiologically relevant in vitro model. Over the next five years, we will exploit the modularity of our
inflammation-on-a-chip device to develop a comprehensive understanding of how individual inflammatory stimuli
(pathogens, pathogen-associated molecular patterns, damage-associated molecular patterns, cytokines) and
interactions with varied inflammatory cell populations (endothelial cells, pericytes, macrophages, platelets)
regulate neutrophil function. We will identify key signaling molecules and signaling network hubs that broadly
regulate the neutrophil response or are uniquely important for the neutrophil response to individual stimuli. This
work builds toward our long-term goal of identifying therapeutic targets to control neutrophil behavior for the
treatment of inflammatory diseases and will advance the study of inflammation by further developing our
modular, multicellular, physiologically relevant experimental model for investigating the innate immune response."

Global health organizations have called for integrating tobacco control into HIV and tuberculosis (TB)
responses. Tobacco use worsens health outcomes of people with HIV, including conferring higher risks of TB
and of noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. How to most effectively and
efficiently incorporate tobacco control into HIV and TB care remains unclear; resource constraints necessitate
thoughtful and evidence-based planning. Determining which interventions are most effective and cost-effective,
and how to combine delivery approaches for optimal outcomes, is critically important for informing clinical
guidelines. This requires understanding the benefits and costs of various interventions, which cost-
effectiveness modeling is specifically designed to address.
The overall goal of this proposal is to promote an evidence-based approach to decisions surrounding the
integrated care and services for the overlapping tobacco, HIV, and TB epidemics in low- and middle-income
countries (LMICs). Tobacco use and cessation behaviors in LMICs may differ from those in high-income
countries and can influence the effectiveness of interventions. In this proposal, we will focus on South Africa, a
country with colliding tobacco, HIV, and TB epidemics. Our research plan includes: developing an integrated
simulation model of tobacco, HIV, and TB; parameterizing the model with behavioral, clinical, and cost data
from a community-based population cohort in South Africa and from other databases and studies; projecting
clinical and economic outcomes associated with tobacco use and cessation among people with HIV; and
conducting model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of tobacco cessation interventions, including those
combined with other HIV and TB care interventions.
This proposal brings together internationally recognized experts in fields that are complementary for the
project, including clinical policy-relevant HIV and TB simulation modeling, health behaviors, tobacco treatment
interventions, and epidemiology of HIV and comorbidities in South Africa. The investigators and institutions
have a history of highly productive collaboration. The innovative model will be the first to integrate tobacco,
HIV, and TB. The methods are highly significant and crucial for addressing questions around cost-
effectiveness and policies for integrating tobacco cessation with HIV and TB care. The model structure will
enable future analyses of tobacco cessation interventions in other settings, establishing a broad, durable
framework for policy-relevant clinical and health economic analyses."

Candidate. Dr. Meyers-Pantele applies for this K01 mentored training award with the independent career goal
of attaining a productive and independent research career as a health behavior interventionist focused on
reducing HIV disparities among women who use drugs (WWUD). Her current training, however, does not
extend beyond the secondary analysis of stigma, and substance use data, and is insufficient for in-depth
instruction on the theoretical and practical methods required for the development and implementation of health
behavior interventions for racially and ethnically diverse WWUD. Specifically, the K01 training will support her
transition to an independent career scientist by: (1) developing proficiency in intersectionality theory to inform
an intervention targeting HIV prevention service engagement and intersectional stigma for racially diverse
WWUD, (2) gaining expertise in mHealth intervention design and development to create the proposed mHealth
intervention, (3) building proficiency in the implementation of randomized controlled trials to pilot the developed
intervention, (4) strengthening her skill base in implementation science to design an intervention that has the
potential for adoption and implementation, and (5) fostering the personal development skills necessary for a
successful academic career. These training aims will be accomplished through didactic courses, training
workshops, participation in professional research networks, hands-on research, and mentored training.
Research and Environment. WWUD are at increased risk for HIV and have low levels of pre-exposure
prophylaxis knowledge and acceptance. Additionally, racially and ethnically diverse WWUD experience
intersectional stigma due to gendered and racialized social norms surrounding womanhood, motherhood,
morality, substance use, and criminality, all of which have important implications for women’s engagement with
HIV prevention services. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions and interventions that target intersectional
stigma have the potential to increase HIV prevention service engagement, but there is a dearth of interventions
tailored toward racially diverse WWUD. The proposed research will provide Dr. Meyers-Pantele with the
training to address this critical gap in HIV prevention research. She will employ qualitative methods to identify
key experiences with HIV prevention services and intersectional stigma, and potential barriers and facilitators
to intervention adoption and implementation, to inform the development of potential theory-driven mHealth
intervention components. This information will be used to develop and test the usability of the mheaLth
interventiOn To redUce Stigma (LOTUS) intervention to improve HIV prevention service engagement and
intersectional stigma for racially and ethnically diverse WWUD. Lastly, she will conduct a pilot RCT to assess
the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the LOTUS intervention. This training will uniquely
position her as one of few mHealth interventionists specializing in intersectional stigma for WWUD at UCSD."

The rapidly expanding field of therapeutic nucleic acids (TNAs) has led to an increased urgency in the
development of chemical approaches that can broaden their clinical application. In just the last 3 years the US
Food and Drug Administration has approved two TNA based drugs that treat diseases that previously had little
option for treatment. Despite these recent achievements, many clinical trials involving TNAs result in termination
due to limited efficacy, a result that is often attributed to poor delivery owing to the highly polar and charged
character of TNAs that limits accessibility to mRNA in the cytosol of cells. Many platforms deliver nucleic acids
using nanoparticle-based approaches that are internalized into cells through endocytosis mechanisms.
Therefore, a central bottleneck to their effective delivery is escaping endosomal compartments and gaining
access to the cytosol. The central vision of my research program is to address these challenges associated with
endosomal escape and TNA delivery to the cytosol at the molecular level. We aim to address these challenges
through the synthesis of nucleic acid surfactant conjugates that we have recently shown can successfully target
mRNA for gene silencing in vitro. As their design is chemically tunable, we aim to systematically assess the role
of the surfactant as it relates to the extent of endosomal escape by evaluating the importance of hydrophobic
character, net charge and size of the conjugates. We will also develop a new class of fluorescent surfactant
probes which can be used to monitored the delivery and stability of the surfactant conjugates as they are
trafficked through cells, thereby helping us to quantify the effects changes in the chemical character of the
conjugates have on cytosolic delivery. In conjunction with these studies we will determine the net effect of
chemically modifying the nucleic acid surfactant conjugates on the efficacy of gene knockdown in vitro using
DNAzymes that result in mRNA cleavage. By controlling the molecular design of individual DNAzyme-surfactant
conjugates we can better understand their mechanism of cellular entry and the properties that lead to cytosolic
access. Through successful realization of our program we will not only contribute to our understanding of the
properties that are necessary for nucleic acids to successfully gain access to the cytosol of cells but also design
a platform that will have immediate therapeutic value suitable for future translational applications."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) persist throughout life to generate all blood cells. The microenvironmental
niche critically regulates HSCs. The bone marrow is the major organ where adult HSCs reside. Rapid progress
has been made regarding the nature and mechanisms of the bone marrow HSC niche. Interestingly, HSCs
change tissues and niches during development and in stress. The fetal liver is the major hematopoietic organ
where HSCs self-renewal rapidly. Around birth, the liver loses HSC-supporting activity and HSCs egress to
seed the bone marrow. The liver can become hematopoietic and support HSCs in extramedullary
hematopoiesis (EMH) in stress and some hematologic diseases. However, in contrast to the bone marrow, little
is known about the liver HSC niche during development and in stress. Our preliminary data identified stellate
cells as a novel key component of the fetal liver HSC niche in vivo. In addition, we have identified a
transcriptional factor, Lhx2, that is required for the proper cell fate of stellate cells as the niche cell for HSCs in
the fetal liver. The goal of the proposed research is to leverage our knowledge of the fetal liver niche to
elucidate the role of Lhx2 in stellate cells during development. We will also study the nature and mechanisms
of the adult EMH liver niche. The results of these studies are expected to not only provide new insights on how
the liver niche regulates HSCs, but also have the potential to identify mechanisms mediating the generation of
new niches to amplify HSCs for clinic use."

improvement in clinical care. Obtaining funding for basic, clinical, and translational research, however, has
become increasingly difficult for clinician-investigators. Clinical neuroscience trainees require protected
research time and mentoring during formative stages of their careers to compete successfully for mentored
career (K) awards and other grants. The Columbia University Neurology Department has been a strong
proponent of incorporating research into the training experience of residents. Beginning in 1979, the
department had a T32 Clinical Neuroscience Training Program, which provided funding for PGY4 residents
and first year fellows to learn research methodology. Since 2002, a Resident Research Mentorship Program
has paired residents with faculty mentors to work on research, and since 2011 a scholarly project is required
for all residents. Beginning in March 2010, this R25 research mentorship program has provided opportunities
for 11 residents (9 neurologists, one neurosurgeon, one neuropathologist) to participate in mentored research
projects (~mean 1.4 residents per year); another three residents (1 neurologist, 2 neuropathologists) applied
for supplements in October 2018. Five residents have completed the R25 experience, including fellowship. Of
these 5, all remain involved in research and 4 obtained further funding; three (60%) have applied for K awards,
and two (40%) have obtained independent K awards (one K08, one K23); the third obtained a KL2 award and
resubmitted his K08 in November 2018. Of the five trainees still in the program, four plan to submit K award
proposals within the next 1-2 years. The present proposal describes a plan to continue this formalized resident
research experience for at least one resident (Neurology, Neuropathology, or Neurosurgery) annually who is
considered to have exceptional promise to become an independent researcher. The focus will be on a
practical, mentor-directed research experience, with limited classroom time, and participating residents will
continue to be optimally situated to compete for mentored career (K) awards at completion of training. Dr.
Elkind, the Program Director/PI, a tenured Professor of Neurology and Epidemiology at Columbia University,
has independent NIH funding for clinical research, extensive experience mentoring residents and fellows
(including directing an NINDS T32 in Neuroepidemiology), and experience reviewing grants. The newly
introduced co-Investigator and co-Director, Dr. James Goldman, is an experienced neuropathologist and NIH-
funded laboratory scientist with extensive mentoring experience. The 47 faculty members of the program are
all experienced researchers with track records of mentoring. The program will continue to be evaluated
primarily by the trainees' success in obtaining K awards, as well as by academic career placement and
productivity in publications."

Gut bacteria associate with host tissues and alter host physiology, impacting lifespan and aging.
Some types of bacteria, such as Lactobacilli, benefit health while others degrade it. A key gap in
our knowledge is how the host constructs microenvironments that coordinate colonization by
specific bacteria. In particular, which host cells (Aim 1), genes, and molecules (Aim 2) promote
colonization by specific bacteria? As an important step forward, this proposal aims to investigate
host mechanisms of bacterial colonization in Drosophila melanogaster using recently isolated
bacterial strains of Lactobacillus plantarum and Acetobacter from a wild D. melanogaster, which
are found to colonize a tightly-defined physical space in the fly gut. L. plantarum, is a probiotic in
humans, and the fly provides unique and powerful genetic resources to study homologs of human
disease genes. This proposal harnesses several unique assays developed to identify host
mechanisms that mediate commensal strain specificity, including the host cell types, genes and
molecules that recruit and maintain commensal bacteria. The central hypothesis is that specific
cell types in the fly foregut produce a ""commensal niche"": a specialized chemical and physical
microenvironment that facilitates adhesion and proliferation of specific bacteria that may benefit
the host. The proposal aims to (i) use single cell RNA sequencing to identify the specific host cell
types and genes that create this specialized microenvironment. This will enable the use of
Drosophila genetics to (ii) probe the mechanisms of host tissue maintainance through cell
turnover and localized secretion of a defined extracellular matrix. As a critical test of the
hypothesis, the proposal will examine the L. plantarum population kinetics that enable its
association with the commensal niche. By studying commensal niche construction in the
Drosophila gut, this research will establish a new paradigm that enables interrogation of the
conserved molecular and cellular interactions between hosts and their commensals that influence
host health. The proposal holds translational potential for developing tools to drive these beneficial
interactions."
10890816,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
People seek out upper limb rehabilitation services to improve performance of activities in daily life, with
performance defined by the World Health Organization ICF model as what someone actually does in the
unstructured, free-living environment. Wearable, motion sensors now allow for direct measurement of upper
limb performance in daily life, but performance is rarely measured or considered in research and care. Data
from our 2nd cycle make it clear that improvements in impairments and/or functional capacity assessed in the
structured environment of the clinic or laboratory most often do not translate to improvements in performance
of activities in daily life. These data point to the clear need to move assessment of performance from the
specialized research realm into more universal use in upper limb research studies and clinical care. A major
barrier to more wide-spread use of sensors for routine upper limb performance assessment is lack of clinical
validation. An elegant solution to the many clinical validation challenges is to move from single variables in
individual populations to multivariate categories of upper limb performance in daily life that span patient
populations.
Our central hypothesis is that, despite the immense variability in biological conditions and their resulting upper
limb impairments and functional capacity profiles, upper limb performance in daily life can be organized into a
relatively small number of categories. Defined, validated categories could be used across populations to push
upper limb rehabilitation research forward and personalize clinical decision-making. We now propose to
expand and validate preliminary categories from stroke into a variety of conditions that send people to upper
limb rehabilitation services and result in upper limb disability. Wearable sensors will be used to assess upper
limb performance in a heterogeneous, longitudinal, observational cohort (N=340) of persons with (stroke,
multiple sclerosis, UL fracture, adhesive capsulitis, breast cancer) and without UL disability (controls), and a
retrospective, pediatric cohort (n ≥ 400) to address three aims. Aim 1 will identify and validate categories of
upper limb performance in daily life that can be applied across conditions that cause upper limb disability in
adults. Aim 2 will evaluate responsiveness to change across categories. And Aim 3 will explore how categories
identified in adults map to upper limb performance in childhood.
Expected outcomes at the end of the proposed cycle are validated categories of upper limb performance that
are responsive to change and span patient populations. These categories (and the software algorithms to
derive them) will immediately be available for intervention studies to measure outcomes that are most relevant
to patients. With anticipated advances in hardware and software over the next few years, future work will
implement validated categories readily into clinical rehabilitation care."

Anomia is a core feature of aphasia, a disorder affecting 2.5–4 million Americans. Sensitive metrics are
needed to support clinical decision making, treatment research, and investigations of the cognitive
mechanisms underlying anomia. The first goal of this project is to test a novel psychometric model that will
jointly estimate anomia severity and processing speed while taking into account information that is available
during the clinical diagnostic process. The second goal is to test a key distributional assumption of response
times (RTs) during confrontation naming as a first step towards developing a chronometric model of anomia.
 Most testing situations possess rich and diverse sources of information, ranging from the
psycholinguistic properties of the items to the patient’s accuracy and RTs during various tasks designed to tap
a range of cognitive-linguistic processes. Recently, unified analytical frameworks for clinical data have been
proposed that integrate multiple sources of information to enhance clinical inference. To this end, in Specific
Aim 1, a hierarchical Bayesian item response theory model will be used to simultaneously quantify anomia
severity and processing speed based on accuracy and collateral RTs during confrontation naming. To assess
the validity of a clinically useful model, proxy RTs automatically captured by readily available software and
hand-annotated RTs will be used. In Specific Aim 2, the model will be extended to infuse predictive information
about items (i.e., psycholinguistic properties) and persons (i.e., performance on other tasks) into the model to
both enhance its precision and understand the relations among its various components. In Specific Aim 3, we
will assess the fit of RTs during confrontation naming to an ex-Gaussian distribution with partial pooling using
Bayesian hierarchical modeling with random effects.
 Consistent with Theme 5 in NIDCD’s 2023-2027 Strategic Plan, this proposal will generate the first
measurement model of processing speed during word retrieval, a construct crucial for successful
communication yet prohibitively costly to assess in fast-paced clinical settings. Further, the joint estimation of
speed and severity will lead to more efficient measurement, thereby decreasing barriers to adopting rigorous
psychometric practices in aphasiology and creating an IRT framework that could be easily implementable in
clinical and research applications. Harnessing the possibilities of this framework will be a critical step towards
computer adaptive testing batteries that will reach high levels of precision while minimizing testing burden for
both clinicians and patients and will ultimately allow each task to be administered dynamically and tailored
uniquely to each person with aphasia. Finally, assessing the distributional properties of RTs will allow
researchers to build in silico models of word retrieval that can account for both the underlying cognitive-
linguistic processes and the temporal dynamics of word retrieval in post-stroke anomia."

Military-connected mothers (MCM; mothers who are either service members or veterans, or spouses of a service
member or veteran) experience significant trauma exposure associated with post-traumatic stress symptoms
and ultimately deficits in parental functioning. Maternal trauma and its mental health and functional sequelae can
have significant consequences for children, including adverse mental health outcomes. Existing evidence-based
treatments (EBT) available to MCM to address trauma have not been adapted for military culture and do not fully
resolve symptoms or address the bi-directional relationship between symptoms and parental functioning. To
address this gap, in this R21, we propose to adapt and collect preliminary data on an innovative intervention,
Parenting-STAIR (PSTAIR), which addresses trauma symptoms and parenting among MCM. PSTAIR is a novel
intervention, combining two existing EBTs: Skills Training in Affective and Interpersonal Regulation Narrative
Therapy (STAIR), targeting maternal emotion dysregulation and mental health symptoms, and dyadic Parent-
Child Care (PC-CARE), targeting parental functioning. In an open pilot with child-welfare involved mothers, 23
session PSTAIR dramatically reduced symptoms, improved parenting skills, and prevented maltreatment.
However, non-trivial treatment dropout and nonresponse consistent with other trauma- and parenting-focused
EBTs were also observed; results suggest shortening and individualizing treatment may offer solutions to
address dropout and nonresponse. Guided by a heuristic framework for cultural adaptation of behavioral
interventions, the present study will proceed in three phases. In phase 1, we conduct qualitative interviews and
focus groups with key informants including MCM to guide adaptation of PSTAIR in Phase 2. Adaptation will be
guided by qualitative findings and informed by novel approaches to shorten and individualize EBTs to address
dropout and nonresponse, including modular and adaptive design elements and shared decision-making
between participants and clinicians. We anticipate the outcome of Phase 2 will be a 10-15 session intervention
(PSTAIR-M), involving a compact version of PSTAIR in Module 1 and tailored options for Module 2, focusing on
mental health (Module 2a) and parental functioning (Module 2b), implemented based on response to Module 1.
Phase 3 will involve a pilot randomized controlled trial conducted in a community mental health setting, in which
we will randomly assign N=120 trauma-exposed MCM who screen positive for PSTD with/without comorbid
depression and one identified child (ages 2-10) to PSTAIR-M or treatment as usual. In Phase 3, we will also
collect critical data on mechanisms which may account for observed effects of PSTAIR. Pilot data collection will
set the stage for a future R01 in which we will conduct a full-fledged mediator-moderator clinical trial. Successful
treatment with an efficient, personalized intervention has the potential to prevent adverse outcomes for MCM
and their children and to interrupt the intergenerational cycle of trauma in military family systems."

Understanding the molecular control of transcriptional responses of cells to environmental signals is
essential to understand how environment, aging and lifestyle impact physiology. My lab has discovered
that the position of genes is actively controlled by cells and that this impacts transcription in several
ways. Although we study this phenomenon in the simple budding yeast, it is conserved to more complex
animals, including humans. We recently showed that a majority of transcription factors control the
interaction of genes with the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC), impacting the spatial arrangement of genes
and the interaction of chromosomes. Furthermore, we have shown that this interaction with the NPC can
either promote stronger transcription and alter chromatin structure to poise genes for future expression.
Thus, transcription factor-mediated targeting to the NPC likely has broad effects on both the spatial
organization of the genome and gene expression. The goals of this work are to determine the molecular
mechanisms by which transcription factors and NPCs spatially arrange the yeast genome and to
understand how these interactions impact gene expression and chromatin structure."

Centrosome deregulation is the leading cause of heritable microcephaly, a congenital birth defect typically
associated with intellectual disabilities and developmental delay. Centrosome dysfunction is also considered a
key driver and prognostic marker of cancer. Yet, mechanisms underlying centrosome regulation remain
incompletely understood. Centrosomes undergo cell cycle-dependent changes in composition and organization
to modulate their activity as microtubule-organizing centers, and these oscillations contribute to the diversity of
centrosome functions. One dynamic constituent of centrosomes is mRNA, yet the functional role of mRNA
localized to centrosomes remains poorly understood. In this proposal, we examine whether mRNA contributes
to centrosome regulation and functions. In Aim 1, we define mechanisms of mRNA localization to
centrosomes. In Aim 2, we uncover the regulatory contributions of two conserved RNA-binding proteins. Aim 3
examines the function of mRNA localized to centrosomes. The completion of this work will address long-
standing questions about the role of mRNA localized to centrosomes within a genetically tractable model. This
work will contribute to our understanding of centrosome regulation, aspects of which are deregulated in cases
of microcephaly and cancer."

Regulatory regions of the genome play crucial roles in ensuring appropriate spatiotemporal expression of genes.
Like other regions of the genome, regulatory DNA sequences exhibit variations that could influence their
functions. Yet, there is a significant gap in our understanding of how variants in non-coding gene regulatory
regions alter gene expression and what impact these variants have on an individual’s development or fitness. In
particular, some rare variants confer gain-of-function enhancer activity, causing ectopic gene expression that
contributes to limb malformations, intellectual disabilities, and autism among other congenital conditions.
Determining how these gain-of-function enhancer variants cause ectopic gene expression and adverse
outcomes is critical for understanding the etiology of underlying diseases. The main objective of this project is to
use limb development as a model to uncover transcriptional mechanisms of pathogenic Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)
activation in anterior limb bud cells that occurs in patients with rare variants in the ZRS limb enhancer of SHH.
More than 30 independent rare variants in ZRS are linked to human polydactyly. However, these gain-of-function
enhancer variants are challenging to study because cell culture- or organoid-based models typically do not
recapitulate ectopic gene expression observed in vivo. In preliminary studies, we used our newly developed,
reproducible transgenic mouse assay to show that most of these rare variants cause ectopic enhancer activity
in the anterior margin of developing mouse limb buds, suggesting a common mechanism for pathogenic
enhancer de-repression. The proposed project will dissect the mechanism(s) by which gain-of-function enhancer
variants result in pathogenic developmental phenotypes. We will utilize a modified version of our novel transgenic
assay, which enables visualisation of pathogenic enhancer activity in live embryos, together with our enhancer
variant knockin mouse model that faithfully recapitulates limb malformations observed in patients, to delineate
transcriptional mechanisms that cause ectopic Shh expression and pathogenic phenotypes. In Aim 1 we will
characterize chromatin and spatial mechanism of ectopic gene activation resulting from gain-of-function
mutations in the ZRS enhancer. In Aim 2 we will identify transcription factors that cause ectopic Shh activation.
The high-resolution and rigorous quantitative characterization of novel genetic factors that contribute to enhancer
pathogenicity will significantly advance our knowledge of enhancer malfunction in disease. Ultimately, this
knowledge can be used in combination with information about epigenome state from single-cell studies to predict
the clinical significance of novel non-coding variants emerging from rapidly expanding whole-genome
sequencing studies."

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias represent a growing public health concern with tremendous
impact on patients and their families. Efforts to treat AD effectively are partially confounded by different
hypotheses regarding its initiation and progression. The varying hypotheses are reflected in the range of highly
informative imaging methods used to study AD and its progression, such as positron emission tomography
(PET) targeted to specific cerebral proteins. In this project we will develop a novel [18F]-labeled PET imaging
tracer, RP-115, to evaluate changes in astrocytes in healthy versus cognitively impaired AD patients by
quantitative PET imaging of the excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) that is primarily localized on
astrocytes and is significantly down-regulated in select cerebral regions of AD brain.
 The project hypothesis is that regional cerebral decreases of RP-115 tracer binding to astrocyte EAAT2
detected by PET imaging in live human brain can be used as an early and sensitive measure of AD onset and
progression. The first-in-human project objective is composed with two translational development goals: 1) to
establish RP-115 tracer human safety, and 2) to utilize the tracer to assess regional cerebral EAAT2 tracer
binding differences in healthy vs. Ab-, pTau- and cognitively-defined AD patients; and compare the EAAT2 AD
data to existing AD FDG and MAO-B astrocytic-related PET profiles. We will test the hypothesis and satisfy the
translational project objective by accomplishing three Specific Aims. Aim 1: Establish RP-115 safety in the
clinic with male and female PET imaging. Aim 2: Acquire RP-115 EAAT2 imaging data in well-defined male
and female healthy control and AD patient cohorts. Aim 3: Analyze the PET imaging data."

The following proposal outlines a 5-year career training plan that will prepare Dr. Alexander Holtz to be an
independent physician-scientist and leader in the field of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) biology and
cellular therapies for pulmonary vascular disorders. Pulmonary vascular diseases, such as pulmonary
hypertension (PH), are devastating illnesses associated with high morbidity and mortality with frustratingly
limited treatment options. Endothelial cell dysfunction is a core mechanistic driver of these disorders, especially
in cases where gene mutations impact endothelial cell biology (FOXF1, BMPR2, etc.). Dr. Holtz’s long-term
vision is to develop autologous endothelial replacement therapies where patient-derived iPSCs are generated,
undergo gene-correction ex vivo, and then are differentiated to endothelial cells (iEndos) to provide a limitless
supply of healthy donor endothelial cells for transplantation without the need for lifelong immunosuppression.
Dr. Holtz presents his initial discoveries that patterning of iEndos with BMP9 shifts cells towards a ‘lung-like’
molecular profile, including induction of the lung endothelial cell marker TMEM100, and enables durable
engraftment of transplanted iEndos into the mouse lung microvasculature. He also shows that this BMP9-
mediated patterning process requires active Notch signaling. Using this novel system, Dr. Holtz will test the
hypothesis that BMP9 and Notch signaling cooperatively induce TMEM100 expression to produce functional,
engraftable cells for treatment of monogenic pulmonary vascular disorders. Specifically, he will 1) assess the
differentiation capacity, longevity, and progenitor function of engrafted iEndos in the lung microvasculature; 2)
utilize a ‘competitive lung reconstitution assay’ to delineate the functional role of BMP9- and Notch-mediated
induction of TMEM100 to facilitate iEndo engraftment and to test the translational potential of iEndos derived
from gene-corrected PH patient-specific hiPSCs (BMPR2, FOXF1); and 3) test the efficacy of endothelial
replacement therapies in immunocompetent hosts using a mouse model of FOXF1-mediated pulmonary
vascular disease. This work will provide a fundamental advancement towards developing endothelial
replacement therapies for a broad range of congenital and acquired pulmonary vascular diseases. Dr. Holtz
has 90% protected time from Boston Children’s Hospital Division of Genetics and Genomics to accomplish
these aims under the guidance of Dr. Darrell Kotton at the Center for Regenerative Medicine at Boston

10868630,"SUMMARY
The Protein Expression and Purification Core will serve all Program Project investigators. Core B will express
and purify proteins for Projects 1, 2, 3, and 4. The Core Director, Dr. Sylvie Doublié, has 25+ years experience
in protein expression and purification. She will oversee the protein production aspect of the Core and directly
supervise the staff in charge of protein expression and purification. Her lab was the first to engineer a construct
of the polymerase domain of human DNA Polymerase θ that expresses well and is active. Dr. Rick Wood, the
Co-Director, has extensive experience in the expression of human proteins in eukaryotic expression systems.
His group was the first to express full-length, active human Pol θ.
Core B will produce soluble proteins and their variants for Projects 1, 2, 3, and 4. Protein constructs will be
expressed in different E. coli strains using protocols and methods, such as autoinduction, that have proven
success. The Core will also optimize the solubility and stability of proteins and complexes to be used in
biochemical and cellular assays, crystallization experiments and single-molecule studies, by characterizing
solvent effects on protein aggregation properties using dynamic light scattering and analytical gel filtration. Full
length Pol θ and other human repair factor that cannot be expressed in E. coli will be expressed in human 293
cells.
The Core is well equipped to express and purify proteins. Core B is also equipped for tissue culture work,
having the necessary incubators, hoods, microscope, centrifuge, and storage facilities.
The services provided by Core B are essential for each Project and for the success of the Program Project as
a whole. The Protein Expression and Purification Core will allow the different projects to achieve their research
goals in a cost-effective manner and with unified quality control. Core B does not duplicate any University core
facilities that would be available to our research team."

injuries involve skeletal muscle damage. This results in a global economic burden of roughly $6 billion. While
skeletal muscle possesses an intrinsic self-regeneration capacity, in clinical scenarios of volumetric muscle
loss (VML) where the muscle's natural repair mechanisms are overwhelmed, regeneration fails. Tissue
engineering strategies using human skeletal muscle stem or progenitor cells combined with novel biomaterials
have unprecedented potential to provide effective therapies. In this study, we propose to harness the myogenic
potential and regenerative capacity of sorted skeletal muscle stem/progenitor reporter cells (PAX7::GFP+)
derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Specifically, we hypothesize that PAX7::GFP+ myogenic
progenitors grown on electrospun fibrin microfiber bundles will proliferate, upregulate their expression of
myogenic genes and form aligned, multi-nucleated myotubes assembled into 3D muscle grafts. These
engineered grafts will be used to regenerate skeletal muscle tissue and restore normal function following VML.
We further hypothesize that the use of agrin in combination with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) will
promote the formation of more densely packed PAX7::GFP+ derived myotubes in the engineered muscle
grafts and enable the formation of mature neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) in the regenerating skeletal muscle.
We will test these hypotheses in three Specific Aims. In Sp. Aim 1, we will engineer uniform, densely seeded
skeletal muscle grafts by (i) electrospinning PAX7::GFP+ cell aggregates into the fibrin microfiber bundles and
(ii) coating the microfiber bundles with PAX7::GFP+ cell-seeded bulk fibrin. We will stimulate their maturation
into contractile 3D skeletal muscle tissues using biophysical stimulation. We will quantitatively evaluate cell
morphology, proliferation, multi-nucleation, and myogenic differentiation and utilize single-cell RNA-sequencing
to compare the cellular heterogeneity and myogenic gene expression profiles with that of native muscle cells.
In Sp. Aim 2, we will evaluate the potential of soluble and tethered agrin/IGF-1 individually and in combination
to enhance the proliferation and myogenesis of PAX7::GFP+ cells. We will also characterize the effects of
tethering these molecules on the physicochemical and pro-myogenic properties of the modified scaffolds. In
Sp. Aim 3, we will implant PAX7::GFP+ derived muscle grafts engineered with and without soluble or tethered
agrin/IGF-1 into small incisions into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of immunodeficient mice to assess cell
survival, integration, and regenerative potential. We will use these data to optimize the engineered skeletal
muscle grafts that we will implant into VML defects to quantitatively assess muscle regeneration, vascular and
neural infiltration, the formation of mature neuromuscular junctions, and functional recovery at 1 and 3 months
post-transplantation. To successfully accomplish these aims, we combine complementary expertise in tissue
engineering, stem cell biology, biomaterials, murine models of VML, and skeletal muscle physiology."

10868639,"Project Summary
 Many diseases, both internal and cutaneous, have distinct odors associated with them, and their identification
can provide unique diagnostic clues, guide laboratory evaluation, and facilitate and expedite treatment. Current
body odor analysis relies on benchtop instruments, but they are too bulky for use at point-of-care, home or
workplace. E-nose technologies provide a simple, light, and low cost alternative for body odor analysis, but they
are highly susceptible to environmental changes (e.g., temperature and humidity). Additionally, e-nose suffers
from strong cross-talk among the sensing elements when it is exposed to ~100 skin-emitted vapor analytes
simultaneously. These drawbacks make e-nose pattern recognition difficult and inaccurate. To overcome this,
we propose to develop a wearable micro-gas chromatography (GC) device integrated with graphene based
nano-electronic e-nose and vital sign sensors, and use it to analyze body odors related to >20
diseases/conditions. In this wearable device, skin-emitted vapors will be pre-separated by micro-GC and then
detected by the graphene e-nose embedded at the end of the GC column to generate time-series patterns.
Because vapor analytes will be eluted out one or a few at a time, pattern recognition by e-nose will be much
simpler and more accurate. The temperature/moisture issues will also be greatly reduced since the vapor
sensors are insensitive to temperature changes. Additionally, the pre-concentrator in the GC is hydrophobic and
does not trap water, and the remaining water will be separated out from other vapors through GC. Finally, the
vapor concentration inside the GC column is >50X higher than near the skin surface due to the pre-concentration
effect. Because of these advantages, the pattern recognition and disease detection capability will be significantly
enhanced. Our multidisciplinary team has the needed expertise in biomedical/electrical engineering, data
science, and a variety of clinical realms including dermatology, emergency medicine, pulmonology, and
pediatrics. We will achieve the following specific aims. Aim 1. Develop and fabricate wearable devices and
disposables. We will build 20 autonomous wearable GC devices integrated with graphene e-nose. The
wearable device will be small, lightweight (~200 g), battery-powered. We will also fabricate 2,000 customized
disposable plastic vapor sampling chambers using injection molding with vital sign sensors incorporated. Aim 2.
Develop and implement algorithms to analyze time-series patterns. We will develop the algorithm based on
deep learning to analyze time-series patterns and the vital sign data. We will train an autoencoder neural network
model and apply it to the features from participants. A regularized classification model will be trained to identify
the positive patients. Shapely values will be used to provide explanations for the prediction that the model makes.
Aim 3. Analyze >20 diseases/conditions. We will recruit patients from the University of Michigan Health
System and then use the wearable devices and algorithms developed in Aims 1 and 2 to analyze >20
diseases/conditions in four different specialties: dermatology, acute care, pulmonary medicine, and pediatrics."
10868652,"Bartter syndrome (BS) is a congenital renal tubulopathy caused by mutations of transporters impairing NaCl reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL). Antenatal BS is caused by mutations of NKCC2 or ROMK in the apical membrane of TAL. Classic Bartter’s (cBS) is due to mutations of the basolateral chloride channel ClC-Kb, presenting highly variable phenotypes and renal outcomes. As opposed to the prevailing view that salt wasting in BS is due to loss of function of transporters in mature TAL, we recently reported that the phenotype of cBS in Clc-k2-/- (mouse ortholog of ClC-Kb) mice is mainly due to developmental defects in the inner medulla and TAL hypoplasia. How Clc-k2 deficiency leads to renal tubule hypoplasia is unknown. The growth of renal tubules arises from a positive balance between cell proliferation and cell death. Preliminary data reveal Clc-k2-/- tubular cells are less proliferative and more apoptotic than WT cells. Cell cycle analysis using primary cultured TAL cells reveals more Clc-k2-/- cells reside in the G1 phase than WT cells, suggesting that Clc-k2 deficiency impairs the proliferation and cell cycle of TAL cells. What causes cellular hypoplasia and cell cycle arrest in Clc-k2-/- renal tubular cells is unknown. Mitochondria provide energetics for transport, and mitochondria dysfunction is linked to cell cycle arrest. We hypothesize that decreased transport activity and mitochondrial dysfunction underlies tubular hypoplasia in cBS. To support the hypothesis, Specific Aim-1 will examine that Clc-k2 deficiency causes cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial dysfunction in renal tubular cells via decreasing transport activity. Assays for cell proliferation, cell cycle analysis, and mitochondria bioenergetics will be performed in primary TAL and DCT cells or tubules. Mitochondrial morphology will be examined in tubules of the kidney section of Clc-k2-/- mice. Direct enhancement of mitochondrial functions by expressing PGC1α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1α, an activator of mitochondrial biogenesis) transgene or Nrf2 (Nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2-related factor 2, a transcription factor downstream of PGC1α) agonists will be used to rescue Clc-k2-/- mice. Specific Aim-2 will further test the hypothesis using two mouse models with gain-of-function (GOF) transport activity. The effect of GOF mice to rescue cell proliferation and mitochondrial dysfunction caused by Clc-k2 deficiency will be studied. The traditional view of the pathogenesis of BS as salt-wasting in mature renal tubules has led to treatment focused on salt repletion. However, many patients progress to chronic kidney disease despite volume repletion. Our studies will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of BS and provide potential therapeutic considerations targeting mitochondrial function restoration."

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has transformed the biomedical field by enabling researchers to examine
molecular biology components with unparalleled detail. In 2018, the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
established a national network of cryo-EM centers, including the Pacific Northwest Center for Cryo-EM (PNCC),
to meet the growing demand for access and training in this groundbreaking technology. Over the past five years,
PNCC, along with partner centers in New York (NCCAT) and Stanford (S2C2), have become an indispensable
resource for the structural biology community. The field of cryo-EM continues to advance at a tremendous pace,
driven by technological breakthroughs in instrument design, computational algorithms, and specimen
preparation methods. It is expected that developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence will also play
a significant role in enhancing cryo-EM workflows and automating various aspects of the process. These
advancements in the field of cryo-EM are enabling researchers to study increasingly complex biological systems,
capture low-abundance targets, analyze time-resolved reaction pathways, and obtain precise details of
biomolecular interactions. The continued growth in cryo-EM promises to facilitate discoveries in basic sciences,
biomedical research, and the pharmaceutical industry for years to come. With the rapid technological progress
comes an increasing demand for access to high-end cryo-EM instrumentation and training opportunities. It is
therefore essential to ensure equitable distribution of resources and training, addressing barriers to entry faced
by low-resource institutions and geographically isolated research groups. Additionally, support is needed for
established researchers in applying cutting-edge technologies to challenging high-value structural biology
targets. The PNCC is committed to meeting the diverse needs of the cryo-EM community through effective and
innovative approaches in service, training, and outreach. PNCC benefits from the partnership between Oregon
Health & Science University (OHSU) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratories (PNNL), both of which provide
unique expertise, resources, and infrastructure. The highly experienced operational team at PNCC is adept at
managing center resources, adapting to evolving developments, and training the next generation of cryo-EM
practitioners. Working with its partners, PNCC will position the center at the forefront of the field, develop and
implement new and efficient workflows and training programs, and engage with the community to ensure that
the benefits of all advances are widely disseminated. For further democratization of cryo-EM, PNCC will target
outreach toward resource-limited communities and focus on innovative, sustainable approaches to overcome
barriers of access and utilization. The future holds exciting opportunities and challenges for PNCC as it continues
to pursue its missions and contribute to the advancement of cryo-EM."
10877618,"The brain is remarkably dynamic, adaptive, and flexible in response to environmental changes.
These capacities are enabled by diverse cell types which communicate with an array of chemical
neurotransmitters (NTs) or neuromodulators (NMs) and receptors. Neurochemical inputs have a
wide-ranging and dramatic influence on neuronal activity and circuit dynamics. To understand the logic
by which multiple convergent inputs shape neuronal activity, it is essential to record the timing and
location of NT and NM release and the dynamic changes in membrane voltage that result. Our team
has developed genetically encoded indicators, as well as high-speed and resolution microscopy, to
allow simultaneous optical measurement of various NT/NM release and diffusion and post-synaptic
activity in vivo with cell-type and circuit specificity. Broad applications of these technologies have
started to reveal how neuromodulators collectively manipulate brain-wide states.
 Despite these successes, significant headroom exists to optimize these indicators to enable
sensitive imaging in small structures, higher throughput, and measurements in sparsely-innervated
brain areas. Moreover, existing NT and voltage indicators are nearly all green in color, and optimization
of other colors is needed to enable multiplexing, along with hardware to perform such recordings and
algorithms to process them. Finally, these new tools must be rigorously and systematically
benchmarked in vivo to allow the large community of users to better design and interpret
measurements in behavioral experiments. With available technology, we have yet to address the
diversity of chemical neurotransmission at scales crucial to understanding brain circuit function.
 Therefore the overarching goal of this UM1 proposal is to establish a multidisciplinary,
multi-investigator, and multi-institution program focusing on developing tools for measuring molecular
inputs to neurons and resulting activity, including: Engineering optimized and multi-color FP-based
indicators for NT/NM and voltage (Aim 1); detailed characterization and benchmarking of indicators in
vivo (Aim 2); disseminating vetted, best-of-class reagents and related testing data (Aim 3). Our effort
will provide the foundation for unraveling the logic of input-output transformation in defined cell types in
vivo, which underlie information processing, brain states, circuit plasticity, and (ultimately) behavior."
10878792,"Project Summary/Abstract
Research: While effective measurement of the patient’s perspective on their illness and its treatment provides
complimentary information to objective disease severity, patient-reported outcomes capturing the lived
experience of chronic inflammatory skin disease are rarely used in routine dermatology practice. Item response
theory techniques can enable more efficient administration of patient-reported outcomes in the clinic, which
can address barriers such as time to administer these measures. The purpose of this study is to 1. prioritize
the outcome domains that are most meaningful to individuals with chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as
acne, psoriasis, and atopic dermatitis; 2. evaluate the content validity of a novel Patient-Reported Outcomes
Measurement Information System (PROMIS) profile measuring these domains; 3. field test and evaluate the
validity of a novel PROMIS profile to capture the lived experience of chronic inflammatory skin disease. The
overall objectives of this K23 award proposal are to improve the care of patients with chronic inflammatory skin
diseases by developing a practical patient-reported outcome to measure the lived experience of these skin
diseases, which will enable increased use of patient-reported outcomes in routine clinical care.
Candidate: Dr. Barbieri’s long-term career goal is to become an independent, patient-oriented physician-
scientist, with a focus on chronic inflammatory skin diseases, patient-reported outcomes, and health services
research. His prior training has provided him with a foundational background in these areas.
Environment: During the award period Dr. Barbieri will devote 80% of his time to clinical research and 20% to
the clinical care of patients with chronic inflammatory skin disease such as acne, atopic dermatitis, and
psoriasis. Dr. Margolis and Dr. Pusic, the candidate’s primary mentors, have directly supervised the training of
numerous successful junior faculty members and Dr. Barbieri will benefit from his experience and enthusiasm
for cultivating the careers of junior scientists. The Brigham and Women’s Hospital offers a rich training
environment, including resources and expertise available in the Clinical Unit for Research Innovation and Trials
(CUReIT) and Patient-Reported Outcomes, Value & Experience (PROVE) Center. Combined with the
knowledge and expertise available in the Department of Dermatology and in Dr. Margolis’s and Dr. Pusic’s
labs, these opportunities will provide an unparalleled opportunity to begin a career as a physician scientist.
Career Development: With the support of his advisory committee, Dr. Barbieri’s training will focus on
advanced psychometric techniques and qualitative research to develop a strong knowledge base with respect
to patient-reported outcome development and validation. Completion of the proposed research and career
development plan will give Dr. Barbieri the knowledge and skills to achieve scientific independence, transition
to a tenure track faculty position, and build a strong foundation for a career in patient-oriented clinical research."
10867159,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Well-established psychosocial interventions for children with or at-risk for ADHD include behavioral parent
training at home and behavioral classroom management interventions at school, both of which show strong
meta-analytic evidence of effectiveness. These approaches involve adults using antecedent- and
consequence-based interventions to create contexts in which children are more likely to succeed. Moreover,
the home-school relationship is critical for children's success in school and home, and interventions aiming to
promote family-school collaboration are effective at improving outcomes of children with ADHD. However,
caregivers need implementation supports to implement evidence-based antecedent- and consequence-based
interventions with fidelity, and caregivers often have difficulty accessing behavior therapy in community
settings. Preliminary data from our ongoing work developing and pilot testing implementation strategies for
teachers in partnership with the School District of Philadelphia suggests an additional need for caregiver-facing
implementation strategies to support behavioral intervention and home-school communication. Schools are a
promising setting in which to provide early intervention for mental health challenges and to increase access to
mental health care. Furthermore, stronger integration between home- and school- based interventions has the
potential to meaningfully improve child outcomes. Therefore, we propose to develop implementation strategies
for caregivers (Supporting School Success [SSS-C]), disseminated through schools and designed to address
the specific needs of caregivers, to support caregivers of children with or at-risk for ADHD in implementing
evidence-based behavioral interventions and home-school communication approaches. These caregiver-facing
implementation strategies will be designed in coordination with the teacher-facing implementation strategies
(SSS-T). To prepare for a large-scale R01 Hybrid Trial, we will address two specific aims: (1) Develop and
field-test caregiver-facing implementation strategies (SSS-C); (2) Pilot test SSS-C, together with the existing
SSS-T implementation strategies to prepare for a large-scale Hybrid Trial. During Aim 1, we will use an
iterative, community-partnered approach to develop SSS-C, refine it in partnership with a Stakeholder Advisory
Board based on feedback from try-outs with caregivers, and make final adjustments based on a field pre-test.
During Aim 2, we will conduct a small-scale randomized pilot trial with 40 children and their caregivers and
teachers, and will collect implementation outcomes (i.e., acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, caregiver
and teacher fidelity) and child outcomes (i.e., ADHD symptoms, functional impairment, academics, student-
teacher relationship). We will also mixed methods to examine the hypothesized mechanisms, based on the
Theory of Planned Behavior, of the caregiver- and teacher-facing implementation strategies."
10867161,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Trachoma remains the leading infectious cause of blindness. The World Health Organization (WHO) has
targeted trachoma for elimination as a public health problem by 2030. The WHO’s elimination strategy
recommends population-based surveys of children aged 1-9 years. Surveys are crucial for deciding which
districts require antibiotic treatments, and also for deciding which districts have eliminated trachoma. Currently,
WHO recommends training staff to assess the clinical signs of trachoma in the field. To be certified, a grader
must be able to identify trachoma in children in a community-based setting. But field grading is subjective—
especially in eyes with borderline findings—leading to variability in estimates of trachoma. And as trachoma
elimination proceeds, countries are left with fewer children with trachoma, making it increasingly difficult to
certify graders during the training. Conjunctival photography could solve some of these problems, but the best
methods for grading photographs and interpreting the data have not been established.
This secondary data analysis grant proposal seeks to provide insights on the best use of conjunctival
photographs for trachoma control. We propose secondary data analyses of more than 20,000 conjunctival
photographs that have been collected as part of several previous NIH-funded studies. Photographs have been
collected from over 130 communities in Ethiopia and Peru, captured on a random sample of children aged 0-9
years of age in each community. The data set thus consists of population-based samples, making them similar
to those recommended by WHO. In addition to the conjunctival photographs, conjunctival swabs were also
collected for each child and processed for the cause of trachoma, Chlamydia trachomatis.
We propose several analyses. First, we will compare the trachoma grades of 25 trachoma experts to see if
these graders can be grouped into clusters who grade similarly. We will assess which group’s grades are most
strongly correlated with ocular chlamydia, providing guidance on exactly how we should be defining the gold
standard photo-grade for trachoma. Second, we will explore different ways to combine multiple grades from a
single photograph into a consensus grade, providing guidance on how many graders should grade each
photograph and which statistical model will provide the most precision and validity. Finally, we will compare the
use of a granular grading system versus a binary grading system to determine if the more granular system
results in more accurate estimates of trachoma. These analyses will greatly improve our understanding of the
best methods for grading and analyzing conjunctival photographs for trachoma, and thus contribute to the
effort for global elimination of trachoma."
10867668,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The main objective of the proposed experimental program is to address questions of mechanotransducer
(MET) channel structure and function employing a combination of electrophysiological and genetic techniques.
Experiments will focus on the attributes and molecular composition of the hair cell MET channel complex,
gathering more evidence that transmembrane channel-like protein isoform TMC1 forms a central component of
the channel and dictates its biophysical properties. Hair cell responses will be measured in acutely isolated
cochleae of wild-type and mutant mice. Specific aims are: (1) to record and characterize the conductance and
ionic properties of MET channels in cochlear hair cells of different mice, each with a distinct Tmc1 missense
mutation. The site of the mutations will be selected to define the location of the channel pore, the residues
differing between TMC1 and TMC2, and those determining channel block by Ca2+. (2) Using mutations of the
accessory protein LHFPL5 to define its contribution to channel conductance, gating and adaptation. One
hypothesis is that LHFPL5 provides force transmission between the tip link and the MET channel. (3) To
investigate the time course of loss of MET currents and transduction in Tmc1 mutants during the third postnatal
week and explore underlying mechanisms. All mutants display MET currents up to postnatal day 12 but lose
them over the subsequent five to ten days depending on the mutant. One hypothesis to be tested is that
decreased Ca2+ entry into the hair bundle is a major determinant of loss of transduction and that differences
between mutants reflect differences in steady Ca2+ influx. The connection between reduced hair bundle Ca2+,
lipid scrambling, and hair cell death will also be explored. (4) Determine the origin of a new type of Ca2+
dependent force generation that we previously observed in gecko hair cells. It is hypothesized that this same
process exists in mammalian vestibular hair cells. The roles in the process of the kinocilium and non-muscle
myosins NMIIB and NMIIC at the endolymphatic surface of the hair cell around the cuticular plate will be
studied. It is hoped that the results will supply evidence on the molecular makeup of the hair cell transduction
apparatus and yield information about proteins that are mutated in certain forms of human genetic deafness."
10867896,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Adults with Down syndrome (DS) are twice as likely to be obese (BMI > 30kg/m2) than their peers without DS.
The health consequences of excessive adiposity include greater risk for cardiovascular diseases, cancers, type
II diabetes, etc. These alarming health implications highlight the importance of identifying accurate methods for
body composition and physical activity (PA) analysis since an early detection and intervention could help
alleviate the burden of diseases that occur later in life. Unfortunately, many methods used for assessing body
composition and PA may be perceived as threatening and burdensome by individuals with DS. Particularly, the
need to visit a research laboratory or clinical testing center may induce discomfort, as our team has noted in
previous research conducted in adults with DS. The MPI’s can attest firsthand that many subjects with DS find
body composition testing as threatening when using devices such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
Several subjects with DS that visited our laboratory had difficulty remaining motionless during the 5-to-10-
minute DXA scanning procedure. We overcame those issues by having a parent or guardian available to offer
verbal encouragement during the scan. Nonetheless, the emergence of wearable technology may offer the
opportunity to measure body composition and PA in a comfortable environment. As a result, the utilization of
wearable technology for body composition and PA may overcome problems commonly observed by
researchers in validation studies. This multi-site cross-sectional study will include 50 adults with DS (18-60
years of age). Body composition will be measured via the InBody Band 2 (biompedance-based smartwatch)
and compared against a criterion DXA scan. Further, the validity of wearable PA trackers will be examined via
the following devices: wrist – Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, InBody BAND 2; waist – ActiGraph GT9X, thigh –
activPAL Micro 4; and ankle – StepWatch 4. The wearable PA trackers will be validated against a criterion
measure that consists of directly observed, hand tallied step count (with video recording for step count
verification). This project relates to the mission of NIH since knowledge gained will be useful in promoting the
health of a special population that has an increased risk of obesity by identifying whether a wearable
technology can be used in weight management and PA interventions. In addition, this study is responsive to
NOT-OD-21-092, which will study the validation of at-home diagnostic tools including actigraphy and wearable
technologies in individuals with DS."
10866875,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) are essential tools in evidence-based medicine and
comparative effectiveness research, enabling thorough evaluations of treatment benefits and risks. In the context
of the COVID-19 pandemic, SRs and MAs have been extensively utilized to provide timely insights on preventive
interventions, therapeutic medications, and vaccines, aiding informed decision-making and response strategies.
However, traditional SRs have limitations such as redundant publications, inconsistent inclusion criteria, and
inadequate investigation of evidence accumulation. Living systematic reviews (LSRs) have emerged as a
dynamic approach to continuously update and synthesize evidence, addressing these limitations. LSRs offer
benefits such as timeliness, reduction of research waste, identification of research gaps, and integration of the
latest evidence. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) is a valuable tool to derive conclusive evidence for assessing
the adequacy of studies in LSRs. By providing monitoring and futility boundaries, TSA ensures reliable decision-
making regarding a treatment’s effectiveness or futility. Conclusive evidence can save patients from harmful
treatments or placebos, and redirect resources to other research areas. However, the current TSA methods have
significant limitations, mainly stemming from their heavy reliance on interim analyses of RCTs, where patients
tend to be more homogeneous than those in MAs that consist of multiple studies on different populations.
This proposed project aims to advance TSA methods by developing innovative approaches to establishing
decision boundaries, specifically targeting the improvement of early-stage TSAs and reducing the risk of
premature termination of LSRs. By addressing between-study heterogeneity and enhancing statistical methods,
this project seeks to enhance the reliability and timeliness of living evidence. Rigorous validation of the proposed
methods for TSAs will be conducted through extensive simulation studies carefully designed to evaluate the
overall type I and type II error rates of treatment effect estimates. Additionally, the performance of the proposed
methods will be assessed using diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, user-friendly, open-source software
will be developed, accompanied by comprehensive instructions and examples, ensuring accessibility and ease
of implementation for biostatisticians and clinicians. In conclusion, these novel TSA methods hold broad
applicability across medical fields, including infectious diseases and cancers, facilitating more robust
assessments of existing evidence, guiding decisions regarding the necessity of new randomized controlled trials,
and ultimately advancing comparative effectiveness research and evidence-based medicine."

10871450,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease of variable severity and course. The
disease is characterized by a tendency for flares, in which symptoms get worse, followed by periods of
quiescence (also termed remission) that can last for months or even years. While drivers of disease activity have
been extensively studied in SLE, regulatory pathways activated during remission remain largely unknown. In
preliminary studies, we identified soluble Izumo1 as a potential candidate involved in long-term remission in SLE.
Izumo1 is the ligand for the Izumo1 receptor (Izumo1R), which is one of the most prominent genes induced by
FoxP3, and has been shown to be essential for the maintenance of FoxP3-expressing T regulatory (Tregs) cells.
Izumo1R is also induced in chronically activated conventional CD4+ T cells, where it has been proposed to be
a marker of hypo-responsiveness and anergy. Our overarching hypothesis is that soluble levels of Izumo1
increase as a compensatory mechanism to activate regulatory pathways that attenuate inflammation in SLE. In
this proposal, we will study a large prospective cohort of patients with SLE to provide clinical and functional
evidence to support or discard this novel hypothesis. If this proposal is successful, it may identify the first
biomarker and potential therapy linked to the induction of remission in SLE."
10873020,"Background: Cancer immunotherapy is a major breakthrough for many patients with advanced cancer.
However, benefits are still limited to a subset of patients, and we need to better understand the mechanisms of
response and resistance to improve therapeutic efficacy. We have identified loss of function (LoF) mutations in
JAK1 or JAK2 (immediate downstream signaling molecule of interferon receptor) that are associated with
resistance to PD-1 blockade. We also found these mutations in human melanoma cell lines by screening PD-
L1 expression with IFN-g treatment (48 cell lines). Tumors harbor LoF in JAK1/2, completely lost PD-L1
expression. Interestingly, one of them harbors no mutation with an active signaling pathway, yet lost PD-L1
expression. We explored why some human cancer cells lost adaptive PD-L1 expression even with intact
interferon signaling and hypothesized that the epigenetic perturbation is mediating this phenotype. With this
approach, we observed reduced PD-L1 expression with ATRX siRNA which was further tested with in vivo
mouse models. In vivo mouse experiments with ATRX KO MC38 cells, anti-PD-1 antibody therapy produced
either accelerated tumor growth or no effect. The current study is designed to understand the mechanism of
resistance mediated by loss of ATRX in cancer immunotherapy.
Objective/hypothesis: ATRX, a SWI/SNF-like chromatin remodeler is modulating the accessibility of
interferon responsive genes that are associated with immunotherapy response.
Specific aims: I have two aims for this study. The first aim is to interrogate the mechanisms of immune
evasion with loss of ATRX using various tools to probe epigenetic state. The second aim is to establish in vivo
tumor growth with ATRX KO using various murine cancer models.
Study design: Aim 1. Subaim1) Generate ATRX KO B16 cells followed by Assess epigenetics state with IFN-g
stimulation (both MC38 and B16 ATRX KO clones) using ChIP/ATAC-seq. Subaim 2) Correlate genomic
studies (ChIP/ATAC) with Chromatin-Associated RNA-sequence (ChAR). Subaim 3) Assess the impact of
epigenetic modifiers in IFN-g response in ATRX KO clones (using various epigenetic modifiers, such as HDAC
inhibitor, demethylating agents and EZH2 inhibitor). Subaim 4) Coculture assay with murine T cells with ATRX
wild-type parent cells and KO clones.
Aim 2. Subaim 1) In vivo experiments with MC38 and B16 models with ATRX KO. Subaim2) Kras mutant
murine lung cancer cell line models with ATRX KO. Subaim 3) ATRX KO in lung cancer and melanoma
genetically engineered mouse models using sleeping beauty transposase vector system.
Relevant to Military health: Improving treatment of many types of advanced cancers is critically important to
the health of Veterans. Many Veterans suffer from significant morbidity when they are diagnosed with cancer
that limits their therapeutic options. Immunotherapy is generally well tolerated and has a significant potential for
durable response, however, the benefit is limited to a subset of patients (and Veterans). Therefore, it is
imperative to improve therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy by understanding the mechanisms of response
and resistance. The proposed research is designed to understand the mechanisms of how cancer cells evade
the immune system by modulating the chromatin state, focusing on the role of ATRX."
10873163,"PROJECT SUMMARY
The goal of this project is to index individual resistance to psychoactive substance use (SU) during
adolescence and use the indices to identify factors influencing resistance into early middle adulthood (30-40
years old), with a special focus on potentially modifiable factors. One possible cause for the limited success in
reducing SU is a focus on factors that elevate risk for rather than resistance to SU. Although the risk and
resistance aspects of liability to a disorder are symmetric, the respective factors are not. Factors enhancing
resistance may more readily translate into prevention and treatment strategies. In addition, “environmental”
variables, which are more likely to be modifiable than the genetic ones, may be confounded by the genetic
influences. Failure to account for this confounding could hinder the detection of resistance factors. We address
these limitations by measuring liability to SU/SUD in childhood/adolescence using previously collected and
harmonizable data from the Virginia Twin Study of Adolescent and Behavioral Development (VTSABD; 1,214
twin pairs) and Minnesota Twin and Family Study (1,382 twin pairs), and assessing potential resistance
factors. Long-term SU phenotype will be verified in a new wave of VTSABD data collection, where participants
will be 30-50 years old. Aim 1. Develop continuous indices of resistance to SU and estimate genetic and
environmental contributions to their variation. Two indices of SU resistance will be derived using a validated
measure of childhood SU liability (Transmissible Liability Index) and SUD diagnosis in the same individuals as
adults (verified in new Wave 7 SU data) to select psychological items measured in earlier waves. Two
resistance indices will be generated via item response theory analysis: High Outset Resistance (based on
items differentiating between low and average childhood SU liability) and High Realized Resistance (based on
items distinguishing high and average childhood SU liability). Aim 2. Identify novel factors that have the
highest probability of enhancing resistance to substance use. These factors will be sourced as most impactful
on decisions related to substance use, using a Concept Mapping approach and existing data. Aim 3. Evaluate
developmental trajectories of the resistance indices and SU outcomes while determining how these trajectories
vary across levels of resistance factors. This will detail the influence of childhood/adolescent resistance on SU
across the life course. This project will produce detail on potentially modifiable factors that can be targeted to
reduce the likelihood of SU and addiction."
10873167,"Project Summary
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a tissue-specific autoimmune disorder. Strong genetic association with the HLA class
II gene locus suggests the importance of CD4 T cells in initiating and driving the disease process. We and others
have isolated T cells from the pancreas of T1D organ donors and identified T cell epitopes specific to insulin,
and its precursor preproinsulin, as well as fusion peptides. An important next step is to elucidate the phenotypes
of such islet-derived T cells in health and disease. Concurrently, the previous studies uncovered the fact that
antigens for the majority of T cells in the islets are still unknown, and we do not even know whether those T cells
are islet antigen-specific. Identifying antigen specificity of islet-CD4 T cells is critical to dissect disease
pathogenicity and heterogeneity to develop antigen-specific immunotherapy to halt disease progression using
appropriate antigens in a given individual. Therefore, the goal of this grant is to identify antigen specificity of CD4
T cells in the islets and link antigen-specific responses to T cell phenotypes.
Multiple lines of evidence suggest that there may be `common' or preferred CD4 T cell epitopes within subsets
of T1D patients. First, the vast majority of T1D patients have risk HLA class II alleles, and specific class II alleles
are associated with development of an initial islet autoantibody (e.g. insulin autoantibodies develop in those with
HLA-DR4, and glutamic acid decarboxylase-65 antibodies with HLA-DR3). Second, CD4 T cells having the same
antigen specificity (e.g. proinsulin peptides and hybrid insulin peptides) are detected in the pancreata from
multiple T1D organ donors, and the same reactivity is found in the blood of those with early stages of T1D.
Finally, CD4 T cells specific to these epitopes have an inflammatory phenotype in the blood of T1D patients
compared to non-diabetic controls. This leads us to hypothesize that islet autoimmunity is promoted and
regulated by CD4 T cells reacting to `common' antigens that are shared by T1D patients having specific HLA
class II molecules. We will determine the proportion of tissue-specific CD4 T cells in the islets (Aim 1) and seek
to identify epitopes targeted by CD4 T cells in the islets of T1D organ donors (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will
determine the molecular phenotype of islet antigen-specific T cells in the pancreatic lymph nodes and spleen of
organ donors with and without T1D (Aim 3). The successful completion of this proposal will: (1) identify antigens
and epitopes targeted by CD4 T cells from pancreatic islets across the stages of T1D development and (2)
elucidate the molecular phenotype and features that render these T cells pathogenic. Thus, these studies will
enhance our understanding of human T1D pathogenesis, dissect disease heterogeneity, and aid in improving
the design of clinical trials evaluating antigen-specific immunotherapy for diabetes prevention."

 The COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant morbidity and mortality globally. While vaccination has
dramatically reduced incidence of severe COVID-19 cases, SARS-CoV-2 continues to circulate with new variants
arising. Importantly, even mild COVID-19 can lead to long term consequences termed post-acute sequelae of
SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) or “Long COVID”. The current proposal will use innovative stem cell technology
to study mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric symptoms of PASC. Neuroinflammation, including
microglial activation, is a hallmark of PASC and cell line models have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-
CoV-2 proteins can induce pro-inflammatory responses in microglia. What remains unknown, however, are the
specific cellular and molecular mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 affects microglial-neuronal crosstalk. Here,
we will generate microglia and 3D brain organoids from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) which are
clinically relevant models to study neuroimmune interactions. Our preliminary data indicate that SARS-CoV-2
can enter but not efficiently replicate in human microglia. We did, however, observe significant transcriptional
remodeling following SARS-CoV-2 exposure involving inflammatory, antiviral, and metabolic pathways.
Interestingly, these responses were strain-specific with the strongest changes observed after SARS-CoV-2
Washington (root-lineage strain) stimulation and more moderate responses to Delta and Omicron variants. In
the current project, we aim to further elucidate molecular mechanism of PASC-related neuroinflammation.
Specifically, we will perform multi-omic and functional characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infected microglia and
cross-reference these signatures with molecular markers observed in PASC (Aim 1). We will further generate
microglia-incorporated brain organoids and study the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on microglia-neuronal
communication as well as neuronal activity (Aim 2). Taken together, the proposed experiments will provide an
important proof of principle for the use of stem cell technology to reveal molecular characteristics of microglial
responses to SARS-CoV-2 and variants, shedding new light on pathogenic mechanisms underlying Neuro-PASC
and providing a platform for future drug development."
10871031,"Xylazine is a synthetic non-opioid alpha2-adrenergic agonist that has contributed increasingly to overdose deaths in the United States in recent years. CDC estimates the number of overdose deaths in the US involving xylazine increased 1238% from 2018 to 2021. Fentanyl laced with xylazine has been declared an emerging threat to the US. Xylazine can cause serious skin ulcerations, profound mental status depression and serious and extended withdrawal effect, which do not respond to naloxone treatment. It is imperative to alert emergency medical service personnel and clinicians of xylazine’s presence when treating opioid overdoses. Despite the clinical and public health needs, there is currently no rapid diagnostic for xylazine detection. The only commercially available test strip is only useful for drug powder checking, not diagnostic use. In this fast-track proposal, we propose to develop and commercialize the first regulatory approved rapid xylazine diagnostic screening device (InstaStrip-Xylazine), from prototype development all the way to regulatory submission. The technology is based on a platform for rapid and high sensitivity detection of drug analytes that is developed and patented by the team. We have a track record of successfully developing a rapid diagnostic for fentanyl using this technology platform. Leveraging the same platform, we have generated an InstaStrip-Xylazine prototype with 20 times higher sensitivity than the only commercially available strip in a head-to-head comparison. In Phase I, we will work on developing and optimizing the prototype under Quality Management System (QMS) and Design Control, using an internally developed antibody to further achieve the clinically ideal cutoff of <10 ng/mL. We will also conduct preliminary clinical validation and conduct pre-submission meeting with FDA to finalize regulatory pathway. In Phase II, we will partner with FDA-registered contract manufacturer to produce three device lots, conduct verification and validation studies, including analytical and method comparison studies. We will also enroll end users in a study to evaluate the usability of the device. Data generated during phase II will be used for regulatory submission. After completion of the Blueprint Program, the immediate next step is the submission of regulatory approval/clearance application to FDA for CLIA waiver and over-the-counter (OTC) use. Although the project focuses on xylazine, the technology and the resources developed in this proposal will serve as a blueprint to allow Instanosis to quickly modify the technology for other analytes and respond rapidly to other emerging drug threats."
10874273,"Summary
Blood coagulation factor VIII is a protein cofactor that is essential for the proper regulation of the clotting
cascade. Deficiencies in factor VIII cause hemophilia A, the most common severe genetic bleeding
disorder, affecting 1 in 5,000 males worldwide. Treatment for hemophilia A consists of therapeutic infusions
of a functional form of factor VIII, termed “replacement therapy.” Complications to factor VIII replacement
therapy consist of an inhibitory immune response to the infusion in 25-30% of hemophilia patients receiving
treatment. Moreover, autoimmune disorders arise in healthy individuals against native factor VIII, causing
acquired hemophilia A. As factor VIII has been repeatedly described as highly immunogenic,
understanding the structural nature of this immune response, how activated factor VIII (fVIIIa) binds
activated platelet surfaces, and how fVIII forms a membrane-bound procoagulant complex with fIXa, may
lead to more effective therapies for hemophilia A patients.
In our previous studies, we have: developed and tested a working model of membrane binding by the C-
terminal (C2) domain of factor VIII through multiple assays, determined the first high resolution structure
of B domain-deleted factor VIII, and structurally characterized antibody inhibitors that target the factor VIII
C1 and C2 domains, which have resulted in further understanding of the pathogenic anti-factor VIII immune
response. To further examine the structural nature of factor VIII protein complexes that exist in circulation,
this proposal will accomplish three specific aims. First, we will examine the structural and thermodynamic
basis of activated platelet binding by: determining the X-ray crystal structure of an activated form of
bioengineered fVIIIa; measuring the membrane binding thermodynamics of isolated C1 and C2 domains,
as well as a tandem C1-C2 domain construct with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC); and characterizing
the structural and dynamic nature of C2 domain membrane binding in residue-level detail with small lipid
nanodiscs with 2D 15N/1H NMR spectroscopy (Specific Aim 1). Second, we will elucidate the molecular
basis for the lipid membrane-associated intrinsic tenase complex between fVIIIa and fIXa bound stably to
small lipid nanodiscs (Specific Aim 2). Third, we will continue to characterize the immune response to
factor VIII replacement therapy by determining high resolution cryoEM and/or X-ray structures of B domain-
deleted factor VIII in complex with (1) anti-A2 domain inhibitory antibodies, and (2) hemophilia A patient-
derived inhibitory antibodies (Specific Aim 3). By examining the factor VIII immune response at atomic
resolution, paired with structural characterization of factor VIII circulatory complexes, our results will
illustrate in detail the life cycle of factor VIII and its procoagulant activity. The structural data that result
from this study will assist in the engineering and development of next generation therapeutics to better
treat hemophilia A patients worldwide."
10876274,"We will conduct a Hybrid Type II effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial of a Case
Management Dyad (CM2) intervention, an evidence-based triadic social work intervention that uses a case
manager dyad to engage younger Black sexual minority men (YBSMM) aged 18-35 in economic stability
services. CM2 innovates on existing care continuum engagement models by (1) prioritizing resource counseling
to improve HIV care and prevention continuum outcomes, and (2) utilizing a triadic network approach where a
client meets with a dyadic case management team in tandem–forming a triad with the client–which provides
additional supports for the client and the case managers. CM2 is timely given that intensive interventions are
critical for engaging community members who have not benefited from existing Getting to Zero efforts. CM2 will
also test robust implementation strategies to support CM2 implementation and to enhance the professional
development and prevent burnout in the HIV front-line workforce, some of whom are directly impacted by HIV.
The CM2 intervention and associated implementation strategies emerge from prior work conducted by the
Investigative Team. We will build upon these experiences, infrastructures, and relationships to evaluate the
effectiveness and implementation of CM2 among N=180 YBSMM. Data collection, at baseline, and every 6
months over 18 months, will include surveys and electronic medical record data. To study implementation, we
will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research as the determinant framework and RE-AIM
as the evaluation framework. The specific aims are to: (Aim 1a) Evaluate the primary (financial well-being, food
security) and secondary (integrated PrEP persistence/viral load suppression) effectiveness of CM2 vs routine
Ryan White Non-Medical Case Management and PrEP Resource Counseling among YBSMM; (Aim 1b).
Evaluate the effectiveness (time to successful resource referral completion, CM job satisfaction, CM burnout and
CM-client relationship) of the CM2 intervention vs. routine Ryan White Case Management and/or PrEP Resource
Counseling among case manager study participants; (Aim 2a) Determine the extent to which financial well-being
and food security mediate the relationship between CM2 and downstream 18-month integrated care continuum
outcomes; (Aim 2b) Explore potential differential effects of CM2 on primary (resource) and secondary (care
continuum) outcomes, based on mental health, substance use, housing, employment and HIV serostatus; and
(Aim 3) Evaluate implementation strategies and outcomes at both YBSMM and case manager levels using RE-
AIM to study reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Implementation strategies include individual
and dyadic supervision, team consultation, and a train-the-trainer model, and implementation outcomes are
acceptability, feasibility, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity and cost. If successful, CM2 will intensify existing
case management resource support systems, which will not only impact the lives and care continua of YBSMM,
but also fulfill an ending the epidemic priority of revitalizing and sustaining the HIV frontline workforce."

Summary
Our long-term goal is to better understand the cellular and molecular changes in neuron-glia communication
mediated by a polyphenol-enriched grape seed extract (GSE) to reduce the burden of chronic pain. Based on
findings from our prior NIH grant, we discovered that dietary supplementation with the nutraceutical GSE
inhibits trigeminal pain signaling in preclinical models of temporomandibular joint disorder (TMD) and migraine.
The mechanism involved modulation of the serotonergic/GABAergic descending inhibitory pain pathway, which
is activated by endogenous opioids and endocannabinoids. The inhibitory effects of GSE on trigeminal pain
signaling involves activation of GABAB receptors in the spinal cord. GABAB receptors are expressed on the
central nervous system glial cells, astrocytes, and microglia, and on trigeminal ganglion satellite glial and
Schwann cells. GABAB are Gi/o protein-coupled receptors that decrease intracellular cAMP levels and inhibit
activation of the pro-inflammatory signaling enzyme protein kinase A (PKA), whose elevated expression is
implicated in the development of chronic pain. The chronic pain reported for TMD, and migraine is associated
with sustained peripheral and central sensitization and involves enhanced neuron-glia interactions. A
significant role for calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP) has been established in the underlying pathology of
chronic orofacial pain by enhancing neuron-glia communication in the trigeminal ganglia and spinal trigeminal
nucleus. The physiological effects of CGRP, which include promoting neurogenic inflammation and enhancing
pain signaling, are mediated via activation of CGRP receptors expressed on satellite glia, Schwann cells,
astrocytes, and microglia. CGRP binding to its receptor couples to the Gs protein, activation of adenylate
cyclase, increased cAMP levels, and enhanced PKA activity that promote cellular changes in peripheral and
central nervous system neurons and glial cells. CGRP also increases expression and activity of the pro-
inflammatory and pro-nociceptive enzymes inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and p38 MAP kinase in glial
cells. Recently, we published that GSE could suppress basal CGRP secretion, enhance neuronal expression
of the glutamate synthesizing enzymes GAD 65/67, and increase basal expression of GABAB in cultured
satellite glia and Schwann cells. In our proposed studies, we will test the hypothesis that GSE-mediated
increased expression of Gi/o-coupled GABAB receptors on glial cells will inhibit the stimulatory effects of Gs-
coupled CGRP receptors that are implicated in the development of peripheral and central sensitization and
chronic pain. Given the need for safer and more effective therapeutic options for managing chronic pain, we
will test if dietary inclusion of GSE can lower the concentration of the GABABR agonist baclofen (prescription
medicine) for inhibiting CGRP activation of glial cells. Hence, we want to validate whether combining a
nutraceutical with a pharmaceutical agent would provide a novel integrated strategy for managing chronic pain
by restoring and maintaining normal peripheral and central neuron and glia function within the nervous system.

10875010,"Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by chronic infections of human schistosomes, parasitic ﬂatworms
that are transmitted by aquatic snails. Schistosomes cause disease in over 250 million people but has
been designated as a Neglected Tropical Disease because of the outsized disease burden in
comparison to the investment given to it by the global health community. Schistosomiasis is controlled
primarily by mass drug administration (MDA) to people living in endemic areas. Though MDA has had
incredible success in reducing the burden of disease, many locations exist where schistosome
prevalence remains high despite repeated MDA with high coverage. In these cases, the stakeholders
are encouraged to implement snail control through chemical molluscicide treatment of local waters.
Chemical molluscicides are effective but can have harmful ecological consequences by eliminating
target snails and, at times, off-target invertebrates and plants. New strategies could be developed that
reduce the density of infected snails without reducing populations of snails themselves. Miracidia, the
aquatic snail-infective stage of schistosomes, utilize a variety of sensory modalities during host-seeking
(i.e., geosensation, photosensation, and chemosensation), resulting in accumulation near potential
snail hosts. Once a miracidium enters the active space of a snail – the area in which it can sense snail
chemical cues – it undergoes a distinct behavioral transition that results in contact with the snail. The
host-seeking and penetration behaviors have been qualitatively described by careful observation, but
quantitative models of these behaviors have yet to be generated, making them difﬁcult to
experimentally interrogate. Further, though a variety of circumstantial evidence exists that supports a
secreted glycosylated peptide as the primary snail cue sensed by miracidia, this has not been
conﬁrmed in vivo. This project will seek to quantitatively describe miracidia behaviors in the presence
and absence of snails and extract behavioral ﬁngerprints from high-resolution tracking data generated
from a unique, bespoke recording device with a large ﬁeld of view. Behavioral ﬁngerprints and an
optimized high-throughput experimental approach will set a foundation for screening of environmental
stimuli and small molecules for inhibitory effects on miracidia sensation of snail cues. In parallel, the
snail secreted peptide that is hypothesized to stimulate miracidia accumulation will be validated in vivo,
and a comparative approach using new genomic reference data from several schistosome snail hosts
will explore this critical host-parasite interaction among three 4 snail species and 2 schistosome
species. These comparisons will allow for the generation of a consensus sequence for the stimulatory
peptide, which could act as a scaffold for future optimization for activity on miracidia."
10875014,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Brain development is a complex process that requires the production and differentiation of numerous cells and
cell types, with the additional challenge of spatial and temporal precision in the neural circuitry that connects
these cells. Improper formation of neural circuitry leads to impaired control over brain activity patterns and is
broadly thought to contribute to a number of childhood neurological disorders. Multiple lines of research suggest
that inhibitory GABAergic circuitry in particular contributes to the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental
disorders, yet symptoms of intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy common in these disorders remain poorly
treated. Our prior work has identified the GABAA receptor α2 subunit as central to human ID syndromes caused
by mutations in genes known as ARHGEF9 and NONO. We have found that impairments in α2 expression and
localization lead to impaired specification of subtypes of inhibitory synapses in models replicating features of
human syndromic ID. In studying these models, we also identified abnormalities in cortical cell morphology and
cortical organization suggestive of dysfunction in earlier developmental processes. A role for the GABAA receptor
α2 subunit in early developmental stages is further supported by its notably high level of expression in early
neurodevelopment, well before synapses are formed. On this premise, we hypothesize that both early
trophic signaling and later synaptic signaling via the GABAAR α2 subunit are necessary for typical
cortical development, with dysfunction in each contributing to distinct phenotypic features of ID
syndromes. In this proposal we will manipulate either the GABAA α2 subunit (aim 1), ARHGEF9 (aim 2), or
NONO (aim 3) and examine: (i.) early developmental stages of process outgrowth, neuron polarization, and
spine formation in vitro, as well as (ii.) tissue level features such as cortical organization, cell morphology, and
synapse specification in vivo. These complementary approaches are expected to provide comprehensive
information about the mechanisms of discrete but interdependent developmental processes necessary for typical
cortical development, with implications for non-typical cortical development seen in neurodevelopmental
disorders. Relevance to human health: The proposed project is expected to yield detailed information about
neurodevelopmental stages ranging from process outgrowth to synapse formation and specification in both
typical and non-typical conditions, providing both basic knowledge about brain development, and translational
insights for neurodevelopmental disorders. Outcomes: This rigorous and impactful work will be conducted
entirely by undergraduate and graduate students at UNLV, which is one of the nation’s most diverse campuses.
Thus, beyond scientific outcomes, this project will provide instrumental training opportunities for the
diversification of the biomedical workforce, as well as enhance the research environment of our institution."

Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) and Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). FIU is the largest HSI in the
continental U.S. and one of the largest MSIs. As one of the top 10 largest universities, FIU has over 56,000
students (2020), with 79% underrepresented minorities (URMs) and more than 1,100 full-time instructional
faculty. FIU plays an important role in supporting scientific research, particularly on diseases such as HIV and
mental illness that disproportionately impact racial/ethnic minorities that often experience health disparities.
FIU has a mission to serve historical URMs in biomedical research. Researchers at FIU are uniquely
positioned to bring novel perspectives and broaden the field of genomics, e.g., by engaging URMs in research
and helping to translate research advances into measurable and sustained improvements in health outcomes
for underserved communities. However, research depth is restricted due to insufficient capacity to conduct and
sustain cutting-edge health-related research, especially genomic research. To address health disparities,
increase representation in genomic research, provide culturally responsive care, foster community
engagement and trust, promote workforce diversity, and improve access to genomic medicine for minority

are two Phases in building the center: 1) During Phase I (UG3), we will develop plans and test the feasibility of
achieving the primary goals to enhance diversity in genomic research by establishing FIU-DCGR to carry out
innovative, state-of-the-art genomic research studies; foster genomic research career development and
enhancement for trainees and investigators at all career levels; enhance the genomic infrastructure,
computational, analytical and ethical, legal, and social implications (ELSI) of genomic research capability;
establish sustainable partnerships and disseminate resources and findings. 2) During Phase II (UH3), we will
build the genomic center, which is expected to support an Administrative Core, Workforce Development Core,
Community Engagement Core, and three interrelated, innovative research projects. Outcomes from FIU-DCGR
will be: 1) the genomic research capacity will be significantly increased at FIU, resulting in more genomic-

10877559,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The goal of the proposed project is to test the effectiveness of a primary care-situated intervention focused on
motivating and guiding patients to use empirically supported, freely available online tools for weight loss,
including a commercial platform for goal setting and self-monitoring of diet, physical activity and weight
(MyFitnessPal) and online communities providing support for weight loss. Over 40% of US adults live with
obesity and approximately 35% with overweight, increasing their risk for poorer health, lower quality of life, and
higher mortality. The primary care setting has significant potential to help connect patients with effective weight
loss programs and tools, given evidence that primary care providers (PCPs) can motivate health behaviors.
Despite the potential, due to numerous implementation barriers, PCPs rarely connect patients to empirically
supported weight loss approaches. To address these challenges, UTOOLS (Understanding and Treating
Overweight and Obesity for Weight Loss Success) was developed with primary care implementation as a
central focus. The novel approach takes advantage of freely available existing online tools to support weight
loss. To support effective and sustained engagement of patients with these online tools, UTOOLS delivers an
interactive “Kickoff” (short videos and personalized feedback) prior to a scheduled PCP appointment, followed
by 52 weeks of text messages and emails targeting psychosocial constructs that are hypothesized to influence
online tool engagement. UTOOLS takes advantage of the influence of PCPs through PCPs’ “virtual
endorsement” of UTOOLS, yet does not rely on PCPs to initiate a discussion about weight and maximizes
flexibility of the PCP during clinic time. Pilot studies support the potential of UTOOLS for effectiveness, the
feasibility of the proposed trial design, and the potential for implementation in a clinical setting. To test the 52-
week UTOOLS intervention, a cluster randomized trial will be conducted in primary care clinics. Thirty PCPs
will be recruited and randomized, followed by 510 of their patients across clinics with strong representation
from groups under-represented in weight loss interventions, including African American/Blacks, Latinos, men,
and individuals with lower income. Patients will complete either the 52 week UTOOLS intervention or a 52
week educational control. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients achieving >3% weight loss at 52
weeks. At the same time as effectiveness is evaluated, essential data to inform future real-world
implementation will be gathered. The evaluation plan includes a focus on testing a model of engagement with
the online tools to inform future digital health interventions. If effective and favorably received by stakeholders
in the proposed trial, UTOOLS has substantial potential to be implemented broadly, aided by its use of existing
online tools, limited PCP and clinic burden, and ability to be largely delivered autonomously."
10878677,"Since its invention in the early 90s, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has revolutionized our un-
derstanding of the human brain. Functional MRI may be used to observe brain function during a speciﬁc motor
or cognitive task, or at “rest” (resting-state fMRI). The latter produces so-called “functional connectivity” maps
that may provide a new window into human cognition. There is currently a large, world-wide effort underway
to discover potential research and clinical uses of such connectivity maps. A signiﬁcant practical barrier in this
effort, however, is the difﬁculty in ensuring that fMRI experiments are conducted in a consistent and reproducible
manner across different centers. In particular, it is generally not possible to ensure identical execution of MR
measurements (pulse sequences) across sites operating different MR scanners. Furthermore, even the image
reconstruction and data processing methods can be difﬁcult to harmonize, particularly across different MR ven-
dors. This makes it challenging to directly compare results between sites, or “pool” data from multiple sites to
increase statistical power and gain access to rare clinical conditions.
 We will assemble and disseminate a truly harmonized, cross-vendor, and ﬂexible environment for fMRI re-
search that ensures consistent data acquisition and image reconstruction across sites. Our framework is based
on an open-source MR sequence development platform that allows any arbitrary MR pulse sequence to be de-
signed “off-line” in Matlab or Python and exported to a vendor-independent ﬁle format, that can be ported directly
to scanners from different manufacturers (at present, General Electric and Siemens are supported, but others
may follow in the future). Due to this open pulse sequence structure it will also be possible to compose a uniﬁed
image reconstruction environment based on current open-source libraries. Based on this technology, we will
provide the fMRI research community with a complete and portable workﬂow for fMRI data acquisition and image
reconstruction, backed up by integrated quality control procedures."
10878688,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 Trichotillomania (hair pulling) and excoriation (skin picking) disorder are debilitating, difficult-to-treat
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) spectrum conditions with no first-line pharmacologic interventions.
Previous work supports the role of shared genetic factors in the development of these body-focused repetitive
behaviors (BFRBs), but progress in identifying BFRB risk genes and biological pathways has been slow.
 The scientific objective of this K08 award application is to use a series of complementary, unbiased
state-of-art neurogenetic approaches to advance our understanding of the genes and pathways that underly
BFRBs, which is an important step towards developing improved treatments. Completion of this K08 proposal
will provide Dr. Olfson with critical new training in several key areas to achieve her long-term career goal of
becoming an independent investigator in neurogenomics. Our central hypothesis is that damaging DNA
sequence and structural variants are enriched in individuals with BFRBs compared to controls, and iSPC brain
organoids can shed light on convergent neurodevelopmental mechanisms. Guided by strong preliminary data
generated by Dr. Olfson from whole-exome DNA sequencing (WES) in BFRB parent-child trios, this hypothesis
will be examined in 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we propose expanding our BFRB cohort to conduct WES in 200
parent-child trios. We will (i) compare de novo and rare inherited WES mutation rates between case and
control trios, (ii) examine shared sequence variant genetic risk across the OCD spectrum using 400 previously
sequenced OCD trios, and (iii) integrate systems analyses to identify biologic pathways, gene networks, and
expression patterns. In Aim 2, Dr. Olfson will develop new skills in analyzing copy-number variants (CNVs) by
conducting the first genome-wide CNV study of BFRB parent-child trios. We will (i) compare the de novo and
rare inherited CNV burden in the BFRB and control trios, (ii) examine CNVs across the OCD spectrum, and (iii)
integrate CNV data with results from Aim 1 for recurrence and enrichment in systems analyses. In Aim 3, Dr.
Olfson will expand her skill set in iPSC brain organoids to assess early neurodevelopmental mechanisms of
BFRBs. We will characterize iPSC brain organoids derived from 4 patients and unaffected sex-matched first-
degree relatives to compare (i) neural differentiation and (ii) transcriptomics by single-cell RNA-sequencing.
 Overall, this K08 proposal will not only improve our fundamental knowledge of BFRB neurobiology, but
also provide Dr. Olfson with vital training necessary to develop an independent neurogenomics research
program to continue her investigations of BFRBs and other neuropsychiatric conditions. This training plan
involves a multi-disciplinary mentoring team based primarily at the Yale Child Study Center with expertise in
genomics (Dr. Fernandez and Dr. Scharf), iSPC brain organoids (Dr. Vaccarino and Dr. Fernandez), and
BFRBs (Dr. Bloch and Dr. Scharf). Collectively, these mentors will provide Dr. Olfson with guidance and
support to ensure her success in becoming an independent physician-scientist in translational neurogenomics."
10878692,"The goal of this Neuroscience Training Program is to generate highly creative and productive neuroscientists
who are broadly trained in neuroscience, well trained in their research specialty and equipped to address
tomorrow’s important neuroscience questions in a broad range of neuroscience-related careers. The University
of Rochester has recently made neuroscience the number one priority in its strategic plan, allowing growth in
neuroscience research resources, and an expansion of training opportunities. This application takes advantage
of this opportunity to expand and enhance graduate training in neuroscience, creating a catalytic and diverse
cohort of trainees. Training support is requested for 6 predoctoral students in each of 5 years. This support will
be used exclusively for broad and basic support of students in their first two years of graduate study. A diverse
and interactive faculty composed of both basic and translational researchers dedicated to excellence in teaching
and collaborative research, and committed to neuroscience training fosters a nurturing training environment.
These experienced training faculty, with strong records of extramural funding, offer research training
opportunities in a wide variety of neuroscience disciplines. Core elements of our training program include: 1.
Core and elective coursework as well as discussion of current literature in required weekly journal clubs and
seminars; 2. Training in oral and written communication; 3. Training in ethical conduct of research; 4. Training in
experimental design and statistical analysis; 5. A strong focus on mentoring from thesis advisors, committees,
as well as other faculty and students; 6. Career development leveraging the program Broadening Experiences
in Scientific Training (UR BEST) and the Center for Professional Development to provide students with
opportunities to follow their own career path. We propose to further enhance training by developing a new
curriculum that allows students to develop quantitative skills through a required summer-long course on data
analysis and computation using MATLAB as a platform, and a separate annual workshop that addresses issues
in rigor, reproducibility and ethics in an on-going hands-on fashion. We will continue to strengthen our already
successful strategies to recruit and nurture minority and women students and to provide all of the trainees with
the essential skills to become independent scientists with an appreciation for the ethical conduct of research.
These trained scientists will provide the next generation of neuroscientists who will further advances in basic
science and translational studies, teach future generations, set science policy and alter the landscape of
neuroscience through many different paths."

Improvements in the surgical and medical care of children with congenital heart disease (CHD)
have increased survival. Among survivors, however, there is a high prevalence and significant
long term impact of cognitive and behavioral problems and medical complications including
heart failure and problems with growth. We hypothesize that in some cases of CHD, there are
genes that have pleiotropic effects on development and function of other systems including the
brain. The goal of this study is to determine the genetic contributions to clinical outcomes in
individuals with CHD and to begin to use this information in clinical care and to design better
clinical trials of treatments for CHD. Through these studies, we will determine major genetic
contributors to CHD outcomes, expand the scientific evidence through additional case finding
outside of PCGC to increase the number of confirmed CHD genes and clinically characterize
these genetic conditions to improve the ability to anticipate and prevent medical problems in
those CHD patients. By identifying individuals with pathogenic variants from previous clinical
trials, we will determine whether integration of genomic data would improve power and precision
for CHD treatment trials by eliminating groups of patients unlikely to respond. All of these efforts
are focused on translating the findings from PCGC into clinical care."
10890684,"Project Summary/Abstract
This is a renewal application for the R01NS093653 award that has been funding the Oaklander lab's research
on small-fiber neuropathy. SFN is a recently recognized peripheral nerve illness that causes chronic pain,
usually starting in the feet and spreading up, difficulty completing routine activities and gastrointestinal distress.
In 2013, the team studied 41 children and young adults, unexpectedly reporting evidence of SFN in most. Until
then, SFN was known only in older adults with diabetes, chemotherapy or other toxic exposures and serious
diseases. The lab had discovered a new condition–early onset SFN (eoSFN). For many, it forced withdrawal
from school or work, derailing young patients' life trajectories. When the lab then reported that 41% of adults
with fibromyalgia also had objective evidence of SFN, implying there might be > 100,000 SFN patients globally,
R01NS093653 funded them to develop standardized tools for collecting data about symptoms (the SSS small-
fiber symptom survey) and exam abnormalities (the MAGNET Mass General Neuropathy Exam Tool) and a list
of best blood tests to screen for potential causes. The PI also directs Mass General's neuropathology lab that
confirms SFN diagnoses by examining tiny skin biopsies from patients' lower leg to measure the density of
small-fiber nerve endings and compare it to biopsies from normal. So the lab built the Neuropathy Registry, a
relational database now containing downloaded electronic medical records plus clinical and research testing
from >6500 people evaluated for SFN. It currently includes 6394 biopsy results and >1000 SSS and MAGNETs
with more than 1000 new patients added yearly. The PI is also part of the NIH and FDA funded CONCEPPT
committee of experts now publishing the 1st formal case definition for SFN, with inclusion requirements for
research. These require specific abnormalities that are already captured by the SSS, MAGNET, and skin
biopsy. Now Aim 1 proposes to use Registry participants plus new patients and healthy volunteers to adapt
and validate the SSS and MAGNET for general medical use by any doctor and for use in children. Aim 2 will
collaborate with the Food and Drug Administration's Biomarker Qualification Program to obtain an FDA ruling
on lab requirements to improve the quality and accuracy of skin biopsy testing. Aim 3 begins whole-genome
study of causes and risks for SFN. It recruits Registry patients with CONCEPPT-defined SFN and adds more
via the lab's NeuropathyCommons website and its global collaborators. Dr. Züchner's U. Miami neurogenetics
lab will analyze the genomes of qualifying participants to study known and unknown genes that cause or
increase risk for SFN. More genetic neuropathies are becoming treatable and Dr. Oaklander helped publish the
1st effective treatment for HSAN1. The final and future goal is to track large numbers of SFN patients and
families using secure web and cell-phone versions of the SSS and MAGNET and mailed-in skin biopsies.
These will allow them to map SFN's symptoms and natural history, identify new causal pathways and potential
treatments, and track children and newly treated patients to monitor long-term outcomes and treatment effects."
10890686,"An unanswered fundamental question in andrology is how cells recognize and respond in a different manner to
different levels of physiological and synthetic androgens. It is assumed that since androgens differ primarily in
their relative binding affinity for the androgen receptor (AR) that they are distinguished by how well they enable
the formation of similar receptor-coregulator complexes and that this manifests as a quantitative continuum of
the same responses. However, leveraging compelling new data we propose the alternate, albeit not mutually
exclusive, possibility that androgen dose regulates the relative abundance of AR monomers and dimers in cells
and that these forms of the receptor have different coregulator binding preferences resulting in different biological
outputs. Indeed, using in vitro systems that model exposure from castrate (low dose; LD) to eugonadal levels
and above (high dose; HD), we have determined that the global changes in chromatin architecture, transcription
factor cistrome, and gene expression in cells are substantially different, with the changes induced by LD
androgens (monomeric AR) being associated with cell proliferation and HD androgens (dimeric AR) inducing a
program associated with a differentiated phenotype. A similar distinction in response to androgen levels was
observed in vivo. Further, we made the surprising observation that both LD and HD androgens facilitate an AR
dependent, non-genomic activation of mTOR but that the resulting translational outputs are different, such that
LD but not HD androgens facilitate increased translation of mRNAs encoding key cell cycle proteins (i.e. E2F1,
FOXM1). Importantly, we have identified high affinity AR ligands that do not allow receptor dimerization and have
shown that their actions phenocopy those of LD androgens. Thus, by using receptor oligomerization state as a
biosensor cells are able to respond differently to different levels of androgens; a process that can be exploited
in the development of new AR modulators for the treatment of cancer and other androgenopathies.
Hypothesis: Androgen receptor expressing cells possess biochemical mechanisms that enable them to
manifest qualitatively distinct biological responses to different exposure levels of androgens enabling the same
hormone to exhibit different activities in the same cell.
Aims: (1) Define the mechanism(s) that enable cells to sense and respond to different levels of androgens, (2)
Elucidate the mechanisms by which androgens activate mTOR and regulate mRNA translational specificity, and
(3) Use small molecule-based approaches to explore the physiological and pathological importance of pathways
and processes that enable cells to respond differently to different levels of androgens.
Impact: In addition to probing the pharmacology of AR this study will formally test the “coregulator hypothesis”
that differential engagement of functionally distinct coregulators allows the same ligand to exhibit different
activities in and between cells. This will also enable the establishment of a conceptual framework that will inform
the mechanisms that determine the molecular pharmacology of other ligand-regulated nuclear receptors."
10890711,"The objectives of the Summer Research Training in Aging for Medical Students (MSTAR) program are to: 1) provide a culturally diverse cadre of medical students with a stimulating 8 week summer experience in geriatric and gerontological research using didactic, clinical and research training; 2) measure the productivity of the participating medical students using the number of abstracts, presentations and publications as metrics; and 3) ascertain the impact of the program on the students' career using follow up surveys of the participants. The principal rationale for the training program is to increase the workforce of physicians entering careers in aging related research from culturally diverse backgrounds. Over the next three decades, the U.S. population of adults age 65 and older is expected to double from 35 million to 70 million. Those over age 85, will constitute the fastest growing segment of the population. In addition, the percentage comprised of minority populations will increase from 20 to 42%. Attracting medical students who represent this ethnic and cultural change and who will pursue careers in aging research is supported by societal mandate as articulated in the 2008 Institute of Medicine report Retooling for an Aging America. The MSTAR program at Johns Hopkins is designed to provide 18 students, after completion of the first year of medical school, with an 8 week research experience at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Division of Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology and the Center on Aging and Health, and the National Institute on Aging. Training targets knowledge, skills and behaviors needed to pursue stage appropriate research by allowing students to perform mentored research that is supplemented by didactic methods (e.g., lectures, seminars, etc.) in epidemiology, biostatistics, hypothesis generation and testing, responsible conduct of research, and career development. Mentored research experiences are designed to be completed during the summer and result in a peer-reviewed abstract presented at the Annual Meeting of the American Geriatrics Society and other suitable peer-reviewed scholarly papers. Clinical experiences are designed to demonstrate the relevance of the research to the needs of an aging population, and to impart excitement about a career in aging research."
10890713,"Project Summary/Abstract
Many pediatric and young adult patients require an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for
treatment of deadly diseases besides cancer. Non-malignant disorders which are often treated with
allogeneic HCT include severe inborn errors of immunity, inborn errors of metabolism, marrow failure
disorders, and hematologic conditions such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease.
Reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and reduced toxicity conditioning (RTC) regimens are commonly
used for patients with non-malignant disorders. RIC and RTC regimens usually contain alemtuzumab, a
humanized monoclonal antibody that is directed against CD52. CD52 is expressed by the majority of
lymphocytes and some other white blood cells. Alemtuzumab is included in RIC and RTC regimens for 2
main reasons. Alemtuzumab prevents graft rejection by depleting the recipient of lymphocytes
including T cells which may recognize the allogeneic graft as foreign. Alemtuzumab also reduces graft
versus host disease because alemtuzumab may linger at lytic levels through the administration of the
hematopoietic stem cell graft and result in lymphocyte depletion of the graft. Adequate prevention of
graft failure and graft versus host disease is essential to ensure successful outcomes and patient
survival.
We do not know the best way to dose alemtuzumab. We have previously reported that optimal peri-
transplant alemtuzumab concentrations of 0.2-0.6mcg/mL on the day of graft administration (Day 0)
reduce the risks of graft failure and graft versus host disease. Levels within this range also optimize
early immune recovery. It is important to be able to dose alemtuzumab so that the majority of patients
achieve Day 0 concentrations within this ideal target concentration window.
We have performed detailed alemtuzumab pharmacokinetic (PK) studies and developed a population PK
model to allow a Precision Dosing strategy to be developed. We applied this Precision Dosing strategy
in a pilot feasibility study of 12 patients with good results. We are requesting funding in this current
application to support a larger phase II study of Precision Alemtuzumab Dosing in pediatric and young
adult patients with non-malignant disorders. We will evaluate the success of our approach in targeting
patients to the ideal therapeutic concentration window of 0.2-0.6mcg/mL on Day 0 and the impact on
the clinical outcomes of immune reconstitution, graft failure, and graft versus host disease."

Shivaani Kummar, M.D., Associate Director of Clinical and Translational Research
The Knight Cancer Institute (KCI) Protocol Review and Monitoring System (PRMS) supports the development of
a comprehensive and scientifically relevant portfolio of clinical trials. The PRMS ensures that cancer patients
have access to clinical trials that are scientifically sound in design, feasible for timely completion, compliant with
federal guidelines, deserving of priority, and in alignment with the strategic goals of the institute. There are two
distinct stages of scientific review for all clinical trials. The first stage comprises the Clinical Research Disease
Site Group (DSG), and the second stage is the KCI PRMS Committee. Proposed trials undergo an initial review
by the DSG to assess scientific merit, alignment with the KCI and disease site goals, available resources
including relevant patient population, feasibility for completion within the specified timeframe, competing trials,
and fit within a disease-level portfolio. In the second stage of the process, the PRMS reviews for the relevance
of the scientific question, soundness of the design, feasibility to conduct the trial, and ability of the trial to meet
an unmet need within the disease trial portfolio. Eligible protocols undergo a formal scientific progress evaluation
twice yearly to monitor accrual against the target with appropriate corrective actions for protocols that fail to meet
accrual targets. In addition, scientific relevance is re-evaluated for trials open to accrual beyond five years. The
PRMS has full authority to enact the scientific progress evaluation determination. Personnel in the KCI Clinical
Research Quality and Administration group provide administrative support for the PRMS Committee, which acts
independently of the OHSU Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the KCI Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
(DSMC)."
10865217,"Autologous vein grafts (VG) are the most commonly used conduits in revascularization procedures for coronary
artery disease (CAD) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, VG failure rates remain high, reaching 30-
50% for lower extremity bypass and over 50% for coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) within 5 and 10 years,
respectively. Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is the primary cause of VG failure, accounting for more than 70% of cases.
While medical therapies have shown some benefit in reducing CABG failure, they have not been effective in
lower extremity vein bypass grafts. The pathogenesis of IH involves determinants such as endothelial injury at
the time of harvest, exposure to turbulent arterial hemodynamics, and other pre-existing atherogenic risk factors.
To prevent VG failure, maintaining endothelial integrity, reducing vascular inflammation and smooth muscle cell
(SMC) proliferation, accelerating re-endothelialization, and promoting positive extracellular matrix remodeling,
are crucial. Building upon our previous research on the A20 gene, which has characterized the multiple
atheroprotective functions and therapeutic benefits in several small animal models of obstructive vascular
diseases, we propose using A20 as a single therapeutic agent that can remarkably target all pathogenic culprits
of IH. Our pilot studies in a large animal model of VG failure, that were funded through an exploratory R21
mechanism, set the basis for the current proposal. Since A20 is an intracytoplasmic protein, our laboratory has
been actively involved in gene therapy research to develop vascular-targeted A20 vectors. In this proposal, we
aim to generate advanced adeno-associated viruses (AAV) and emerging circular RNA (CircRNA) platforms for
safe and efficient delivery of A20 into VG via a short ex vivo perfusion prior to implantation. A combination of
both CircRNA and AAV for robust, immediate and sustained expression of A20 may well be required to address
the complex pathogenesis of IH effectively. The aims of this proposal are articulated around: 1. Optimizing and
validating the feasibility of this first-in-class in human saphenous vein tissue cultures, and 2. conducting efficacy
studies in two large animal models of VG failure with high bio-fidelity to human disease. Positive results in these
relevant animal models are a necessary prelude prior to pre-IND filing. Additionally, for the first time, we will
perform an in-tissue analysis of the VG transcriptome using spatial transcriptomics, enabling fine granular
mapping of transgene distribution and expression levels in different vessel layers, and capturing cell-specific
transcriptomic signatures that demonstrate A20's therapeutic impact and ensure its safe use. We are excited
about the potential groundbreaking results of these studies, which will bring us closer to clinical readiness for a
revolutionary vascular-targeted A20 gene therapy. This therapy holds great promise to fulfill an unmet clinical
need by addressing VG failure and significantly impacting patients' morbidity and mortality. Our research team,
along with leading expert collaborators, has the diverse expertise required to successfully carry out this project."
10865218,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
This is an application for a K08 award for Dr. Nikolaos Skartsis, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at Mayo
Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, MN. Dr. Skartsis is establishing himself as a young
investigator in clinical science research with a translational focus on the impact of inflammation on regulatory T
cells (Tregs) with an overarching goal to design the next generation Treg-enhancing therapies for transplantation.
This K08 award will provide Dr. Skartsis with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to
become an expert translational researcher in Treg biology as it relates to inflammation; (2) to develop all the
tools necessary to have an independent translational research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Skartsis has
assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts comprised of his primary mentor, Dr. William Faubion,
expert in basic and translational research in Treg biology and epigenetics; co-mentors are: Dr. Cornelia Weyand,
expert in immunometabolism; Dr. Virginia Shapiro, expert in T cell activation and maturation; Dr. Mark Stegall,
expert in clinical trials in kidney transplantation, and Dr. Vesna Garovic, expert in immunological mechanisms of
preeclampsia. He has established collaborations with Dr. Sun, expert in bioinformatics, and Dr. Wangensteen,
expert in CRISPR screens. The impact of inflammatory signals on Tregs is not well understood despite the pivotal
contribution of Tregs to terminate immune responses and maintain immune system homeostasis. The central
hypothesis for this proposal is that human Tregs can positively response to proinflammatory cytokines by
stabilizing their cell lineage, while clonally expand to scale to inflammation. Molecular mechanisms that control
human Treg lineage stability and proliferation in inflammation are not fully understood, which will be the focus of
his research in the next 5 years. In Aim 1, Dr. Skartsis will study the transcriptional and epigenetic changes
induced by TNFR2 that promote FOXP3 expression in Tregs. In Aim 2, he will analyze the transcriptional and
metabolomic control of Treg proliferative fitness under inflammatory conditions. This proposal represents an
innovative approach to studying Treg biology because it incorporates CRISPR gene editing, functional genomics,
and in-vivo disease modeling in humanized NSG mice to dissect the impact of inflammatory signals on Treg
homeostasis that have not previously applied together in Treg studies in transplantation or autoimmune
diseases. This project addresses a major gap in our knowledge of the impact of inflammation on Tregs, and the
training plan it requires will form the basis for a compelling R01 grant application to harness the molecular
pathways that promote Treg survival and function under inflammatory conditions to design the next generation
of Treg enhancing therapies in transplantation and autoimmune diseases."

 This proposal describes a rigorous five-year training program leading to the career development of Dr.
Lisa L. Korn as an independent physician scientist. The principal investigator is a physician scientist with a PhD
in immunology who recently completed clinical fellowship training in rheumatology. Her career goal is to become
an independent investigator working at the intersection of mucosal immunology and inflammatory diseases,
studying how environmental influences in inflammatory disease are mediated by the intestinal immune system.
She proposes to expand her training in gut physiology, the microbiome, and inflammation biology through an
intensive training research experience under the mentorship of Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov, a pioneer and world leader
in the complex biology of inflammation. In addition to intellectual mentoring and hands-on training in Dr.
Medzhitov’s lab, she has designed a series of relevant didactic coursework and has carefully selected an
advisory committee with extensive expertise both related to this project and in successfully mentoring physician-
scientists. An outstanding scientific environment and extensive resources are provided by Yale University and
its Departments of Medicine, Immunobiology, and section of Rheumatology.
 The research objective of this proposal is to study the interactions between nutrient signals and
microbiota on eosinophil residency in the small intestine at steady state and in a mouse model of eosinophilic
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), an eosinophilic vasculitis that often involves the intestine. We found
that small intestine eosinophils undergo a process of tissue adaption at steady state that involved transit of
eosinophils up the crypt-villus axis with time, and changes in eosinophil morphology, surface marker expression,
and transcriptional profile. The canonical eosinophil survival factor IL-5 was largely dispensable for eosinophil
adaptation, while the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid was required. Because small intestine eosinophils are
most abundant in the part of the intestine that is most exposed to luminal nutrients, we asked whether these cells
were further regulated by diet. Indeed, a high protein diet caused depletion of the villus-resident subset. Based
on these findings, we hypothesize that coordinated environmentally derived signals regulate eosinophil small
intestine tissue adaptation, and that they might affect intestinal eosinophilia in EGPA. Therefore, we propose to
identify how retinoic acid and dietary protein impact the eosinophil small intestine adaptation process, to
determine the impact of the localization of the intestinal microbiota on this process, and to identify mechanisms
of intestinal eosinophilia in a mouse model of EGPA.

10864439,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Regeneration of the lung following severe injury is an imperfect process and frequently leads to permanently
altered lung structure and dysplastic cell types. After severe injury, such as influenza or COVID-19, the alveolus
can either regenerate in form and function (adaptive regeneration) or be replaced by airway-derived dysplastic
epithelium (maladaptive repair). These maladaptive cells and structures do not participate in gas exchange and
likely contribute to the long-term reduction in pulmonary function seen in some patients from severe lung injury,
highlighting the need for the development of new therapeutics with which to promote functional adaptive alveolar
regeneration. Developing these new therapies will require a comprehensive understanding of not only the
progenitor cells and their functions after injury, but also how they signal and interact with other cells within the
injured alveolar niche.
The alveolus is composed of a fragile layer of epithelium surrounded by a dense network of mesenchymal cells
which serve important roles in paracrine signaling within the alveolar niche. Recent work from our lab and others
has demonstrated the heterogeneity of these cells, identifying two key populations of alveolar mesenchyme,
those that express Pdgfra (alpha+) and those that express Pdgfrb (beta+). Based on my extensive preliminary
data demonstrating a key role of alpha+ cell proliferation, plasticity, and Notch signaling in alveolar regeneration
after viral injury in both mouse and human lungs, I will test the hypothesize that specific mesenchymal cell
lineages that arise from injury-induced plasticity establish and maintain the maladaptive epithelial regenerative
response, in part through Notch mesenchymal-epithelial signaling. In Aim 1 of this proposal, I will examine how
alpha+ cell proliferation and plasticity are defined and maintained after viral injury. The proposed research in Aim
1 will further develop my skills in transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses and physiological impacts of injury on
lung function. In the independent phase outlined in Aim 2, I will define the importance of Notch mediated
mesenchymal paracrine signaling within the alveolar niche during adaptive vs maladaptive regeneration. My
primary mentor, Dr. Edward Morrisey is an internationally renowned lung biologist who has identified many key
cell types and pathways which drive regeneration of the injured lung. I have also assembled a diverse advisory
committee of experts in bioinformatics, epigenetics, physiologic readouts of recovery of lung function after injury,
and Notch signaling who will assist me in training of these areas. The proposed work will be conducted at the
University of Pennsylvania, where I will benefit from the rich intellectual environment, wide-ranging resources,
collaborative scientific community in pulmonary and mesenchymal biology, and the full support of the institution.
Together, this proposal outlines a rigorous research and training plan that will establish the foundation to advance
my career in lung and mesenchymal cell biology."
10864442,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Olfaction plays a critical role in animal survival, enabling the detection of food sources, dangers, and potential
mates. The remarkable plasticity of the olfactory system allows for the modification of responses to cues based
on various internal states. However, the precise mechanisms underlying olfactory plasticity, particularly at the
level of peripheral sensory neuronal activity, remain poorly understood. In this research proposal, we aim to
investigate the contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and lncRNA-encoded micropeptides in
modulating olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and other olfactory functions.
 LncRNAs are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that lack an open reading frame longer than 100
codons. Various lncRNAs have been implicated in neural development, function, and diseases. While lncRNAs
are traditionally considered non-coding, certain lncRNAs encode micropeptides, which contribute to diverse
biological processes. Despite their abundance and potential importance, the functions of lncRNAs and their
encoded micropeptides in the nervous system, particularly in olfaction, remain largely unexplored.
 To address this knowledge gap, we will capitalize on the well-characterized olfactory system of the fruit
fly. This system offers several advantages, including numerical simplicity, well-defined neurons that drive
complex behaviors, and the availability of powerful genetic tools. We recently generated a comprehensive survey
of lncRNAs in the main fly olfactory organ that demonstrated the diversity and expression patterns of lncRNAs
in the olfactory system and set the stage for investigating their functional roles and their impact on sensory
behaviors.
 Through a multidisciplinary approach that includes genetic, electrophysiological, behavioral, and
molecular assays, we will test the hypothesis that lncRNAs and their micropeptides contribute to olfactory
modulation and function. Our initial focus will be on the lncRNA ANRUS (Antennal RNA Upregulated by
Starvation) and its encoded micropeptide. We will functionally characterize ANRUS and test whether it
contributes to olfactory modulation. During the R00 phase, we will investigate the unexpected regulation of
ANRUS levels by a food odor, ethyl acetate. Finally, we propose to expand our investigation by characterizing
the micropeptidome of the antenna, a first step toward exploring the regulatory roles of these micropeptides in
olfaction and gaining a deeper understanding of the mechanisms governing olfactory plasticity and function.
 Dr. Talross will benefit from outstanding support from her mentoring team at Yale University, which will
facilitate her journey towards independence. The proposed objectives in this proposal are carefully designed to

10939429,"Project Summary Abstract
 HIV remains a major public health concern in the United States (US) with a disproportionate burden of
disease in the US South, including Tennessee. The proportion of people with HIV (PWH) in Tennessee in 2019
who knew their HIV status (85%), were linked to care (61%), were retained in clinical care (59%), and had
suppressed viral loads (65%), were well below US Ending the HIV epidemic goals (90%). People residing in
rural areas, men who have sex with men (MSM), and Black and Hispanic people continue to bear the highest
burden of HIV disease and have poor HIV continuum of care outcomes in Tennessee. These statewide
disparities are more starkly mirrored in Memphis/Shelby County, a Phase 1 EHE Priority Jurisdiction and a
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) that ranks 3rd in the US for HIV incidence. In this public health context, the
state of Tennessee has decided to reject ~$9 million dollars in federal funding for HIV testing and prevention
effective June 1, 2023. The public health impact of rejecting federal funding for community-based HIV services
is likely to be profound given the years of experience, deep institutional knowledge, and community trust these
organizations have built. Further, the state has enunciated new “priority populations” responsible for only a
handful of HIV cases in Tennessee in the past decade (i.e., first responders, victims of human trafficking, and
pregnant women and children), in addition to the key populations known to have a high risk of HIV and high
need for these services (i.e., rural residents, MSM, and Black and Hispanic people). These changes represent
an urgent quasi-experimental event that requires evaluation to assess changes in HIV prevention and care
outcomes related to this policy shift. Thus, our overarching goal is to provide a near-real-time evaluation of
whether and how policy changes to funding HIV testing and prevention in Tennessee will affect HIV outcomes,
particularly among populations highly vulnerable to HIV. We are uniquely positioned to perform the work in this
proposal as our study team has complementary expertise in Tennessee clinical HIV testing and prevention,
HIV modeling, health policy analysis, and qualitative research to ensure the timely initiation of the project with
minimum delay. Our findings will provide clear, rigorous evidence in a near-real-time evaluation of whether and
how policy changes to funding HIV prevention and care in Tennessee affect HIV outcomes, particularly among
populations highly vulnerable to HIV. Although focused on Tennessee, results are relevant to broader policy
discussions around the direction of federal funding to community-based organizations for public health
programs already emerging across the US South. Importantly, our work will support Tennessee communities in
reaching their Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) goals through the leveraging of our unique academic and
community-based partnerships."
10864280,"For the first time, this project will define the impact of high volume (HV) exercise compared to moderate
volume (MV) exercise for Veterans with moderate PD (Stages 2-3). Volume of aerobic exercise (AE) has not
been previously well studied in PD, in moderate PD, nor in Veterans. Exercise is now prescribed as a first line
therapy in PD. Exact combinations of frequency, duration (the product of which is volume) and intensity of AE
need to be determined for optimal delivery of exercise for PD. In contrast to studies of high intensity exercise,
which is being investigated in a major stage 3 clinical trial, SPARX3, few studies have examined the impact of
volume, in particular HV in PD. As such, AE volume is primed for evaluation, for its effects on gait measures,
and overall physical activity (PA). Like (SPARX3), evaluation of volume must include clinically-relevant
behavioral measures, e.g., gait parameters, and disease severity; biomarkers of neurodegeneration,
representing inflammatory, and neurotrophic mechanisms. Given the strong impact of PD on autonomic and
sympathetic processes in PD (Sabino-Carvalho et al., 2020) cardiovascular and vascular processes should
also be evaluated- particularly in moderate PD who have OFF-time and greater motor dysfunction. Our
published work shows HV light-moderate intensity Partnered dance AE (PDAE) (5 days/week, for 2-3 weeks) -
improved gait, motor function and neuromuscular control in people with moderate PD. These functional
changes were comparable to changes seen in programs of longer duration and lower weekly volume. PDAE
has been tailored for Veterans with PD since 2011 and is adaptable for MV or HV. This project explores effects
of exercise dosing that make good use of patients’ high functioning times and will lead to enhance gait
parameters and more PA. The primary outcome measure is preferred gait cadence, a clinically relevant
variable for gait training studies, and which our data show is strongly associated with PA. At the Atlanta VA,
for 13 years, Dr. Hackney (PI) and her team have developed a research infrastructure to investigate rehab
treatments for Veterans with PD -most of whom have moderate stage PD. The expertise, resources and
infrastructure the team has accumulated are crucial for the proposed work. This RCT assigns n=102 (34 per
group) older Veterans with PD to 52 weeks of PDAE at HV or moderate volume (MV) or to a MV control (MV-
WALK). Overall exercise dose will be 112.5 hours over 52 weeks. MV-PDAE and MV-WALK classes will meet
twice-weekly for 65-minutes. HV PDAE classes will meet 5 times a week for 90 minutes for three weeks at trial
onset followed by one HV week every 4 weeks for a year. Gait cadence will be measured with inertial sensors.
PA will be measured with accelerometry and a questionnaire. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (before
intervention), and at 52 weeks (intervention end). We assume 20% attrition and will recruit 21 additional
participants, totaling 123 Veteran participants (41 per group). Aim 1 will compare the impact of AE volume on
gait cadence and PA. Aim 2 will compare the impact of AE volume on blood biomarkers: IL-7, BDNF and CRP.
Aim 3 will compare the impact of exercise volume on vascular function and aerobic capacity."

The Administrative and Research Support Core of the Carolina Center for Population Aging and
Health (CCPAH) has the overarching goals of fostering creative research and high-quality data
collection, reducing the administrative and technical burdens on faculty of conducting that
research, and managing the Center's activities so that the goals of the CCPAH are realized.
This core will organize seminars and workshops related to the Center's themes, identify faculty
new to UNC or whose work logically relates to our themes, streamline administrative processes
so that faculty can focus on science, and manage the day to day operations of the center.
The success of this Core, in combination with the success of the Center overall, will result in
several outcomes. Most importantly, data collection projects undertaken by CCPAH faculty will
better reflect the state of the art with respect to aging-related design and content and will be
better integrated with one another and with other surveys that are major resources for aging.
This outcome is central to our ambition of enhancing research on aging at CCPAH and
elsewhere because the projects will place major new data sets in the public domain, which will
be more useful to scholars of aging both within CCPAH and worldwide if their design
incorporates cutting-edge approaches and supports comparisons to other data. The Core will
leverage existing structures at the Carolina Population Center, CCPAH's administrative home,
that work well, but also develop new activities to make sure that CCPAH accomplishes the work
it has proposed over the coming five years. The combination of the CCPAH PI, Core Leaders,
project manager, and CPC's experienced professional staff on which CCPAH will draw, all of
whom are deeply committed to the goals we have developed, will provide strong leadership for
CCPAH in the coming years."

Hypertension is a leading cause of death and originates in childhood. Hypertension in childhood is common,
causes heart and kidney injury, and predicts adult hypertension, but poor treatment response occurs in 50% of
children and increases the risk of heart and kidney injury. Predicting treatment response may improve health
throughout one’s life, but no predictors currently exist. The reasons for poor treatment response and how
children develop heart and kidney injury are not fully understood; these gaps limit patient care. Preliminary
data suggest changes to angiotensin-(1-7), uric acid, and klotho may be critical to the early development of
hypertension and organ injury. However, this has not been studied in pediatric hypertension. The goal of this
K23 is to initiate a mentored research project and training plan to a) establish a foundation of clinical evidence
of angiotensin-(1-7) in pediatric hypertension and b) obtain training, education, experience, and data needed to
transition to an independent patient-oriented research career focused on addressing gaps between basic
science and clinical research in the mechanisms of hypertension in order to prevent and treat cardiovascular
disease across the lifespan. This prospective cohort study of children aged 5 to 17 years with hypertension will
measure angiotensin-(1-7), uric acid, and klotho in blood and urine and use novel causal inference methods to
analyze their relationships to blood pressure and measures of heart and kidney injury. The specific aims are:
i) determine if angiotensin-(1-7) differs in hypertension subjects vs. normotensive controls and mediates effect
of blood pressure lowering on heart and kidney injury in subjects; ii) evaluate if angiotensin-(1-7) predicts
treatment response in subjects; and iii) determine if angiotensin-(1-7) mediates the relationships between uric
acid and heart injury and klotho and kidney injury in subjects. The central hypotheses are that 1) angiotensin-
(1-7) is lower in subjects vs. controls and mediates the effect of reduced blood pressure on improved outcomes
in subjects; 2) angiotensin-(1-7) predicts treatment response in subjects; and 3) angiotensin-(1-7) mediates the
associations of uric acid with heart injury and klotho with kidney injury in subjects. Results will lead to an
improved understanding of pediatric hypertension by identifying differences in how the disease progresses in
response to treatment and providing crucial evidence of how hypertension-related organ injury occurs. This will
improve patient care by defining new types of disease and informing new treatment strategies. The Candidate
is a tenure-track assistant professor with 75% protected time and research funds, equipment, and personnel
supported by the department and institution. The Candidate has a well-defined mentored learning plan that
provides training in large cohort studies, advanced statistics, assay and cellular mechanisms, and clinical
cardiovascular measures. This K23 award will provide the resources necessary to support the Candidate’s

10868657,"Project Abstract
 Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as Klebsiella
aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are responsible treatment failure and
mortality rates up to 50% and 30%, respectively. Beta-lactam antibiotics are a mainstay for the treatment
of HAP, but antibiotic resistance continues to erode their clinical efficacy. Importantly, the efficacy of beta-
lactams depends on achieving adequate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) exposures;
however, many patients with HAP experience inadequate PK/PD because of changes in PK caused by
critically illness. Precision Dosing strategies can overcome PK variability caused by critical illness, but
Precision Dosing requires robust PK models and clinically validated PK/PD targets; such models and
targets are currently lacking for patients with HAP. Without robust PK models and optimal PK/PD targets
for antibiotic dosing, HAP patients will continue to experience high rates of treatment failure and death.
Our proposal will adapt and extend the existing research infrastructure of the Successful Clinical
Response In Pneumonia Therapy (SCRIPT) Systems Biology Center to robustly address these gaps in
knowledge. Our long-term goal is to develop Precision Dosing strategies that overcome PK variability
caused by severe illness. The project objective is to utilize the infrastructure, samples, and data collected
in SCRIPT to develop PK models in critically ill patients with HAP—thereby facilitating the development
and validation of HAP-specific PK/PD models. Our central hypothesis is: (1) inadequate beta-lactam PK
is common with standard “one-size-fits all” HAP dosing regimens; which (2) increases the risk of re-
infection; that in turn (3) increases the likelihood of clinical treatment failure in HAP. In Aim 1, we will
develop and evaluate PK models for use in Precision Dosing of beta-lactams for HAP. In Aim 2, we will
evaluate the impact of alveolar beta-lactam PK/PD on outcomes in HAP including (a) treatment success
and (b) pathogen reinfection. In Aim 3, we will identify patients who experience alveolar-plasma PK profile
discordance—making plasma a poor surrogate for alveolar concentrations and placing these patients at
risk of underdosing for pneumonia treatment—and determine clinical risk factors for such discordance.
 Our study will provide clinically validated tools which will facilitate the actualization of Precision Dosing
for patients with HAP. Our study will have a positive clinical impact by providing optimal PK sampling
times, generalizable PK models, HAP-specific PK/PD targets, and validated risk factors for alveolar-
plasma PK discordance, all of which can be applied at the bedside for patients with HAP. This research is
significant because it will provide the tools required to achieve Precision Dosing in HAP, which will
advance the NIH mission to protect and improve the health of patients affected by resistant pathogens."
10865975,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
The increasing salinity of groundwater is a key emerging global environmental health risk factor for hundreds of
millions of adults, including in the United States. Climate change and anthropogenic effects are exacerbating the
salinization of drinking water sources. Drinking water salinity increases concerns about water safety. Further,
recent evidence suggests that it may affect body water homeostasis, negatively impact kidney function, and
increase blood pressure (BP) and risk of hypertension. In hot settings, physiological water needs increase, yet
water scarcity and salinity make it harder to meet those needs. However, aside from guidelines for palatability,
which are important as they may signify individual concerns, there are currently no established health standards
for maximum water salinity (unlike dietary salt). Much of the research examining drinking water salinity has done
so cross-sectionally, retrospectively, or in settings where other factors such as health-protecting salts may con-
found the relationship. Further, in examining chronic kidney disease of unknown origin, studies examine water
quality or heat stress, without integrating co-exposures. Thus, it is hard to know how drinking water salinity affects
hydration, kidney function, and hypertension and whether effects are due to salinity or other factors. A critical
step toward understanding and mitigating the health risks of water salinity is to establish evidence-based rela-
tionships between water salinity and health using a longitudinal design in a real world hot setting with variation
in water salinity levels due to seasonality, hydrology, and a desalination system. This research proposes to test
the central hypothesis that drinking water salinity is detrimental to hydration, kidney function, and BP longitudi-
nally. The specific aims of the project are: (1) To identify seasonal variation in drinking water salinity and individ-
ual hydration status, water turnover, and water insecurity; (2) To test how drinking water salinity affects kidney
function and injury over time; and (3) To test how drinking water salinity affects systolic and diastolic BP and
hypertension longitudinally, and whether these BP changes affect kidney health. The research will expand an
ongoing longitudinal study to leverage a natural experiment created by a new water desalination system that
provides variation in drinking water salinity levels across communities. This longitudinal study will enroll 600
adults (300 men, 300 women; 50% aged 18-45; 50% aged 45+) with seasonal (dry and rainy) assessments
across 3 years to have within-participant, repeated measures analysis. The research will integrate environmental
measures of water quality (in-field and laboratory assessment of water salinity, ionic composition, and heavy
metals) and heat stress (wet bulb globe temperatures, heat illness), socio-ecologic assessments (in-depth multi-
modal measurements of water and food insecurity, socio-demographics, diet, mobility, and stressors), and health
measures using point-of-care and gold-standard laboratory methods (biomarkers of hydration, water turnover,
kidney function/injury, and BP). The results will inform policy and EPA and WHO recommendations about drink-
ing water salinity levels for human health and potential mitigation with water desalination in marginalized areas."
10865721,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a clinical syndrome in which there is rapid development of liver and multi-
organ system failure in a patient with previously stable cirrhosis. There are two different types of ACLF. In the
first, the precipitating insult directly injures the liver and liver failure is a direct consequence of this injury. In the
second, the precipitating event is typically sepsis, and this unexpectedly results in the sudden loss of liver
function without massive liver cell death and its mechanism is unknown. There have been very few mechanistic
studies of ACLF to date due to the lack of an appropriate animal model.
Recently we developed a mouse model of sepsis related ACLF. We found that sepsis induction in mice with
advanced liver fibrosis results in high mortality and a rapid decrease in liver function, associated with a decrease
in differentiation markers, such as Alb, and an increase in hepatocyte expression of C/EBPβ
Preliminary data indicate that the key mechanism responsible for loss of liver function is linked to endothelial cell
dysregulation mediated by angiopoietin imbalance and C/EBPβ signaling in hepatocytes. Angiopoietin-1 and -2
are key regulators of endothelial cell fate and function, dynamic changes in angiopoietins control both
regenerative response after liver injury and ensuing return to homeostatic state. Increased ANG-2/ANG-1 ratio
is a well-known feature of ACLF. Preliminary experiments indicated that angiopoietins profoundly altered
endothelial cell-hepatocyte crosstalk. While ANG-1 promoted hepatocyte albumin production, ANG-2
suppressed hepatocyte differentiation while increasing C/EBPβ expression and cell proliferation. However, the
mediators of this endothelial cell-hepatocyte crosstalk are not known.
C/EBPβ is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in the acute phase response,
metabolic functions, and cell cycle progression. C/EBPβ is transiently activated during liver regeneration.
However, sustained activation is harmful because it may prevent re-differentiation. Preliminary data indicated
that C/EBPβ is activated in ACLF mice and in human ACLF samples. Activated C/EBPβ promoted sustained
suppression of metabolic and hepatocyte differentiation genes. Hepatocyte specific Cebpb knockout increased
gene expression of hepatocyte differentiation markers and prevented mortality in ACLF model.
Taken together, we hypothesize that endothelial dysfunction mediated by sepsis in the presence of liver fibrosis
promotes sustained activation of C/EBPβ in hepatocytes that in turn promotes loss of hepatocyte differentiation
and liver failure in ACLF. We propose to study C/EBPβ-mediated loss of liver function in ACLF using mouse
models and human liver transplant explants; and find the link between endothelial dysfunction and C/EBPβ
activation. The results of this project will define if C/EBPβ promotes liver failure in ACLF and will set stage for
future studies defining C/EBPβ function and ultimately identifying new therapeutic targets of sepsis ACLF."
10865722,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 To make full impact of organoid technology, it is key to build organoid disease models with regionalized and
interconnected compartments. Such regional specificity and the associated inter-region communication are
essential calibers for evaluating functional maturation and structural integrity of the organoid models. Besides
the considerations of culturing yield and structural complexity, it is technically non-trivial to probe the functional
connectivity and pathways among sub-regions of 3D-structured organoids with high spatiotemporal resolutions.
While 3D electrophysiology platforms are suited for recording intact organoid activities, they are yet to combine
with high-resolution, cell-type-specific circuit manipulation to fully examine interregional circuits under definitive
stimulus patterns and substantiate the analysis of functional connectivity. To this end, optogenetic control over
cell activity has been noted for its combined advantages of temporal precision, cell-type specificity, and bi-
directionality over other ways of cell modulation. Optoelectronic probes assembled with light sources together
with an MEA have emerged as a powerful tool to optogenetically modulate the cell activity in a variety of settings.
In this project, we will tailor design one high-precision optogenetic probing system, based on monolithic
integration of close-packed dual-color LEDs and MEA, to dissect inter-region communication within
regionalized organoid disease models. Leveraging our efforts on optoelectronic probes and organoid
patterning methods, we will investigate if our probes with scalable pixel counts/pitches could advance
organoid disease modeling via cellular-precision, tissue-level optogenetic electrophysiology.
 The proposed work will establish a new set of organoid probing systems that enable cellular resolution bi-
directional optogenetic control of inter-region circuits and electrophysiology across multiple regions and depths
of the organoids, which cannot be achieved by existing RNA sequencing, 3D organoid electro-physiology, or cell
imaging methods. Such capabilities will deepen our understandings on regional circuits, functional connectivity,
and organoid disease models. Given their scalable form, these probes could also be applied to transplanted
organoids, cortical spheroids, and assembloids. Moving forward, our technology may provide insight into
functional maturation, developmental stages of diseases, and even tissue engineering via optogenetic control of
gene expression in select regions of the organoids. In particular, this project is comprised of two research aims:
 Aim 1. Bi-directional optogenetic probing of region-specific, depth-dependent organoid dynamics.
We will develop the probe structures with the LED/MEA pitches/counts tailor designed to optogenetically access
depth-dependent activity in targeted regions of SCZ organoid disease models and its control group.
 Aim 2. Bi-directional optogenetic probing of inter-region communication within living organoids.
We will develop multi-shank structured probes to access cell activities across multiple organoid regions, with the
focus on identifying inter-region connectivity and pathways via bi-directional optogenetics."
10878796,"PROJECT SUMMARY
State Medicaid programs pay for nearly half of all births in the United States (U.S.), financing over 1.6 million
births in 2019. Federal law requires states to provide pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage to low-income
pregnant individuals through 60 days postpartum, after which 1 in 4 become uninsured. A substantial and
increasing proportion of adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, including maternal morbidity and mortality, are
occurring among individuals with Medicaid-paid births and after pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage ends.
Postpartum Medicaid eligibility extensions (PMEs) to one year postpartum are an emerging strategy for
improving insurance enrollment, healthcare access, and health for low-income mothers and children. Passed in
response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, two federal laws have accelerated implementation of
PMEs. First, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) of March 2020 prevented states from
disenrolling Medicaid beneficiaries during the public health emergency. In turn, the FFCRA created a
national de facto PME. Second, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of March 2021 allows states to adopt
PMEs starting in April 2022 with federal matching funds. Rigorous evaluations of these policies are urgently
needed to inform state decisions to adopt PMEs and determine whether these polices are having the intended
effect of improving maternal, child, and pregnancy-related health in the year after birth.
To inform ongoing, evidence-based policymaking and fill this significant gap in maternal and child health
research, our multi-disciplinary team will conduct rigorous, quasi-experimental evaluations that exploit state
variation in policy adoption to provide timely data on the FFCRA and ARPA and associated changes in 1)
maternal insurance enrollment, healthcare use, and health; 2) children’s insurance enrollment, healthcare use,
and health; and 3) outcomes among subsequent pregnancies including rates of short interpregnancy interval
and preterm births (NOT-HS-14-004). Given that a disproportionate share of those with Medicaid-paid births
and experiencing adverse health events in the postpartum year are low-income and Black, Indigenous, or
people of color (AHRQ priority populations), we will also measure the impact of PMEs on racial health equity
(NOT-HS-21-014).
The proposed set of evaluations will produce data directly informing whether these unprecedented, large-scale
policy interventions have been associated with improvements in maternal and child health or racial and ethnic
disparities in the year after birth. We will generate timely findings to inform ongoing, evidence-based
policymaking to address the U.S. maternal health crisis. Ultimately, we aim to improve health and reduce
disparities in the year after birth among low-income mothers and children at the population level."
10869989,"Abstract: Intermediate filaments are highly conserved eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins present in
nearly every cell in the body. Although initially thought to simply provide structural support to cells,
intermediate filaments are now implicated in a variety of biological processes due to their
numerous protein interactions. Due to the number of intermediate filament monomers, more than
70 in humans, and the complexity of their regulation, more than 100 posttranslational modification
sites, gaps remain in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which they are regulated
and by which they contribute to many biological processes. To begin to fill these gaps, we seek
to define molecular mechanisms by which intermediate filaments are regulated in cells and to
define how intermediate filaments contribute to inflammation by focusing on their role in neutrophil
inflammatory processes and migration. This proposal builds on the PIs previous experience
investigating intermediate filament function during bacterial infection by proposing to leverage
new cellular models of immortalized neutrophil populations with established screening
approaches successfully use by the PI to define molecular mechanisms by which the intermediate
filament vimentin contributes to inflammatory processes. The flexibility in funding provided by this
R35 program will enable the PI the flexibility to follow the most promising lines of investigation
and to leverage the proposed approaches to train junior scientists within the laboratory. The
successful completion of the proposed studies is highly likely to improve our general
understanding about the biological processes in cells to which intermediate filaments contribute
and to our understanding of the mechanisms by which neutrophil function is regulated during
inflammation."
10868168,"The proposed work will involve the synthesis and evaluation of glycoconjugates designed to trigger
adaptive immune responses that provide protection against infection by the bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii.
Drug resistance to this pathogen is on the rise, and there are no approved vaccines to prevent infection.
Central Hypothesis: Conjugation of two classes of glycan from the surface of A. baumannii to so-called
carrier proteins will result in an effective glycoconjugate vaccine with broad coverage against various strains.
Project Goals: Short term goals include the synthesis of two classes of glycoconjugate inspired by A.
baumannii glycans and their injection into mice to determine their immunogenicity and protective effects
against infection. Long-term goals include the development of a binary glycoconjugate vaccine (based on the
two classes of glycan) that can prevent infection with A. baumannii in humans. Specific Aims: Aim 1:
Chemical Synthesis of A. baumannii glycans. Both a pentasaccharide O-glycan and fragments of a
lipooligosaccharide (LOS) from A. baumannii will be synthesized chemically. Successful execution of this Aim
will result in the production of homogeneous and conjugation-ready glycans. Aim 2: Covalent conjugation of
A. baumannii Glycans to carrier Proteins. Glycans from Aim 1 will be equipped with a linker and then
covalently linked to, inter alia, the carrier protein CRM197. Successful execution of this Aim will result in well-
characterized glycoconjugates for immunological study. Aim 3: Immunological Evaluation of the
Glycoconjugates. Mice will be immunized with the glycoconjugates. The antigenicity of these glycoconjugates
will be studied. Immunized mice will then be challenged with A. baumannii to determine the protective effects
of immunization and to study the nature of the immune response. Successful execution of this work will result
in high titers of antibodies and robust protection of immunized mice relative to controls.
 Specific Aim 1 studies will involve multistep chemical synthesis of a series of 3 LOS fragments of
varying complexity. We have completed the synthesis of the aforementioned O-glycan and one LOS fragment
already. Key aspects of these syntheses include “endgame” assembly of oligosaccharides and protecting
group removal. Specific Aim 2 studies will involve appendage of the O-glycan and LOS fragments with e.g.
thiol or alkoxyamine linkers and subsequent conjugation to pre-functionalized derivatives of the carrier protein
CRM197 through sulfide or oxime linkages, respectively. Specific Aim 3 studies will involve immunization of
mice with the conjugates. Anti-glycan antibody titers in the resulting immune sera will be determined with
ELISA, and binding of the antibodies to A. baumannii will be studied using flow cytometry. Immunized mice will
be challenged with A. baumannii, and cytokine profiling will be conducted to study the nature of the immune
response while the extent of protection will be determined by studying survival rates and bacterial burden.
Such challenge experiments will be conducted with mice immunized with the most promising glycoconjugates."
10867185,"PROJECT SUMMARY
A major goal in modern neuroscience is to comprehensively map circuits of synaptically connected cell types
throughout the mammalian brain. The key technological gap this proposal will address is the need for
systematic, high-throughput methods to define neuronal wiring diagrams at the level of defined cell types. The
overall objectives of this application are to establish a suite of tools that combine spatial transcriptomics and
connectomics into scalable, high-throughput methods and analytical tools for linking the molecular identities of
neural cell types to their synaptic connectivity. The rationale for the proposed work is that scalable, rapid means
of unraveling circuit connectivity with cell type-specificity will accelerate efforts to unravel circuit structure and
function throughout the brain. These goals will be pursued in three specific aims: 1) Establish and validate a
spatial transcriptomic approach, TransA-MERFISH, for multiplexed, brain-wide mapping of the postsynaptic
neurons of genetically defined starter cells; 2) Establish and validate a spatial transcriptomic approach, TransR-
MERFISH, for multiplexed, brain-wide mapping of the presynaptic neurons of genetically defined starter cells;
and 3) Establish computational platforms to decode the information gathered from TransA- and TransR-
MERFISH. These collaborative experiments will draw on diverse expertise to merge connectomic methods
developed by the applicants with spatial transcriptomic methods and analytical tools. These methods will be
validated in the mouse brain, including multiple cortical and midbrain areas. The research proposed in this
application is innovative because it establishes new tools to comprehensively map in situ synaptic inputs and
outputs at the level of molecularly defined cell types. The proposed research will use commercial equipment to
facilitate the easy adoption of these techniques by other labs. However, the approaches are also easily extensible
to other spatial transcriptomics methods. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to yield a
scalable, user-friendly, rapid means of unraveling circuit connectivity with cell type-specificity and defining circuit
connectivity. Ultimately, the scalable tools developed here have the potential to accelerate investigations of
neural circuit assembly and function in a variety of model organisms."

The primate brain contains trillions of highly specific synaptic connections that are the building
blocks of neural computation. While tools available in rodents have begun to shed light on how
particular cell types and circuits participate in brain functions, these approaches are not
currently possible to apply to primates. Recently, our labs have developed technology that: 1)
delivers barcoded RNAs to the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments with high sensitivity
and specificity using AAVs; and 2) allows CNS-wide transduction by AAV through systemic
injection. We will combine these innovations, together with our platforms for single-cell and
spatial transcriptomics, to systematically map the projections of thousands of midbrain
dopaminergic neurons across the marmoset brain. In addition, we will develop strategies for the
rapid and scalable quantification of postsynaptic spines in individual cells, using known
abundance in spine variation amongst the cells of the dentate gyrus as a validation. Together,
these technologies will enable the routine quantification of presynaptic and postsynaptic
phenotypes at a level of resolution and scale that has hitherto been impossible in primate"
10866947,"ABSTRACT
Inherited retinal degeneration is a class of disease characterized by progressive photoreceptor cell death and
irreversible vision loss. While multiple treatment options are being explored, the preferred approach will
depend on how far a patient's disease has progressed at the time of diagnosis. For patients who have lost most
of their photoreceptor cells and no longer have useful vision, photoreceptor cell replacement therapy will be
required. Use of pluripotent patient-derived stem cells to generate transplantable photoreceptor precursor cells
is a promising approach that is being aggressively developed. Robust retinal differentiation protocols that
enable production of 3D retinal organoids have been reported and adapted to current good manufacturing
practices. While retinal organoids contain therapeutically relevant photoreceptor precursor cells, they also
contain all the other cell types present in the neural retina. As such, photoreceptor cell enrichment is required
in order to achieve optimal treatment outcomes. Photoreceptor cell enrichment has been achieved via the use
of fluorescence activated cell sorting and magnetic bead-based pull down, both of which typically rely on the
use of cell type specific antibodies that target cell surface antigens. While highly effective, these approaches are
challenging to adopt to clinical manufacturing of autologous products. Given that photoreceptor cells naturally
segregate to the outermost layer of retinal organoids, we have found that partial organoid dissociation can be
used to isolate a relatively pure photoreceptor cell population. While encouraging, we believe that the rate at
which retinal organoids dissociate will vary between patients and be highly dependent on organoid shape and
size as well as the lot of enzyme being used. For clinical use, the manufacturing process should result in a final
product that consistently meets a predetermined set of clinical release criteria with little variability across
production runs. As such, standardization of our partial dissociation protocol and validation of the final cell
product is essential. To address these needs, in this application we propose two specific aims. In Aim 1, we
propose to refine our partial retinal organoid dissociation protocol and identify the optimum tradeoff between
photoreceptor cell purity and recovery that is achievable without antibody-based sorting. In doing so, we will
fully characterize the identity of all cell types within the final preparation and determine the size and
mechanical properties of therapeutic photoreceptor precursor cells. In Aim 2, we propose to fabricate a retinal
organoid dissociation and label-free microfluidic photoreceptor cell enrichment platform designed to reduce
the amount of time that individual photoreceptor cells spend in dissociation enzyme, enable further
photoreceptor cell enrichment, and to permit empirical determination of organoid dissociation state.
Specifically, by incorporating electrodes into a microfluidic channel, we believe we will be able to monitor
organoid dissociation rate in real time via the Coulter principle. Despite differences that may exist between
patients, rounds of differentiation, or reagents used, we hypothesize that real-time monitoring of dissociation
will allow us to identify when the process should be halted in order to achieve a consistent, high purity product
without the need for further label-based sorting."

10869042,"The Ohio State University (OSU) is proud to submit this renewal application to the Paul Calabresi Career
Development Award for Clinical Oncology (K12) mechanism. The overall goal of this renewal proposal is to
effectively mentor and train faculty level investigators in basic science and clinical approaches to translational
research so they may have successful careers in cancer experimental therapeutics and other therapeutic
modalities including radiation oncology, surgical oncology and cancer prevention, control and survivorship
research. Aim 1 is to provide individualized career development support to ensure a cadre of physician scientists
and cancer clinicians who collaborate to design and conduct hypothesis-driven clinical cancer research. Aim 2
is to provide scholars with educational opportunities and scientific training to enhance their knowledge base and
ability to conduct hypothesis driven cancer clinical research. Multi-PIs William E. Carson III, MD and Rosa
Lapalombella, PhD will guide this program into its second decade of existence and continue their oversight of
early career investigators who will dedicate their careers to the prevention and treatment of cancer. A customized
mentorship team will be developed for each K12 Scholar and they will guide the Scholar in their development of
an Individual Development Plan. Each Scholar is required to join the laboratory of an accomplished Translational
Research Mentor for the 2-3 year period of their appointment. So-called “dry lab” opportunities in population
sciences and health outcomes research are encouraged. This research experience will be the source of the
preclinical data that will support subsequent investigator-initiated trials (IITs). A Clinical Preceptor will provide
guidance on clinical translation and a newly instituted Peer Mentor program provides support from a committed
colleague. The educational curriculum has three distinct components: 1) Fundamentals of translational oncology;
2) Essential skills necessary for academic success; 3) Career-building activities and integration into the
professional sphere. Scholars are encouraged to enroll in an MPH in Clinical Translational Science. A rigorous
process for clincial trial development and implementation is in place and Scholars have benefited from new grant-
writing courses such as the R Club. The evaluative process has been redesigned resulting in changes to the
program’s educational offerings (Genomics Workshop), mentorship structure (Peer Mentors) and community-
building approach (K Breakfast). The Scholar selection process has identified a diverse group of early career
investigators (36% minority, 36% female) that have exhibited drive and energy. 14 Scholars have generated 18
IITs and published over 200 K12-related manuscripts. 8 of 8 graduated Scholars have peer-reviewed funding
as a PI (7/8 NIH) and half have R01 awards. Drs. Carson and Lapalombella will utilize the extensive educational,
translational and clinical trial resources that are available at The Ohio State University to create a cadre of highly
trained clinicians dedicated to the development of new treatments, targeted therapies, diagnostics and social
strategies that will benefit patients with cancer and lead to longer life."

Injuries to the optic nerve damage or sever the axons of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), leading to vision loss that
is currently irreversible. While optic nerve regeneration in a major research area, little is known about the early
functional changes to RGCs that precede cell death. Strategies to restore vision, as well as improved diagnostics,
require more detailed information about the time course of changes in RGC spike responses after optic nerve
injury.
I propose to address this knowledge gap by developing a new preparation of the intact mouse eye and its
supporting vasculature. We are working to adapt an isolated, perfused eye preparation that has been published
in larger eyes, into the mouse while simultaneously using high-density electrodes to record spikes from the optic
nerve. Aim 1 will validate the successful functional identification of RGCs using opto-tagging. Aim 2 will measure
the time course of dysfunction in identified RGCs following optic nerve cut while experimentally varying the
location of the cut along the nerve.
The successful completion of this project will establish a new preparation with advantages over existing
preparations for studies of the earliest RGC dysfunction in retinal disease."

The proposed research program seeks to understand how genomic information is organized and accessed. At
the core of my proposal is an effort to develop a framework that bridges in vitro experiments to their counterparts
in vivo. We will do this by employing novel in vitro experimental platforms that are uniquely poised to work with
mesoscale materials. (1) DNA and chromatin curtains, which are a high-resolution, high-throughput single-
molecule tool for imaging interactions on long extended DNA and chromatin fibers. (2) Optical tweezers, which
measure forces on DNA or chromatin to exceptionally high resolution. And (3) droplet experiments, which allow
us to measure key biophysical parameters, like free energies, partition coefficients, and relative mobilities. Using
these assays, research in my lab is aimed at understanding how chromatin condenses into compact structures
and the role that compaction plays in biology. In addition, we are investigating how epigenetic information is
propagated along chromatin fibers and how chromatin dynamically partitions into regions of similar function in
the nucleus. The proposed research program seeks to connect in vivo measurements into mechanistic
frameworks of individual protein actions by tracing reactions across scales. Specifically, our approaches afford
us the opportunity to increase the complexity of a particular reaction from isolated molecules in a test tube, to
one dimensional reactions on extended molecules, to the disordered three dimensional environment of
condensates, and finally to the nucleus. We feel that stepping across scales in our investigations, stopping at
these intermediate levels of observation, which up to now have been missing, will allow us to successfully attack
important questions in chromatin biology about regulation and domain formation, which have remained elusive.
And ultimately, will drive us toward a cohesive model of how our genetic information is accessed, managed, and
packaged."
10872203,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
 The midgut is characterized by a series of concentric, mesodermally-derived layers of smooth muscle
and mucosa, surrounding an inner, endodermally-derived epithelium. In the mature gut, this epithelium forms
finger-like projections extending into the lumen, called villi. In the developing chick, intestinal villi are generated
in a step-wise manner, through a series of epithelial buckling events. Buckling forces are generated through
the confined growth of the epithelium at a time when expansion is restricted by the adjacent differentiating
smooth muscle. The physical constraint experienced by the epithelium changes over time as different layers of
smooth muscle are established sequentially. The location of these smooth muscle layers is established
through the activity of gradients of Shh and Bmp, which, respectively, have positive and negative effects on
smooth muscle differentiation. As they form, the orientation of the fibers in each muscle layer depends upon
the mechanical environment of the gut at the time the layer undergoes differentiation. In spite of this general
outline of how the midgut architecture is established, there is a dearth of information regarding the tissue-level
construction of the other gut segments. Both the foregut and the hindgut arise from the same linear primative
gut tube as the midgut, and have the same general concentric organization. However, there are significant
differences in the thickness and timing of smooth muscle differentiation in the different gut segments, and the
epithelial lining differs dramatically in the three segments. In Aim 1, the mechanisms responsible for the distinct
characteristics of the muscle layers in the fore- and hindgut will be elucidated. The signaling systems known to
be responsible for defining the location and thickness of the smooth muscle in the midgut will be examined in
the fore- and hindgut segments qualitatively (by in situ hybridization) as well as quantitatively (by qPCR) to
determine how they differ in expression from the midgut. These signals will be manipulated by electoration in
vivo and through culturing with agonists and antagonists in explant culture and utilizing tissue recombination to
test their roles functionally. Experiments in Aim 2 will determine the extent to which these differences in smooth
muscle architecture and dynamics are responsible for the distinct epithelial morphology of the fore-and hind
guts. Drugs will be employed to block smooth muscle differentiation to test their necessity. Morphometric and
biophysical parameters will be measured and entered into computational models to test the degree to which
epithelial morphology can be entirely explained on this basis. Finally, in Aim 3 we will assess how transcription
factors of the Hox and paraHox clusters, known to specify regional identity within the gut, alter the molecular
and physical parameters that differentiate the fore-, mid- and hindgut, thereby connecting regional patterning to
morphogenesis of the gut. To that end, transcription fctors involved in regional identity will be misexpressed
ustilizing retroviral vectors, and changes in biochemical and mechanical parameters will be examined."

Pressure injuries (PrIs), commonly located over bony prominences, are local areas of damage to the skin and
underlying soft tissue caused by pressure and shear forces. These painful, dangerous, costly, and preventable
injuries in nursing home (NH) residents are associated with reduced quality of life and mortality. This
embedded pragmatic stepped wedge cluster clinical trial, using a mixed-methods approach for all residents in
8 NHs, will examine use of subepidermal moisture (SEM) assessment results as a cue for nursing staff to
initiate PrI prevention. SEM assessment, a biophysical measure that senses changes in skin characteristics,
detects early pressure damage by identifying subclinical signs of PrI. SEM use is an innovative addition to
current PrI prevention care that is currently initiated upon a positive risk assessment and/or a visual inspection
of skin discoloration. Significant damage exists by the time erythema or purple skin is observed. Lag time
between pressure-induced tissue damage and visual detection of skin discoloration delays nursing actions to
prevent PrIs. Discoloration is more difficult to discern in persons with dark skin tones, making skin damage
detection more challenging for residents from minority or under-represented racial/ethnic groups than those
with lighter skin tones; thus, producing a health disparity. The study will incorporate SEM assessment into PrI
prevention standard-of-care and conduct the intervention over a 9-month period. The study aims are to: 1)
determine if early pressure damage detected by SEM assessment at time of visual skin observation of NH
resident sacral and heel areas is effective in cueing initiation of NH standard PrI prevention; 2) examine the
association between NH standard PrI prevention and SEM assessment and NH residents’ characteristics (age,
gender, risk, skin tone, race, ethnicity, BMI, cognitive status) and their interactions on individual NH residents
with regard to initiation of NH standard PrI prevention and PrI occurrence; and, 3) explore if SEM usability, NH,
and nursing staff characteristics influence the adoption and assimilation of early PrI detection and subsequent
PrI prevention practices. Current NH PrI prevention protocols and periodic safety and care checks will be
performed. Sample will be comprised of all residents at intervention start and those newly admitted during the
9-month intervention period. An intention to treat approach will be used for quantitative analyses with resident
data accrued throughout the intervention period included in analyses. Cueing effectiveness will be determined
by evaluating the initiation of PrI prevention strategies in relation to SEM values and the development of PrI
during the intervention. Mixed effects regression models for clustered/repeated measures will use electronic
health record data and SEM assessment values modeled to predict initiation of PrI prevention actions.
Qualitative analyses will be applied to focus group data with comparison to cueing effectiveness findings.
Study results will advance knowledge about clinically assessed PrI risk-level and contribute to future redesign
of preventive nursing practices and refinement of PrI prevention guidelines."

Preexisting obesity and non alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are strongly associated with COVID-
19 cytokine storm and severe outcome. SARS-CoV-2 virions are present in the patient adipose
tissue and liver at low levels and it is not known if they play a major functional role in severe
COVID-19 pathology. The Raabe lab has derived for the first time organoids from livers of patients
with NASH and shown that they are senescent and exhibit a senescence associated secretory
phenotype (SASP) and thus model the known senescence of hepatocytes and other liver cells in
end stage NASH liver. Further, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown recently to induce senescence and
an SASP in infected lung cells that spreads through senescence associated secretion of
chemokines and cytokines including chemokine CXCL10, interferon IFN and cytokine TNF to
attract macrophages and activate them to a pro inflammatory state. The Raabe lab will study the
hypothesis that genetic or chemical removal of senescent cells in SARS-CoV-2 infected obesity
or NASH mouse models or in human adipose tissues derived cells and NASH patient liver derived
organoids will alleviate NASH related severe COVID-19 symptoms. In Aim 1 we will induce
obesity and NASH senescence in mouse models and infect these with SARS-CoV-2. Prior or
after infection we will remove senescence promoting factor p16 expressing cells either genetically
or chemically and then determine if this alleviates severe obesity or NASH COVID-19 symptoms.
In Aim 2 primary human lung cells will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the supernatant
containing the SASP and virus will be added to primary human adipocytes or NASH liver derived
organoid cultures. We will remove senescent cells chemically using established senolytics to
study if their removal alleviates inflammatory responses. Readout will be RNA-Seq, IHC and
ELISA to study the effect on senolytics on the SASP."

 Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. Exposures to airborne carcinogens
contribute significantly to lung carcinogenesis. Genotoxic carcinogens, which can come from environmental
and/or occupational settings, are the most important causes of lung malignancy in humans. These include
hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK), benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), and urethane.
Exposure to these carcinogens can lead to formation of DNA adducts that induce DNA double-strand breaks.
DNA damage is a key early event and the driving force of genetic abnormalities that lead to malignant
transformation of normal lung epithelial cells. In humans, there are two forms of Polδ: Polδ4 and Polδ3. Polδ4
is a tetramer containing the p12 subunit which is absent in yeast. The degradation of p12 in response to DNA
damage leads to the conversion of Polδ4 to Polδ3. This is a novel cellular regulatory system that orchestrates
the formation of Polδ3 which plays a key role in DNA repair and replication. Our recent work shows that Polδ4
is the enzyme form that is involved in the key step in homology directed repair (HDR) of DSBs. Loss of Polδ4
leads to HDR deficiency and is a novel potential contributor to tumorigenesis. Our goals are directed to the
unexplored roles of Polδ4 loss in lung tumorigenesis. Our first aim is to characterize the effects of the lung
carcinogens (Cr(VI), BaP and NNK on p12 degradation in lung epithelial cell lines as well as the mechanisms
involved in this process. These studies have not been done in non-neoplastically transformed cells. We will study
the potential of chronic exposure to the above-mentioned carcinogens on p12 degradation, as well as their
capacity to lead to epigenetic changes that suppress p12 expression after chronic exposure. Our second aim is
to test the hypothesis that p12 depletion facilitates neoplastic transformation of lung epithelial cells. We will
examine whether p12 deletion promotes neoplastic transformation of lung epithelial cells induced by these
carcinogens. We will also investigate whether p12 deletion enhances the ability of urethane to induce lung tumors
to provide an in vivo readout of the effects of p12 on lung tumorigenesis. As deletion of p12 eliminates the
possibility of forming the Polδ4 enzyme, the p12 knockout cell and mouse models are absent of Polδ4. These
models thus have a unique and defined locus in the convergent step of D-loop extension, a crucial step in HDR.
The p12 knockout mouse model provides a unique opportunity to examine the role of p12 in lung carcinogenesis
induced by genotoxic carcinogens in vivo in a clean background. These studies will lead to evidence for a role
of Polδ4 in lung tumorigenesis that originates from a novel route to HR-deficiency and have the potential to open
up further avenues of research that could contribute to future therapeutic approaches in lung cancer."

 Diabetic nephropathy represents the primary cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the US,
underscoring the need for innovative therapies for preventing its progression. We are interested in
understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern mitochondrial dysfunction in the diabetic
milieu with the expectation that understanding of these processes will expose potential disease mechanisms
and therapeutic targets in diabetic nephropathy. The present proposal is based on our recent published
observation, indicating that mitochondrial fragmentation is essential for prompting mitochondrial dysfunction in
podocytes in the diabetic milieu. A detailed understanding of mechanisms that govern mitochondrial fission in
the kidney remains incomplete and therapeutic targets based on these mechanisms do not exist. Because
dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) plays an integral part in regulating mitochondrial fission, we have focused on
investigating the role of Drp1 in mitochondrial fragmentation and progression of diabetic nephropathy. We have
been guided by our recent published observations that high glucose leads to mitochondrial fragmentation by
promoting Drp1 recruitment to the mitochondria. Deletion of Drp1 in db/db diabetic mice prevented
mitochondrial fission and improved histological and biochemical features of advanced diabetic kidney disease.
Importantly, we found that high glucose milieu triggers mitochondrial fission by phosphorylating Drp1 at serine
600 residue. Here, we propose to establish the crosstalk between phosphorylation of Drp1 and electron
transport complexes (ETC) as key mediators of mitochondrial ROS (mROS) and potential therapeutic targets
in diabetic nephropathy (DN). In support of our hypothesis, we have recently generated a novel diabetic
knockin mutant mouse harboring a single phosphorylation deficient (serine-to-alanine) point mutation at the
corresponding S600 site in the endogenous Drp1 allele (Drp1S600A). We observed that diabetic Drp1S600A
mice exhibited improved key biochemical and histological features of DN. To assess the role of Drp1S600
phosphorylation on mROS, We next crossed diabetic Drp1S600A mice with mice that express a redox-
sensitive green fluorescent protein biosensor (roGFP) specifically in the mitochondrial matrix (mt-roGFP) and
observed that Drp1S600A mutation in diabetic mice leads to reduced mROS in podocytes in live diabetic
animals. These findings provide compelling initial evidence into the unexpected role of Drp1 in a signaling
cascade that regulates mROS, and represents a therapeutic target that might be useful in preventing diabetic
kidney disease. Given these results and additional preliminary data presented in this application, this project
will address the hypothesis that Drp1 phosphorylation dynamically interact with mitochondrial ETC to enhance
mROS though a signaling network that is regulated by cardiolipin activation. The results of this study will
provide important new insights into the role of mitochondrial morphology in the development of diabetic
nephropathy, and may lead to novel therapeutic targets for the future treatment of diabetic kidney disease."

 The increasing rate of infection and spread of antibiotic resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae poses an urgent
threat to public health. Knowledge of the pathways and genes that support the emergence and spread of antibi-
otic resistance is necessary to develop new strategies for surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment. Despite our
understanding of the genes and alleles that confer resistance, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the
factors that contribute to the uneven distribution of resistance across the gonococcal species phylogeny. A core
issue that remains poorly explored is the impact of resistance determinants on gonococcal fitness: to what extent
do resistance determinants impact fitness, and, if they incur a fitness cost, how does the gonococcus adapt and
mitigate these costs? In this proposal, we address these gaps through a comprehensive strategy linking experi-
mental and computational identification of compensatory mutations with studies of their mechanisms of action.
 The overall goal of this project is to determine the impact of mutations that increase resistance to the two
most clinically relevant antibiotics for treatment of gonorrhea, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone, on bacterial fitness.
We will achieve this goal through three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the fitness costs of resistance
alleles when transformed into susceptible isolates from different niches and with distinct phylogeny and identify
compensatory mutations that mitigate these fitness costs through experimental evolution in the female mouse
model. We will examine the two most common ciprofloxacin resistance-conferring alleles (gyrAS91F,D95G and
parCS87R) in clinical isolates, and four ceftriaxone resistance-conferring alleles (two variants of penA, the lethal
target of ceftriaxone, and newly described variants in rpoB and rpoD), and evaluate the dependence of compen-
satory pathways on genomic background. In Aim 2, we will leverage our collection of over 7500 gonococcal
genomes from clinical isolates for which we have antibiotic-resistance phenotypes and employ population ge-
nomics methods to identify potential compensatory mutations and test these in the mouse model. Moreover, we
will define the allelic diversity and distribution of candidates identified in Aim 1. In Aim 3, we will determine the
mechanism of action of confirmed compensatory mutations arising from the studies in Aims 1 & 2 using an
integrative strategy that examines growth and morphology, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and directed studies
of biochemical function. We will also build on preliminary data on compensatory mutations in acnB and mleN for
ceftriaxone resistance and on the thiamine biosynthesis pathway in gyrA-mediated quinolone resistance.
 This interdisciplinary project brings together the complementary and non-overlapping expertise of three lead-
ing investigators in the biology and genetics of antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae, linking the mouse model
of gonococcal infection (Dr. Jerse), population genomics (Dr. Grad), and biochemical and physiological charac-
terization of resistance-related variants (Dr. Nicholas)."

The physiological decrease in maternal insulin sensitivity during pregnancy is necessary to increase nutrient
availability for placental uptake and fetal delivery. When the decrease in insulin sensitivity is excessive, it results
in adverse pregnancy outcomes such as gestational diabetes leading to fetal macrosomia and hypoglycemia at
delivery, and long-term risk for development of diabetes in mother and offspring. The mechanisms regulating
insulin signaling during pregnancy are unknown. Maternal insulin sensitivity improves 120% within hours
following delivery of the placenta, suggesting a placental factor may regulate insulin signaling during pregnancy.
We have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) produced in the placenta that are associated with maternal insulin
sensitivity index in late pregnancy. We detected some of these placenta-expressed miRNAs in maternal
circulation as early as 8-12 weeks of gestation, suggesting they may be involved in the physiological adaptations
of maternal glucose metabolism beginning early in pregnancy. The overall goal of this study is to investigate
mechanisms by which selected candidate placental miRNA participate in the interplay between placenta and
glucose-insulin regulation during pregnancy. We hypothesize that miRNA produced in the placenta and regulated
by maternal glycemia, act locally and peripherally to manipulate maternal insulin sensitivity during pregnancy.
To test this hypothesis, we will leverage our existing perinatal cohorts which include longitudinal prospectively
collected plasma samples and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) data derived from oral glucose tolerance tests in the
first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy. We will also utilize in vitro human primary cellular models to
directly test the function of placenta-derived miRNA locally (paracrine actions in placenta) and in insulin-sensitive
peripheral tissues (endocrine actions). Upon completion of the proposed studies we will have determined: 1) the
local effect of placental miRNA related to maternal insulin sensitivity on placental gene expression and
function; 2) the peripheral effect of placental miRNA related to maternal insulin sensitivity on skeletal
myocytes, adipocytes and hepatocytes in vitro; 3) the regulatory role of hyperglycemia on placental
miRNA expression and release. A detailed understanding of the function and regulation of these placental
miRNA may provide us with novel targets for treatment of pathophysiological decreases in insulin sensitivity."

 Two million uveitis new cases per year occur in the United States. The current treatment strategy is to
suppress the immune system with corticosteroids or other medications that have serious side effects including
an increased susceptibility to infection. After a patient achieves remission for one to two years, a slow taper of
the medications can be attempted, and some patients can be completely tapered off medications and maintain
durable remission. There is a strong correlation between the induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and
achieving durable remission. Unfortunately, the current medications used to treat uveitis do not induce Tregs.
Therefore, treatments that target Treg induction or a cell-based approach to delivery Tregs to a patient
represents a novel therapy with lasting benefits. Chimeric antigen (CAR) T cells that target B cells have been
used to treat B cell lymphoma, and more recently for the treatment of B cell mediated autoimmune diseases,
such as systemic lupus erythematosus. CAR Treg cells have been designed to prevent an immune response
against adeno associated virus (AAV), thus allowing for more effective gene therapy. We propose to
demonstrate that CAR Tregs are effective in suppressing autoimmune uveitis. Our central hypothesis is that
CAR Tregs effectively suppresses ocular inflammation. We have a unique opportunity to evaluate and develop
ocular CAR Tregs with the experience in the Lee lab with experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU), and the
Keeler lab that has experience developing CAR Tregs. The Keeler lab has AAV-specific CAR Tregs on hand
and has shown these are effective at suppressing inflammation. Therefore, we will determine if administration
of AAV-specific CAR Tregs in combination with an intraocular injection of AAV is effective in suppressing EAU
(Aim 1). We will also generate ocular antigen-specific CAR Tregs and evaluate the efficacy of these Tregs to
suppress EAU. Completion of this project will provide the foundation for developing a novel therapeutic for
autoimmune uveitis and could further be applied to any ocular disease with an inflammatory component."

1969, and has been continuously funded by the NIH since 1970. It has trained 658 MD-PhDs, more than any program in
the nation. As it has been since the program's founding, our primary goal is to identify, train, and mentor a diverse
group of women and men who will become leaders biomedical research, patient care, and medical education. To that
end, we have designed a flexible, individualized training pathway that emphasizes the integration of clinical and research
training. The University's substantial commitment to the program is evident not only in providing 68% ($8.6 million in
FY2018) of the total MSTP budget, but also in tailoring the curriculum and policies to accommodate the unique
requirements of MD-PhD training. Appointments to this T32 are typically made for the first 3 years of training. We are
able to leverage each of the grant’s 44 training slots by a factor of 4.4 through university and other funds, which allows
us to support a current population of 192 students. To select individuals to train in the program, we focus primarily on
academic achievement, research experience, and a commitment to a research career. Students typically train in the
Division of Biology and Biomedical Sciences, a trans-university consortium of 11 doctoral programs, but a significant
number train in other academic units, including Biomedical Engineering. The 156 training faculty for this proposal are
out of a total population in these academic units of over 570 tenure-track faculty. Policies are in place to select faculty
for participation in graduate training, and training faculty are reviewed every 5 years. Our program enjoys strong
interactions with other programs at Washington University for training of physician-scientists after they receive their
doctorates, i.e., Physician-Scientist Training Programs (PSTPs) in our clinical residency and fellowship programs. Student
attrition is low and has declined significantly over the past 10 years. Time to degree has stabilized at 8.0 years, and is
lower than the national average. Outcomes data shows that 78% of those that have completed postgraduate training
are employed by academic institutions, research institutes, federal agencies, and biotech or pharmaceutical firms. Many
have research support from the NIH or other sources, and some have leadership roles in other MD-PhD programs.
While our program has had a long history of success, we are cognizant of the future challenges facing our trainees to
achieve success in careers as physician-scientists involved in basic and translational research. To help them reach the
highest levels of success, our goals for the next 5 years include: 1) Providing our trainees with academic programs that
integrate basic science with clinical medicine; 2) Providing our trainees with a new career mentorship program that
features successful physician-scientists; 3) Build on existing programs to enhance camaraderie and instill confidence that
the physician-scientist pathway is viable and worthwhile; 4) Working with our PSTP colleagues to further enhance the
likelihood of success of our students; 5) Working with our institutional stakeholders to reduce time to degree without
sacrificing necessary rigor, and 6) Building on our recent success in recruiting a diverse cohort of individuals who will be
well trained to be leaders in the discovery and application of ground-breaking research and innovative patient care."
10876279,"Project Summary
 Despite decades of reaction development, medicinal chemists still frequently face synthetic barriers when
preparing molecules with potential therapeutic value. For example, the substitution of C–H bonds for C–F bonds
in a target molecule can improve its metabolic stability, membrane permeability, and biological activity, but this
substitution is often impossible to realize in the laboratory. This obstacle arises because the fluorination of
otherwise simple building blocks or reagents generally renders them gaseous, toxic, corrosive, or unstable. While
this “reagent problem” is not limited to organofluorine chemistry, it has prevented significant advances in this
area. Therefore, the overall objective of the proposed research is to “tame” the reactivity of fluorinated building
blocks and enable their use for the construction of complex fluorinated molecules. Specifically, the proposed
multidisciplinary program aims to employ insoluble porous nanomaterials, which commonly serve as “hosts” for
“guest” molecules in materials science, to control the reactivity of fluorinating agents. The resulting
heterogeneous species will function as “nanovessels” capable of controllably releasing the stored reagents or
as “nanoreactors” that facilitate new transformations within their pores. The central hypothesis of this proposal
is that metal–organic frameworks, a relatively new class of porous, crystalline materials constructed from organic
“linkers” and inorganic “secondary building units,” are the ideal platform to achieve this objective due to their
unparalleled structural tunability. This research aim is part of the PI’s broader research program to unlock the
potential of metal–organic frameworks for applications in organic synthesis, medicine, and structural biology.
 The proposed research is composed of three comprehensive projects that target specific challenges of
working with fluorinated reagents, all of which can be translated to applications involving non-fluorinated building
blocks as well. First, fluorination depresses the boiling point of molecules, rendering most simple building blocks
(such as trifluoromethyl iodide, CF3I) gases at room temperature. By using metal–organic frameworks to
reversibly sequester these gases into the solid state, medicinal chemists will be able to safely handle them as
powders. Second, fluorinated anions such as trifluoromethoxide (CF3O–) are typically unstable, and one of the
most promising avenues to utilize them in organic synthesis – stabilization in stoichiometric late transition metal
complexes – is hindered by purification, cost, and reliability concerns. This proposal aims to overcome these
challenges by moving these complexes to the solid state as recyclable metal–organic framework ”nanoreactors.”
Last, radical and electrophilic fluorinated building blocks can be tricky to prepare and often have undesirable
reactivity patterns. This proposal aims to overcome these limitations by building on known reactivity in molecular
complexes and metal–organic frameworks to generate these species in controlled fashion at high-valent metal
centers. Overall, the proposed research program is significant because over the next five years it will enable the
preparation of previously inaccessible fluorinated compounds and their evaluation as next-generation medicines."

Cells are the building blocks of life. The functions of tissues and organs emerge from the dynamic properties and
interactions of cell types. The diversity of cell types and cellular states, over time scales ranging from minutes to
millennia, underlies the anatomical and physiological diversity of animals. Because cellular diversity is ultimately
the result of differential gene expression, studying organismal biology from a cell type perspective is necessary
to link genes to animal physiology and pathology. The overarching goal of our research program is to
understand how the molecular diversity and evolution of cell types determines how vertebrate species adapt
differently to changes in their environment. We focus on problems where the evolutionary perspective has the
potential to reveal fundamental principles that may generalize across species. A smaller part of the lab
investigates the relationships between cell type evolution and the evolution of behavior. The majority of the lab
focuses on regeneration, to elucidate how dynamic interactions of cell types in space and time result in the
regeneration of complex tissues and body parts, with an emphasis on those cell types and interactions that might
be conserved across body parts and species.
Our goal for the next five years is to lay the foundations of this research program. Specifically, we propose to
develop further the Spanish ribbed newt Pleurodeles waltl as a model for regeneration. Urodele amphibians such
as newts are the terrestrial vertebrates with the highest regenerative capacity. Pleurodeles is an excellent
complement to axolotl, the most popular amphibian model for regeneration: (i) these two species diverged about
150 million years ago, and their comparison may reveal fundamental principles of regeneration; (ii) unlike axolotl,
Pleurodeles has a complete life cycle, including metamorphosis into a true adult stage; (iii) Pleurodeles has a
sequenced genome and established methods for transgenesis and genome editing.
To maximize the impact of our research and discover evolutionarily conserved mechanisms, we will focus on
the nerve dependence of regeneration, a phenomenon observed in almost every highly-regenerative species
and in a variety of tissues. Specifically, we will compare brain and limb regeneration. First, we will determine
whether regeneration depends on the same neural secreted proteins in these two different contexts. Second,
we will clarify whether neural activity is necessary to mediate the effects of nerves on regeneration. Third, we
will decipher how neural signals induce the proliferation of stem or progenitor cells.
Impact: this work will reveal molecular and cellular mechanisms of regeneration that generalize across body
parts, and lay the foundation for comparative studies across species. The discovery of general mechanisms
underlying regeneration will clarify why many species, including humans, have lost regenerative capacity, and
may catalyze the development of new approaches for human regenerative medicine."
10876402,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of focal epilepsy and is often refractory to medical
management. In addition to seizures, patients often suffer from cognitive comorbidities, with memory impairment
being the characteristic deficit seen in TLE. Despite the severe impact on patients’ quality of life, the mechanisms
underlying poor memory are not understood and therapies that directly address it are limited. Previous studies
in the lab have identified impaired place cell stability in the pilocarpine mouse model of TLE, which could underlie
the spatial memory dysfunction in these animals. The place cell deficits do not emerge until 6-weeks after the
epileptogenic insult (i.e. pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, SE), suggesting that there are pathological
processes triggered initially that take weeks to degrade hippocampal coding. This delay presents an opportunity
for therapeutic intervention to prevent the degradation of hippocampal spatial representation, and is an important
timepoint to examine for a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular basis of memory
dysfunction in TLE. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that circuit reorganization precedes the changes in
network properties that cause place cell dysfunction and memory impairment, and that modulating circuit
reorganization can improve place cell functioning and memory. Given the great cell type heterogeneity in the
hippocampus, we performed single nuclei RNA sequencing on hippocampal tissue to determine cell type specific
transcriptomic changes. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) a different time points after
pilocarpine-induced SE and focus follow-up studies on astrocytes given their emerging role in cognitive
processing. To enrich for changes relevant to memory impairment, we compared the astrocytic DEGs at 3-weeks
to a previously characterized Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model. AD, like TLE, is a disorder afflicted by memory
impairment and has prominent hippocampal involvement. Within the overlapping genes, there is a functionally
linked subset with roles in proteolysis: Cathepsins B, D, and L (Ctsb, Ctsd, Ctsl) and cystatin C (Cst3). These
candidate genes have each been implicated in AD pathology in humans, although whether their role is protective
or pathogenic is not fully determined. Additionally, while they were identified through analysis of astrocytic DEGs,
they are broadly expressed across many cell types. In this proposal, we will use a CRISPR-mediated gene
deletion strategy to selectively knockout each of these candidates from astrocytes, microglia, and interneurons.
The effects of the knockouts on performance on a memory task will be determined in Aim 1. In Aim 2, the different
knockouts will be evaluated in terms of their effects on hippocampal electrophysiology (sharp wave ripple
occurrence, theta phase locking) and their effects on place cell function. In Aim 3, histological studies will be
performed to evaluate the effects of the knockouts on a cellular level, looking at mossy fiber sprouting and
synapse quantity. These experiments will elucidate the role of the candidate genes on memory processes and
determine what the relative contributions are from each cell type."
10876405,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
The candidate, Dr. Elizabeth Moore, seeks the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award
(K01) to acquire the necessary training and experience to become an independent translational clinician-
scientist focusing on tumor microenvironmental regulation of breast cancer (BC) genome stability and
therapeutic resistance. BC therapeutic resistance remains a major hindrance to successful treatment,
particularly in the aggressive triple negative (TNBC) subtype. However, it remains unclear how therapeutic
response is influenced by the physical and biological characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and which
role altered DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms and metabolic reprogramming play this process. In
particular, it remains to be elucidated how fibrotic remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which is a
hallmark feature of a protumorigenic microenvironment, impact BC risk and drug resistance. Given these
connections, the overall objective of the proposed studies will be to identify mechanisms of matrix-mediated
BC therapeutic resistance. Aim 1 will determine the impact of fibrotic ECM on BC DNA damage response
(DDR). Aim 2 will test how fibrotic ECM regulates the DDR and metabolism of tumor cells and their reciprocal
interactions. Aim 3 will test the functional links between fibrotic ECM, DDR, and metabolism in vivo. Aims 1 and
2 will utilize translationally relevant, high fidelity 3D tissue culture systems in which features of fibrotic ECM
remodeling can be selectively adjusted. Aim 3 will leverage a humanized mouse model of mammary fibrosis
and TNBC using human BC cell lines and patient derived xenografts of TNBC. A multidisciplinary approach,
including classic molecular techniques, gene expression analyses, metabolomics and Seahorse metabolic
analyses, and advanced imaging will be applied to achieve these aims and for the candidate to acquire
additional technical skills. Dr. Moore’s mentor is a leading expert in engineering in vitro and in vivo models to
study tumor-microenvironment interactions. Co-mentors will provide expertise in the fields of genome stability
and the DDR, cellular metabolism and metabolomics, and clinical aspects of breast cancer. Faculty expertise
and interdisciplinary collaboration in oncology research is exceptionally strong at Cornell University and further
strengthened by the training environment and exceptional core facilities. The planned career development
activities, including technical research training, coursework, attendance of seminars and conferences,
experience in grant and manuscript preparation, and the refinement of teaching, mentorship, and laboratory
management skills will support Dr. Moore’s transition to independence. The incorporation of physical and life
science approaches, utilization of highly translational in vitro and in vivo platforms, and the integration of both
extracellular and intracellular regulation of BC genome stability will enable Dr. Moore to establish a niche in
oncology research. Proposed activities will generate data for a future R01 application and launch Dr. Moore’s
faculty career in advancing the field of breast cancer biology with the goal to improve patient prognosis."
10876610,"PROJECT SUMMARY - EVALUATION CORE
The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) seeks to revolutionize biomedical research through strategic
investments in informatics tools, personnel, and data. The Evaluation Core will be responsible for performing an
annual evaluation of the CFDE, assessing the program's progress toward its goals. For high-visibility CF
programs, undergoing such assessments can enhance their reputation, increase impact, and foster positive
outcomes. The Evaluation Core will produce annual reports aggregating metrics, interpreting findings, and
issuing recommendations while providing advice and guidance based on the evaluation process. We propose a
stakeholder and community informed continuous evaluation and improvement process across the CFDE, utilizing
our expertise in automated systems, data integration, and stakeholder engagement. Working under the Office of
Strategic Coordination (OSC) and in collaboration with NIH staff, we will achieve the following aims: 1) establish
evaluation metrics aligned with CFDE principles through stakeholder engagement, 2) implement processes that
continually integrate resources to gather metrics across CF programs, including the CFDE, 3) develop a report
generator for CF programs and the CFDE to provide dashboards and continuously-updated reports to project
leaders and stakeholders; 4) engage with CF programs and the CFDE to provide guidance based on findings
from evaluation metrics, understand gaps in metrics and reports, and ensure continuous improvement. Inspired
by the agile framework, our approach supports annual evaluations while offering immediate feedback for CFDE
components. This strategy maximizes the core's impact by generating metrics informed by diverse perspectives,
developing software and automation for evaluating CFDE components, creating integrated reports combining
narrative interpretation with quantitative metrics, and implementing agile practices for continuous improvement.
Our proposed Evaluation Core will provide impartial, transparent, and constructive guidance. Our focus on
collaboratively developing principle-guided metrics through stakeholder engagement ensures a smooth
evaluation process, eliminating unexpected outcomes and fostering a sense of fairness."

We are an experienced interdisciplinary team who has been a part of the CFDE community since 2014. Our
team offer 20+ years of combined experience in data repositories, data management, cloud computing, and
FAIR data. We are excited for this opportunity to establish the CFDE ICC Sustainability Core (ICC-SC),
to facilitate successful transition of CF program digital assets, including their datasets, software tools
and workflows, as well as e-Learning materials. We are committed to sustain the wealth of knowledge
contributed by the CF programs via education, outreach, and dissemination programs. Our ICC-SC
team will serve as ambassadors to advocate and to champion the grand accomplishments of the CFDE
community. In view of our opportunities and challenges, we propose a CF program digital asset transfer
strategy with 3 specific aims as well as 7 supporting, interconnected, multi-dimensional, and action-packed
milestones and deliverables (see details in the section of Research Strategy).
Briefly, to enable smooth digital asset transitioning efforts and to maximize dissemination and community re-
use, we define five action items to guide CF digital asset transfer: Meet, Assess, Transfer, Coordinate,
Handover (MATCH). Meet. At launch, the ICC-SC, we will invite CF program representatives to meet with
suitable NIH IC-specific, specialized, and public repositories to identify challenges and opportunities in
2-3 matchmaking conferences. Assess. The ICC-SC will help identify needs of both parties to collaborate on a
stewardship plan following the devised diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) minded standard
operation protocols (SOPs) for the CF Digital Asset Transfer. Transfer. The process of comprehensive and
secure digital transfer will begin with CF programs creating an inventory for all relevant digital files and
metadata. Coordinate. The ICC-SC will facilitate a transition period, coordinating closely with both parties
to ensure smooth transition of stewardship. The ICC will monitor the secure relocation of assets and
implement backup, versioning, and recovery strategies where applicable. Handover. Following transition,
responsibilities will be handed over to the new steward, with partial ownership by CF programs negotiated
where applicable. To facilitate MATCH, we will construct a web-based application, the “CFDE Digital Asset
Repository Roadmap” linked under the CFDE portal; it will connect CF programs online with suitable IC-
specific, specialized, and public repositories. In collaboration with the Evaluation Core at ICC, we will
implement periodical review of our progress and we will refine our strategy to assure program success
moving forward. In summary, our efforts will showcase CF program success, amplify their impacts, and
extend this invaluable treasure to benefit the wider biomedical community, and to inspire new innovations."
10875152,"Project Summary
Hunger and thirst are powerful motivational states that drive intense attraction to need-related stimuli. Here, we
investigate how hunger and thirst differentially focus behavioral attention towards food and drink odors but not
other olfactory cues. These studies should help provide insight into long-standing questions in neuroscience,
including how various sensory inputs are distinctly represented in the brain, and how physiological state
influences behavior. The olfactory system detects a myriad of odors that elicit diverse perceptions, and in mice,
food odors, pheromones, and predator odors differentially influence feeding, mating, and fear. One model is
that the olfactory system uses parallel processing streams to channel particular sensory inputs into appropriate
behavioral outputs. Interestingly, hunger and thirst influence only select olfactory pathways, enhancing
attraction to food and drink odors respectively but not pheromones. Yet, molecular and cellular features that
distinguish olfactory circuits responsive to food or drink odors are unknown. Here, we will leverage powerful
genetic approaches in mice to study how hunger and thirst selectively and differentially gate odor responses.
We recently observed that hunger shifts odor preference through a Neuropeptide Y (NPY) spotlight (Nature
2021). Optogenetic stimulation of hypothalamic AGRP (Agouti-related peptide) neurons, like fasting, promotes
attraction to food odors but not pheromones through specific projections to the paraventricular nucleus of the
thalamus (PVT). Knockout mice lacking NPY or one of its receptors (NPY5R) fail to prefer food odors over
pheromones after fasting, with normal behavior restored by cell-specific NPY rescue or acute NPY injection in
the absence of further training. Thus, food odor-responsive neurons comprise an olfactory subcircuit that
listens to hunger state through thalamic NPY release. Here, we will build off of these findings by using NPY5R
as a genetic handle to characterize key neurons involved in food odor responses. Npy5r mRNA is highly
expressed in olfactory (piriform) cortex but not PVT, and NPY5R neurons from the piriform cortex are back
labeled by tracer injection in the PVT. We hypothesize that NPY5R acts in PVT-projecting axons of food odor-
responsive cortical neurons. We made new mouse models for Cre-based knockout and rescue of the Npy5r
gene to pinpoint the site of NPY5R action, as well as Npy5r-p2a-Cre mice to enable optogenetics and fiber
photometry experiments. Moreover, in preliminary data, we developed a paradigm to measure thirst-driven
odor attraction, and are poised to chart how thirst and hunger exert differential control over olfactory
responses. Together, these Aims should help reveal how neural circuits represent different classes of olfactory
cues and mediate state-dependent behaviors."
10876939,"PROJECT SUMMARY
Scaffolded stem cell transplantation has the potential to provide structured chemical and mechanical cues to
guide cell growth into functional tissues for regenerative medicine. However, significant challenges have limited
the clinical success of this approach. Cells implanted in large scaffolds often have limited viability due to
hypoxic conditions in the host, while cells injected individually or in small clusters often suffer from poor
retention at the site of injury. Hydrogels are commonly utilized as stem cell scaffold materials because they
confer substantial flexibility in terms of chemical composition and ligand integration. However, hydrogels are
also typically amorphous, limiting control over ligand presentation (important for adhesion and signaling), and
lacking structural cues such as fibers that are present in biological ECM, which impacts mechanical strength.
We have recently demonstrated that it is possible to generate stable, 1-nm-resolution functional patterns on
amorphous polyacrylamide and polydimethylsiloxane surfaces, using sub-nm-thick films of highly ordered
polydiacetylenes (PDAs) that are preassembled and covalently transferred to the hydrogel surface. Our
approach potentially addresses both chemical and mechanical challenges associated with hydrogel stem cell
scaffolds, enabling generation of cell-instructive hydrogel tapes that can be shaped to create 3D scaffolds.
However, to be useful in clinical settings, this strategy will need to be validated with: (1) commonly used
hydrogel stem cell scaffold materials, (2) hydrogel moduli matching the range commonly associated with
tissues, and (3) films thin enough for adequate perfusion to prevent hypoxia and enable normal secretome
interactions. Here, we develop a platform technology based on cell-instructive hydrogel tapes, benchmarking
their chemical and mechanical properties, and their impacts on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs).
In Aim 1, we evaluate the hypothesis that PDA surface functionalization can improve chemical control over
surfaces of hydrogels common in regenerative medicine, orienting and spatially clustering ligand presentation,
to modify stem cell growth in a predictable fashion. We test this by culturing hMSCs on surfaces designed to
maintain stemness or to induce specified differentiation behavior (angiogenesis, adipogenesis,
chondrogenesis), benchmarking against common stochastic hydrogel modification strategies.
In Aim 2, we evaluate the hypothesis that our PDA surface-functionalization approach can improve the
mechanical and handling properties of thin, soft hydrogel films, enabling creation of cell-instructive hydrogel
tapes. We generate and test impacts of paired tapes as cell sandwich scaffolds and 3D constructs that provide
structured chemical surfaces and mechanical environments, while maximizing perfusion to and from cells.
Overall, this proposal develops a modular surface functionalization strategy that can be easily integrated with
many existing hydrogels for tissue scaffolds, providing structured ligand presentation and mechanical strength
aimed at improving utility in clinical cell transplantation therapies."

The profound detrimental impact to society from individuals abusing drugs is well established. To meet the
challenge of developing new and effective treatments to help those that have succumbed to the temptation of
drug use and abuse, we need to inspire the next generation of students to pursue research careers in the field.
The need is particularly acute among populations of students who are currently underrepresented in the field of
drug abuse. Published analyses indicate that exposing undergraduate students, especially early in their career,
to laboratory research is an extremely effective way for developing their interest in research as a profession.
Since 1989, the University of Minnesota of has recognized and met this challenge by offering summer
residential research programs in the biomedical sciences. This proposal is the competitive renewal of a training
program that specifically provides research experience in the field of drug addiction. Our goal is to train
undergraduate students who have completed their freshman or sophomore years in college. We will recruit
students nationally, accepting students from groups that are underrepresented within the biomedical research
profession. We will provide them with a 10-week intensive research experience that will include professional
mentoring (academic survival skills and preparation for graduate school) as well as workshops on research
ethics. Our goal is to inspire a new generation of drug abuse researchers. In turn, we expect these individuals
to become part of the research infrastructure dedicated to solving medical problems of nervous system
dysfunction"
10876947,"Project Summary / Abstract
 Computational biophysics and drug discovery need much faster, better, and in some cases
completely reformulated physical modeling of protein solvation and of protein-protein interactions:
for designing macrocyclic compounds that can sandwich into large protein-protein interfaces; for
modeling biochemical pathways; for computing multi-antibody motions, binding and recognition;
for formulating therapeutic protein solutions against folding and aggregation instabilities; and to
mitigate against diseases of protein aggregation.
 Achieving fast, accurate and scalable modeling of proteins that are large or in complexes or
aggregates, and that are in water, requires a team that can innovate from four largely non-
overlapping research communities: atomistic protein MD, protein-protein docking, protein-colloid
liquid-state theory, and water statistical mechanics. Combining these approaches is needed for big
advances toward fast and accurate computer modeling on biologically relevant time and space
scales, with proper statistical mechanics. Here, our team is 6 PIs that have already been pairwise
highly collaborative (42 joint papers), and that each bring forefront capabilities (Simmerling, a key
developer or AMBER and GBNECK; Kozakov, developer of CLUSPRO, top protein-protein interaction
webserver in CAPRI; Coutsias, mathematical geometer whose BRIKARD gives proven acceleration of
constrained search by 100x; Hribar-Lee, whose Wertheim Theory successfully predicts simple
protein aggregation; Fennell, developer of SEA, a fast accurate water model; and Dill, developer of
statistical mechanical models of water and of MELD, an MD accelerator that has proven successful
in CASP).
 Our 5-year Aims include: (A) Going beyond rigid protein-protein docking, to include
conformational flexibility, atomic detail, scalability to large systems, and affinities. (B) Predicting
protein and antibody aggregation hot-spots and dependencies on salts and excipients. (C)
Developing AmberSB force fields with next generation implicit solvent, and faster, more accurate
surface-area calculations, with blind testing in CASP, SAMPL and CAPRI events. (D) Developing
‘super-fast’ analytical water models for solution equilibria, and for water dynamics, such as
diffusion, viscosities and transport at surfaces and through pores. A Team Management Plan is
proposed to optimize collaborative research with concerted leadership, and to provide for ongoing
communication, engagement and the development of collective intelligence."
10877706,"The opioid and overdose crisis in the United States (US) disproportionately affects women of childbearing age
(15–44 years), particularly pregnant women and their newborns: 20% of pregnant women are prescribed opioids
during pregnancy.1,2 States have enacted both general opioid policies (e.g., access to medication for opioid use
disorder (MOUD)) and policies specific to substance use during pregnancy, but the effects of these policies on
pregnant women’s opioid use and newborn outcomes remain poorly defined. States’ policy responses to prenatal
opioid use vary widely, resulting in inconsistent approaches to pregnant women’s opioid use. In this mixed-
methods project, we will apply a convergent parallel design to examine the separate and combined impacts and
consequences of state opioid policies on pregnant women and their newborns using Medicaid and commercial
insurance databases (MarketScan). We aim to: 1. Examine the separate effects of general and prenatal state
opioid policies on pregnant/postpartum women and newborns. We will: 1a) systematically map all 50 states’
prenatal opioid policies (2011–2020) to categorize policy variations and build a publicly available time-varying
dataset; 1b) use this prenatal policy dataset and existing data on general opioid policies to explore the individual-
level impact of general and prenatal opioid policies on opioid use disorder (OUD), MOUD access, and neonatal
opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) for pregnant women and their newborns; and 1c) test for effect modification
by maternal race/ethnicity and age. 2. Investigate the combined effects of general and prenatal state opioid
policies on pregnant/postpartum women and their newborns (2011-2020). To move beyond the impact of
single policies in isolation, we will: 2a) use a modified Delphi approach to create a time-varying taxonomy of
each state’s overall opioid policy climate relevant to pregnant women, ranging from penalizing to health-
promoting, based on states’ combination of prenatal and general opioid policies; and 2b) explore the individual-
level impact of states’ overall policy climates on pregnant/postpartum women and newborns using the same
outcomes and effect modification as Aim 1. 3. Explore how prenatal policy implementation affects daily life
for pregnant women and their newborns. We will: 3a) apply the Consolidated Framework for Implementation
Research (CFIR) to interviews with 60 key stakeholders across states that vary by their overall policy climate to
explore multilevel drivers of prenatal opioid policy implementation and how variations in implementation affect
maternal and newborn health; and 3b) create an ethnographic cohort of 40 pregnant women who use opioids
across states with four different prenatal policy climates (punitive, prosocial, mixed, inaction) and conduct three
interviews with each over one year. We will explore how variations in prenatal opioid policy implementation affect
how women navigate pre- and postnatal care, MOUD use, and state services. Findings will have concrete real-
world impacts by describing the effects of state opioid policies on pregnant/postpartum women and their
newborns and by identifying intervention points and policy changes that promote maternal and infant wellbeing."
10877708,"Excessive osteoclast activity underlies many bone diseases such as osteoporosis, periodontitis, rheumatoid
arthritis and Paget’s disease. Bone resorption requires degradation of organic bone matrix, whose main
component is type I collagen. To degrade bone matrix, osteoclasts secrete cathepsin K (CtsK), a potent
collagenase that functions optimally under acidic pH. CtsK-null mice display severe osteopetrotic phenotype
despite normal differentiation of osteoclasts, which strongly supports the essential role of CtsK in bone
resorption. A highly positively charged protein, CtsK is known to bind negatively charged glycosaminoglycans,
among which it binds heparan sulfate (HS) most avidly. Widely distributed at the cell surface and in the
extracellular matrix, it is conceivable that the high-affinity interaction between CtsK and HS plays a role in CtsK
biology. However, how HS regulates the biological functions of CtsK remains completely unknown. The
persistence of this critical knowledge gap prevents us from gaining a more complete understanding of CtsK
biology, and likely also from fulfilling the therapeutic potential of targeting CtsK. Our central hypothesis is that
heparan sulfate regulates the activity and localization of CtsK, and that CtsK activity can be
manipulated by targeting its HS-binding site. Guided by strong preliminary data generated in the lab, our
hypothesis will be tested by pursuing the following three specific aims. Aim 1: Determine the structural
details of CtsK-HS interaction. We will employ complementary biophysical/biochemical methods including
X-ray crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering and HS oligosaccharide microarray to understand the
structural basis of CtsK-HS interaction. Aim 2: Determine the biological roles of CtsK-HS interaction. By
utilizing a newly generated knock-in mouse strain bearing an HS-binding deficient CtsK (CtsK∆HS), we will try to
understand the physiological consequence of disrupted CtsK-HS interaction. Aim 3: Inhibition of CtsK with
structurally defined HS oligosaccharides. We will examine the antiresorptive activity of CtsK-binding HS
oligosaccharides in a number of murine models of bone remodeling. By investigating CtsK-HS interaction using
a combination of in vitro and in vivo methods, our contribution will be significant because we will identify
multiple mechanisms by which HS regulates the biological functions of CtsK. Without this critical knowledge,
our understanding of CtsK biology will never be complete. The outcome of our investigation could also help
design novel ways of manipulating the activity of this highly important protease. In particular, because HS
possesses the unique property of selectively inhibiting the collagenase activity of CtsK without compromising
its normal peptidase activity, our investigation might help develop an ideal CtsK inhibitor for treating many bone
diseases."

Despite the access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), and its effectiveness controlling viral load and disease
progression, HIV-associated cognitive impairment (HIV-CI) prevail in 20-50% of the people with HIV infection
(PWH). The mechanisms involved in HIV neuropathogenesis remain to be elucidated. Health disparities have
been identified in the prevalence of HIV-CI being more prevalent in Hispanics, women, and older PWH. A
recent study on PWH in the United States (US) revealed that Hispanics (of Puerto Rican [PR] and Mexican
self-reported descent) are at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment compared to non-Hispanic white.
Moreover, Hispanics of PR descent, in this sample largely from New York City (NYC), demonstrated increased
rates of HIV-CI when compared to Mexicans from San Diego, CA. Health literacy, access to health care, and
language barrier have been attributed to these disparities. However, these factors alone may not justify the
observed disparities among Hispanics. Structural racism and discrimination (SRD) may contribute to these
discrepancies and lead to poorer health outcomes for racial/ethnic minorities. SRD refers to the totality of ways
in which societies foster racial discrimination (e.g., housing, education, employment, healthcare, and criminal
justice). There are limited studies evaluating SRD as determinants of health in biomedical research including
HIV-CI. Our overall objective is to determine the biological, behavioral, and environmental factors within the
cohorts of PWH in PR (PR-PR), Puerto Ricans in the US (PR-NYC), and Mexicans in San Diego (Mex-SD) to
determine similarities and differences that could identify unique factors explaining the disparities in HIV-CI
among Hispanics. By bringing together diverse national Hispanic cohorts we will have a unique opportunity to
address a common hypothesis. The following aims are proposed: 1. Determine the association between SRD
and perceived/felt stigma, stress, and systemic inflammation. 2. Determine the association between SRD and
HIV-CI. 3. Test our hypothesis that PWH living in Puerto Rico show greater association between SRD and HIV-
CI, compared to the other two groups. The findings from this study will increase our understanding about the
relationship between SRD and HIV-CI in a Hispanic HIV infected population and identify factors that may be
modified. These are important steps in advancing towards health equity, improve HIV outcomes, and end the
HIV epidemic."

The RCMI-Center for Collaborative Research in Health Disparities (RCMI-CCRHD) at the University of Puerto
Rico Medical Sciences Campus proposes an Investigator Development Core (IDC) for its budgetary cycle 2017-
2022. The RCMI-CCRHD will coordinate a pilot-project program (PPP) to nurture the growth of promising junior
faculty within the UPR-MSC by soliciting and reviewing grants, and awarding funds to innovative proposals that
will lead to competitive independent funding. The overall goals of the IDC are three-fold: 1) to mentor early career
investigators as they transition to independent funding; 2) to fund innovative basic, behavioral and/or clinical pilot
projects focusing on health disparities and/or minority health; 3) to match RCMI faculty with outside
collaborators/mentors in order to strengthen collaborative networks. At the end of the proposed cycle, it is
expected that 6-8 Early Stage Investigators (ESI), working on basic biomedical, behavioral and/or health
services/clinical research, will have been funded, mentored, and well on their way to independent funding
relevant to minority health and health disparities. We plan to accomplish this goal through the following Specific
Aims: Grantees will receive a two-year grant of $40-50,000 per year in order to sustain studies for a sufficient
period of time to compete successfully for outside funding. Mentoring activities will include bimonthly meetings
to review progress, developing personalized short- and long-term career development plans, rehearsal of
scientific presentations, discussion of topics relevant to successful transition to running their own labs; and CSR-
style mock study-sections. Tracking and evaluation mechanisms will be established to measure scientific
progress and ensure that the goals of the program are met, including increasing the number of publications,
generating preliminary data, and increasing grant applications and awards (including R-type and K awards).
Outcome metrics will be used to refine or refocus the solicitation, review, selection, and funding of applications
made to the PPP. Staff from the Administrative Core will support and monitor full compliance with local and
federal regulatory requirements. The IDC will be directed by Dr. Gregory J. Quirk, a retired senior neuroscientist
at UPR-RCM, and Dr. Luis Montaner, a senior scientist and Vice President for Scientific Operations at The Wistar
Institute in PA. Both directors have extensive mentoring experience, which has been documented in recent
publications. The directors will be assisted by the scientific mentors to include added scientific expertise as
determined by mentee needs inclusive of representation of the basic, behavioral and health services/clinical
areas. The IDC will coordinate closely with other NIH-supported programs at the UPR-MSC to share mentoring
activities and resources and avoid support overlap."
10879178,"Project Summary: Community Engagement Core
The goal of mitigating health disparities in Puerto Rico is a formidable task that cannot be achieved without
community engagement initiatives. These are based on promoting sustainable community-academic
partnerships that can improve researchers’ cultural competency, translate research findings to diverse
stakeholders, and promote changes at the local level. To achieve CEC’s main goal, the following key
activities will be conducted: (1) Establish and enhance sustainable community-academic partnerships
involved in translational research in Puerto Rico, to address health related concerns and promote
participation in the Center’s activities. The CEC will continue to foster relationships with local community
and health organizations through collaborations such as coordination of educational activities, development
of educational materials, need-assessment surveys and other community outreach activities that consider
their specific needs. (2) Increase RCMI investigators’ cultural competency and strengthen community
engagement approaches in research projects involving minority health and health disparities. The CEC will
organize a series of activities such as an annual retreat, symposiums, seminars and workshops aimed at
increasing investigators’ knowledge of community engagement strategies, along with having recurrent
meetings with the CCRHD-supported investigators. Also, the Core will develop an infrastructure to
implement the Community Engagement Studio, a strategy that allows researchers to obtain feedback from
community experts. (3) Coordinate a Community Coalition Team (CCT) that will advise RCMI investigators
on research areas of high interest to the community, strategies to improve the recruitment and retention of
study participants, and methods to disseminate research findings to a variety of audiences. The CCT will
support and collaborate with the CEC in the development and implementation of our strategic work plan.
(4) Evaluate the activities and strategies implemented by the Community Engagement Core (CEC) and the
extent to which the Core has achieved its goals each year. The CEC will use diverse methods to conduct
evaluations such as surveys, attendance lists, testimonies (writings, videos), social-media statistics and a
SWOT analysis. (5) Disseminate CEC and RCMI-wide activities and educational content to diverse
stakeholders, and translate research findings into sustainable community changes at the local level. The
Core will use existing CCRHD social-media accounts to create and share relevant content and also
promote health literacy among communities through research translation."
10879179,"PROJECT SUMMARY – RESEARCH CAPACITY CORE (RCC)
Convergent external and internal trends at the UPR Medical Sciences Campus (MSC) will shape the
institutions’ research portfolio for the next five years: 1) Scientists at the MSC continue to perform studies at
the molecular level that require Genomics and Proteomics approaches. 2) Researchers at the MSC’s
Institute of Neurobiology rely on cutting-edge imaging resources and specialized methods to learn about
the structure and function of the nervous system. 3) The threat of endemic and newly emerging infections

(GS), Proteomics Services (PS), Neurogenetics & Bio-imaging Services (NBS), and Tropical and Emerging
Infectious Diseases Research Services (TEIDRS) into one transdisciplinary capacity core. The goal of the RCC
is to maximize the quality and productivity of the research projects proposed in the Research Projects Core and
in the pilot projects that will be funded through the Investigator Development Core. This RCC will also promote
collaboration between RCMI faculty and other researchers throughout the institution and leverage other RCMI
cores, especially the Administration and Community Engagement cores. These objectives will be accomplished
via the following specific aims: 1) assist researchers with integrated informatics solutions such as
bioinformatics, health informatics and data science as they apply to biomedical research; 2) provide advice
in experimental design, training and high-end services to support Genomics and Proteomics research; 3)
provide state-of-the-art Neurogenetics and Bio-imaging services, and 4) provide access to key resources,
services, advice in experimental design and training for research on Tropical and Emerging Infectious
Diseases. The RCC will be managed by a faculty Core Director and a team of Facility Leaders with relevant
expertise. Technical Specialist staff will be responsible for daily operations and laboratory technologies
management. A central electronic ticket system will allow users to request any service, track progress,
completion of services, and schedule use of shared instrumentation. The RCC will continue integrating the cost
recovery, managed centrally by the RCMI Program Administrator. Internal and external collaborations have been
secured to avoid duplication of services and resources. Instrumentation, hardware, and most software required
for the provision of these services are already fully operational. The synergy among the RCC and its collaborating
partners will facilitate basic and translational biomedical research, stimulate studies on health disparities, and
contribute to the development of a diverse biomedical workforce at the MSC."
10878693,"As many as 90% of Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) report nightmares and
insomnia and even when nightmares are excluded, sleep disturbances are the most prevalent symptoms of
PTSD with roughly 50%-70% of patients suffering from co-occurring sleep disorders. The typical sleep
complaints include nightmares, distressed awakenings, nocturnal panic attacks, sleep terrors and insomnia.
While it has long been established that PTSD engenders sleep disturbances and averse clinical outcomes,
current investigations indicate that disordered sleep is also a risk factor for the development of PTSD.
 In military personnel with combat exposure, comorbid insomnia and OSA, a condition originally labeled
as “complex insomnia” has emerged as one of the most challenging sleep disorder to manage. In the
presence of PTSD, the co-occurrence of OSA and insomnia is also associated with significant morbidity.
Veterans with both PTSD and complex insomnia report more psychiatric symptoms, chronic pain, and higher
rates of suicide. Further, these Veterans may have more difficulty adhering to CPAP because of increased
awareness of the mask due to frequent awakenings and an inability to initiate or return to sleep with the mask
in place. Fortunately, there are effective treatments for each of these sleep disorders. Traditional treatment
models consist of treating OSA first, followed by adjunctive or concurrent treatment for insomnia only if the
response to CPAP is deemed unsatisfactory. However, the suboptimal response observed in Veterans with
PTSD from such an approach in terms of quality of life, PTSD symptoms, and CPAP adherence highlights
the need to examine alternative modalities of treatment. At present, there are no general guidelines on the
best strategy to treat complex insomnia in Veterans with PTSD.
 Prior studies have shown that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for treating insomnia
when compared with hypnotic agents. Whether combination therapy offers a therapeutic advantage over CBT
alone for complex insomnia in Veterans with PTSD is yet to be determined. The objective of this proposal is
to conduct a pragmatic, randomized, parallel clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of Brief Behavioral
Therapy for Insomnia in Military Veterans (BBTI-MV) plus eszopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic,
versus BBTI-MV alone in 52 combat-exposed Veterans with PTSD and OSA with coexisting insomnia on
global sleep quality of life, PTSD symptoms, and CPAP adherence. The topic addresses several key areas
of unmet needs for Veterans with PTSD and sleep disordered breathing. Among these are: 1) the association
between complex insomnia and PTSD on global sleep quality of life; and 2) the effectiveness of combined
treatment of CBT and eszopiclone versus CBT alone in improving sleep quality and PTSD symptoms; and 3)
the impact of each treatment regimen on CPAP adherence. By establishing the most effective therapy in
alleviating insomnia that complicates the presence of OSA in Veterans with PTSD, higher CPAP adherence
will ultimately translate into improved cognitive function, enhanced quality of life, and suppression of PTSD
symptoms. The long term benefit of this trial will also lead to opportunities for more personalized treatment
including delivery method via mobile health technologies which will allow greater assimilation of results across
several domains."

Infection with human papilloma virus (HPV) causes endemic occurrence of cervical, head and neck and anal
cancers. Radiotherapy is the cornerstone treatment for these tumors. However, clinical outcomes in patients with
locally advanced disease remain poor due to high recurrence rates. Thus, there is a critical need to improve the
efficacy of radiation in these tumors. Epigenetic signaling pathways play a crucial role in DNA damage response
providing suitable clinical targets for improving the efficacy of radiotherapy. We demonstrate that expression of
the HPV proteins E6 and E7 alters epigenetic signaling in cancer cells. We hypothesize that these epigenomic
alterations cause tumor dependence on alternative epigenetic pathways to cope with DNA damage. Using a
CRISPR/Cas9 screen we discovered that HPV-positive cancer cells selectively depend on the chromatin modifier
NSL1 and the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 to survive radiation. The goal of this proposal is to determine the
mechanisms of DNA damage response (DDR) regulated by these pathways in the setting of HPV-induced
epigenetic changes. Our work will establish a novel concept of tumor-targeted therapy by harnessing HPV-
induced epigenomic alterations to allow specific targeting of cancer cells while sparing healthy tissues. The work
proposed here will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Dennis Hallahan, a leader clinical and experimental
radiation oncology. The candidate is an MD/PhD with training in clinical radiation oncology who seeks further
training in basic research. His long-term goal is to establish an independent research laboratory studying the
role of epigenetics in DDR. It is anticipated that the project will result in impactful contributions to the fields of
DDR and Radiation Oncology and prepare the candidate for a career as an independent investigator."
10890820,"The under-participation of minority group members in the nation's biomedical research enterprise represents
the loss of a large talent pool that has not been applied towards the solution of the Nation's many biomedical
problems. As a partial solution to this situation, three institutions in the Los Angeles basin propose a
collaborative Bridge to the Doctorate at Cal State LA (B2D@CSLA) program to increase the number of
talented minority students in Ph.D. programs in the biomedical sciences. This will be done by increasing the
transfer of minority students from strong MS programs at a minority institution into PhD programs at major
research universities. These institutions are California State University, Los Angeles (Cal State LA), a minority
institution which awards the MS as its highest science degree, and two PhD-granting major research
institutions: the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), and the University of California at Irvine. We
propose to train each year a group of 25 minority students pursuing the MS degree at Cal State LA in a
program designed to enhance their academic and research achievement; integrate them into the broader
Southern California biomedical research community; expose them to a broad range of biomedical sciences and
scientists; enhance their transfer rate to PhD programs; and establish the foundation for their eventual
successful research careers in the biomedical sciences. B2D@CSLA seeks to further an established
environment at Cal State LA that mimics a doctoral program in many important respects: We provide a strong,
lab-based M.S. research environment where the research interests of the Fellows drive their placement in labs.
We design an academic plan for the Fellows that overcomes deficiencies in their undergraduate records. We
employ monthly discipline-specific journal clubs for Fellows to be trained in critical analysis of the original
research literature. We host three strong, weekly science seminar series throughout the academic year that
provide opportunities for Fellows and faculty to interact with academic scientists from PhD-granting institutions.
And we provide close mentoring to our Fellows to guide them through the academic process—mentoring
provided by a faculty that is itself well represented by minority group members. These best practices, initiated
and institutionalized by NIH-funded student training programs, have made Cal State LA a well-respected
magnet for minority science graduates in the Greater Los Angeles area to earn their MS degrees and proceed
to the PhD degree. This proposal seeks to expand these best practices at Cal State LA from two departments
to six departments, from one College to three Colleges, and from 6 students to 25 students."
10890822,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
In 2017, 1.7 million Americans suffered from opioid use disorders (OUD), which led to 47,000 American deaths
from opioid overdose. Social determinates of health (SDoH) affect patients' OUD risk level and
physicians' opioid prescribing. Physicians lack the tools to quickly and accurately assess SDoH associated
with OUD, and lack knowledge of relevant resource for intervention. Clinical decision support (CDS) could
quickly assess a patients' SDoH factors associated with OUD risk and provide actionable recommendations,
which would reduce OUD risk assessment time and address knowledge gaps. In 2018, UCSF researchers
created the Compendium of Medical Terminology Codes for Social Risk Factors that maps SDoH risks to
medical vocabularies. However, most SDoH are documented in clinical notes. My long-term career goal is
research independence with expertise in: 1) OUD risk assessment, 2) SDoH research, and 3) intervention
development, implementation, and evaluation. Related to these goals, this study will use natural language
processing (NLP) to identify SDoH in clinical notes, examine associations between SDoH and OUD,
and develop a CDS tool to assess OUD risk. We will then assess usability, acceptability, and feasibility
of using the CDS tool in clinical settings. This research will help physicians quickly and accurately assess
OUD risk, intervene earlier, and improve care. Our research aims include: Aim 1. Use NLP to identify SDoH in
clinical notes and examine associations between SDoH and OUD. We will use the Compendium and NLP to
extract new SDoH in clinical notes. Two raters will manually validate the new SDoH, and use descriptive
statistics to characterize associations between SDoH and OUD. (training goals 1 and 2). Aim 2: Develop a
CDS tool to assess OUD risk. We will use SDoH and OUD associations from aim 1 to develop a supervised
machine learning algorithm for our CDS tool. We will validate the CDS tool by measuring its ability to correctly
assess OUD risk in patients' EHR data (training goals 1 and 2). Aim 3: Test the usability, acceptability, and
feasibility of physicians' use of the CDS tool. 40 physicians will be asked to assess sample patient cases, then
given CDS results on those same cases. Physicians will indicate whether they would follow the CDS's
recommendations. Additionally, participants will be asked to complete an interview and questionnaire to
evaluate usability and acceptability. We will assess feasibility by examining recruitment, implementation, and
metadata. (training goal 3). These aims are achievable because I have experience in NLP and machine
learning and my mentors are experts in OUD research, SDoH research, and intervention design; and have an
outstanding record in career development. This K01 will help me achieve researcher independence by
providing a) skills to develop an OUD risk assessment intervention; b) expertise in a novel growing SDoH field;
c) an innovative trial-ready scalable intervention; and d) preliminary data for an R01."

In this proposal we combine a number of technological approaches to provide a novel way
to functionally characterize complex gene networks to identify those that function to
regulate biological processes in macrophages.
Advances in deep sequencing technologies have revealed that the majority of the human
genome is actively transcribed into RNA. Our lab is focused on characterizing the largest
group of RNA produced from the genome named long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) and
their associated protein binding partners. To date only 3% of lncRNAs have been
functionally validated. This project is highly innovative as we will perform the first
systematic unbiased screens and create the first genetic interaction maps to identify
functionally relevant lncRNAs involved in viability and functions within macrophages.
Using our newly developed reporter cell lines in both human and mouse we will be able to
rapidly screen and map for lncRNAs and their protein binding partners that are critical for
controlling viability and inflammatory signaling. We will also obtain crucial information on
functional conservation of lncRNAs across species. We will then create genetic mouse
models to prove the importance of these genes and their regulatory networks in controlling
immune responses during sepsis in vivo. This approach will allow for rapid meaningful
data to be obtained in a highly efficient manner. Accomplishing the ambitious goals of this
proposal will provide us with a wealth of information on the complex pathways involving
lncRNAs and gain insights into their roles in contributing to viability and functions of
macrophages."

Understanding the complex relationship between brain activity and behavior is one of the most exciting and
challenging pursuits in neuroscience. The proposed BBQS AI Resource and Data Coordinating Center
(BARD.CC) aims to facilitate innovative research in this area by managing, sharing, and harnessing the power
of vast amounts of data and machine learning resources generated by various projects within the BBQS
consortium. We will focus on five interrelated aims: 1) Data Management; 2) Data Standards; 3) Machine
Learning and Artificial Intelligence (ML/AI) Resources; 4) Data Ecosystem; and 5) Dissemination, Training, and
Coordination. The first aim is to serve as a hub for efficient data curation, management, and sharing. We will
collaborate with other BBQS projects and coordinate with existing BRAIN data archives to curate and
harmonize project data. Data management will be handled by a combination of automated data ingestion and
human oversight, transitioning to a fully automated system over time. We will work with scientists and relevant
communities to implement robust quality assurance and control solutions. The second aim focuses on
establishing data standards for novel sensors and multimodal data integration, as informed by the use of
existing standards and best practices from similar efforts. We will aggregate relevant standards for data and
metadata, data processing methods, appropriate ontologies, and common data elements, and adapt as
needed for evolving methodologies. The third aim involves the development and definition of ML/AI resources
for BBQS. We will evaluate and curate relevant ML/AI models and platforms, aggregating datasets, models,
and other ML/AI resources from both within and outside the BBQS consortium. These resources will be made
available to consortium members, with each resource's origin documented and evaluated for performance and
ethical generation and use. Moreover, all models will be made available through public repositories, allowing
for widespread access and utilization. The fourth aim involves creating a cloud-based data ecosystem and
computational platform. We will collaborate with relevant archives and computing facilities to develop a
computational platform in the cloud. This platform will enable access to and processing of even very large data
sets with commonly used pipelines and provide a wide range of users, even those with limited resources, with
computational capability to analyze and visualize data, models, and model outputs. Finally, the fifth aim is
centered around efficient dissemination, training, and coordination of BBQS research resources. We will
coordinate data sharing, offer training on relevant topics like neuroinformatics, neuroethics, and ML/AI, and
maintain a consortium Web portal. Furthermore, center staff will coordinate consortium activities like meetings,
working groups, and policy and ethics discussions, ensuring smooth and effective operation. In summary,
BARD.CC aims to catalyze the discovery of valuable insights from intricate relationships between brain activity
and behavior, which in turn could advance neuroscience and our understanding of the human mind."

The long-term goal of this K23 Career Development Award is to prepare Dr. Son H. McLaren, MD, MS for an
independent research career focused on improving the health and outcomes of infants and children presenting
to acute care settings with bronchiolitis and other potentially severe infectious illnesses through the use of
predictive modeling, integrating continuously measured (time series) physiologic or vital sign data and machine
learning techniques. Bronchiolitis, a viral lower respiratory tract infection, is the most common reason for
emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations in infants ≤90 days old, hereafter referred to as young
infants. In an ongoing prospective cohort study of young infants with bronchiolitis, Dr. McLaren found that
young infants are more likely to have potentially avoidable hospitalizations, when compared with broader age
of infants <2 years old. Over-hospitalization contributes to preventable exposure to nosocomial infections and
medical errors, undue caregiver psychosocial distress, and avoidable health care costs. As no clinical model
has been developed to predict the risk of respiratory progression in young infants, many ED clinicians struggle
with the decision to discharge infants to home even when they are well appearing. An accurate, reliable
prediction model that identifies infants at low risk of respiratory progression using clinically practical predictors
would facilitate safe ED discharge. Prior literature suggests that viral etiology and physiologic time series data
may augment prediction model accuracy, but little work has been done specifically in infants with bronchiolitis.
To address these gaps in knowledge, Dr. McLaren will pursue the following specific aims: to derive and
internally validate clinical prediction models using a) clinical history, physical examination findings, and viral
etiology (Aim 1) and b) physiologic time series data from bedside monitors (Aim 2), to identify young infants
with bronchiolitis at low risk of developing respiratory progression. Completion of these aims will create novel
prediction models incorporating comprehensive clinical, viral, and physiologic data that can inform clinical
decisions at the bedside and enable safe and objective disposition decisions. Dr. McLaren has formed a strong
team of mentors and advisors with complementary expertise in bronchiolitis epidemiology, clinical prediction
modelling, time series data analysis, and machine learning techniques to successfully conduct the proposed
study. With their dedicated mentorship, didactics, and rich training environment of Columbia University, Dr.
McLaren will achieve the following training goals: a) learn advanced research methods in clinical prediction
modeling, b) become proficient in analysis and model building using physiologic time series data, and c) gain
mentored experience in federally funded, multicenter emergency medicine research networks. The completion
of this K23 proposal will shift bronchiolitis care towards a targeted approach, afford Dr. McLaren crucial
training, and provide preliminary data necessary to inform a future R01 application to externally validate the
prediction model in diverse populations through a multicenter research network."
10866027,"PROJECT ABSTRACT
Sensorineural hearing loss is a major public health issue; by 2050, over 900 million people will have some form
of auditory impairment. The spiral ganglion nerve (SGN) plays a crucial role in hearing by transmitting acoustic
signals from the inner ear to the brain. Because the auditory nerve lacks intrinsic regenerative capacity,
damage to the nerve leads to permanent deafness. Cochlear implants are ineffective when the SGN is
damaged or lost, as observed in auditory neuropathy (AN) cases. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop
novel treatments for AN, and regenerative medicine holds enormous potential to restore SGN and treat this
condition. The spiral ganglion glial cells support, nourish, and protect the SGN and are critical for auditory
nerve function, development, and homeostasis. Direct neuronal reprogramming converts somatic cells to
induced neurons by overexpression of neuronal transcription factors (NTFs), bypassing the pluripotent state.
The spiral ganglion glial cells are considered a promising source for cellular reprogramming in the inner ear
because of their plasticity, proliferative capacity, survival post-nerve damage, and proximity to the nerve.
Recent work has shown that neonatal spiral ganglion glial cells can be converted into SGNs by overexpression
of NTFs in vitro and in vivo. However, despite administering multiple NTFs, reprogramming spiral ganglion glial
cells remains inefficient. Recent cellular reprogramming strategies incorporate neuroregulatory microRNAs
(miRNAs) to enhance the conversion of fibroblasts into induced neurons in combination with NTFs. The role of
these miRNAs in regulating SGN fate is unknown. Our primary goal in this grant proposal is to convert spiral
ganglion glial cells into SGNs via gene therapy and to advance cellular reprogramming in the inner ear. We
identify three knowledge gaps in advancing cellular reprogramming in the inner ear: 1) We know very little of
the glial cell response after SGN damage, 2) driving exogenous transgenes specifically into glial cells is
challenging, and 3) reprogramming of spiral ganglion glial cells into neurons is very inefficient, and it is not
clear if this generates the correct neuronal subtypes. We hypothesize that spiral ganglion glial cells can be
converted to SGNs in normal and deafened mice with a combination of NTFs and miRNA delivered to the glial
cells via an AAV vector. The aims of this project are (1) the characterization of age-related glial cell response
to acute SGN apoptosis by creating a neonatal mouse model of AN, (2) to optimize exogenous transgene
delivery into cochlear glial cells in neonatal mice, and (3) explore direct reprogramming of normal or damaged
glial cells in vitro. The expected results of this study will be (1) an improved understanding of age-related
changes in reactive gliosis in mice in response to SGN death, (2) improved targeting of cochlear glial cells with
a combination of glial cell-specific AAV serotypes and promoters, and (3) providing experimental evidence of
the role of NTFs and miRNA in inducing SGNs from normal and post-damaged glial cells."
10866086,"Even in the absence of active inflammation, persistent symptoms are reported in up to 46% of patients with
Crohn's disease (CD). Persistent symptoms in quiescent CD (labeled qCD+S in this grant) result in significant
deterioration in quality of life, increase risk for future opioid use, and are among the top drivers of healthcare
costs in CD. Increased intestinal permeability and visceral hypersensitivity are key pathogenic features in
patients with qCD+S. Although initially believed to be related to sub-clinical inflammation, recent studies have
shown no difference in the rate of persistent symptoms in CD patients with and without deep histologic
remission. Importantly, evidence-based treatments do not exist due to lack of understanding of the
mechanisms leading to qCD+S. Recently, altered gut microbiota have been implicated but the mechanisms by
which altered microbial communities may mediate qCD+S remain unknown. A promising development shown
by our preliminary data is enrichment of sulfidogenic bacteria and sulfur metabolic pathways in patients with
qCD+S. Dietary sulfur is metabolized by the intestinal microbiota to produce hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is
rapidly detoxified by host mitochondrial enzymes to protect the host against toxic effects of H2S. However, at
higher concentrations, microbial-derived H2S may overwhelm host mitochondrial H2S detoxifying capacity. As a
result, increased H2S levels may result in mitochondrial dysfunction, disrupt intestinal barrier function, and
exert pro-nociceptive effects. Diet, particularly consumption of animal protein, is the major determinant of H2S
production in the gut. However, the relationship between diet, sulfidogenic microbes, epithelial barrier function,
and visceral sensation in qCD+S is unknown. Thus, there is a critical need to examine the interplay between
diet, sulfidogenic microbes, host responses, and persistent symptoms in quiescent CD. The long-term goal of
this project is to accelerate development of microbial-based treatments for qCD+S. The central hypothesis is
that enrichment of sulfidogenic microbes result in dysregulated host responses, including intestinal barrier
dysfunction and visceral hypersensitivity, which may be amenable to dietary intervention. In Aim 1, we will
determine how sulfidogenic microbes influence host gene expression in qCD+S by integrating existing multi-
omic datasets from a multi-center cohort, including metagenomic and untargeted metabolomics data from stool
samples as well as host gene expression from intestinal biopsies. In Aim 2, we will perform a pilot study to
determine the feasibility and tolerability of a low sulfur diet in qCD+S. We will also test whether a low sulfur diet
may improve intestinal permeability, visceral sensation, and persistent symptoms and whether these changes
are mediated by perturbations in sulfidogenic microbes. Completion of these aims will provide fundamental
insights into diet-host-sulfidogenic microbial interactions in qCD+S and provide proof of principle for a future
R01 proposal to investigate dietary interventions to reset sulfur metabolism, improve intestinal permeability,
and reverse visceral hypersensitivity in qCD+S."
10865711,"Project Summary
The cerebellum plays a significant role in cognitive, emotional, and social behaviors, but we lack a basic circuit-
level understanding of how it contributes to these non-motor functions. Classical cerebellar learning models
postulate that cerebellar Purkinje neurons use error feedback to shape future actions, but recent recordings of
Purkinje activity in associative learning tasks revealed that Purkinje neurons encode sensory, cognitive, and
reward-related responses, not motor errors. These remarkable observations challenge the error-learning model
and suggest novel cerebellar functions during associative learning. However, this has never been causally
tested, and it is also unclear how these non-traditional responses are acquired during learning. This gap in
knowledge is largely due to limitations of past technologies, since linking Purkinje activities with behavior would
require simultaneous recording and perturbation of Purkinje activity, ideally with single-cell and sub-second
precision in awake behaving animals. Therefore, to define non-motor computations in the cerebellum and to
understand how they contribute to behavior, I will employ two-photon calcium imaging and holographic
stimulation of novel excitatory and inhibitory opsins to record, track, and modify Purkinje activities
throughout learning. My preliminary data suggests that complex spike responses in Purkinje neurons encode
reward-related signals, whereas simple spike responses in Purkinje neurons encode timing signals that precede
motor output. Based on this data, I hypothesize that reward-related signals present in complex spike
responses are necessary for the acquisition of timing responses in simple spikes in Purkinje neurons
and are therefore crucial for generating well-timed behaviors during associative learning. In the first Aim
(K99), I will characterize simple and complex responses within individual Purkinje neurons during associative
learning. Then, in Aim 2 (K99), I will determine how simple spikes in functionally defined groups of PNs influence
behavioral output. These initial studies will allow me to determine, in Aim 3 (R00), how reward-related signals in
complex spike responses shape timing signals in simple spike responses and therefore modulate behavior
during learning. Together, this proposal will define cerebellar computations using non-motor signals and could
profoundly enrich our understanding of cerebellar function. In the K99 phase, I will be mentored by Dr. Karl
Deisseroth, co-mentored by Dr. Liqun Luo, and will be advised by an exceptional advisory team composed of
Dr. Sean Quirin, Dr. Scott Linderman, and Dr. Reza Shadmehr. With their support and the tremendous scientific
environment at Stanford University, I will gain technical training in two-photon holographic stimulation,
extracellular electrophysiology, probabilistic modeling, and conceptual training in cerebellar neuroscience. This
training will prepare me well for my long-term goal of leading my own laboratory, where I will integrate advanced
experimental techniques with computational modeling to understand cerebellar computation."
10864248,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT
Humans have evolved an expanded and elaborated brain capable of higher-order cognition. However, the
sequence variants and resulting neural specializations that distinguish humans from other mammals are
commonly dysregulated in diseases such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This suggests that human-specific
non-coding variants are enriched for neural functions and may underlie genetic and phenotypic disease
vulnerabilities. Thus, there is a critical need to identify and characterize the non-coding variants that underlie
human neural specializations. However, identifying the causal variants that contribute to human neural
specializations is a daunting challenge that has been likened to searching for needles in a haystack. In this
proposal, Dr. Janet Song will improve prioritization of human-specific variants for further functional analysis using
two complementary approaches (Aims 1 and 2) and determine whether prioritized variants regulate nearby gene
expression in a high-throughput manner (Aim 3). Dr. Song will use the human-chimpanzee tetraploid system to
link regulatory regions that are differentially accessible between species to nearby differential genes in neural
progenitor cells and excitatory neurons, two cell types that are profoundly changed in humans and are commonly
dysregulated in neurological diseases (Aim 1 – K99 phase). As a complementary approach, Dr. Song will identify
constrained human-specific insertions and assess their contribution to ASD risk (Aim 2 – K99/R00 phase). Dr.
Song will then evaluate the effects of human-specific variants on nearby gene expression in neural cell types
using CRISPR inhibition screens (Aim 3 – K99/R00 phase).
This K99/R00 proposal will support Dr. Janet Song in her pursuit of the genetic basis of human neural
specializations and allow her to acquire new skills in comparative and functional genomics that will open up
innovative approaches to explore this problem. This proposal will be initiated during the mentored period in Dr.
Christopher Walsh’s lab at Boston Children’s Hospital / Harvard Medical School and continue in Dr. Song’s own
lab upon securing an independent position. In addition to providing immediate insights into the genetic basis of
human neural specializations, the proposed research will lay the foundation for Dr. Song’s independent research
program. It will provide a framework for future studies in additional cell types or paradigms, pinpoint high-priority
loci for single-locus studies, and identify a corpus of human-evolved elements that may contribute to genetic risk
for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases. Long-term, Dr. Song’s independent research program
will dissect how sequences that changed in humans relative to other mammals result in human-specific neural
phenotypes, and ultimately, contribute to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric diseases."

studies in the demography and economics of aging. Resources for this Core will provide funding
for projects with a particular focus on the core themes of our center: aging in diverse contexts,
health and social and economic productivity, and the development and application of cutting
edge measurements and methods into data collection and analysis. For early stage
investigators we will include a mentoring component to ensure that the outcomes of the pilot
data are leveraged for future R- or K-type funding applications. The core will provide
methodological and statistical support through a Measurement and Methods Resources Panel
staffed by senior faculty. This group will help with project planning and at subsequent research
stages to develop innovative approaches that make sense given the current state of the field.
We anticipate funding four pilot projects per year. We will solicit proposals in an annual call.
Proposals will be reviewed by a standing group whose members rotate and feedback will be
provided in the form of an NIH-type review. As seed grant recipients complete the work they
proposed we will work with them to develop and submit full proposals as part of a Grant
Proposal Development Group. This Core will be instrumental in fostering new work on aging by

10868666,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT – PROJECT 2
Exposure of people to single chemicals or mixtures at Superfund sites has unquestionably occurred. The
unanswered question addressed here is whether those exposures can be associated with measurable risks to
genome integrity or expression, which would provide biological plausibility to the argument that the chemicals in
the environment have affected human health and welfare. The compounds chosen for investigation were inspired
by engagement efforts with a local community containing a Superfund site and with Tribal groups in Maine.
Carcinogenic N-nitrosamines (e.g., N-nitrosodimethylamine or NDMA) as well as other toxicants are abundant
in both of our catchment areas. These agents have not been studied as mutagens or proteome disruptors at the
level of detail proposed here, and they certainly have not been subjected to the combined multi-omic scrutiny of
this Project taken together with Project 1 (DNA damage and gene-environment interactions). The technology of
Project 2 has five components: (a) We employ a genetically engineered panel of mice (Project 1) that responds
to environmental toxicants in a manner that reveals underlying mechanisms that confer susceptibility to a
toxicant. The pathway to toxicity involves disease initiation, concomitant complications such as tissue-destructive
inflammation, through end stage pathologies such as cancers. (b) We use a newly developed high-fidelity DNA
sequencing procedure that provides unprecedentedly high-resolution mutational spectra (HRMS); HRMS can be
used to identify chemical-specific mutational patterns resulting from environmental exposures. (c) We use a
unique proteomic platform that sensitively senses disruptions in thousands of nodes in signaling networks. (d)
We use a novel computational module via the Data Management and Analysis Core that quantitatively
compares HRMS and proteomic patterns from our models with the rapidly expanding human data sets of The
Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA), other tumor sequencing efforts, and the growing body of knowledge of
proteomic patterns. (e) Lastly, we introduce mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) lines isogenic with our mouse
models that can be used as high-throughput screening tools to help find genotoxic fractions in complex mixtures
(Projects 3 and 4). Our multi-omic approach centers on animal and cellular models, but we also look ahead to
application of these novel tools for molecular epidemiology and for disease prevention. Regarding the latter
possibility, the proteomic and mutagenic biomarkers we already see in our work can be immediately be used to
assess the efficacy of probiotic mitigation of disease, via our interactions with Project 1. Regarding contributions
to epidemiology, the distinctive mutational spectra we have already observed following NDMA exposure to
animals and cells could eventually become valuable early-onset biomarkers that portend later life diseases.
Taken together, this Project leverages basic studies on genomics, adductomics, gene expression, and systems
toxicology to provide practical tools that can help detect and mitigate human diseases caused by specific
environmental chemicals that both our community partners and regulators have defined as agents of concern."

Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in South Africa have one of the highest HIV-1 incidences globally
and are a key target population for oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV-1 acquisition. In addition,
AGYW seeking PrEP frequently experience high rates of curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Current
South African PrEP guidelines recommend syndromic management for STIs, meaning that only women reporting
symptoms will receive treatment. It is well-established that syndromic management is particularly problematic
for women as the vast majority of curable STIs are asymptomatic. Persistent, untreated infections can lead to
serious reproductive health outcomes, including pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy,
neonatal infections, and increased risk HIV-1 acquisition. The high STI incidence in AGYW, which is on the rise,
emphasizes the need for effective screening strategies to reduce rates of STIs and their associated impact on
sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Among women who are at risk for HIV-1 and interested in initiating
PrEP, point-of-care diagnostic STI testing and expedited partner therapy (EPT) are two strategies that could
have a substantial impact on STI incidence. Few studies have evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of EPT
in low and middle-income countries and, to date, no studies have assessed the implementation of point-of-care
STI testing and EPT in the context of PrEP scale-up. This proposal builds on nearly a decade of collaborative
HIV/STI prevention research to conduct a prospective cohort study of AGYW eligible for PrEP in South Africa in
which we will assess the acceptability of point-of-care STI testing plus EPT and its impact on the incidence of
common curable STIs over 12 months of follow-up (Aims 1 and 2). We will undertake qualitative interviews with
participants and their male partners to identify facilitators and barriers to EPT uptake (Aim 2) and conduct a
comparative cost analysis to estimate the cost per person tested using point-of-care STI testing with and without
EPT incremental to the cost of standard of care (Aim 3). Findings from the proposed research will provide
essential knowledge for national policy makers to advance approaches to STI screening and treatment that will
lead to reductions in STIs and improvements in AGYW sexual reproductive health. The data generated from this
proposal are essential to inform efforts to reduce the burden of STIs and HIV-1 in women achieve the 2030
Sustainable Development Goals, which includes substantial reductions in HIV and STIs in key at-risk populations."

 During tumor evolution, cancer cells can acquire phenotypic heterogeneity, enabling them to grow more
aggressively, invade neighboring tissues, evade the immune system and therapeutic challenges, and
metastasize to distant sites. The ability of cancer cells to change their phenotypes can be broadly defined as
cancer cell plasticity, which can be influenced by both tumor intrinsic and extrinsic factors. However, the
underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate cancer cell state transitions throughout tumor evolution remain
poorly understood. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms will uncover key gene networks and
potentially inform novel therapeutic approaches.
 Studying cancer cell state transitions in vivo has been challenging due to the lack of tools for tracking cell
lineage relationships at high resolution. To overcome this, I have recently contributed to the development of an
evolving lineage tracer that leverages CRISPR/Cas9 technology to simultaneously report each cancer cell’s
lineage history and transcriptional state in vivo. By applying this tool to the well-characterized Kras;Trp53 (KP)
autochthonous mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma, I was able to reconstruct the entire tumor evolution history
and measure cancer plasticity by quantifying cell state changes in phylogenetically-related cancer cells. Built on
this innovative system, this proposal aims to investigate the mechanisms underlying lung cancer cell plasticity,
both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous. Leveraging my expertise in cancer biology and the evolving
lineage tracing model, I will quantitatively track cancer cell state transitions within the native microenvironment.
Specifically, I will delineate cell-autonomous regulators of cancer cell plasticity by CRISPR knockout of putative
regulators of plasticity, identify plasticity-associated tumor microenvironmental factors and dissect non-cell-
autonomous regulation of plasticity using spatial transcriptomics, and explore the role of plasticity in resistance
development to anti-cancer therapies. Addressing these fundamental questions will provide new insights into the
biology of cancer cell state regulation. Moreover, the experimental and computational framework from this
proposal can be applicable for studying cancer plasticity in other genetic perturbations and therapeutic contexts,
serving as a general template for understanding the molecular basis of cancer cell plasticity and tumor evolution.
 My diverse expertise in cancer biology, mouse modeling, technology and single cell genomics positions me
to execute the proposed projects and help me acquire important preliminary data to apply for future research
grants. As part of this grant, I will assemble an advisory team at my institution to support my transition and career
development training activities outlined in this proposal. I will also take advantage of the varied resources at my
postdoctoral institutions and the institution where I secure an independent position to develop skills related to
mentorship, communication, and research ethics. Overall, I believe my focused research plan, detailed training
goals, and a strong advisory team will facilitate a successful transition to independence."
10865368,"Project Summary/Abstract
This is a career development award application for a dermatologist and physician-scientist studying the role of
retroelements in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a highly morbid autoimmune disease with major
manifestations that include disfiguring skin rashes as well as joint and kidney pathology. In the United States, it
is estimated that over 200,000 patients have SLE. The pathogenesis of SLE remains incompletely understood.
Of the implicated pathways, elevated antiviral type I interferon signaling as well as autoreactive T cells have
been identified as possible mediators of disease, though the etiology of these antiviral signals as well as the
antigenic targets of T cells are not well established. Prior work from our laboratory discovered antibodies
targeting retroelements in patients with SLE which correlated with interferon gene expression signatures. We
hypothesize that deregulated expression of retroelements induces an inflammatory antiviral expression program
and likewise generates a reservoir of autoantigens that trigger adaptive immune responses in SLE patients,
initiating and propagating autoimmunity. This proposal will (1) delineate the gene and retroelement expression
patterns as well as inflammatory cytokine levels in the peripheral blood and skin of SLE patients and (2) identify
and phenotype retroelement-specific autoreactive CD4+ T cells. In addition, we will (3) mechanistically evaluate
immune responses targeting retroelements in the skin using genetic mouse models. Through the
characterization of these autoreactive T cell populations and correlation with gene, retroelement, and
inflammatory protein levels, these studies will evaluate previously undescribed pathway to autoimmunity with
future therapeutic potential.
This proposal describes a rigorous five-year career development training program supporting my transition to an
independent investigator. After completing my MD and PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, I continued
my clinical and research training at Yale in the Investigative Dermatology Program which combines clinical
dermatology residency training with protected research time. I have now embarked on an intensive immunology
training program under the mentorship of Dr. Akiko Iwasaki, a pioneer and world leader in deciphering the
complex interplay among viruses, innate immune recognition, and adaptive immunity. In addition to the
intellectual development and practical laboratory-based training that I will continue to receive in Dr. Iwasaki’s lab,
I have developed a training program built on didactic coursework in immunology and computational biology. This
plan is supported by the expertise of dedicated and experienced mentors with extensive domain knowledge in
relevant disciplines. Yale School of Medicine, along with the Departments of Dermatology and Immunobiology,
will provide the resources, support, and infrastructure to assist me in achieving the aims described in this
proposal and my long-term goal of developing into an independent physician-scientist studying autoimmune skin
disease."

Background and Objectives: Synapses and circuits possess a robust capacity for keeping their outputs stable.
Using the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model synapse, many labs have recently
identified dozens of signaling molecules and processes that stabilize synapse function through a non-Hebbian
form of homeostatic neuroplasticity called presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). These findings offer a
rich reservoir for discovery science, but at this point we have little understanding of how dozens of discrete
homeostatic signaling molecules integrate into coherent system that stabilizes synapse function over time. The
objective of this proposal is to solve that problem combining genetics, pharmacology, imaging, biochemistry, and
electrophysiology. Ultimately, improved knowledge about homeostatic forms of synaptic plasticity could lead to
a better understanding of neurological disorders that occur when synapse stability is lost.
Specific Aims and Research Design: This project has two specific aims. We know that PHP at the Drosophila
NMJ can be acutely induced in minutes and then chronically maintained for days. The first aim is to define a
sequence of events that occurs during the opening minutes of PHP induction. For this aim, we take advantage
of a serendipitous finding from a genetic screen: impaired chaperone function in the muscle slows PHP signaling.
Using this genetic tool we will delineate an order of processes that occurs as the muscle signals to the nerve
and potentiates release. For the second aim, we developed a new pharmacological approach to monitor the
transition periods between induction, acute expression, and long-term maintenance of PHP. We will apply this
new method to characterize about 25 known genetic conditions that impact the sustained maintenance of PHP.
We expect to define distinct PHP signaling modalities. Between our aims, the expected outcome is a model of
how a synapse can sustain homeostatic function by integrating multiple signals across phases of time.
Health Relatedness: Neurological disorders like epilepsy, ataxia, and migraine are associated with unstable
neuronal function. Understanding how synapses work to maintain stability on a molecular level could have pro-
found implications for disorders with underlying neuronal instabilities. Yet the signaling events that tightly control
levels of synaptic output are poorly understood. The tractable Drosophila NMJ employs homoestatic strategies
to stabilize synapse function – such as altering levels of presynaptic calcium influx – that are shared by
mammalian central synapses. Taking advantage of the molecular and genetic tools offered by the NMJ promises
to shed light on universally conserved mechanisms of how synapses maintain stable function throughout life."

 My career goal is to better understand systemic diseases in rheumatology by examining the mechanisms of
ocular inflammation and determining which mechanisms are specific to the eye and which are shared with other
organs, particularly the joint. This five-year proposal for a Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career
Development Award will help me mature into a productive, independent academic investigator in the field of
ocular rheumatology. Advances in this area should complement the body of work in the field to allow for a more
comprehensive understanding of systemic autoimmune disorders.
 Axial spondyloarthritis is strongly associated with HLA-B27 and has frequent extra-articular manifestations
such as anterior uveitis, an inflammatory ocular disease that can lead to cataract, glaucoma, and permanent
vision loss. While discrimination between pathogenic and bystander immune cells in rheumatologic diseases has
been challenging, the intrinsic immune privilege of the eye increases the enrichment for pathogenic cell types.
Therefore, studying ocular immune cells and the corresponding populations in the peripheral blood provides a
novel opportunity to understand both organ-specific and systemic mechanisms of disease pathogenesis.
 Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) in three individuals, we have preliminarily identified two
subsets of CD8 T cells that collectively accounts for ~50% of all CD8 T cells within the eye during HLA-B27+
anterior uveitis. While both types of CD8 T cells share a transcriptional program, such as expression of the
surface receptor CD161, the antigen-specificity is distinct for each population. The first population is a
conventional polyclonal CD8 T cell population that recognizes viral antigens, among others, but is able to express
IL-17 and therefore have been termed Tc17 cells. In contrast, the second population is an unconventional T cell
population that predominantly uses a single T cell receptor gene segment that specifically recognizes metabolites
of riboflavin synthesis and are called mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. Given the difference in
antigen-specificity, we hypothesize that these two CD8 T cell types serve redundant roles in an antigen-
independent mechanism of inflammation.
 We propose to establish whether MAIT or Tc17 cells play a central role in HLA-B27+ anterior uveitis by using
scRNAseq and multidimensional flow cytometry to assess (1) whether one or both CD161+ CD8 T cell subtypes
are conserved in HLA-B27+ anterior uveitis, (2) what mechanisms of activate these cells within the eye, and (3)
whether one or both of these subsets are dysregulated in the circulation prior to entry into the eye. Through
successful completion of this research, undergoing the didactic training, and receiving guidance from a
multidisciplinary group of experts, I plan to launch my career as an independent translational researcher
investigating the ocular manifestations of rheumatologic diseases."

The fight against the SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is ramping up with vaccinations and
therapeutics. Yet there is a growing urgency to study and address the other side of the pandemic, a shapeshifting
byproduct known as the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), among other names. Even if several millions
are successfully vaccinated against the virus, many more are still likely to be infected and for hundreds of
thousands (if not millions) of those, recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19 infection will be grueling with a
debilitating second act. A collection of persistent physical (e.g., fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, cough),
psychological (e.g., anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder), and neurocognitive symptoms (e.g.,
impaired memory and concentration) can appear and last for weeks or months in patients after acute COVID-
19, impeding their ability to function normally and costing the U.S. economy billions of dollars annually in medical
bills and lost incomes. However, little is known about the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19, the extent and
causes of its lingering health issues, which patients might develop them, and how to address them. We seek to
leverage electronic health records (EHRs) data from 7 hospital systems across the U.S. to develop and validate
a novel framework for studying evolving temporal phenotypes of the post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. For a
period of four years after each patient’s SARS-CoV-2 infection, we will track their clinical data, including clinical
notes and laboratory tests recorded in EHR notes to Curate validated cohorts with gold-standard, rule-based,
and silver-standard (computationally interpolated) labels for PASC phenotypes (Aim 1). We will utilize these
cohorts to develop and validate consistent and interpretable cohort identification and risk models of PASC
phenotypes, accounting for temporal ordering and progression of evolving phenotypes over time (Aim 2). Finally,
we will evaluate the generalizability the PASC models to develop a framework for modeling evolving temporal
phenotypes with EHR data through an objective methodology for evaluating bias in medical AI. (Aim 3). This
study will yield new knowledge regarding the phenotypic characteristics of the post-acute effects following known
SARS-CoV-2 infection and the underlying drivers that influence their presentation and onset. The novel
framework for studying evolving PASC phenotypes will capture and characterize new PASC problems that may
present 2-3 years post-acute infection and update risk models. Given uncertainties around the efficacy of current
vaccines against future mutations, the proposed learning systems will improve our capacity for adaptive
pandemic decision-making. Finally, the framework and underlying methodology developed in this study will lend
insights towards understanding persistent sequelae of other known/suspected viral infections and modeling other
evolving temporal phenotypes."

 Every year 255,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed amounting to well over 4,000 deaths
occurring per year in U. S alone. With the use of anthracycline-based polychemotherapy (including doxorubicin),
the reduction in annual deaths from breast cancer is approximately 38% for women under 40. Systemic
Chemotherapy (CTx) plays an important role in the management of these patients; however, most CTx agents
have severe adverse consequences on the cardiovascular system. Injury to the heart as a result of exposure to
CTx is well established; however, little data exist on the contribution of CTx to endothelial cell dysfunction and
the direct effect on mitochondria in the microcirculation. Doxorubicin (DOX), a widely used CTx drug, is known
to cause excessive DNA damage, including in the mitochondria where DNA damage increases reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production. Mitochondrial dysfunction, induced by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage,
uncouples coronary blood flow from cardiac workload. Excessive mtDNA damage leads to an elevation in cell
free (cf) mtDNA which is known to act as a secondary messenger, triggering an inflammatory response in the
vascular endothelium. cfmtDNA has been observed in disease models of endothelial dysfunction and correlated
with poor clinical outcomes but not investigated on a mechanistic level or in Cardio-Oncology. The restoration of
mitochondrial integrity in the coronary microvasculature has proven to be sufficient to restore normal heart
function, yet few reports show CTx effect on mitochondrial function, and none have investigated effects in the
microvasculature. To date, no studies exist which consider the contribution of mitochondrial function and mtDNA
damage on cell survival and physiological endothelial function after CTx in human coronary vessels. We
speculate the acute effect of CTx induced mtDNA damage is further amplified by elevation of circulating mtDNA
fragments, leading to diminished vascular reactivity. As CTx is known to be more effective at damaging
cancerous cells than host and endothelial cells, elevation of mtDNA fragments after effective anticancer therapy
is a reasonable expectation. This raises the possibility that CTx-induced endothelial dysfunction may play a
key role in development of myocardial pathologies. The focus of this proposal is to define the direct signaling
events that mechanistically link CTx to microvascular endothelial damage."
10866705,"Project Summary. Intravenous ketamine, which displays rapid antidepressant properties, is posited to reverse symptoms
by rapidly enhancing neuroplasticity. Although community-based ketamine clinics have proliferated in the US and
worldwide in recent years, a significant barrier to clinical adoption is the lack of evidence-based strategies to enhance the
durability of ketamine’s effects, creating substantial barriers to access and longer-term maintenance of gains. In a previous
efficacy study among depressed outpatients, we posited that ketamine would rapidly increase plasticity within the
information processing domain, allowing for rigid, negative biases in cognition (specifically, negative self-
representations) to be rapidly made malleable. We further expected these neurocognitive changes would provide a clinical
window of opportunity in which to introduce digital cognitive training techniques, which would consolidate adaptive
forms of cognitive processing (specifically, positive implicit representations of self) while neuroplasticity remains high.
By instantiating adaptive forms of processing after first 'priming' the brain with ketamine, we developed a novel
synergistic treatment approach (ketamine + Automated Self Association Training; ‘ASAT’) that extended the acute effects
of a single ketamine infusion far beyond its typical 7-14 day window, showing statistically significant effects on
depression [relative to saline paired with ASAT (no-drug control arm)] that persisted for 3 months after a single infusion
of ketamine—an approximately 9-fold increase in durability of effect relative to ketamine paired with sham digital
training (no-training control arm). In the current multi-site ‘Hybrid Type 1’ effectiveness-implementation randomized
controlled trial, 600 ketamine-seeking depressed outpatients receiving intravenous ketamine ‘induction’ (6-12 serial
infusions over 3-8 weeks) at one of 8 well-established real-world clinics throughout the US will be randomized to receive
either adjunctive active ASAT or sham ASAT. After an initial in-clinic ‘onboarding’ session, patients will self-administer
ASAT (or sham) at home, in three ‘bursts’ (each ‘burst’ = eight ~15min sessions delivered 2x/day over 4 consecutive
days), sequenced to begin just after (1) the first ketamine induction dose (Aim 1), (2) the last ketamine induction dose
(Aim 2), and (3) 3 months after the first dose (Exploratory Aim). Patients will complete depression severity measures
and performance-based measures of cognitive target engagement (implicit self-associations), acutely and across a 12-
month naturalistic follow-up, enabling comprehensive assessment of ASAT’s potential enhancing (Aim 1) and extending
(Aim 2) effects on depression relief. Validated data-driven ‘combined moderator’ methods will be used to identify
baseline patient profiles (Aim 3) that predict favorable response to ketamine (all patients) and specific response to
ketamine+ASAT (relative to ketamine+sham). Comprehensive, mixed methods feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness,
and cost data will be captured from both patients and providers (Aim 4). This study will provide novel effectiveness,
feasibility/acceptability, and long-term (12-month), systematic follow-up data among heterogeneous real-world patients
seeking ketamine treatment under real-world conditions in the community, and will synergistically combine ketamine
with a portable digital intervention in an effort to exploit and extend ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects."

Significant effort over the past decades has been devoted to uncovering neuronal mechanisms that regulate
substance use, including the use of cocaine. Notable progress in this effort includes evidence that dysregulation
of neuronal signaling after cocaine exposure may rely on plasticity within non-neuronal cells. A particularly large
share of attention has been paid to astrocytes, fueled by early demonstrations that a variety of brain insults from
trauma to neurodevelopmental disorders profoundly alter astrocyte morphology. Cocaine exposure impacts
astrocyte cytoskeleton, changing the size and shape of astrocyte cell bodies, processes, and proximity to
synapses. Additionally, cocaine triggers changes in the astrocyte ability to initiate and maintain propagation of
Ca2+ waves that have established themselves as a prototypical signature of “active” astrocyte signaling. Much
less is understood about cocaine effects on astrocyte K+ responses, a key feature of neuroglial interface whereby
astrocytes maintain ion homeostasis following neuronal extrusion of K+ ions during action potentials.
We provide the first, to our knowledge, evidence that astrocyte voltage-gated K+ channels are affected by and
contribute to cocaine use in the rat self-administration model. We present preliminary data that the voltage-gated,
KCNQ, channels in astrocytes of the nucleus accumbens shell (NAc) are rapidly and dose-dependently up-
regulated by extracellular dopamine, that KCNQ channel activity influences astrocyte Ca2+ responses after
cocaine self-administration, and that attenuation of cocaine-seeking by KCNQ inhibition requires functional NAc
astrocytes. We propose to use standard pharmacological techniques along with newer molecular approaches,
electrophysiology, and Ca2+ imaging to further describe astrocyte KCNQ channel contribution to cocaine use.
Our hypothesis is that KCNQ channels regulate astrocyte Ca2+ signaling to impact acquired cocaine-seeking
behavior as well as its reinstatement after extinction. Within this hypothesis, we define contribution of neuronal
activity, relevance of astrocyte Ca2+ compartmentalization to transmembrane and endoplasmic reticulum
domains, and cocaine impact on expression of KCNQ subtypes. We predict that astrocyte KCNQ activity,
independent of neuronal KCNQ channels, influences generation of intracellular Ca2+ signals by membrane-
proximal sources and that inhibition of astrocyte KCNQ activity pharmacologically or by virus-mediated knock-
down attenuates cocaine seeking and cue-induced reinstatement.
Results of this experimentation lay the foundation for investigating contribution of astrocyte K+ channels to
neuroglial coupling. For example, changes in astrocyte K+ may influence Ca2+ dependent release of
neurotransmitter molecules, cytokine production, and secretion of extracellular vesicles or other signals to
influence neuronal output and cocaine-associated behavior. Such studies will promote understanding of dynamic
roles of astrocytes in the healthy brain and facilitate novel cell-type specific approaches to mitigate cocaine use."
10867078,"PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT
Heart replacement therapies (HRT) (i.e., heart transplants and left ventricular assist devices [LVADs]) can
improve quality of life and survival in patients dying of advanced HF. The patient selection pathway for
receiving HRT is heterogeneous between centers with no universal consensus, increasing inequities and
limiting access to potentially life-saving therapies. The medical evaluation for HRT is standardized, but the
psychosocial assessment is different at each center, carries significant weight for candidacy, and is a
frequent cause for patients’ ineligibility for HRT. During the psychosocial evaluation, inadequate duration of
caregiving post-HRT is the most common perceived contraindication to candidacy. Caregiving requirements
in the U.S. currently have clusters of centers requiring up to 1 month, 1-3 months, or 3+ months. No
evidence exists to identify an ideal duration of caregiving to optimize patient outcomes. Variability in
caregiver requirements creates healthcare inequities, particularly among vulnerable populations where
socioeconomics can affect the ability for caregivers to devote longer durations of time away from work and/or
child rearing. However, these variations are also understandable since there are tradeoffs associated with a
decrease in caregiving requirements, including increased clinical staff burden after HRT. Per consensus,
longer caregiving durations create institutionalized structures that exacerbate inequitable access to life-
saving therapies, and 3+ months of continuous caregiving is considered “excessive” because centers with
lower requirements still report optimal clinical outcomes. Given a lack of true empirical basis for caregiving
standards and the willingness of some centers to create flexible, inclusive, creative solutions for patients
whose social resources are limited, our ultimate goal is to conduct an R01 type 1 hybrid effectiveness-
implementation trial that will: (1) test non-inferiority of shorter duration caregiving (1-month) at centers that
currently require 3+ months of caregiving and (2) create an evidence base to define associations between
caregiving and outcomes. However, changing center-specific caregiver rules will require significant planning,
resources, and adaptations prior to implementation. This grant proposal uses the PRISM implementation
science framework to conduct critical pre-implementation work. We will assess best practices and
organizational processes needed to decrease caregiving requirements using the positive deviance approach
(Aim 1), and will use implementation mapping to identify and adapt interventions that will allow centers to
shorten caregiving requirements while simultaneously limiting clinical staff burden and maintaining optimal
clinical outcomes (Aim 2). The goals of this research are consistent with the NHLBI’s strategic goals: (1) to
investigate factors that account for differences in health among populations and (2) to optimize clinical and
implementation research to improve health and reduce disease and inequities in care. The pre-
implementation work proposed is essential for center-level changes that will be adaptable, acceptable,
feasible, and sustainable as preliminary data for an R01 application."
